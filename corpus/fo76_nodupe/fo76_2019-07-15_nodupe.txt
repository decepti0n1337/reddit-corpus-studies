The missile silo state holotape? It is available for purchase in the enclave command bunker under the whitespring.
---
---
---
pass everything to a friend before cutting !!!! ü§£ü§£
---
Theirs no way to track the weapons. Thats why the bans dont matter bc they use mule accounts to dupe. Youre fine.
---
Or you could, you know, not cheat.
---
Nope in game now playing
---
Makes sense to me! /s
---
Such an unfair drop rate!
---
The game is made to make people grind. If you got everything you wanted at once you wouldn't play for much longer and they wouldn't make consistent money off of purchases. Don't wanna grind? Play something else.
---
Well that's not very nice.
---
Just play Nuclear Winter. You gradually earn rewards for gaining overseer's xp.
---
the crater/raider/photo dailies should be resetting right now.
---
No, sorry, I should've explained better, I'm talking ab the overseers log, my b
---
Its like Germany after WW1 but in reverse, now the caps arent worthless but the bread is lol
---
Wow, never anticipated a response from Bethesda. Thanks for the follow up.
---
Unfortunately some things require cheating.
---

---
There are a lot of legacy items that don't exist anymore.
---
And the only way to get them is through duping.
---
So, yeah...
---
The more you know.
---
Got it
---
Wait action boy is also broken shiet so ive had it on for no reason at all i guess i better remove it for now
---
why would u not want people to enjoy a game you enjoy? Like does it bother you so much in your gameplay that other players have things and you dont? Or is it just a no bs ima mans man attitude? Im just curious to why so many people are upset with dupers. Im not one also was not banned but i could care less bout what other players do to enjoy their game. Do the dupers stop you from enjoying the game or smthin?  cause like if they do then I get it.
---
Dont listen to this guy hes posting about geting banned for just trading and happened to have dupped gear but his post history is full of post of him sell 30+ B2525 fixers and other duped gear and even admits to duping in one
---
This has literally happened to me every day I play since the game launched.
---
It only works when you're the leader of you're the only one in a group. For example if two people are on a group and the leader crashes but the server delay means the other person isn't made team leader yet then they won't get the benefit. Team leader can be solo in a team for the benefit
---
Ugh.. The grind is giving me major burnout already at the point where weekly's are now more important requiring 2k+ to rank up, I'm ready to buy-out the pass and finally move onto a different game how about everyone else?
---
Can i ask what lvl u r?
---
I want to smelt "Republic of Dave" bullion, official seal and all.
---
Ah, haven‚Äôt checked but I know their numbers are gonna be reallllly down.
---
I got mine from site alpha. It wasn‚Äôt there first time but second time on another server it was.
---
It can supposedly spawn at amy missile silo after a nuke has been launched at a place that is NOT a fissure site. Mind you, for me it's always been at Site Alpha no matter where the nuke launched from.
---
I mean the economy was broke before but in a different way sooo i wouldn say that its worse now its as bad as it was before but kinda reverse
---
I thought the instance of each item had an entity ID for each instance, not just the archetype. Been a while since I was trying to learn how scripting worked in-game on the older engines.
---
Was there a mass banning today or something?
---
Shhh don‚Äôt let Bethesda know
---
I kno. But I don‚Äôt cheat üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
One of the best screenshots of this game I‚Äôve ever seen. Really captures the post-apocalyptic industrial feel. Upvoted!
---
Long Shot doesn't work in vats, but if you're using a sniper rifle, Vats can't reach your max range, and Long shot makes your max range more effective.
---
Confirmed.  Aa and Troublshooters.
---
troublshooters Large lvl 50 has 3rd claw, take 40 pct less dmg when power attacking, 50pct limb damage and 30 pct against robots. 4.16#
---
aa is Level 40, 50 pct limb damage, ignores 50 pct armor, and 90 pct reduced weight 0.32#. No third claw, but I can mod it for that.
---
It really was tbh, there isn‚Äôt a way in hell that this could be a all rise chad
---
Low 50s is what I‚Äôm guessing
---
Explain how it is destroyed. We went from barely anyone being able to get the items they want to an economy where a lot people will be able to get the gear they want because there is a ton of those top tier items waiting to be traded
---
Your just a butt hurt dupper that got banned
---
my favorite part is that bethesda basically set up a speed trap to ban all the people trying to do it after it was fixed lol
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre taking this rn, ban first ask later
---
Or maybe it's people with disposable income who didn't have kids?
---
oohhhhh, ok, yea no, mine was Fissure Site Prime, ahh, alright, cause ive been searching a lot of places but couldnt find anything, thank you
---
I imagine the difficulty here would be how it would or wouldn't translate over to Adventure. If they increase the budget for Private worlds, but a selling point of the 1st is the option to hop between them as you want, how do you address the bigger CAMP that'd be coming from the Private World? Just not allow the bigger CAMP in Adventure? Tank stability by bringing it over? Store separate CAMPs that get loaded in different depending on loading into Private or Adventure? Sounds like a whole can of worms to solve
---
na, pretty slow day
---
If you aren't being facetious, yes. yes there was.
---
I just hit 101 last night. Bought the game at release but put it down until wastelanders
---
Yeah. Idk how I feel about ban first ask questions later. I get it but leaves a weird feeling.
---
rs broski, real one
---
Yea lol.  In that case I‚Äôm fucked.
---
Are you around tonight?  PS4 Dementd40
---
Nothing like the wealthiest country having homeless people.
---
i would actulaly buy f1st if the workshops were persistent
---
No servers are unstable cuz you dupe the the hell out of shit and crash the servers
---
i see and how has duping affected your gameplay
---
Yeah, happened to me too first time and then I realized. Better luck next time :)
---
Pardon my ignorance but what is a legacy?
---
Can I go back and get the two key cards again??
---
Me either - but to think you have not gotten to where you are without duping is silly. Nice try
---
Really? I hate that personally... but different strokes I guess.
---
It really is, and I grinded HARD for it the first time and got none of the items.
---
Saying that bethesda bans indiscriminately cheaters and legit players caught in the crossfire. Maybe if it hits their pockets hard enough they'll reconsider.
---
&gt; Reddit has never been a place where you read unbiased opinions, ever.
---
This sounds pretty biased though.
---
What is the fixer not really aware of what it is
---
[removed]
---
You are spot on. This weekend was so amazing. Finally got to try out all those God weapons I could never get. Met soooo many people and made quick friendships. Even friends that left the game came back just for this great event. I loved every minute of it and would do it again
---
Its like whole other parallel world is existing in this game, which I'm not aware of, and I'm just doing dailies minding my own business, wondering what the hell is going on with this posts.
---
Up to two groups of four or all eight.ungrounded and nany configuration in between.
---
Yeah I went through several camps before I made one that I love so much that I won‚Äôt ever likely change it. So a lot of this stuff I just can‚Äôt use. I tried making a second character but it‚Äôs such a slog to level up again and reaquire a lot of those plans. 
---
Even then, we‚Äôre already at the point where 2 characters wouldn‚Äôt even be enough to utilize all the items we‚Äôve got. The persistent workshops would be a much better option for those who like to get creative with camps and make themes, or create stuff that fits in with the game world.
---
What do you win though?
---
Are we judging maturity by character level now? Going to have to start telling my girlfriend she‚Äôs being a real level 3.
---
A weapon that‚Äôs no longer available to get in the game. Such as explosive energy weapons. If you got one from before they were patched out you have one. But they no longer drop. So it‚Äôs became legacied
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs like why tho, and just like you said has a weird feeling
---
in site alpha were she bitches you launched a nuke, ironically i‚Äôve got this and haven‚Äôt launched a nuke yet
---
Well...when you ruin every items value in fallout 76 cause it‚Äôs been ‚Äúduped‚Äù yeah it kinda ruins the economy and makes everything cheap. You got the ban hammer huh?
---
You obviously haven't played skyrim lol. Good luck on getting unstuck on surfaces without console commands üòÇ
---
[deleted]
---
Probably from the upcoming event.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure all these people praising this ban are really just the butthurt devs...
---
You are right, I got banned and I didn‚Äôt even dupe anything.  I just grinded, every day, every night, all my dailies, getting gold and modules.  I just recently got screwed out of 1000xp from the legendary run, and now I‚Äôm banned.  
---
This game has always been broken, and now they are casting aside the people who still play it.  Hope the hundred people that keep playing are enough to pay the bills.
---
Probably a good thing as long as they only got legit dupers.
---
For a country that hates socialism we sure what these companies to give us free shit, welcome to capitalism, baby!
---
"a"
---
lol
---
He definitely has a full health build but manages to die every 5mins
---
Items that no longer drop but still exist. Like explosive energy weapons
---
Well, 'The Big Scary Ban Hammer' is going to be the name of my next melee weapon.
---
That, or my drag name....
---
I feel like part of its in Bethesda b/c people find a new dupe every 2 weeks
---
Sorry for enjoying the game and giving back to the community
---
It's alright, I was stuck as well in past lol... Personally, I did not expect the daily reset to be at 5PM lol.
---
I'd say providing stability to the planet pretty useful.
---
Some of my friends have been banned for trading for duped items. [XB]
---
I'll assume you cheated in a video game, got caught and you forgot to cancel your subscription so you're here whining about it.
---
If it's chemistry we're discussing, then we must consider how gold from vault 79 had not been exposed to large quantities of radiation and wasteland gold scrap has. Therefore they are different isotopes of the same element. And since the value of gold is based on its rarity the gold bullion is inherently more valuable than gold scrap of the same mass.
---
I'm a nerd.
---
Yeah same people complaining about ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù are actually wasting their time irl by buying 50$ of atoms to get a few camp items, scrap kits, cosmetics because they think they‚Äôre missing out on free stuff? I‚Äôm lvl 47 on the pass and I play about 4 hours a day. This is the third week of a 10 week season you don‚Äôt need to buy atoms or ranks at all.
---
You‚Äôre not going to get banned for having one of a specifically duped weapon. Otherwise anybody with a TSE handmade or explosive flamer would be getting banned too. 
---
Now, I‚Äôm not saying you actually did anything to get banned. Bethesda has banned people before in the past wrongfully. Maybe that happened to you. But if you push to get your ban reviewed and the outcome is still you being banned, then it would likely be because of something you did, not just by having that gun.
---
They‚Äôre still handing them out and it isn‚Äôt a ban hammer is a suspension hammer. From what I‚Äôm looking at and hearing that ALOT of players were banned. Most were innocent though.
---
I don't think people realize the costs associated with making games now.
---
It is happening in waves. I got my email at 2pm pst, my buddy just got one at 5pm
---
I‚Äôd say a good amount. I had one account that I actually did use to dupe, then I had an account that I played on, the dupe account was not banned, the main account was, I believe it‚Äôs because I had two of the same item on it. I suspect it has literally nothing to do with the act, and everything to do with what you are in possession of
---
Your welcome
---
Dont listen to that guy hes just pissed gots he got banned for dupping look at his post history is full of post of him selling 30+ B2525 fixers and other duped gear, then tried to play it off like he got banned for trading even though he openly admits to duping in one of his posts
---
Hehehe, sweeeet
---
A guy on Xbox has about 200,000,000 presents. I think your good.
---
Got mine a 4:20pm üòé
---
Honestly tho
---
Do you have a Bethesda account linked to your account? Some people claimed that you get random numbers if you haven't created and linked a Bethesda account with a user-made nickname to the Steam account
---
I did not no, but they arnt duping shit items that youd be using? How does them duping b2525 fixers affect your economy in the game? Or the be90 gatling plasmas? The "economy" you are talking about doesnt exist and if you were part of what little "economy" that exists in fallout, you would know that there are so many duplicated items in circulation. So to clarify once again, I am asking YOU, how does the duping affect YOUR gameplay as a lvl 101?
---
You have to imagine if someone random goes to a vendor and sees a god tier for good price and had no idea what it was, bought it and banned for having it wouldn't work out. Likewise picking up a random bag shouldn't get you banned. They'd not be able to track duped item ownership intent.
---
My social account still can't be seen on my friends list
---
So no one can join me and I can join ther private server
---
They just need to flat out ban IP addresses or something.  Idk
---
I haven‚Äôt had a pet in months now, but iirc you can‚Äôt kill someone‚Äôs pet unless you‚Äôre engaged in PvP with the camp owner, at their camp. What likely happened to Fluffy is the same thing that‚Äôs happened to my deathclaw George. And George Jr. and George III. And George IV. And George V...the game just killed them. I saw two of mine just drop through the map before. Another one died because it spawned before my camp did, and when a foundation spawned it was inside him, which caused him to die.
---
I wouldnt say most off them
---
You realize how that sounds, right?
---
Bethesda, just disable the quick menu while your in a vendor or stash or stuff like that
---
I'm not complaining that survival mechanics exist, I'm complaining that the survival mechanics are tedious and poorly implemented. Interacting with a menu every 20 minutes is not engaging.
---
Yeah, I mean for a player like me I‚Äôve subbed to fo1st since it came out and spent a shameful amount of money on atom shop purchases I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I‚Äôm somewhere close to $700 total idk lol ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è that being said I would probably continue to do the same as long as the game was supported and received content updates
---
No just general innocent. I was one of those people. Obviously the suspension wave was made by a bot.
---
My wife and I have made top 5 a couple of times. Think we got around 650 for second place.
---
Supposedly patch 21
---
Go away, duper!
---
Well yeah but there was a decent amount that were innocent.
---
Right, I understand he basically benefited from the dupe, but he didn‚Äôt enable it.
---
What do you mean?
---
Well thats just blatantly false...
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a month but when I did someone dropped like 250 holiday boxes and I had no idea at the time they were duped. So I might be banned for not knowing about the glitch which is there fault.
---
set yourself free dude haha. you did a great service.
---
We‚Äôre they aware that they were duped?
---
Yeah, this is a problem. If you keep your camp device outside, away from foundations, and also do *not* log out at your camp (so you won't load in while the pet is as well) you'll have a lot more success keeping a big pet alive.
---
Sometimes it disappears when I put on the outwear. Probably a happy glitch, though
---
they're banning people attempting to do the glitch even though it is not patched
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not as worried about that. Technically, a bigger budget for private worlds sounds like a nightmare. But I think the majority of concern for a bigger budget is that people have so much stuff at this point that they can‚Äôt use it all. And since they paid for it, they feel they have to choose between getting their money‚Äôs worth out of what they paid for, and the creative vision they had for their camp. Having 20 something camps to build up would remove this dilemma.
---
Thoughts on the Dragon, or Gauss Rifle versus Lever?
---
I have to agree. If you know about duping then you also know that banning can occur. It‚Äôs just not worth it.
---
Yeah but are you really banned or is your account under investigation?
---
you‚Äôll be fine i pick up dropped stuff all the time and then scrap it or re drop stuff, in on pc not banned
---
Dude i stg all the people saying fuck all suspendees are low lvl and dont trade or they are under some false impression that the dupes affect their individual play in some random bs way
---
No idea why this is getting downvoted?? Sub full of cheater cucks I guess?
---
How many? ;D
---
I have the unpopular opinion that the blame is on Bethesda coding team and not the players who found out the glitch. Just saying.
---
I don‚Äôt think players are able to kill your pet anymore unless you‚Äôre in PvP.  They can, however, kite mobs to your camp to get the job done. 
---
My condolences.
---
I believe so because it was legacies.
---
Lol sounds fishy
---
With you on that one
---
I met many generous people and am thankful I got to try all the things I did. unobtanium is nice sometimes.
---
Yea or what a ‚Äúservice game‚Äù  means. 
---
People need to realize that This game was designed from the bottom up like a retail store. 
---
Just how target / Walmart invest millions of dollars for customer satisfaction. So does Bethesda, epic game , supercell etc etc 
---
Bethesda care about their customers so that why they fix thing. Not as fast as we would  like them too but nonetheless they still fix it. 
---
The moment people like OP realize this he won‚Äôt be disappointed ever again
---
Gauss. The shoots five times before the reload and doesn‚Äôt take forever to fire again. Still does high damage.
---
Don‚Äôt have anything to contribute, just wanted to say happy cake day! I hope you have a great day, especially with all of these new deals.
---
Under investigation. Wait people just got straight up banned? I thought it was a suspension wave. If it was also a suspension wave I guess I‚Äôm lucky because I didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong. I‚Äôve been turned to god mode accidentally a few times while trying to pvp.
---
Hmmm maybe instead a nuka-cola factory where you decide the flavor you want, much like the food and ammo factories. 
---
Will still give 1 cap per bottle (lol) but most importantly could also be used by people as heal or buff aids. 
---
Only problems with bottlecap press is that many people already are at the 30k cap (a caps cap... get it?... ok nevermind)
---
Agreed.  Cheating would take the fun right out of this game for me.
---
 I am glad I'm not one of those people.
---
In order to play the game you have to agree to the terms of service or tos or whatever you wanna call it and you broke that contract. It's not their responsibility to cancel your service it's your. And I dont care it's just a game theres right and wrong you did wrong and you got what you deserve 
---
PSA: Always read the fine print kids
---
Wouldn‚Äôt hold scrap not be ‚Äòpure‚Äô enough to smelt into bullion?
---
A level 30 version of it is unlocked via a quest line.  To find the plans you need to do the Encryptid event (but it‚Äôs an uncommon/rare drop) 
---
It has an inherent 10% damage increase over regular combat rifles.  Plus secondarily you sneak faster.  
---
Once you learn the plans, it has a chance to drop from the Purveyor - so it‚Äôs all about rng and is sought after as such
---
I use the lever for my sniper, and Fixer for cleaning up.
---
Toilet paper and raw fertilizer are what I put on their pillows üí©
---
I went Pack Rat level 3 pretty fast and use the meds one. I think I need to focus a food, I was kinda working towards the canned dog food one, got Can do! to 2 already, but the games rng like to give me imitation seafood instead. Weapons tho, I really can't decide. Only using whatever the most ammo of. I didn't really play 4 much cause my old pc was crap, so I'm not used to any of the guns. 
---
Back when I was watching people stream fo76 it seemed fire axe build were king.. but that seemed kinda lame. Course, I've been using a melee myself cause ammo is tight for now and my guns are crap.
---
Lol why are people upset a hotfix doesn't fix everything
---
Looks like a shit ton of cheating asshats on here, yammering about "Hurr hurr how does it affect YOU?"
---
Well, it affects me because you are cheating. Get fucked.
---
Yeah that was my endgame lol. Now that I tried them all I am completely ok with a ban. I feel like I am now free to play something else finally
---
Maybe once all the duper‚Äôs are out of the game The once rare outfits, plans, good armor pieces, etc will be ‚Äúrare‚Äù again. Nothing has rarity in the game anymore. People who look for a genuine fallout experience aren‚Äôt getting that with duper‚Äôs. 
---
Yes fallout 76 has a lot of bug and glitches - but like it says in the terms of you play stupid games you win stupid prizes
---
Man those crybabies are mad at you lol
---
Seasoned dupers know how to play the system. Those are the same ones trying to bring reason to the market (and get some amazing weapons into some casual players hands). I don't feel bad for those who were banned... Rules are rules. But I understand their mission.
---
It should be a visual bug.  Happens to me from time to time too.  It's just because the data for the atom shop hasn't updated fast enough.  Relog or wait and they should return.
---
Bethesda screwed up. They should of not have a bot suspend people.
---
Ah yes the comment for the people
---
This is bs everyone duped no one is the holy night everyone duped so I guess everyone should be banned
---
Ugh do I buy the garage or save the atoms in case I don‚Äôt make enough SCORE....
---
no everyone didnt dupe
---
They‚Äôre mad Bethesda actually punished them
---
Ah thx ive never rly played that gamemode before i guess its time lol
---
Bro exactly. Different viewpoints - but you agree not to cheat when you sign up for the game so I don‚Äôt get why everyone‚Äôs acting so surprised and salty üòÇüòÇ
---
&gt;I'm wondering why it took so long to be brought to their attention
---
Because it was being contained to discord and a handful of FB trading groups. Then last Friday Demon Asylum posted a video and it blew the fuck up.
---
Everyone did including the mods and couriers
---
Hey if you eat scorch best meat you don't have yo use stimpacks that much, scorch best gives u 400 ap
---
8 dailies and 5 weekly here. Hope they give us some compensation.
---
That‚Äôll do it
---
I didn‚Äôt.
---
You‚Äôre response is clear. You‚Äôve never traded for flux or that gun of yours?
---
You jump to personal insults is clear enough. You are where you are because of the people who duped.
---
This goes back to before I took a break where I sold flux for 350 caps each. (Farmed all myself).
---
People like you would send responses like that to me with my prices.  Then I‚Äôd send them a breakdown.
---
You haven‚Äôt played since day 1 without benefiting. Or you wouldn‚Äôt Respond like that
---
Why not both?
---
It's pretty fun if you don't take it too seriously.
---
Yeah like how does this really hurt anyone, oh boohoo, you can‚Äôt hear cuz of too many explosions, or you got your base leveled cuz you got in pvp at your camp, lmao, like literallyyyy bruh, none of the dupes are even powerful enough to kill the sbq before they can get their damage in, unless their that bad
---
I don't need or want legacy items
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs accurate. I had a response to a ticket (with resolution) about two weeks ago.
---
Yes ridiculously so. They have been bugged for a while.
---
I think you‚Äôll probably be fine unless it‚Äôs explosive
---
Idk, I heard a rumour that Reddit isn't a hivemind with identical opinions
---
I keep a couple stocked in my vendor for 200 caps. 
---
GT is the same as my Reddit name except a space in place of the underscore
---
Do you think it's worth buying the wastelanders deluxe edition?
---
Inveterate stealth sniper build here. Some of my best buds are PA players. I hold only one thing against you all, and it‚Äôs this: your heavy footstep jostles my scope. Small price to pay for all the love from my PA pals.
---
If you see any nuke zones in white springs there is usually a plethora of Cobalt flux
---
Nope not a single time have looked up duping videos
---
Not  entirely sure honestly as I‚Äôve never personally had this issue. I‚Äôm sure there are steps to take on beths website. Best of luck man !
---
Sometimes I think it has to do with where the stairs interact...a habit I‚Äôve gotten into it after I ‚Äúsummon‚Äù it, I hold down the trigger so it‚Äôs rotating constantly and when I hit green, I set it down. Speculation on my part though, it is Bethesda. No telling why the tent acts the way it does
---
Same dude
---
Possession is pretty much the only method I‚Äôve seen by which it it determined. I can agree with that if you have like ten of the same item, though they haven‚Äôt stated possession will get you banned, one copy of an item shouldn‚Äôt get you banned as they have no inclination of how it was obtained. Guilty until proven innocent is Todd policy.
---
Ugh just when I finally thought I hit the jackpot with my bloodied weapons
---
What if doesn't really matter till it happens. I've been here a while, and haven't seen it yet. All the claims I've seen so far have been either people who are full of shit or people who decided to play white knight and go steal stuff from dupers to destroy it and they got flagged for holding the stuff. Did those people deserve it? No, but then again we're still taking their word that they were only doing that and not also duping stuff themselves at another time.
---
Ummmm...but you Literally didn‚Äôt answer the question bub..... üòÇ
---
I love the game so i agree with you there. Just a love hate relationship all around.
---
Hell, I am new and would love to do mega damage, but I‚Äôm enjoying not being Bloodied build. Dupe? Heck no.
---
Sorry that seems to be choppy. Two groups of 8 or 8 ungrouped or any combo is your post? 
---
Can two groups do events and bosses together?
---
because people are slaves to the meta.. even when it serves no real purpose..
---
any halfway optimized build can run around like a fucking boss in this game..
---
are you going to be soloing Encryptids/SBQs in under 2 minutes without being min/maxed.. probably not.. but other than serious farmers.. how often does that really come up?
---
at the end of the day there are always going to be meta whores in any game.. 
---
all you can do is play your own way.. whatever way that is..
---
I can only speak for my own personal preferences.. I use high damage weapons and builds to avoid unnecessary grinding/crafting of ammo and other materials every day. I rather shoot the enemy once, than spend entire magazine on it.
---
I kindly ask that nobody gives me too much, even non-duped stuff. I like the thrill of earning something awesome!
---
I wish that Xbox players and pc players come to my camp too so they can buy notes what they don't have I feel sorry
---
There is an implied social contract inherent in multiplayer games. Each of us voluntarily agree to follow the rules. 
---
I don‚Äôt have sympathy or respect for those with poor integrity. 
---
I enjoy the game regardless of what others do.
---
Explain to me why someone that follows the rules and someone that breaks the rules should both have the same end result?
---
Lmfaooo skill... my bad I forgot auto aim weapons and standing in place takes a whole lot of that
---
What? So you think this game is about not trading? 
---
Lol then the trading system and player vendor should be removed too.
---
You have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about, clearly have more than you say.
---
Melee meats have stacked for a while, that was one of the methods my friend used. Mutant hound steak ftw.
---
I can help you if you‚Äôre on ps4. I know a glitch that you can skip straight into the last room
---
It‚Äôs fun. I like the risk. It‚Äôs a nice change from my full health stealth sniper build I used to use.
---
I constantly run with nerd rage active . Is honestly more about managing your rads than health once you get used to it .
---
I mean, about 1/3 of all the people I run into in public teams are bloodied. I'd say a pretty significant portion of the playerbase knows.
---
Well I did use the carryweight glitch back at the beginning but other than that I have not cheated. I'm level 445 and got there legitimately
---
A mixture of toxic goo fromp west tek and diluted rad x  and diluted rad away, i have nearly an absolute control over my health, no matter the time and situation
---
i bought the bundle not knowing that the sides were broken.  I requested a refund and waiting on a reply.
---
Because wasteland gold has been exposed to large amounts of radiation for 20 years while the sealed bulion has not. I mean you would be able to tell the difference.
---
It's not a question that deserves answering.
---
It is a widely known, irrefutable concrete FACT that you are not allowed to cheat in games. Show me a game that allows you to cheat - and I dont mean scamming in EVE, thats fooling idiots, not using exploits.
---
So you heard someone say this, haven't logged in, and just assume it to be true?
---
Before this there were people claiming a ban wave would wipe the playerbase, oh God, think of the poor playerbase.
---
It's BS. Game is just as active as before, sans a few cheaters.
---
Don't buy into their hype, they're just trying to stir up drama because they got caught.
---
They will fix it (or according to their statement already have without needing to update) and if someone has the money to pay for levels why not? Not everyone can sit around on furloughed from covid and level up... (Checks my current level) 53. They also said they will be adding more dailies to compensate lost dailies. Double score and double XP coming up. Idk what more the community wants from Bethesda besides handing them 100 levels for free and claim bankruptcy the next day or becoming a 503c non profit gaming business.
---
They say that they can‚Äôt restore lost SCORE points. So instead, ask for Atoms as compensation, to be able to purchase the lost ranks equivalent to the lost SCORE points.
---
For the record, I am not banned. I just logged in to make sure I didn't somehow aquire duped weapons.
---
So that is a relief.
---
My comments still stand. I want this game to be the next world of Warcraft for me. I do truly enjoy it. I just bought FO1st. 
---
But this has to be a labor of love, not a quick paycheck. You have made over $180 off of me mostly for the title of Fallout. Make. This. Game. Quality.
---
Look to your peer developers. Does it measure up?
---
I started playing last week, pretty much everyday and I  never saw nuke zone anywhere except near Forward Station Delta...
---
I mean I can still go into communities and post pics of my guns and get caps or do trades. For me nothing has changed, the duping has always been there and the economy is far from broken.
---
Friend invite sent!
---
You are going to get spanked any moment. :'D
---
But there‚Äôs more accounts with more duped items hidden away, the damage has been done and there isn‚Äôt a way to fix it, items have been traded, sold, dropped, and handed out, there will be no fix, the trading economy is dead, the game in about to fall out, lol the pun... but it‚Äôs ready to fall out the window, no one cares about your ‚Äúfallout experience‚Äù go play fo4 where you have control, this is an online service, things change and won‚Äôt be how you want it to be all the time, if you want a controlled environment hop in a private buddy
---
Can't, I can't get through to anyone as they just lock any ticket that even has the word score or daily mentioned at all!
---
Just make a new character as a dedicated Heavy. Double XP rolls around shortly, so that‚Äôs a prime opportunity.
---
Then transfer the gun with either private servers or through the help of a friend.
---
I've got both, depends on the target and the situation. I use an AAE fixer on larger/tankier enemies and I use my QFFR Handmade for the rest.
---
I run around as a bloodied stealth commando. stack sneak/stealth perks, agility, silenced weapons, unyielding armor or chinese stealth suit. There‚Äôs a perk that makes your running not affect stealth so you just can just sprint around, drop down and pop whatever you come across
---
As for health and rads, i carry a lot of radaway with chemist backpack mod and eat uncooked meat with carnivore perk if I can‚Äôt find a rad source to get back to where I want
---
Normal group rules apply. 2 groups of 4, 8 groups of 1 or all in-between
---
You just try to lie to the guy a say you got banned for trading. One thing I cant stand is a liar and you sir should call the fire department cuz your pants are on fire
---
I have been fooled, thank you for your time
---
Some thing I actually just learned a couple months ago is that sleeping on a sleeping bag/mattress on the ground or floor Gives you an hour bonus, sleep in a bed that is off the ground and you get a two hour bonus
---
Nah, on pc
---
I run about 90% rads and 10% health. Sometimes I‚Äôll take a diluted radaway when I‚Äôm doing something like the queen so I don‚Äôt die as easily, but that‚Äôs about it.
---
I use nerd rage so I rad until it procs and thats that.
---
Riverside manor, road above that, next to concrete pit. ( it‚Äôs where my camp is at. Flat land on a road)
---
I got banned this evening 
---
I assume my husband (who has been doing my challenges so I don‚Äôt fall behind on the season pass while I‚Äôm at work on 12 hour shift) has traded a dupe or participated in it 
---
I‚Äôm livid 
---
I hope it‚Äôs lifted quickly as this is the only game I actually play üòî
---
As a bloodied build you want to be under 20% health. You‚Äôll know when you hit that when nerd rage activates. 
---
Lead belly works great so you don‚Äôt get extra rads from food. 
---
I would either go with sneak commando bloodied or power armor heavy guns.
---
Again, that's not in-game, not immersive, not in the world.
---
In previous Fallout games there were barbers and facial reconstructive surgeons.      
---
In Fallout New Vegas there is literally an Auto-Doc that does facial reconstruction exactly as being suggested.
---
So it would be cool if that were in 76 too.
---
Although I play bloodied, I use radaway to remove the rads, so that I can tank the pylons (if needed) in PA, so that when I need to stim, it's almost immediate versus the animation when not using PA is a bit slow .
---
I have a sneak/commando build and am always 80-85% rads. It‚Äôs really about the build and type of armor your are wearing &amp; of course weapon. 
---
Have full unyielding armor so that my specials are very high - have a good bloodied commando weapon like handmade or fixer so that all regular mobs are one shot - and have lots of agility to enable sneaking. 
---
So, I literally don‚Äôt even get hit because am never detected and if I am, Escape Artist Perk was finally fixed so it helps losing enemies quick. So, it‚Äôs not that I can take damage, it‚Äôs the fact that I don‚Äôt even get hit or hit enough before I kill the enemy.
---
There was a dupe.  Now there are consequences.
---
Shoot it was out longer than 4 days. But whatever. It was the most fun I‚Äôve had playing this game.
---
Soooo lets start with the number of points youre needing for the whole pass its ((1000+3500)/2)√ó100
---
Thats 225000
---
10000exp for 100 points
---
22.500.000 exp for 225000 points
---
Sooo 22.500.000 exp for level 100? 
---
Yeah def not messed up 
---
So we go further
---
We know 200 exp for one super mutant so
---
22.500.000/200 = 112500
---
Around 30 mutants at west tek
---
112500/30 = 3750 west tek runs
---
One run + server hop 15 min
---
3750√ó15 = 56.250 min of west tek grind
---
But to put it in a better perspective
---
1hr = 60 min
---
56.250/60=  937,5hrs
---
1day=24hrs
---
937.5/24 = about 39 days
---
Sooo there you have it, you actually have to grind west tek for 39 days straight if you want to reach level 100 without doing dailys or weeklys 
---
Yeah seems to be balanced
---
Ya, I sighed audibly when I got in. Like, it's just a game but I didn't like feeling judged.
---
Will you still pick up stuff that people drop? Has this changed how you think about it?
---
I'm talking about the time when it started. Not talking about just this one dupewave. Without any duping the economy would be much better. Economy has been broken for a very long time.
---
I noticed that as well. Most of the time none of the containers have anything in them
---
The oldest anarchy server in Minecraft, 2B2T....lmao, and like every question deserves answering, you just don‚Äôt want to bud
---
They were quick to tweet community photos on twitter but could never give a reason or a response about a hotfix. I understand they don't work on the weekend but surely something this game breaking should've been enough incentive to hot fix it before it got out of hand.
---
Absolutely dead. No good vendors or let alone lobbies to launch nukes at the SBQ confidently. 
---
"10 weapons for sale" goes to CAMP.... finds 10 combat knives for sale.
---
Camp plants don‚Äôt mutate unfortunately
---
Ya done, and if you ain't done, that'll just about do yaaa
---
Tell that to my carry weight that drops when I'm solo because my strength gets lowered. And yes, I've always had Class Freak maxed.
---
Personally, after trying a lot of different builds, I emded up with bloodied on what is now my main character for one reason - I finally have a build where I don't have to miss out. The thing about bloodied is that a full set of unyielding armor will net you an extra +15 to every stat except endurance. Combined with the standard backpack and high capacity mod or chem weight reduction mod (I always carry too many stimpaks) amd marsupial, I have all the carry weight I could ever need. My strength is crazy despite only having spent 2 perk points on it. I do die, but the knowledge that I'm always on the edge of death makes the game that bit more entertaining to me and yes, one- or two-shotting most enemies is pretty fun. I didn't think I would enjoy it nearly as much as I am, but here we are. As for events, I do what I can to not be the person killing the legendary before everyone else has a chance to at least tag it. Unfortunately not everyone is as considerate.
---
Anyway, to make a long story short, bloodied is fun because you don't have to give up anything really, no huge compromises, you can just have it all... more or less :)
---
Ive wanted one for while i tried getting one at purveror but all i got is shitty heavy weapons etc :(
---
Not at all. Plenty of us legitimate players still around. We are just over shadowed by the bad faith players.
---
Same. I invested 745 hours into a game and worked so hard and just for me to suspended is a big middle finger.
---
Agreed.
---
Awesome effort, thanks! üòÑ
---
ok do you not know how to read? There is no economy to sell those rare outfits to if you delete all the dupers. I gurantee you if you trade items over max caps on the reddit, you have come into contact with a duped item at some point. I can also guarantee you that not every single person on that reddit is a duper. To fix an economy, there has to be an existing economy. You're low level and havent played this game for very long yet you are under the impression that everything is as you see it. Not every item is devalued like you claim, and this issue isnt even a concern to someone that doesnt own the items that are being duped. While I am doing the same thing, I want you to know that you are pointless antagonizing people for doing something that doesnt affect you in anyway. You just an offbrand bandwagoner
---
What does he want pics for? How did I miss that?
---
Some acc are already finished with the investigation so some people already got the awnser if theyre banned or not
---
See I can live with that but from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs all teslas and if it isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs legacy energy weapons which at least you kinda have to aim I guess...
---
Search angry turtle on YouTube. He will teach you everything you need to know. I‚Äôve learned a lot from his videos.
---
I don't think you know what a bias is.
---
Totally understand. After my fifth or sixth sloth I was pretty upset at losing him, swore off taming, then ending up finding one by accident.
---
Though a lot of unnecessary trial and error I've learned how to keep them alive, but I still have to make trips back to camp to ease my mind and make sure shoppers aren't ignoring adds spawning in.
---
If it's any consolation they actually take up zero budget, so feel free to fill up your camp and tame if you stumble on a pet.
---
My server seems full
---
Very true. Lol I am currently in that exact boat you describe as my CAMP is maxed, so considering the Red Rocket Garage prefab to replace my built garage if the budget gain is big enough to justify spending the Atoms so I have more room to decorate elsewhere, but I'm not 100% into the aesthetic of the garage. Choices XD
---
As for workshops, I definitely agree that might be an easier thing to tackle, but may still be some considerable hurdles. Currently, a brand new server is spun up when you join Private, so how do you rework the server spin up process so that it doesn't load the default state of workshops with enemies, junk, misc. scrappable items and such? If the back-end of how workshops are coded are similar enough to CAMPs, may not be hard. But if they aren't? How do you rework them while also retaining the regular Adventure mode systems? If someone hops between Private and Adventure, how do you "hold" the Private workshops in limbo until the next time they go to Private? Do we just switch to a persistent server for Private? But then what about the issues servers have the longer they are active? 
---
I'm certainly no game designer, and I claim no extensive knowledge of how the game works behind-the-scenes, so these questions may not even be issues at all, but these are just things that make sense to me as things that would possibly pop up as problems.
---
I wanna like this.... but the number of the beast
---
Pets can suicide. They'll teleport up and then drop and get gibbed almost immediately. It's fucking bonkers that they introduced human companions that are essential but still can't fix the pets. Happens with brahmin too.
---
so what are you going to get banned for?
---
a 2525? 50k presents?
---
Np i like maths so that was actually fun for me and its interesting to know
---
There was dupe, but only some of them got banned. There are people mocking and laughing at these "cheaters" but they themselves benefited from duped weapons/plans/consumables.  It seems like this last dupe was "tracked" a little.
---
Indeed. I was disappointed to see the duping. I was ready to move on. But now? I am not moving anywhere.
---
That‚Äôs odd.
---
I bought mine five days ago and still haven't received it. My support ticket hasn't been updated in almost three days. So... I'd be wary if I were you.
---
I bought an elder paint from a player and learned it but 2 weeks after I received the captain paint which I haven't learned
---
Unpopular opinion.  I dont even dupe but the dupers have my full support. Bestheda devs are cunts that want you to grind endlessly and be a slave to this shit game. They do nothing except line their pockets by taking advantage of fans who enjoy it. I was level 200 and had jack shit to show for it. Bad guns and armor. After this dupe wave I got the best shit ever and I'm having more fun than ever before. Bethesda and their developers can suck it. So I say dupes away!
---
Speaking as someone who loves cons: if the costume's good enough, people'll ask for pictures and act like they know who you are no matter what.
---
Built a costume out of scraps found around my hotel room once and it took a 10 year old to call me out on it, after like 2 hours of walking around.
---
It was a great!
---
They don't cost any budget. You can tame at max.
---
Hoard?  Why would someone hoard downvotes?
---
I wouldn't even know if I've grabbed stuff.  Is it plans that everyone duped?
---
No, don't worry. Ban only for people, who duped as insane
---
Does the direction of the camp device matter? And which side of the thing is the front?
---
Agreed
---
I duped but I just got the guns on another account if I do get banned can‚Äôt always get the gun but can get the levels needed to use them on an alt
---
Yeah, like the game has its foot out the window rn and it‚Äôs sad, but the problems are never ending and they‚Äôre gonna kill the game by banning the rest of the community
---
If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about ban waves, never trust the people who claim innocence. If they are truly innocent then Bethesda will undo their suspension/ban
---
And why do you assume anyone that has no sympathy for the dupers benefited from the dupers themselves?
---
 No I mean a hoard such as a swarm like a zombie hoard the salty people downvote everything for pathetic satisfaction
---
its a fucking mmo. you dont like grinding play another game
---
Damn. How long will it take for everyone to be un banned?
---
What's your GT?
---
It‚Äôs a nice pour. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/f9G035L.jpg
---
That is an amazing question you posed at the end, why should someone who is not duping be banned for duping?  They are not the people guilty of the actual charge yet they receive the same punishment? I guarantee you at point in your life you've broken a social contract whether it be a law or just by being creepy. By your logic should you go to jail for i dont know, say jwalking or looking at that girl across the street to long?
---
Gamers‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
video game developers aren't the police
---
I choked reading that, thank you.
---
Try another sub. This one doesn‚Äôt allow bartering.
---
Can confirm, this works.
---
Bethesda, keep banning any motherfuckers. They deserve it!
---
Ahhhh ok gotcha
---
You make a damn good point. I should have checked first. I couldn't at the moment and took the accounts of others as factual accounts because I have found so much in this community to be accurate.
---
Very much yes. I couldn't even kill a radroach. üòí
---
Hah, thanks. Don‚Äôt see myself as much of a hero though. A historian, maybe. Or a storyteller. 
---
Plus I like getting in arguments when I know that I‚Äôm gonna be right.
---
there's no way to tell if you've gotten a duped weapon
---
Did you just check a single server and call it good? Nukes a plenty where I'm sitting. Three full event groups too, had to start my own.
---
They do tho, the players getting banned are long time players most likely with fo1st, the new players are playing cuz it‚Äôs free....which means they most likey won‚Äôt Be investing into a monthly service for the game, so they‚Äôre losing that....
---
Yes sir, the market pages were so active. It was awesome
---
I guess I just don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs even remotely enjoyable about combat based on stacking buffs, invisibility, and auto aim weapons üòÇ
---
Not that I've seen. Front doesn't matter.
---
It‚Äôs very tasty.
---
If you did the event fairly recently and haven‚Äôt looted the 200-ish items needed to repopulate previously emptied containers, the deposits will still be marked as looted for you.
---
The door has no electric connection point and it is a separate item to the building itself. It‚Äôs odd it doesn‚Äôt appear in the door section as it probably should but it‚Äôs found in the wall section with the other garage doors.
---
During the times of the ‚ÄòRona all we ask is that you wash your hands and wear a mask.
---
So the ban can last months idk exactly i never got banned the investigation can last several days up to weeks (depending on the number of acc under investigation)
---
It's happened to every person I've talked to about this whom it also happened to, here in reddit, in Facebook and various discord groups, even a few friends ingame report the same, automated response from support which is auto locked, no communication with a person at all!
---
You can't even get a kill doing either lol.
---
Well....don‚Äôt smoke. Sorry.
---
Thanos approved
---
To maintain rads the easiest way is to build either a rad barrel or radiation emiter at your camp. That way ypu can always top off to keep at 20%
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think any of the duper‚Äôs would care....
---
Yeah, hi. Private server user here. Can confirm that the flux, guns, ammo, etc I have is all from either me farming or crafting.
---
You get one more try at that!
---
Duped?
---
about fuicking time
---
I‚Äôve got all 5 character slots filled and my camps are maxed. I really like what I‚Äôve done with them, so they‚Äôre done. Really the only thing left to buy is weapon skins (really need that radium Bethesda).
---
I love camp hopping and seeing the vamps with like 20 stacks of serums and standing gorilla plans
---
Oh really? Coulda swore a while ago that everyone was saying you needed *some* free space. Oh well. My camp right now is at a pre-existing place, so I can only build it up so much before it feels crowded.
---
Your wish is granted. However:
---
It uses a terminal interface and us buried multiple menus deep, which you can not use in power armor and you are limited to 10 bullion a day which reset on a 19.763468 hour timer unless you can currently  buy from Smiley in which case you lock out fast travel for your session unless you server hop which will autocomplete your daily quests.
---
Got it, thank you so much!
---
That train cart and the building in Harpers Ferry are your best bets, through the hole in the wall to your right as you spawn in. If its a different plan, don't pick it up! ;)
---
I did every single trophy in FO4, including all DLC. That was some effort.
---
It did work great this afternoon.  I still need to shuffle some points for a bloodied build.  Amazing how little AP it uses.
---
Private servers haven‚Äôt existed for more than a few months. Try again.
---
people are so salty today.. lol
---
but.. but all the banned fo1st players that bethesda couldnt legally charge for next months subscription anyway are going to cancel their fo1st.. ZomG!!11
---
For the love of god i really hope your right
---
But that sucks for the people like me who should of never been suspended in the first place. I was trying to grind the battle pass just to be put in timeout and be left behind.
---
&gt; What? So you think this game is about not trading?
---
No, it is about playing the game. But you do you and keep on claiming everyone has either cheated or benefited from it.
---
We get it, you're stupid as fuck. Move along.
---
Who in fallout has the equipment to do so?
---
Yeah, the dupe fairy stopped by my camp and gave me some great legacies this weekend. God bless the dupe fairy.
---
I think just about every " i traded for a duped item" is lying. How did you know it was duped? If you knew, your technically duping too.
---
Some people did it once and got yeeted.
---
.... it tis, and I‚Äôll be watching from my Minecraft mansion enjoying 1.16 üòÇ
---
You assume I have been playing since before they existed &lt;3
---
Yeah you wasted your one try.
---
I am so very sorry your brain is that of a baked potato with way too much butter and salt.
---
I‚Äôm still finishing raider rep.  That‚Äôs the worst grind in this game as it is so slow.
---
none.. just have a max lvl Standard backpack
---
Seems to me to be too much effort to cheat rather than just play the game.
---
Does radiation even affect gold? I know about the value of pre-atomic steel on WWII warships, but haven't heard the same thing about gold.
---
eventually the new players will replace the old timers thats facts bud
---
I had a weird situation today where I couldn‚Äôt reload and couldn‚Äôt fire. Couldn‚Äôt even swing a melee weapon. No weapon I switched to would fire or reload. 
---
So I just let them kill me and then I could reload and fire after I respawned.
---
But today I definitely had problems with the robots for the rocket cores daily. Normally 1-2 shots and they‚Äôre down. Today it took 15-18 shots to take down one. They refused to take damage.
---
My bad I tapped the autofill on my keyboard.
---
ü§î
---
&gt;It shouldn‚Äôt take cheating for you to have fun in an online multiplayer game.
---
No, it shouldn't, which is why I've pretty much given up until they fix they abysmal perk/drop/whatever system to not suck.  It's so focused on just a couple affixes that are actually useful.
---
For what? Knowing that my fairly traded items I worked for I know are 100% naturally gained?
---
You need help or haven‚Äôt played this game for very long.
---
Please tell me the camper has been fixed before it's being sold again.... The collision mechanic for the walls was busted according to ladydevann which is why the posters and frames etc won't stop sinking into the walls on the interior.
---
I miss it. I'll check today now it's for sale see if it's been fixed.
---
Servers already seem to suck ass sometimes why make them worse by having some taken up by hackers or dupers?
---
I know but it‚Äôs just a thought I had and we all know bugthesda likes money so instead of permanently remove potential customers just make it so they can‚Äôt ruin our fun and we can‚Äôt ruin theirs ? Is that not fair to have separate servers for bad sports ? Even titanfall can do it
---
So wait, I need to loot all containers to make them respawn?
---
Also I did it yesterday, so quite a while ago. 
---
I don't mind them taking a while to repopulate. It's just that they look like they can be collected
---
Agreed because if something requires to ban a crap load of people, they should have been putting up threats to ban people immediately. Why sugar coat it? If they knew it was bad they should have been setting everyone up to be banned.
---
there‚Äôs a lot of perks that help with low health, allowing you to act like you have more health than you actually do. Most of them are Percentage based so they have a greater effect than raw damage Resistance. For example:
---
- Serenpidity Perk: Gain 45% chance to avoid damage when under 30% HP (that‚Äôs 45% damage reduction there and then)
---
- Nerd Rage Perk: while below 20% HP Gain 20% damage, +40DR, +15% AP regen
---
- Blocker Perk: take 45% less damage from enemy Melee Attacks (regardless of HP)
---
Then there‚Äôs Unyielding Armour itself:
---
- up to +3 of each SPECIAL (except Endurance) the lower your health. If you‚Äôre sneaky, the extra Agility helps not be detected so helps you survive. 
---
Last but not least:
---
- Dodgy Perk: gain 30% damage reduction regardless of HP at the cost of 30AP per hit. (Unyielding armour gives you extra AP the lower your health)
---
So there you have it. Lots of perks benefit playing at low health by rewarding you with % based damage reduction or a chance to avoid damage, effectively allowing you to be less wary of your low health. 
---
Due to the reliance on RNG, and the fact that large bulk damage (ie, hit by something big like a Bear or Scorchbeast Queen), you‚Äôll still to down faster than other players at full health, but you have more breathing room than you may think.
---
Edit: there‚Äôs no need per se to sit super low, as others say, find where you‚Äôre comfortable to play with. I sit on 30% or so usually, and get most of what I need from that. Not to mention the purpose of a glass cannon - you‚Äôre not typically going to be in danger as much as others since you can take out the enemies faster
---
Very nice :)
---
?
---
Good thing I'm not banned then lol
---
Clearly someone does, as we can trade fed currency for gold in the outer world.
---
Haha lol I‚Äôm playing rn
---
I don't sweat it too much. Too many rads, take a radaway. Too few rad, go stand by a barrel. You are still very powerful even if you don't have the perfect ratio. Also increase your damage resistance as much as possible, so when you do get hit, it doesn't knock you out. Get the secret service armor if you can.
---
You rock! I have a similar gametag to my handle on here I'll add you as a friend!
---
run blocker at max lvl in str.. ignoring 45% of incoming melee damage is huge in this game whatever your build is..
---
Chemist mod from raiders, it removes the need to use traveling pharmicst at no cost to bag weight. It works with chems and stims and has 90% weight reduction
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm time, but with this much of a gut punch and no one to immediately be there to replace the funds, The game is gonna take a tumble
---
Power armor? If so i can give pointers
---
I'm usually doing a mad crawl, as I've weighed myself down with pointless items lol
---
That'd be "horde" as a head's up: a large group/a mass or crowd.  
---
"Hoard" is usually a verb meaning to accumulate something for, often hidden,  preservation, or future use.  
---
Easy enough mistake to make.
---
Yeah thats a point that is reall bothering me too because one of my friends is under investigation too an he already is pretty far behind and now he has to wait more days to be unbanned
---
if it's just a game why cant I get a good gun that I want. It shouldn't matter if it's just a game. Your argument doesnt hold up
---
Salty for not being banned? Ok then...
---
The NW daily to survive for 20 minutes will take significantly longer than 20 minutes to complete when you factor in finding a match, loading in, waiting for players, waiting for vote, load times, etc. 
---
To just stand their for 20 minutes. 
---
Absolutely no ‚Äúskill‚Äù involved. Just a worthless time sink like literally every NW daily they have. 
---
Pick 3 locks? Yeah. Have fun with that shit when people know literally everyone has to pick 3 locks and camps them. 
---
No. I want to earn score by playing, not being forced into a shitty game of grab-ass with other players just trying to complete dailies.
---
What my idea was maybe have besthesda actually do something and maybe make new servers some for us some for them that way they keep making money of us and the duper‚Äôs and we don‚Äôt have to give a shit about what they do
---
It's a total of 15000 atoms for every level. I'm at the end of chapter 1.
---
It would be smart but I don‚Äôt think they have enough servers for that üòÇüòÇ, but good idea
---
Oh, ok. So a server specifically setup to allow players to override rules, and you want to compare that to a game that isn't setup that way. Makes sense, nice strawman.
---
You know goddamn well you arent allowed to cheat in fallout. Its not a fucking surprise. If someone knows the rules, and gets banned, and then cries about it, its funny as fuck to me.
---
How does it affect me? Because YOU cheating allows you to progress faster that I am. That affects my game. You get to set prices, you get to use better gear and equipment first. That is not fair to anyone who doesnt cheat.
---
So, to all the idiots that got banned, I think this is fuckin hilarious, and I hope you lost countless hours of your life that you wont ever get back. Hopefully you morons learned something.
---
Grocery mod 90% reduction to all food and drinks.
---
Hopefully Bethesda will give atoms so a person can skip to their tier they would be caught up with.
---
my man
---
I nor none of my friends have, so you're wrong.  Quit projecting your bad behaviors onto all of us.
---
Good to know. 
---
I've only gotten them from the workshops, but great that they are actually available elsewhere. I've been seeing some of the Whitesprings plans with the Blue Ridge Caravan traders, resort chairs, etc.
---
I got bos cap paint from technical data a few days ago
---
From what I have heard, the bans are associated with having multiple of a duped item. No one I know has been banned for owning one of a duped item.
---
Nope, you can tame anything even at max budget! I say that from personal experience, I go nuts with lights and decorations.
---
If Bethesda themselves are asking players to call out annoying challenges why the hell do you feel it‚Äôs necessary to come in here and defend a system Bethesda themselves ASKED for player feedback on? Like, what are you even doing but arguing with people just to argue? Smug self-satisfaction? Like, really, what is your goal here?
---
But they still get fucked vis a vis the season because missing a few days deprives them of score.
---
its not going to a tumble as the game is free to play now lol
---
The game keeps track of containers and loose items you loot, up to around 250-ish.  After looting item 251, the first container will be lootable again.  This counter applies to all containers and loose items laying around in the world, so it‚Äôs better to loot liberally and toss what you don‚Äôt need if you return to the same areas repeatedly.
---
Second run for me following this. Thank you!
---
Same. Though if I could input an infinite Caps cheat code legitimately I might do it. I just wanna build my swank ass apocalypse den without all the hassle
---
If they are doing the dupe based on the weapons you have there fools because then everyone is going to get banned those weapons are everywhere
---
That‚Äôs breach and clear, completely different
---
I have a conspiracy theory that this dupe wasn't disabled because Bethesda wanted to purge 76 of dupers so game pass plebs can have a more "social/fun" wasteland.
---
I have a spare if you are on ps4
---
i know her i think, shes jewish right?
---
I didn‚Äôt  dupe period. You‚Äôre just being assholes who have duped and/or don‚Äôt know how you are in the game without it
---
Shitty people gonna do shitty things
---
Cheers my fellow vault dweller.
---
Gives you a headache doesn't it
---
If you aren't a duper or cheater, as you put it in other posts, why cruise the marketplace?
---
That was a mediocre attempt at trying to get the pvp people into another game mode and it failed horribly
---
I am on ps4 tho =/
---
...Dubious?
---
You‚Äôre really being this salty over an incredibly commonly used word? 
---
Really?
---
I joined one of the big cheaters' discord channel and it's a full on clown fest rn. So many different ways of trying to justify it. You'd think this game is unplayable without a junkie's explosive gatling plasma if you based your opinions on what they are saying
---
That's true, but that's not the only way Bethesda has fucked the average player on SCORE (looking at you, challenge autocompletion)
---
No worries my friend, no worries. I used to work nights so trust me, I can sympathize.
---
I'm just trying to help and you've done no harm. That said, hopefully you'll manage to get some sleep soon, as that's always a real drag.
---
If you get the plan for Marine Tactical Helmet and tag Rubber for search, you'll never need to sell purified water again. Then you can move your camp anywhere you want, and carry Inert Flux instead which weighs 0.2 instead of Purified Water (which weighs 0.5)
---
Not all of it is duping. I said 1/5
---
Is jaywalking an arrestable offense or a ticketable one?  Is looking at someone in public a felony or a misdemeanor?
---
Your analogy is weak. It would be closer to ask *‚ÄòShould someone be arrested for possession of stolen goods or illegal substance?‚Äò*. That‚Äôs a much closer comparison. 
---
I never signed a contract to not look at someone in public. I did sign a contract (accepted a ToS) to neither engage in or support glitches in this game.
---
Do I think that payers should be able to appeal and have a secondary review, if they provide reasonable details for the situation?  Yes. 
---
But you‚Äôve shifted from ‚Äòsomeone that did something that doesn‚Äôt directly affect me‚Äô to ‚Äòsomeone tangentially involved in the offense‚Äô. 
---
So let me break it down for you;
---
Intentionally engaged in using a glitch that resulted in duplication?  Permaban. 
---
Accidentally encountered a duplication glitch but then decided to keep repeating it?  Permaban.
---
Accidentally found a duplication glitch but didn‚Äôt repeat it?  Email advising that this was noted and reminder to not repeat the event.
---
Engaged it a single direct trade involving a duped item?  Email advising that this was noted and reminder to not repeat the event.
---
Engaged in two to three trades involving duped items?  One month ban.  
---
Engaged in four or more trades involving duped items?  Permaban.
---
But my opinion isn‚Äôt the point. That‚Äôs between Bethesda and the individual player. 
---
If the trade is too good to be true?  It probably is.
---
Good
---
Was this a recent dup or long standing?
---
Yeah there was actually a write-up about the method they use when the last big duping ban wave happened in early 2019. It was exactly like you said, they look for items in unattainable quantities.
---
The technical difficulties that come with developing these features is totally understandable. My issue is with Bethesda‚Äôs lack of communication on these difficulties. Especially since the feature was used to promote Fallout 1st.
---
Nah, I don't expect anything as strong as that.  They're already adding more challenges, I think they'll just do more tweaks like that - maybe award a bit more points for challenges, maybe slightly reduce how many points you need.  They'll probably be aiming to make it so that players who don't spend atoms, don't play NW, don't grind XP hardcore, and lost some SCORE to the bug, will be able to make it to rank 100 before the end but not too long before the end.
---
Well then you answered your own question.
---
I didn‚Äôt have any doubles of anything but it is what it is. Best weekend I‚Äôve had playing the game and was totally worth it just to try an explosive flamer and an explosive plasma.
---
This &gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Happens to me and a lot of other people too. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. I'm just glad I don't use a gatling gun but this has to suck for people who do.
---
Heck yea, someone send me
---
Instructions on how to dupe!
---
No they announced it a few weeks ago when they release info on the score system that within 2 weeks they are allowing rank purchases
---
So try again. Use different words. 
---
What are you expecting from me?  Mine didn‚Äôt get blocked or ignored.
---
I‚Äôve been trying everything to sleep but I just can‚Äôt really considering banging my head off a wall till I pass out just so I can get some rest
---
I use the sink and settler well for this. I live MILES away on a rocky mountain beyond enemy spawns. I love never fixing shit and having to deal with mobs.
---
I'd take seclusion over a jank stream any day and it only takes a minute to get cooking water sorted. One small purifier covers the purified side of things.
---
So I appreciate everyone‚Äôs response. A lot of it makes sense. 
---
Here‚Äôs what I built using the advice. Any tips off this? I‚Äôll add adrenaline on once it‚Äôs fixed. 
---

---
waited so long for this, and now the garage is here! Kinda disappointed though. Its way smaller than I hoped, so I have to work to cam my benches in it, and I cant find any stairs that snap to it. I'm gonna make it work somehow. Got an existing ramp butted next to the side door for now, and the main door is just for show. Now I can rebuild my red rocket themed diner completely!
---
I miss the instigating lever action.  I ran a 1 star until I was over 300 and I switched to bloodied.
---
yea, i recently launched my first nuke, and i expected it to be close to impossible, but its really not
---
Ah I misread your post. My mistake.
---
Christ I wish these were legitimately tradeable. My first roll was a bloodied/limb/90 on my full health build
---
I don't understand why a ban is absolutely necessary for EVERYBODY who duped. I never did it but it's not even a pvp game at this point and what if I got a godroll and wanted to give my friend another one of the same? Sure, its not totally moral but nobody is getting hurt on this situation. I'm sure there's a way for devs to see just how many items each player that gets banned has duped. And if thats the case, they could surely out a filter where only people who duped over a certain amount of items gets banned. Again, it just seems a little extreme to ban people for duping just once especially if that person has pit money into their account
---
Location location location,  I'm on the main farming route so I can sell ammo, other park where lead is
---
It‚Äôs interesting. 
---
I have two guns that I use. One I‚Äôve had since I picked it up off the first SBQ that I helped kill and another one that I rolled from Mumbles. Buying bubble gum, a fan and one bullet (to get the dailies yesterday) are the only times I‚Äôve bought anything from anyone. 
---
Care to tell me exactly where anything I have is duped?
---
Is there a way to report dupping? Im on console and regularly get asked if i want to dupe my weapons and trade.
---
All good
---
I‚Äôm definitely with you on this. I don‚Äôt even want to touch a duped item.
---
....are you banned?
---
Yeah, at this point, I would think three and four times before dropping the money on this game.
---
Just summon Arvak bro
---
I had legacies far before this dupe, and our classed you by miles :), hours mean nothing, as it‚Äôs just a game, there‚Äôs others to go to, and it‚Äôs not like there is something special in it, I beat the game, I got everything I wanted, I had fun, and I‚Äôm set now, and how are you even gonna talk about progression, are you stupid, like bruh, someone that has better rng can go faster, someone with more time and commitment can out Pace you, so like that isn‚Äôt even a applicable argument üòÇ, and you wanted a response so I gave you one lmao, and yeah I know you aren‚Äôt allowed to and no one said I had cheated, I can side with who I want your accusations arent nice tho friend. Just learn that this is a live public service, your progression is up to your want to progress, your game play, is up to how much you want to pay, ex: private servers, you can‚Äôt control this game bud, and ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù will always be there ;)
---
Duped about 30 guns total and got banned.
---
From my perspective the thing they should have done over a year ago was eliminate all legacy weapons.  Most of the dupes aren‚Äôt of things you can get in the game but rather things you cannot get but need if you engage in pvp.
---
Best part is the poor thing had to check my post history to take a jab at me. 
---
Fucking pathetic &lt;3
---
Yeah not me either
---
I didn't say you got banned, just that you're a dirty rotten cheater. 
---
I also don't have cheated items, because I rarely buy anything. Keep projecting though.
---
I don't understand why the backpack and the suit are two different shades of green.
---
Yeah lmao, they still get money from Microsoft now, so maybeeee they did that as a crutch lmao
---
Location trumps water source for me. Caps is not an issue since one quick legendary farm run nets me more than 1400 caps in guns, armor and chems.
---
no
---
im playing on pc gamepass tho if that makes a diffrence
---
Whaaaaaat?  Duper‚Äôs got bans?  Ahhh
---
Hahahahahahahahhaha 
---
(Inhale)
---
Hahahahahahaha

I stay at 20% health, if i take on rads, i use radaway then drink water for rads til im back at 20%. I use healing factor mutation cause as a bloody build, i kill stuff fast and am oit of combat for free health regain. Ive shed all my weight reduction perks except thru hiker.
---
Yea I got my hands on a b2525 fixer, je plasma a be flamer and a je laser best time I‚Äôve had playing this game in a while if I‚Äôd get banned i would be pissed but I know at least 15 people that I could throw under the bus
---
Is it saying you‚Äôre not authorized?
---
High Capacity
---
Actually there are no criteria to be under investigation but for the final ban its about the items you have i mean if you have one b2525 fixer they cant ban you for it but if you have 10k presents 
---
10 be25 fixer and every legacy on earth youre acc is ruined
---
I bought a high end Fixer and a legacy gatling laser from a vendor bot over the weekend and I was able to log in just fine today. Could be false positives if you are innocent, submit a ticket. Good luck fellow wastelander.
---
Me too brah!
---
I duped once for a buncha 50 cal and 5mm cuz making ammo sucks ass. I don‚Äôt blame people for duping really, imo FO76 is just too much grinding and it makes it less fun. I just wanna do events and shoot at stuff
---
Rarely? Like the other guy who only plays on private servers(only a couple months old) Lol.
---
You think it‚Äôs unfair to trade actually earned caps for flux? Do you know where that guy got the flux?
---
At least your honest
---
You're ahead  of me in the game but I've been building since day one.  Maybe I can assist in building and you keep me from dying so much on quests...
---
PSN KaganMikhail
---
What do you mean delete those accounts?
---
They removed your post lmao
---
They already got their money from the people that are banned. They don't get more money from letting them play. No point.
---
Idc lmao. Maybe they should make it an easier grind with less RNG. Lighten up a bit tubby
---
Not as practical as you'd think. Concussions aren't very restful.
---
I wish I could offer some tips or something, but honestly, all I ever did was run myself until I finally passed out.
---
It's not a great solution to say the least and even then, it was hit or miss at best.
---
This is the stuff that boggles my mind, how does one man have that many presents and isn't banned lol
---
Ahhh on my alt I have 22k gifts all of them are legit on my end, I traded for gifts since I was lvl 40 and I‚Äôm 120 now I hope that doesn‚Äôt f*ck my account
---
It‚Äôs a joke because Bethesda always breaks something when they try to fix something else
---
&gt; cheating
---
If you're cheating, you're playing a different game.  You're paying 1v1 with the developer, and that's absolutely not Fallout.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious. Cheaters getting fucked! Well done Bethesda.
---
PVP *can* be fun. I have a hard time believing any low level players are taking workshops because their idea of *fun* PVP is 1 v 3ing a squad of max level players. And even if the case was that the team thought she took the workshop for pvp, why follow and harass her afterwards? Take the W and move on.
---
Agreed that getting steel is easier by combat/scrapping in locations, but that requires physically doing those things. Usually if I take a workshop for steel (grafton steel) I am using it more for the passive generation than the swiftness of acquisition. Else I would go to watoga and slay some bots and scrap everything in sight. Grafton Steel is nice because i can event hop while it gathers steel and jump back periodically to craft ammo.
---
It‚Äôs a thought to be had
---
Bro, what the fuck are you responding to, that doesn‚Äôt even link with my comment üòÇ
---
Yep its a file issue. The .exe has to be on the boot drive.
---
i think i‚Äôm going with commando/rifle.
---
They‚Äôre just gonna delete Bethesda it‚Äôs self next üòÇ
---
I wish I knew. I did it about 5 or 6 times so my buddy and I could have similar weapons to mess around with. Got the suspension email today. Never duped any single weapon more than once and they never stayed in my inventory for very long. I think with anyone with &lt;10 duped items, it should be considered reparations for how many times this game has crashed on me fighting either sbq or imposter sheepsquatch and not getting anything for the event. Or atleast for the 2 or 3 crashes\freezes a day my friends and I experience haha.
---
Hmm idk i think for unsuposed bans you can write bethesda and explain the situation and maybe you have luck not getting banned
---
Cause I liked the hook up on weapons lol. Wouldn‚Äôt have gotten anything good without them.
---
You are pretending like you are better than anyone when you are where you are in the game from people who have duped. (Yes, almost everything on the market is ‚Äúcheated‚Äù).
---
Stop pretending like it‚Äôs not; stop pretending like you are better.
---
There‚Äôs gonna delete oxygen ü§£
---
I really wanna seem them lose it and get lifetime bans that go through generations and other family members.
---
"ThIs RaNdOm GuY tOlD mE" is NOT proof dude.
---
Did you have a lot of multiple guns in your inventory?
---
ok
---
You must really be up to no good, banned before you even started...smh. Kidding, have you downloaded all the DLC schtuff and patch crap?
---
I had a good sever a few minutes ago after constantly being on dry ones this past weekend. 3 SBQs, a failed Encrypted (lol), and everyone working together. 
---
It‚Äôs all chance.
---
OK I am slow how do you Dup? Is it a specific type of cheating? Sorry, I know I am stupid.
---
Bethesda has no cajones. They should have banned dupers in the first wave ever *and* everyone who bought their products. They didn't even delete their duped guns that wave. 
---
There'd be no sentinel meta because the one guy who got it clean wouldn't have been able to spread it like a cancer. Ah well. Guess bans are better late than never.
---
Oh wow. One person talking reasonably here.
---
I eat mentats or something that boosts Intelligence it helps,  someone told me that long time ago and been using it. seems to work well
---
You all give me such pleasant nostalgia! 
---
But 
---
Garyyy.. whaaaaa..
---
Bruh only in their building tho so there won‚Äôt be any incompetent workers
---
Damn you showed me! Gottem!!
---
OK.
---
It's cool, this is one of the saltiest sub reddit I've ever seen for a game.
---
We are talking about social contract tho not laws specifically. Its a lot easier to break social contract than law. You dont have to break the law to break a social contract but you do break social contract when you break the law. You said it, poessession of stolen property is a better anaology for a direct correlation for what happens but I am also assuming you know that if you can prove genuine ignorance to the knowledge of the item being stolen at the time of purchase, you lack the necessary mens rea to commit theft. So by your logic once again, if someone who bought a duped item or unintentionally involved themselves in a duping incident were to be banned, would that be justified? The only person who is changing their perspective on what has been said is you. You have said that it matters not whether or not the person duped previously but then now you say that people who were not duping per se should not be banned, i.e emails. To clarify my point to you once again, people who didnt dupe shouldnt be banned while hackers. I sympathize with dupers because it doesnt effect my gameplay in anyway and they have just lost how they enjoyed the game. Im not asking for your sympathy but rather I would appreciate consistent thinking cause you dont seem stupid and are actually articulating your points.
---
For me it‚Äôs a bit situational. Most of the time I use the Grocer‚Äôs Mod...for casual Wasteland roaming. High Capacity for junk runs...and for harder stuff like SBQ or Encrptid, etc. and I want to be a tad bit beefier..I like to use the Armor Plated mod. But....that‚Äôs when I remember to switch, lol. Half the time I forget. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Very true, and agreed
---
Yep pretty much Todd Howard‚Äôs gonna get in a space suit and gas his Workforce of Neanderthals
---
Back-and-forth between high-capacity and dense
---
Man that sucks I think since this game is just so destroyed and the lack of content in that ahem that was promised there should be a better banning system someone can have 100 b2525 fixers and won‚Äôt get banned then someone with 2 will get banned it‚Äôs stupid
---
Jesus what a shitty textwall run-on. I guess ill TRY to read this shit... 
---
&gt; and how are you even gonna talk about progression, are you stupid, like  bruh, someone that has better rng can go faster, someone with more time  and commitment can out Pace you, 
---
You asked for an answer, and you got one. Sound familiar? 
---
&gt; ex: private servers, you can‚Äôt control this game bud, and ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù will always be there ;) 
---
Sure, and in a game that allows private servers, this wouldnt be a problem. But its not, so it is. 
---
I dont control the game, the company who owns it does, and they are doing so. 
---
Cheaters will always be there? That's your excuse for just excusing cheating? I dont know about you, but my parents taught me it was poor form to cheat in games when I was like two. Of course cheater will always be there. And, of course they will always whine and cry when they get kicked/banned/etc.
---
High Capacity for the general carry weight boost. Grocer and Chemist sound nice but I don't see any reason to horde enough Stimpaks or Nuka Colas to justify their use and SSA has enough resistance to offset the negative effects of the High Capacity mod.
---
In a way I agree,  but its hardly an mmo. It has aspects of one. But the limiting they put on us is a bit much. Remove cap limit, add more guns and items to the game, more content, maybe some new areas, etc. Anything to change the economy of the game. Then I can see having a cap limit, daily amount, etc.
---
There's no real world economy in 76, so I dont see an issue with it i guess.
---
I have not had my own water purifiers for over a year. I vendor grenades, cooked food, and chems. I actually stopped using hard bargain so I could get rid of the chems faster since I get more of them and water from events than I need
---
I've had extremely good and extremely bad luck getting the mods for my FFR Radium. I unlocked the scopes first, but then right after that I unlocked the suppressor and powerful auto receiver; on the other hand, I've scrapped about 200 since then and I'm still missing that fucking reflex sight. One of these days you're going to give up and give it to me, game. You won't win this battle of stubborn attrition.
---
Collect laser weapons from Super Muties and scrap with the scrapper perk, you'll have more plastic that 50 year celebrity trying to stay relevant.
---
Are you on pc? 
---
I could be wrong, but I remember reading that when Beth released fo76 on Steam and 2fa, it was linking people accounts to the wrong account.
---
I think its cause servers are unstable atm but it might just be you ive been playing the game most of today and ive been somewhat fine aside from the occasionally lag spike
---
I'm just curious if it can be placed on foundations. I have a semi-detatched garage I keep my vendors in, that's got a connection to my porch via foundations.
---
Is Bethesda actually banning people for duping now? Didn't seem like they banned anybody before, but I don't follow duping.
---
This is something you see in people who behave badly. "I do it, so everyone else must do it too." No, *everyone* doesn't do it, *everyone* is a large amount of people and you speak for exactly one person.
---
That is factually incorrect. They announced it would be available today.
---
I bought a plasma gatling to play with when I get a build set up, I hope I can still get in. :/ I just thought the player was being nice.
---
Yeah, you can do that to get back the lost intelligence from marsupial for example.
---
Did the ban wave just start? I haven't gotten an email. I was given 3 BE15r GP that's im 100% sure are duped but why would I say no?
---
That's an interesting way of trying to justify it. Hope your weekend of fun was worth it, now those of us who actually play the game get to pay for your fun. The already resource-scarce skeleton crew we have trying to fix the game is now instead focusing on this mess. Those of us who were already running out of things to do and hoping seasons would brighten up the grind instead get to find out that everything we previously grinded for is even more worthless than before, and those who either got a lucky drop or legitimately grinded for top-tier items are now being accused of cheating thanks to people like you.
---
I get that it's a grind. I get that it can suck. But if you can't have fun with it, that is when you put your foot down and say that you are not going to sink your time into something you're not enjoying. Cheating through it is to get your way is just childish in an online game where your actions are always affecting others. It reminds me of a kid in my preschool who broke a block set by trying to ram a square one into a triangular hole. If you want your power fantasy blowing everything up with broken weapons, play fallout 4 with some console commands or mods. Or play a game that's more fitting for you. Don't ruin it for the rest of us just because you don't like it
---
Been active since Christmas lol
---
No it has its own separate foundation
---
Ah yes, the servers will finally work like they‚Äôre supposed to, honestly I‚Äôm kinda glad the game is dying, I‚Äôm happy to move on to something else
---
I think with a lot of the console players they don't realize the game isn't actually closed and is still running in the background after you exit via the menu. You have to force close it from the game management menu (on xbox, not sure what the PS4 equivalent is).
---
Either way, it's still a bug and hopefully they fix it really soon.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a whole legendary revamp. The system kinda worked for FO4, mostly due to mods, but the legendary effects make no sense really for a multiplayer game, for the reason you point out. The Division 2 had the same problem, too many garbage effects, too much 0.00001% RNG ruins games for me, and also leads to duping and screwed up ‚Äúmeta.‚Äù
---
Actually banned? Not suspended?
---
So I had one account I did the dupe on(A) then another account I play on(B). B got banned, A did not. I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with the act, all what‚Äôs in your inventory.
---
High capacity, and never swapped it out for the others even though I have them all
---
how do you know if something is duped? Id hate to randomly pick something up from someone and get banned for it.
---
Super trash. Can‚Äôt stand it. Destroys the game experience. I hope they lost money today.
---
I am persoanlly extremely excited for the chicken coop with real chickens cause pretend pet lmaoo, gratz on the bag dude
---
Chemist. Stockpile chems I like and use, sell the ones I don't, hoard stimpaks.
---
Same here I‚Äôm tempted to try get myself banned but I‚Äôm not sure
---
I had one of a TSE flamer, be plasma, b25 25 fixer, and got banned, no email yet.
---
My mom and I are at Aaronholt Farmstead and there's a good amount of flat road up there. Plus it spawns melon bloom and ash bloom which is mega hard to find.
---
I set up north of whitesprings just below NAR. The artillery car reach the cars in front of the golf club and tennis courts. Its great for Mayhem.

Two backpacks on each character.

Capacity/cooler for gunslinger, heavy weapon and ghoul builds.
---
Cooler is only for gather flux materials.
---
Sometimes, when you are specced out correctly, you can hold the crit button and the fire button to automatically crit when available. You can only do this when your crit bar is full and under certain circumstances of which I do not know.
---
Obligatory "it just works"
---
Some of us don‚Äôt buy flux off the market bruh
---
What a shame did you dupe that? Or did you trade for that
---
Yes they announced it that it be within the 2 week mark , which is Today. 
---
You making it sound that they announced it this morning and that not the case
---
Does it have chickens?
---
Wastelander.
---
Huh, interesting.
---
no i dont think so
---
I rolled a bloodied AGL few days ago and have been enjoying lobbing them everywhere since, especially at the lower level events I‚Äôm only doing for dailies etc. 
---
Seems to break every 5 minutes sadly, but I‚Äôm kinda bored of using best weapons constantly. It‚Äôs either that or fist fighting stuff lately.
---
It's due to the introduction of a certain bug that appeared in the beginning of Wastelanders. Essentially, sometimes an enemy's unlooted items will spawn in as a physical item. (For example, sometimes after a Queen event, there will be a pile of Ultracite Plans, meat, armor, weapons and bones around Drop Site V9 because it's the most common battle location.) This applies to Raider thieves getting killed by something and going unlooted.
---
Thus it is possible to on occasion find the stolen Foundation items just sitting on the ground in the world.
---
Edit: This was actually part of a common settler reputation exploit back in early May. [DemonAsylum](https://youtu.be/nXmAs5LM5Z0) can do a better job at explaining this.
---
I thought the ban wave was still active rn as in people are still getting banned
---
The waste acid is probably more valuable than the gold scrap they would have made made with it.
---
How do you use the artillery?
---
My first 5 rolls came out with a BLD15 gauss shotgun. I love it but VATs is so buggy atm.
---
You ABSOLUTELY shouldn't feel bad. That dude started the feud. You just put an end to it.
---
They did release a hotfix, it's in the patch notes, and the ban/suspension system is automated. Only if your account is tagged for a manual review (suspicious activity) will a person look at it and review the suspension.
---
Well that's not true as I don't stand by that. I despise having a game where there's a market where people can financially benefit from. It's against the ToS. I Broke my end of the agreement yes, but my war was against those greedy people no one bats an eye on
---
I‚Äôm just suspended at the moment. I hope they don‚Äôt permaban me. Best case scenario they just wipe my items from my character
---
oh boy
---
&gt;when leveling up BE AWARE you do not have to pick a Perk Card from the same stat you place your level point in!!
---
&gt;after you place your point for leveling up you can scroll the stats and pick any card you have unlocked..
---
&gt;ALSO - you cant "bank" levels waiting for cards to unlock.. for example you cant pick a card that unlocks at level 10 until you have spent your points for the previous levels...
---
I try to keep 10-20 Stimpaks on my person "just in case", but I can't even do that because I get so many more than I ever use. I'm constantly throwing them on the floor. I can't comprehend why you'd choose to carry nearly 500 when you could use that space for far more valuable purposes, but hey to each their own I guess.
---
You don't. But at this point, nearly all of the top-tier items in circulation in trading subs/discords are cheated. If you're buying something there, you can be relatively sure it's duped or hacked in (if you're on PC). Your average players who just happen to get lucky drops and don't want them either sell them to vendors or put them in their vending machines
---
You seen the PS4 servers after this ban wave 
---
There‚Äôs like 6 people a server !
---
Did it work?
---
yah look at it the pictures show the chickens in different positions so im assuming they are like living friendly mobs
---
I had 5 of each of these weapons: b2525 fixer, 2 god roll hand maxes, 3 different legacies, some junkie shotguns
---
While I don't carry one regularly, I do keep a ts  in my stash the pull out when I have an exess of grenades.
---
Wow. You really nailed it. A+ job turning my subtle snark into a well thought out diatribe.
---
lul people are so entitled these days.
---
Well thanks, you just saved me from wasting Atoms on it üëç
---
Anyone on PC having this happen when you weren't on at reset time (12:00 noon eastern)?
---
It seems like most of the unexplained occurrences are console people and I suspect it's because the game is running in the background. It's easy to have the game running on consoles and not know it, and a lot more difficult for that to happen on PC (it still can, if the client hangs on close).
---
Totally agree. I don‚Äôt dupe, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me that other people do! Just play how you wanna play. 
---
If the devs make a mistake, that‚Äôs on them. And those who‚Äôve been banned for duping that I play with feel like it‚Äôs a fair consequence, they aren‚Äôt whining.
---
Yes. Mine is a sneak commando, just build around Agility, Perception and Luck. You‚Äôll need all those to sneak, hit and improve critical hits. You‚Äôll be doing so much damage and stay hidden. I‚Äôd really recommend unyielding armor though, it‚Äôll make your specials much higher, thus higher sneak ability, hit chance, etc.
---
dont do any N.W before all weekly and daily are complete
---
This happened to me today and the best I could figure was that I was in a rad storm with enemies nearby and my fast travel canceled every time lightning flashed.
---
It‚Äôs all a matter of perspective and opinion. There‚Äôs one side of the aisle that will say it‚Äôs the best thing that ever happened, the other side will say it‚Äôs the worst, and then there‚Äôs those in the middle who simply don‚Äôt care.
---
So if I turn pacifist off, my brother can ‚Äúretire‚Äú my DC?
---
I‚Äôve been suspended with a email
---
Im not a meta whore so my gear is pretty cheap and not often duped...
---
It‚Äôs an excavator armor piece. I was 99% sure that they didn‚Äôt exist in the game.
---
I use mine for the line in the sand event and I find I have to repair it about 5 times over the course of it, but it hasn't deterred me yet, I have dozens of repair kits in my stash that I need to use at some point anyway. I guess being 2 shot it degrades twice as fast? Though I'm not certain about that.
---
Pssst... It was a made up high number for potential comedic effect. I should‚Äôve gone with the old stalwart number of eleventybillion eh. 
---
I use healing factor so even though I only use them in emergencies they DO stack up and I can‚Äôt be bothered doing inventory buckaroo endlessly. Also I have like 500 carry weight so when the donkey DOES kick it‚Äôs an even bigger ballache to clear everything. 
---
I usually sell everything to duchess but when adventuring with calves of steel so you can carry more than Atlas, it‚Äôs easy to forget when you‚Äôre hopping around the map doing stuff endlessly üòÅ
---
It was underwhelming, such an overhyped gun tbh.
---
that won't get you banned.
---
It‚Äôs stupid the casual players right now are having the best time of there life‚Äôs and there getting banned, the hoarders are getting mad, and the try heads are freaking out because there weapons are worthless
---
I'm not entirely convinced people got banned for duping tbh. Also there wasn't really an "economy" before, it was already ruined by previous dupe waves. People were abusing an exploit to stack leadership bobbleheads and gain massive amounts of XP (getting about 3000 XP on a mole rat) and supposedly getting banned for that too
---
Still going strong! Ironically, I think this is the longest  I've ever gone without being disconnected üòÇ
---
Pro tip take that down to 20% and get nerd rage going. Huge dmg difference for 5% health
---
Agreed, although I'd settle for buying it from a vendor.
---
Thank you!
---
hope it was worth it
---
It's a good weapon but find it cumbersome
---
My main is a .50 cal  when it comes to mobs or big enemies
---
Definitely can‚Äôt hurt. I would think that the updates and patch info would download automatically if you‚Äôre a new player. I only ask because sometimes my patch files downloads automatically and sometimes I have to start it. Xbox tho
---
GL man
---
Guess I'm lucky I never tried then. I noticed the change on the week of wastelanders launch, and I was curious if they implemented some countermeasure against the dupe after re-enabling those vendors, but I didn't care enough to check. Based on how many bans are happening right now, maybe even testing out of curiosity back then would have been enough to get my flagged
---
I'm assuming you're referring to "Overseer's Log - Nuke Launch"
---
Mine was at Site Alpha, but if you're on PC I can drop you one if for some reason yours never spawned, I somehow ended up with a spare - i dunno if it'll count towards quest completion though (if applicable i can't remember).
---
A handful of months ago I got a J/25/25 handmade from SBQ the onlg good thing to come out of her and i traded it for a B/25/25 from someone I was talking to during the queen and the feeling if getting my everyday use weapon was soo satisfying. Ill never forget that
---
Mass bannings.
---
Bans
---
Like 80% of players got banned lol
---
Diluted doesn‚Äôt. Just always be on diluted rad-x and pop diluted rad aways when needed. You can also use any toxic water as well to bring health down (that is collecting it for later use as drinking it straight is 100x slower).
---
1000000% true
---
Lmao you‚Äôre most certainly welcome, I hope it hurt what brain cells are left lmao
---
and ah it does sound familiar, though your answer was flawed so I showed how it doesn‚Äôt matter, and it does allow private worlds, you just have to pay, which is what they want you to do, and this.....is just a game, virtual, has no impact on you in the real world unless you let it, 
---
it‚Äôs good your parents taught good morals, though those are good for real life, yes I do carry good morals as to not scam or be disrespected to others in game, and have given to the new players coming in, and no it wasn‚Äôt weapons it was water and other resources 
---
But dude, cheaters are like villains, or the bad guy with the gun argument, if this game was perfect which, lmao, it‚Äôs FARRRR from that, then there wouldn‚Äôt be problems, the rng wouldnt be so shit, and the game would be fun from the get go, but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs a broken game, always has been, so cheaters will always be there, such as crooks and such in the real world, or killers or anything else, and this isn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs a game, so if people dupe, why does it matter
---
Yep, if I need to I'll buy on the last day to get the most S.C.O.R.E. for my atoms.  But with the additional # of daily events they added it should be a cake walk.
---
I've had people suggest St. John's Wort or melatonin. Worked for my girlfriend, made me paranoid and disoriented, but if you're desperate it might be worth a shot.
---
My thinking *is* consistent. 
---
If you intentionally violated the rules or intentionally assisted in violating the rules then you need to face consequences. Some form of ban, up to and including permanent is warranted. 
---
If you only violated the rules accidentally, then a warning of some form  is warranted.
---
Having said that, the servers are private property. And a private property owner has quite a few rights in determining who may have access and what kind of conduct is allowed. Short of a form of discrimination or a violation of law, they have very wide latitude.
---
Which of my listed ‚Äòaction:consequences‚Äô do you disagree with?
---
By your logic of ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt hurt me so why should I care‚Äô, tell me why someone exceeding the speed limit when I‚Äôm not on the road shouldn‚Äôt get a ticket. Why someone that steals from Wal-Mart should be arrested if I don‚Äôt even shop there. 
---
Why should I care about any illegal activity if it doesn‚Äôt affect me?
---
What the hell ?!
---
I don't see how the economy recovers now, personally.
---
Present dupes made caps redundant.
---
Ammo dupes made 5.56 etc. redundant. 
---
Now this dupe has made... everything redundant?
---
Recently trade pages were pretty much only trading legacy weapons or god rolls for other legendary weapons or god rolls. Now the majority of people will have got their hands on what they want, what will people need to trade for?

Are you on PC? Mole Momma gave me a B/FFR/+1AGI handmade this weekend. Yours if you want it.
---
That‚Äôs probably gonna be the solution then
---
So just so we're clear.
---
If we ever bought flux, we benefited from duping. But you sold flux that wasn't duped? But what about the people that bought from you? Did they benefit from duping? Or are you claiming to be the only legitimate player who.has ever sold flux?
---
Not really, now the BE Flamer that was worth it.
---
Legendaries absolutely need a revamp.  First it was two shot / exploding, so they nerfed it into the ground.  Then it became junkies / bloodied.  But of course these are also only useful on very specific weapons, as most items are considered trash drops.
---
There's at least a little bit of build diversity going on, but it's really annoying when there's so few viable options to not feel like an underpowered wimp.  My friend was playing with me and he didn't min/max and he's struggling and I'm just running around in a Chinese stealth suit 1 shotting everything as melee.  There's no balance, my alt can't do jack squat without the exact right gear, it's all meh.  So we both quit, because it just quit being fun trying to grind for 1 very specific drop.
---
Appreciate it. That's how the game should look like on console üëç
---
Yeah me and all my friends are hit, so there‚Äôs no point, and the servers are shot, but like I have no need to go back to the game, I had gotten everything and tryed everything, now it‚Äôs just the fact that I got banned and didn‚Äôt leave by choice
---
Same with me
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah, I have a few people on my friends list where they have literally been doing nothing but and they're still on right now. Figured this might be karma coming back around for getting out scot-free on the first exploit that came out when caps meant something and TSE was the meta haha. Guess it's back to rocket league for me til it's sorted out lol.
---
The complaint isnt so much about how you spend your money. At its core the issue is that because of the exp/time gate it is heavily geared towards making you pay to complete it. Which honestly when done correctly isn't that bad. Except because the game "locks" the score available it creates a giant upset for casual players. 
---
This gets tossed onto those that are buying from them. Why? Because if you buy from them when they're doing bad/awful decisions it doesn't give them a reason to improve. 
---
Also there isnt much reason to buy now instead of later when you're deeper in the pass for multiple reasons.
---
You may have traded for them, but they were never legit.  They can't trace the origin of them, so they'll just assume that you having that many means you either duped them or should have known they were acquire via exploit.
---
New Plague. If you survived the wave, its up to you to teach the new vault survivors by selling crap items like they're valuable
---
-Overseers Log
---
Best to just check for yourself. The post about steam numbers being down was fake news, numbers are consistent with the month average and actually a tiny bit higher than the same time yesterday. Every server I joined had the same amount of people today as before. Dupers are also in full damage control mode rn trying to guilt bethesda for actually punishing people for once, so don't be surprised if people are feeding you straight bull with a spoon
---
For real. I am happy they reduced the market value of what are essentially fake toys but if you break the ToS then you accept what they can and will do to your account. Hopefully all the crap they duped has long lasting effects on the market but god damn these self righteous posts are so stupid and pointless. Sure I'm frustrated and want them to fix bugs but expecting them to roll over when you're exploiting the game is just dumb.
---
Yeah every side has their own pros and cons
---
Damm and here‚Äôs me wandering a 3 man public server on PS4 I guess everyone was wiped out by the wave
---
I like to jetpack up into the air and rain down fire from above, its very effective in certain situations. But mostly I just like watching the ragdolls slowly sail over the horizon.
---
In my experience enemies start scaling to their max level after you hit level 100. Nothing really to do about it other than perfecting your build and using stimpacks like an addict
---
They basically ban people for having too many identical items, if that makes sense.
---
Which plans? You have to go into your notes and learn them then you craft armor at the armor bench and weapons at the weapon bench
---
It‚Äôs almost like fallout is 100x funner with console commands lol
---
The funny part was most players who got banned were people who literally had no idea they were receiving duplicates items. Thought players were friendly like myself.
---
I have zero duped weapons and wouldn't take one if given. I actually like the game so playing it isnt a big deal.
---
Nice try.
---
I‚Äôve never duped flux.  But most flux in game is duped.
---
Keep up your MAGA efforts.
---
Yes, if you have ever traded for anything, ever in this game. You have benefited from duping.  Maybe not every time, but at least 50% (give or take my experience from playing from day one).
---
They did a mass suspension/ban with regards to the recent duping.  
---
Some people are staying it's temporary pending an investigation, some are saying it's permanent, some are claiming they did the community a favour by duping items and some are saying they did nothing at all.  
---
It's pretty much all the chatter on here right now, so you'll be able to get caught up pretty quick if you try.
---
As someone else has mentioned, someone linked your account to their steam account, which gives them unfettered access and overrides your password changes
---
Its there own fault with there shitty code
---
Good luck.
---
I guess I‚Äôm setting up shop near 76 then I must teach the newbies of our past mistakes and how not to repeat them
---
Before 120 most my enemies were lvl 50-68
---
After 120 they average 80-91
---
Might be that shift
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs bad, they really fucked up now lmao, one possibility is that they‚Äôre just banning to take out duped weapons and then putting the accounts back active but I doubt that
---
Because the last 20+ large patches haven‚Äôt either
---
Jesus that‚Äôs rough
---
Dupers love living in the edge
---
I'm on a full server on PS4, weird
---
Literally not possible.
---
None of them honestly, i said at the start my point was that people who unintentionally got a duped item shouldnt be permabanned. Everything thus far has just been me and you discussing semantics regarding that statement. I am not disagreeing with you that dupers should be banned. I am saying people who got caught up in a dupers circle unintentionally should not be banned but that was not clarified til you broke it down.
---
sounds like you need better gear.. also adrenaline is currently broken if you use that perk..
---
also sounds like your build could probably use a little punching up from your desription
---
I have a bloodied which I'll use. People talk about swimming in 40mm but I funnel it from four other toons and still can't get enough.
---
They have crazy range, it's fun it just watch it arch in vats and boom, 1sk.
---
I keep it on me for that event too, but only when solo or if there‚Äôs like 10 people. If there‚Äôs only a few people  it one shots most of the mobs which is a bit shitty to do to people, and if there‚Äôs loads of players there, someone else will just do it instead so then it‚Äôs every man for himself-and a bloodied AGL means winning that fight mostly üòÅ 
---
I used it once with confetti mess and there was just bodies and colours flying everywhere. It was the most I‚Äôd laughed at the game in a while.
---
From what I‚Äôm seeing PS4 was hit very hard
---
I know, I wasn‚Äôt doing it for greed, just trying to help people out. I had a great time too, i was able to get my dream weapon I‚Äôve been trying to get since December of 2018, the BE plasma. It is what it is now.
---
What do you use?
---
That would make sense if I had ever been able to loot the ore in the first place. Done the event many times, never been able to loot any of the ore deposits.
---
You have, or you \*had\* 8.3 million acid?
---
How else can you fall?
---
Wait. Didn‚Äôt you originally say, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have accepted the random players generous offer‚Äù
---
Which one was it ? Vendor or random player offer?
---
I can guarantee nothing I own was duped.
---
Absolutely, but that goes for all cheating, including exploiting bugs. Unfortunately I've seen far too many people respond with "well there shouldn't be bugs then".
---
Pushing towards level 300 myself and I only feel more and more overpowered the longer I play and the more I tune my build with good gear etc.
---
I'd look into your perks, if you are having a hard time surviving, there are probably a few changes you can make to help your survivability immensely.
---
Yeah thats true it kinda killed the trading systeme but i mean it happened before thats why most of the legacys are still existing so i am not really sure
---
It's still a risk. People who bought a month lost that month, people who bought a year lost that year. The only money they can still safely regain is a recurring monthly subscription. They can try a chargeback, but it is fraud, so they're basically just rolling the dice with whether anybody involved will care enough to push back over such a small sum
---
Her flying around 500 yards out of range for 5 minutes straight ***is*** considered fun for you?
---
And I was wondering why my friend was panicking about finding a legacy on the ground
---
Hoping one day I can reach this point so I can sleep easy at night knowing I'll never need to do another goddamn daily.
---
there has been speculation they dont want people to pay for ranks because they are trying to figure out how/if they should compensate players for the score glitch..
---
advancing all players a set number of spaces on the board is the popular frontrunner.. but its all just guesswork at this time
---
I feel this way too. Even come across folks that talk so casually about all there mr fuzzy tokens and ammo that their "friends" duped yadda yadda. I'm just over here full health with my Furious rifle hoping for more boss fights or a hoard dungeon.
---
Update for what?
---
That's a great tip. I don't usually need to worry about getting more rads but it can't hurt to use diluted as I find them, then.
---
I agree that being followed around and harassed is shitty. That shouldn't happen. I'm one of those players that just wants a few rounds of PVP and then will usually leave you be at your workshop with a GG, win or lose. Personally though, when I have a low level character I would be glad to fight a group of high levels. To each their own. There's very little to lose in adventure PVP. Understand that outside of a private server there's nothing passive about owning a workshop though. You've claimed resources that someone else may be willing to fight for. Defend it or not, that's your choice and the risk you're taking with workshops.
---
Also, man, I hate Grafton Steel. There are just so many SMs and it takes forever to hunt them all down to claim the workshop. However I'll almost always try to contest it if I see it owned with someone there because it's an awesome location for PVP.
---
I'll admit that having 1st changed my PVP habits significantly. It's a lot easier to be sure your junk is always stashed before getting into a scrum, and after six months or whatever I've got mountains of scrap on all my characters. I just started up a new account with game pass (I'm on PS4 mainly, ~2600 hours) and have no intention of buying 1st there, and I'm already feeling the resource crunch at just level 5. My stash is already pretty full and I'm having flashbacks to the plastic hoarding days so I can bulk and sell the excess. That said, when you're in a workshop you own there's no excuse for having junk on you unless you're on your way to the stash box.
---
You are with a large group of survivors us here in the uk we got wiped out by Todd
---
I've been looking for him as well
---
It‚Äôs okay that you feel burned out, I agree they need more useful/meaningful legendary prefixes but at the same time that doesn‚Äôt give validation to cheating. Bloodied/junkies is overrated imo because everyone is in this mentality where if it‚Äôs not the absolute best then it‚Äôs the worst and that‚Äôs just not true at all..Especially when you can solo the sbq without any legendary gear at all. Furious/anti armor/ two shot are still really good prefixes even suppressor can be good if you have faster fire rate on it but everyone makes it seem like you have to use bloodied or junkies to be relevant which isn‚Äôt true.
---
I have seen so many people have that exact weapon. Hard to say if any of them are legit
---
yea i just got it, someone launched a nuke
---
You put way too much faith in other people.
---
Most people probably don't figure that out right away.
---
Got some kid a little higher up who doesn't think real money trading will get you banned.
---
People are just not very bright.
---
All systems were, seen it on a few discords.  PC doesn‚Äôt seem to be as bad though which is ironic because they‚Äôve been duping, hacking, creating 12 star legendaries etc hahaha
---
Hopped through a few servers and it's pretty barren currently.
---
yah that makes sense but I am giving the benefit of the doubt to some of the people banned who actually didnt do anything  and I am also factoring in bethesdas previous ban history as well. I dont think people who didnt know and bought duped items should be banned and i dont think anything warrants the hate they are receiving. Dupers have little to no affect on the vast majority of players, but still should be banned.
---
Oh that‚Äôs bad man I‚Äôm out here wondering if me with my legit legacy rifle mean I‚Äôm gonna get hit
---
I remove my demo expert perk and it only takes off about half of their hp, if I fire one grenade in the right spot it tags all the spawns and I let everyone else clean them up. I wouldn't do it if I was insta killing them, thats for sure.   
---
Also, confetti mess is so good with the AGL, I had bodies hitting the roof of fort defiance, by the end of the event there was confetti all over the roof.
---
Just enter your User, Password and credit card info here and i'll happily play on your behalf :-)
---
Lets say $1.50 per level, assuming you're a typical whale that'll be 95 levels, so lets go with $142.50 USD
---
^/s ^plz ^no ^ban ^mods
---
EDIT: just to add, u/RF_huntr above me has a much more serious answer that I agree is likely the situation
---
I got an email saying it was a temp suspension pending investigation 
---
I wonder if there‚Äôs a difference between ban emails and suspension emails
---
Yeah it wasnt even easy to get good gear in this game to get to a normal bffr+ agi hm i needed about 1 month pure trading in f76 and legy grind
---
Im just north west of 76 have over 200 plans for mounted heads at 200 caps each, purified water at 15 caps
---
Xbox put 76 up as a game pass game, the new meat is spending their early caps on my crap left and right. I bought a x01 jetpack plan yesterday, hardly use power armor.
---
I'm about to go check there now
---
Yep pretty much PS4 uk servers are literally a wasteland
---
They haven't fixed the infamous Deathloop glitch yet, and it's been a year or so.
---
Ditto. Head shot out of VATS usually works, thankfully, but it's annoying af
---
Yup but it's delayed 
---
Most likely because they're working on trying to figure out a way to fix or reimburse players who had their challenges auto completed
---
Forget I said anything. I can already see this is pointless.
---
Might be a good time to see what's changed in Destiny eh
---
I live in fear of picking up or buying a duped item ... 
---
Not knowing how they decide who to ban, I've just avoiding direct player trades altogether.  Wish they would be more upfront about the rules.
---
Thats for them to figure out and the player base to critique. They shouldnt have had a mass temp ban wave then go ghost on support right after
---
My mom is going to be so happy I‚Äôm getting a deal like this! Brb let me grab her card!
---
/s
---
I recently traded for a b2525 fixer, b2525 handmade, be laser, be gat plas, je gat plas, je laser, be cryo and more and I am not banned.
---
Probably get delayed
---
That‚Äôs seems cool ! I‚Äôve been helping my new friend on PS4 but since most of our pubs are just us and one other guy it‚Äôs strange
---
You can only get 1400/day.  I often get that just with food and water.  It's a good day when I can also get rid of some of the 600+ stimpacks or radaway clogging up my inventory.
---
lol the grenade launcher is hilarious in VATS, I can fire at a target with 95% hit rate at like 10 metres and the grenades seem to go out of existence before just appearing on the head of the enemy and exploding. Other times if there is a ghoul or something sprinting from left to right, its funny to watch the grenades curve through the air, kinda like the homing briefcase bug from Hitman  hahaha.
---
The worst that will happen is Beth will remove them at some point.
---
Why not? I only play on private servers anyways, doesn‚Äôt affect anyone‚Äôs gameplay on there.  Save the preaching, I don‚Äôt care if they permanently ban me.
---
Dang I‚Äôm sorry man
---
just added you! i guess we'll see! haha
---
This is mostly true, but they do ban some people who pick up suspicious items/quantities as well. Idk what exactly they use for their tracking, but surely consistency is somehow involved. Many people active in the trade subs are getting banned, which makes sense because almost everything sold there is duped. Far fewer people are reporting getting banned for buying a few high tier items from vending machines. I'm pretty sure it has to be something based on recent item acquisition though, my main is fine with 80+ weapons on me, including some god tiers and multiple NW weapons I obtained a long time ago. Even got 4 of the NW lasers blood eagles dropped early on. People are reporting getting banned for duping less than that, so they must be evaluating that those items were acquired recently and in questionable ways
---
I have tripped over a flat surface before so it‚Äôs not that hard
---
I see your point but I still think it‚Äôs wrong but also it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs confusing
---
If Bethesda let‚Äôs dupe after dupe get out then isn‚Äôt it just a game mechanic at this point lol
---
Yes, especially on a fast moving enemy. Freaking homing misses.
---
Fun weapon, wish it didn't break so fast.
---
The gold that was refined pre war
---
And it used to be even worse... can't build here, there's a twig in the way!
---
I got suspended and I did duped like 40 guns. No xp stack
---
I duped a few times but I didn't keep any copies. I'm not surprised at all. I'm under investigation and kinda interested to see what happens.
---
I duped a few times, got some new toys to play with so I can actually enjoy the game for once, did a giveaway on the market and copied some OP shiz for people having a hard time, or for people who have helped me.
---
I legit traded a BE25 fixer for a B3390 hunting rifle lmao. I got the things I wanted and started giving guns to noobs since I have nothing better to do.
---
It was worth it. I made someones day and helped out  others. Screw the economy, let everyome have fun, that's what they bought the game for and deserve.
---
Although the bans are deserved, it's funny how many people didn't expect it or are trying to lie about their circumstances. I duped out of kindness and boredom, I'm almost level 400 and have little to enjoy, I own my suspension, but shame on those who got too greedy and selfish.
---
Now I've made some people have a good time I can go about my day, maybe finish up on RDR2. I hope yall enjoy the madness:')
---
Idek, these bots have been pretty wack, I had like one of each laser and plasma and got hit
---
Anyone else missing the garage door?
---
I haven‚Äôt had it drop yet, and I do the bos pretty much everyday
---
Wuz ist an doop? o.o
---
you get to keep all the free FO1st stuff after ur sub runs out
---
He just wanted to rant.
---
Instigating Hunting rifles, Furious levers and handmades.. Non-Explosive...
---
I'm at a point that this doesn't mean much to me. Congratulations, a couple players were banned who will most likely come back and do it again. It's the vicious cycle of MMO life. But I do have to say, as a long time player, I'm bothered by the artificial inflation high level long term players have induced on legendary items and plans. In the past year or two since 76 was released, I've watched prices hike higher and higher that locks out the majority of players except heavy duty grinders and players.
---
The fact that so many players took part in the duping is a pretty obvious symptom of what the community's obsessive inflation of prices has done to the player to player economy.
---
Edit: Before some hypersensitive clown jumps down my throat; no, I am not defending duping. My point is that it's absurd that the community and Bethesda would rather treat the symptoms than the actual disease. As long as players keep inflation high, you're helping in your own way perpetuate the duping.
---
Instead of arresting me for stealing that bike, you should fix the fact that i was able to steal it lol
---
Player since day one here. I have never traded, I don‚Äôt trust it. Farmed and/or crafted everything I have. Bold of you to assume everyone is cheating when that is not the case.
---
This is what people dont understand, people dupe cause bethesda has god fucking awful RNG, probably the worst RNG ever in a videogame, its on the predatory level of that of slot machine in a casino and in all honesty I feel like your chances are better on slot machine than getting even close to the roll you want. The drops and the purveyor and designed after "GOCHA" game mechanics, if you dont know what those are look it up, and bethesda will NEVER charge actual money for legendary rolls because in most countries its now becoming illegal, in the US gocha games are still legal and you see em mainly in mobile gamea.
---
I agree, make up your mind and stay with it. I would never dupe, but I feel like duping stabilizes an unbalanced economy for weapons/armor that relies on 4 levels of RNG (7 if you count 3 star legendaries and not just the legendary seller). I did a more detailed comment you could find in my post history
---
Bullion is real gold but gold you dug out of the ground and melted into a bar or coin isn't bullion because it's not certified in purity.
---
The reason anyone can mine bitcoin is because the certification process is actually what people call "mining" it.
---
Nah I think it revived the economy. There was a surplus of things people actually wanted. And enough of those things to make caps actually worth something again. Finally you could buy a fixer for 25k caps instead of waiting months to roll one or roll a bloodied 25 reload speed 25 vats point cost hand made to trade for it. 
---
Made the economy boom. There wasnt a big enough cap sink before the dupe
---
That‚Äôs nasty tho I‚Äôm dropping that legacy straightaway I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs good I care about my account right now
---
Ever since I signed up for fallout first I‚Äôve almost exclusively played on private servers aside from going shopping when I am close to max caps. 
---
FYI wasn‚Äôt directly mentioning you on the preaching comment, mostly the large group of people that are like ‚Äòbut you ruins mah game!‚Äô Like I said, don‚Äôt care.  Why would I pay for private servers and not use them
---
I think so, but possibly not unless you "initiate" PvP. Can't be done while on a team. It used to be that anyone could just walk up and kill your pet, but I pretty much haven't left pacifist for the last three patches.
---
If you're stuck with a pet you don't want and can't seem to get rid of it try and tame something else. If you really don't want *any* pet tame from far away from your camp and follow it until it gets killed by something.
---
Nobody told me how to duplicate items and I don't bother looking for it either
---
Your amount of perception doesnt matter. Keep choosing a point for whatever and whatever other card you'd like until it appears. You probably have a bunch of levels stored up, which causes this.
---
We can blame people that dupe, and that is dishonest so it is a valid complaint. But haven't people been duping since the game began? Is this an unfixable bug? Or is it just another thing that Bethesda doesn't care about because they know you'll play it anyway?
---
Entitled for me to expect a game I payed for and continue to pay for through fo1st to work properly? I get hiccups here and there are to be expected but to have multiple crashes\freezes a day, glitched NPCs and for them to have events that get so laggy that you literally sit there and have to wait for the game to catch up? Consider me entitled then.
---
Also, it was a joke. To think they'd do anything of the sort is absurd given their track record from launch.
---
This won't help. Based on previous incidents, they tend to track your item acquisition, and many times in the past people have reported getting banned even after dropping cheated items. If you already took them, you're already flagged
---
Haven‚Äôt played it but may take a gander at it
---
Beginning of Aug.
---
Yeah or have a friend hold it that doesn‚Äôt care about their account
---
yawn go roleplay robinhood somewhere else. Don't like the game? It's just an expensive toy so stop playing it lol.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm fully specced for heavy guns but no demo. Being bloodied obviously is what makes it more potent so I only use it the circumstances above for that event. 
---
Otherwise I‚Äôm either punching things of using it everywhere else üòÅ
---
Confetti mess is  just a delight isn‚Äôt it. Especially with explosives. I‚Äôd love it as a perk card.
---
That‚Äôs because today all the kids who insist on playing the game the ‚Äúright‚Äù way by not duping and paying for fo1st get mad that duper‚Äôs have more fun. Because instead of waiting for daddy Todd to release that one magical patch that will make fo76 perfect, the duping community decided to accept the game is and will forever be broken so let‚Äôs make the best of it. 
---
IMO dupers provide a service that makes the game    fun and actually tolerable vs just a fucking unnecessary lengthy grindy struggle fest in which your god tier legendary might get stolen or disappear next patch because all the devs maintaining this game are inept, don‚Äôt play the game, or both.
---
Probably means update 21
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with it. It‚Äôs about time that those involved with and associated with duping got a wake up call. 
---
And the apologists and rationalists trying to justify and complain about it are amusing. 
---
If someone states they had ***absolutely nothing*** to do with any duping or ToS violations and they got banned, then I‚Äôd support them. 
---
But I‚Äôve yet to see anyone reporting being banned that outright claims they never did anything at all at any time that violated the ToS.
---
Those individuals should contact Bethesda and insist their situation be reviewed. 
---
For the rest of them, that were involved and didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd ever get in trouble?
---
**Too.  Damn.  Bad**
---
I thought I was the only one.. I don‚Äôt even know how! And I don‚Äôt play enough each day to care, I do my asylum runs get my scrip get off. Maybe sell some stuff in my vendor but nothing else
---
And screws/ballistic fiber. I've spent more time picking up plastic pumpkins at Morgantown High School than I have at camp. I'm sick of Fort Defiance and Sugar Grove at this point, haha.
---
Totally agree, survival was trash.  I miss the early days when I could see how high I could get my bounty because everyone was thirsty for those caps, even the non pvp crowd
---
If you fire at 95% chance and miss don't waste your time firing any more. Exit and reenter vats and you will hit.
---
All you need to know really is that they‚Äôre a lot of legacy‚Äôs and god rolls out rn that are worth 30k caps
---
I'm fundamentally apathetic to it, by and large because outside of a like two instances I can think of, duping has never effected my experience to my knowledge.
---
I don't buy anything from other players outside of the challenge that demands it, and that's usually just whatever's the cheapest at the first shop I go to.
---
Part of my fun is searching for new guns to try. Someday Murmur'll give me a minigun. Someday...
---
I get what you were saying no worries I don‚Äôt like those preachers either but also the law must be upholded
---
I am on PC, how much are you selling it for? because I don't have much caps on me.
---
Speaking of holding onto 40mm rounds, I make a bunch, just because they're so fun, but its also made me use the ammo machine to trade in ammo i dont want/need for grenades, its not the greatest conversion rate, but its probably better swapping points for 5 40mm grenades than 12 .45 rounds which is what I was doing before
---
If you aren't lying for muh sympathy or some crap then contact support with evidence. Of course you could also reply to my reddit comment saying that's pointless but then that wouldn't help you get your account back.
---
Dropping is safer don‚Äôt want my friend to get banned for a gun
---
Lunchbox effect
---
I like the idea.
---
Alright, understandable, the ban wave of today has passed tho so you might be safe
---
Yep I used to be a bounty hunter with my level 5 50 cal hunting man I loved that gun
---
yah man im wit that, would also like to clarify, i was not banned lmao but im holdin out for the what if. You probably right most banned ppl were involved but those people who just got in the way of the hammer dont deserve the hate or the ban.
---
Ahh, possibly.
---
Non of this answers when exactly we will be able to rank up. It's almost July 15th and the rank up option is still unavailable to use on the score board. If they didn't mean July 14th then they should of said that date.
---
I‚Äôm just really looking forward to that SS Ghille Armor + Backpack. Thanks for responding so quickly and giving a thought out response. Hopefully this answers the question for other people as well
---
Hey all few questions:
---
1.) How can you tell if an item is duped when you either buy it from a vendor, trade it through the ingame interaction or if your brave enough to use discord/ebay and the like to purchase those items
---
2.) If a duped item is bought or traded for, whether or not the person buying it was aware at the time, would they also get banned by Bethesda
---
3.) I was planning on buying a cheap copy of fallout 76 to put on my gaming laptop i use for university so that i can have two seperate accounts and use the second as storage and scrip farming, is this an acceptable thing to do or is it something that could either get me banned or given shit for by the community as a whole
---
4.) Do any players and/or vendors have any chance of having a legacy two shot explosive dragon as i made a post about it earlier and one person said they saw the supernatant npc vendor selling one, just wanted to clarify so i can keep everything as well researched as possible
---
I have got my Eye on you.
---
Still I‚Äôm gonna play it safe
---
Not too sure why your comment is being downvoted. Its completely unfair that Bethesda allowed older players to keep their legacy weapons whilst newer players don't have anyway to legitimately obtain them. If you don't give people legimate avenues to obtain something that other players get to have then its unfair and people will eventually use cheats or whatever means they see fit to obtain said items. Legacies should have been completely removed from peoples inventories when Bethesda decided to remove them from the spawn pool. Why should certain players get access to  legacies while others can't?
---
At the same time, if they put maybe 10% more effort into coding this and other things wouldn‚Äôt be a problem lol
---
I just use it for my plasma flamer TBH.
---
Copper and plastic are a bitch sometimes.
---
Yeah, I'll be the only one in a group turning down free handouts from kids who duped. I've been enjoying the mass amounts of content which seems endless. I feel like Im playing Fall out 3 but now I can play with people and customize my hideouts. Game pass is going to help this game a lot now that it can be tried out before buying. The reviews I read online while installing made me feel like I was about to regret it.
---
Appalachia isn't a wasteland.  There isn't enough radiation to be detectable, hell, most of the gold is in zero radiation areas.
---
The answer is much simpler.  There isn't enough gold in Appalachia to make a bar.  People don't realize how rare it is.
---
Yep but this game is fallout 4s code with some flashy skins
---
Lmao but these people are douche bags they did it for greed
---
How could you tell if its a duped item? Legit question.
---
it unlocks at lvl 40 
---
unless you have been holding levels since prior to lvl 40 it should show in the perception perks when you sroll to them.. as long as you have a point to spend
---
you cant see cards you have not already picked or received in a pack unless youre spending a level
---
Thats a somewhat new idea so now that there are no items with signifficant more or less value it has a good impact on the economy
---
It was the greatest weekend in the history of the game.  That was my end game and I‚Äôm ok with it lol. Would do it all over again too.
---
Free! I don't really need caps or gear, and I'm not 100% on that third effect. I might be mixing it up with another gun. But the first two are for sure. Add me, my IGN is the same as here, I'll hop on right now.
---
Edit: just checked and the third effect is faster movement while aiming, so...it's basically a two-star.
---
Next time you level up... just select the card?
---
Do you have levels saved up?
---
So they can implement intricate item tracking but they can‚Äôt fix simple coding flaws that cause most of the issues? Sounds like a statement made to avoid backlash.
---
Yeah it is.
---
no, they ruins my fun I have un this game that I paid full price.  
---
I would rather see the dupers getting banned. its not a single player game, they are affecting others. its not our faults   
---
if you guys are so bad at games that you have to cheat to get to us
---
Probably the Fixer, its fotm.
---
Just because it's a prior for you doesn't mean it is for them.
---
Oh! I didn‚Äôt see the chickens. I need to look again
---
A lot of us in the states...used private servers of our UK friends to...come up with extra items because of the lag üòÇ
---
A player messaged me saying to check the Charleston vendor. That‚Äôs why I said I shouldn‚Äôt have accepted the offer and that I got it basically for nothing.
---
Anyone know how to fix him bugging out? Like when someone dies right after grabbing a pylon or something similar and he‚Äôs perma invisible/invincible for the rest of the timer.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a permanent event, as far as I know. Nothing they‚Äôve communicated has indicated it would be temporary. It‚Äôs also now using instancing tech and has been pushed back for further testing. so I doubt they‚Äôd go that far for a temporary thing. 
---
Even in its first iteration on the PTS it seemed to run fine. If it was just temporary I doubt they‚Äôd be looking so closely.
---
Those fixes weren't happening anyway, they've had months, and support is just locking tickets!
---
Agreed!
---
&gt; They ban people who ... pick up hacked items.
---
How would we even know if it were a hacked item or not? That seems extremely unfair.
---
Curious while we're on the topic of cheating, I've also seen a heck of a lot of weird things out there and I'm curious if they're known hacks or just glitches that happen to have shown up?
---
For example, I've seen people jump so high they could pretty much jump half a city block, often I've seen it straight in the air, equivalent to jumping like 8 stories high, definitely not just a marsupial perk or anything. I've seen this at least half a dozen times or more (was really prevalent during Faschnaut).
---
I've also seen those with such ridiculously high DPS they've taken down a Scorchqueen in about 2 seconds flat. I mean I may not have bloodied weapons yet but I can't imagine it'll be so much more powerful it's the equivalent of 20+ people. That's the most extreme example but I've seen several instances of very powerful weapons that one-shot pretty much any high-level monster other than something like a scorchqueen (take down a legendary scorchbeast with maybe 2-3 shots). Don't know if that's just an insane build or if that's likely some sort of hack?
---
Playing on PS4. And while the jumping one doesn't directly affect me (more just curious if I'm missing something), the ridiculously overpowered weapons do as they can take down legendaries before I can even get more than a shot in so I can attempt to earn a legendary weapon as well.
---
Yeah I finally started trading for caps again instead of trading gun for gun. It was cool
---
yah but u gotta learn it
---
I‚Äôm just gonna say, the vast majority of players wouldn‚Äôt have end game gear if it wasn‚Äôt for dupers. Bethesda‚Äôs drop rates for specific rolls are insanely bad. The amount of RNG in this game is enough to make the lottery seem realistic in comparison (slight exaggeration, depending on which item you‚Äôre RNG-ing) 
---
You can act like it‚Äôs a moral victory for you that these ‚Äúbad‚Äù people got banned for doing what essentially made the game more enjoyable for a vast majority of people.
---
Oh no! Your gun is worth less than before... ok. Is it really that bad? I just don‚Äôt understand why everyone treats dupers like they‚Äôre awful. Why don‚Äôt you complain about the hacked weapons or the fact they‚Äôre about to turn a year old now? What about the griefers? Or the Nuclear Winter hackers? No, just the dupers who 100% are the reason people can have nice things.
---
I also wanna add that the majority of these players will be returning in a few weeks or a month. The note even stated that only ‚Äúegregious‚Äù offenders would be permanently banned. All others are temporarily suspended. Most of those will get a strike, maybe a character or two deleted if they were holding duped items, and then released again. Any of the serious offenders would‚Äôve used alts to do the dupe in the first place, so they haven‚Äôt gone anywhere. The people affected here are mostly people‚Äôs first or second attempts, and they‚Äôre the ones crying the loudest. People who haven‚Äôt done much and didn‚Äôt know better than to take precautions. You‚Äôre not gonna hear complaining from serious offenders because they‚Äôll be on another account waiting for the next dupe to hit
---
12 star?! I want to know everything lol
---
If they're all dupers, who would they be selling to? All stores have everything and nobody buying. It's pretty much the perfect break the economy punishment :)
---
Look under walls, try to find the atom symbol. It's somewhere in the middle.
---
Legacy‚Äôs?
---
I had the same issue so I made like 30 scrapped them all at once eventually it gave me the two mods I was missing
---
Ummmmm.... this got uncomfortable. I was trying to support you dude
---
I didn't dupe but i'm with you. After you finish the story there is only grind and boring stuff left.
---
Per my other reply where someone suggested this.
---
Your gold scrap is for completing circuitry.
---
Given the amount of gold in a large circuit board, the amount of gold needed in a fallout recipe, and the weight of a bullion bar...
---
It's 420,000 gold scrap per bar.
---
Get collecting.
---
Yup just a month of grinding
---
&gt; A guy on Xbox has about 200,000,000 presents.
---
Well, _had_, probably.
---
You dont have good guns legitimately at level 200 ? What kind of gun are you entitled to?
---
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5513501/
---
Where you finding lvl 80s??
---
same. i‚Äôm in a few group chats of various folks and all of them are exploding with panic and figuring out alt accounts and i‚Äôm just like üëÄ ‚Äúcan‚Äôt relate‚Äù lmao
---
Bubblegum spawns in facshnot bot  as well as 3 spawns in flatwoods
---
I started extracting copper and now I have so much of it.
---
Yea just explosive weapons you can‚Äôt get anymore unless you got them before the update that wouldn‚Äôt let you get them as a perk
---
God roll guns used to be valued at 5-8k caps in the early days even before the first dupe, charging more than max caps or worse asking for almost their entire inventory was just the greed of the robber barons running the trading communities!
---
&gt; carry Inert Flux instead which weighs 0.2 instead of Purified Water (which weighs 0.5)
---
What the hell... I'm 176 and haven't been doing this. Learn something new every day.
---
The item will have something majorly wrong with it. Super huge damage, durability, other weapon parts on that weapon (like gamma Gun on a minigun). Legendary perks that aren't allowed on that item like PA with Legendary stats.
---
At this point only way to save the game is full inventory wipes of everyone
---
Someone didn't get a legacy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Same here. Never once cared about having some legacy weapon. I‚Äôve been running over 100 levels worth the same fire axe 3 star legendary. Instigating, 40% more damage with power attacks, +1 strength 
---
Make tons of cap trading, but never over legendaries. Always ammo, junk, food, plans that aren‚Äôt mounted heads. 
---
Generally  twice a week I need to go spend large amounts of caps cause I got up to 28-29,000 caps.
---
Tse weapons?
---
The suspension means that your acc is kept by bethesda until they can investigate it and after they investigate it they will ban you or will not ban you
---
I like how when people complain about scrap bots and stuff like that everyone yells about how it's not a competition so there is nothing wrong with it, yet when people dupe everyone screams about how they deserve it and they ruin the experience for everyone for not playing the game like the rest of us.
---
Before "You must be a duper" comments, no I am not. I just find the hypocrisy funny. Now watch people make up excuses.
---
Found him! Thanks for making that so dang simple lol
---
Support are locking EVERY ticket that even mentions score, or dailies!
---
Now for the Nuclear Winter cheaters...
---
Even heard they had a Discord where they call their scripts ‚Äúskill‚Äù.
---
Least they don‚Äôt go to the sky. Still, they need to go.
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Any tbh but yea mostly tse, AAE, and BE and even rare outfits
---
Edit: even DE
---
It would suck and if they did that they would lose a majority of players, but there also banning people for no reason
---
Ya
---
You keep all of the cosmetics, and lose the scrap box and tent.
---
Wait, Action Boy is broken?  In what way?
---
How do people find these things out!?
---
Thansk
---
People were able to hack the code and come up with some wild shit like a powered cavalier sentinel assassin WEDDING RING.  Yes the stuff got pulled, but there was some really creative things haha.  Saw a 12 star handmade too LOL
---
I think I might have a F25 Fixer somewhere. I‚Äôd have to check though. I do usually hold onto a few instigating items since they‚Äôre very fun to play with
---
I definitely have a F2590 10mm sub that I‚Äôm never gonna use again
---
You do realize that the market is fucked up that you probably have a duped weapon from one of previous dupes
---
Why isn't this online multi player game an MMO?
---
What do you play on?
---
Fair point. I'll ride that karma coaster with you.
---
I think he kicked the bucket.
---
If it also says 4:8:2000 it‚Äôs a ban, check your email, try to appeal, and hope for the best
---
Im on the eastern "shore" Directly west of that blood eagle camp and along the road.I moved there because lord being near the whitesprings station is nice but if your camp is in the way of someone elses they get the biggest stick up their ass about it.
---
And fallout four was basically fallout 3‚Äôs code with slightly better graphics and the same amount of blue screens and crashes haha
---
If you find grass pushing up through try placing and relogging and usually the remaining grass will go away.
---
Been hearing even if you not a duper and have a dupe item in your inventory your still banned
---
love your username haha
---
Thing is, if you don't know what's normal for that sort of weapon, how would you know what to look for?  In FO4, I had a minigun with plasma effect, and there's a radium rifle, so why would it immediately seem like a red flag to me that there are weapons with other effects?
---
And I though PA had legendaries now, isn't that what the Legendary Modules are for?
---
Yeah, getting one shot in PVP, getting outdamaged in endgame events faster than I can qualify for rewards, and watching a dude steamroll content I've been trying to do legitimately for the last 3 hours and STILL have to pay 30k caps for a weapon or armour I want if I don't just grind it myself sure is fun and tolerable.
---
Welcome to the League of Thoroughly Average Gentlepeople.
---
I see your one handed melee and raise! Pure Gunslinger VATS! I'm *practically* useless. 
---
Now meet my bow build with backup shishkebab!
---
I die a lot.
---
Lmao
---
Alright I'll hop on now, thank you.
---
I suppose it is different for someone who is familiar with fallout in general. This is her first fallout experience, and she has never played shooters either, so combat is not her strong suit. Granted, there is no way another player could know this before attacking, so I cannot really blame them for fighting a "new to fallout in general" player.
---
You make a good point about the store things asap policy, and I suppose I hold some of the blame there as i told her to make the crafting station and fix her equipment first. 
---
Also, grafton steel is an awesome pvp zone. I used to hate how often it would get contested because it was always such a chore to go back and protect it, but I've come to appreciate the diversity of the area and the unique combat experience that comes with it. I do with the zone covered more of the actual building though, so that would be included as well. But yes, hunting the muties is a long process sometimes
---
What if i dont have access to my email, am I just Thanos Snapped by Todd?
---
For those very few?  Yes, it‚Äôs unfortunate.
---
You dont need to completely respec. Run PA with emergency protocol, stabilize, and nerd rage and you'll fine. Even just moving 2 points to strength and get the first rank for 2 heavy gunner perks and you'll be good.
---
All this has done is proven they can fix whatever bugs they want in record time, they just only Prioritise ones that help players and ignore ones that hinder us for months or years on end!
---
I could not access it yesterday.
---
I apparently signed up through Microsoft so I had to login there and cancel the reoccurring payment.
---
I went to Bethesda and had no subscription listed under the manage tab.
---
thats not what your wife said
---
nah im just messing with ya man
---
The weapon economy is pretty toast
---
First time, 2 auto complete weekly challenges. It's supposed to be because i logged in a NW world before an adventure one. That doesn't make any sense, but i did exactly that. Log in an adventure world first just in case.
---
and 2 answer your question yea u can still use a melee build but it‚Äôs mostly stealth rifle/commando that‚Äôs op and idk best heavy 2 handed melee but ima day BFSS+S on that battle axe (idk how to spell it)
---
I've come across camps selling alot of plans cheap and I bought the sitting gorilla,  scorchbeaat queen head etc...
---
Will they come after me if I bought a duped plan?
---
Why I am scared to move no idea if this will have my base saved or not
---
&gt; Well I did use the carryweight glitch back at the beginning
---
I completely unintentionally was hit with that carryweight glitch a few times back at the beginning, was terrified for months Beth would think I had done it on purpose!
---
Yeah, it‚Äôll be active Soon^TM
---
Did Bethesda drop the news? I could not see it on Bethesda twitter.
---
Submit a ticket on BethNet with as much info as you can give them
---
 I'm loving the score system! It plays to my character's strength.  I played two days so far this season and I'm at rank 33 already.
---
Yeah I get that but it‚Äôs the best way to fix the game if they want to keep it going for the next few years. Yes people will leave but people will join the fun because of all this people leaving
---
I checked all of my emails and haven‚Äôt received anything. Well I guess they just lost two fo1st accounts as me and my fianc√© have played this daily since launch.
---
Grognak axe?
---
Yeah its a skin, its a semi rare plan from riding shotgun. Its not too hard to get though as you can easily server hop and grind the event dozens of times a day if you want.
---
You have to do it through the microsoft website. Log into your account on there and check your subscriptions.
---
You're savage and *I like it.*
---
Aye. Since then i've concluded it saves half points and quarter points and stuff and then adds or subtracts when it has a full one. 
---
It's why i get  +4 INT when everything else gets +3
---
This is a problem why?
---
Yea
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 but saw the stuff from a PC guy.  It was something like AA/Bloodied/Junkies/Explosive/Faster Fire Rate/VATS Crit fill/Less VATS cost/VATS chance/VATS 50%/DR while reloading
---
Have fun repairing your decontamination shower after running a few of those.
---
I guess they just destroyed the game on there own
---
And sorry what does bfss+s mean
---
Alright, good thing tho man, this whole situation is dumb
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve met a concise sentence I couldn‚Äôt help but make convoluted ;)
---
You are wrong, I am already here...

https://bethesda.net/community/topic/419343/rank-up-purchases-postponed-july-14-2020?language%5B%5D=en
---
Hi everyone,
---
The ability to rank up using Atoms during The Legendary Run was planned to begin today, but we are delaying this feature for the moment. We apologize for the inconvenience and should have more info for you in the coming days.
---
In the meantime, we've added a¬†couple of bonus Daily Challenges for a total of 9 each day this week, until July 20. So we hope you're able to pick up a little extra S.C.O.R.E. along the way this week.
---
How dare you claim the B/25/25 Fixer I got for 10k was duped. Eat ionized meat, dingbat.
---
Is it possible to upload an image?
---
Well if you are a high dps player just stand up shoot her to get her attention before sneaking and move out in the open. It never failed me. Less I'm using my melee character, but then again when she first lands it's over in seconds with several melee character. But if XP is the only reason then I guess it's a good thing.
---
Random event. There‚Äôs a few towns that you‚Äôll see them in.
---
Lmao, but why would you need a economy anymoreü§î
---
If you have egg head mutation strange in numbers gives you another 2 int for 9 total extra int for being on a team
---
Bloodied faster swing speed + strength but that‚Äôs the best roll for any melee
---
where have you been?
---
Well darn I guess my BE15 Fixer from the purveyor is trash
---
why do u even bother ,theyre casuals who dont even understand that this game is pure RNG and u ll never get decent gun like handmade explosive even  in your 500h gameplay. Duppers are the only thing that keeps this ULTIMATE RNG on leash. Casuals shouldnt even bat an eye on duppers. Theyre only helping them. The only reason why bethesda cant keep duppers here cuz theyre makin real money for their pathetic RNG
---
So true lol... they probably think that someone was sooooo "generous" they gifted them super rare legacy/plans/godrollss... OR that they were lucky and bought it for 5k caps.
---
This guy gets it!
---
I think generally speaking those who duped understand the risk and as part of the ToS yes they do deserve to be banned. With that said *everyone* in this community to an extent benefits from their actions. These weapons make their way to a vending machine at some point. Are traded on forums and other places. Prices for other weapons fall as a result. So we do all benefit from it directly or indirectly and yes they do deserve to be banned just like you deserve to get a ticket for speeding if caught.
---
You called him tubby, lmfao.
---
people are so salty today.. lol...
---
How can it cost 30k if the cap limit was 10 or 25 k when I last played? Did they increase limit?
---
You overpaid 11k caps for that my friend üòÇ
---
Make Berz Great Again!
---
What if we stole them from train station vendors before the duper got back from leaving the server? Are we responsible for the bans? Technically we helped people to maybe not get banned if they didn't get to collect their dupes. But maybe since the duper had to dupe even more they got banned sooner?
---
Cringey
---
they cant legally charge you anymore after youre banned anyway...
---
That was photoshopped. However, they were crafting 5 star legendaries.
---
Turning in pictures to Ward Is a +25 reputation increase
---
you can solo it with a full set of troubleshooters armor and a good vampire weapon
---
it just going to be fallout 4 camp defense mods all over again fun for the first few times annoying and boring going forward
---
I literally duped that 50 cal many times, a lot of the higher tier handmades were originally mine, so chances are high people are buying duped weapons in game lol
---
Yea what of it.
---
How many times a day would you say that you type the letters "LMAO"? Seems to be the bulk of your material here. I guess at least that part makes sense. 
---
Private worlds are not private servers. A private server allows you to set your own variables. You cannot rent your own 76 server. You can pay for a subscription to play alone or with people you invite. That is not the same thing. 
---
Nobody is comparing the game to real life. Are you 12?
---
If people dupe, it matters. You know how we know this? Because they got banned. End of story.
---
Claim a workshop and craft it.
---
Yea it did it‚Äôs 30k max now but people are starting to be suspended or banned so I‚Äôll watch out you‚Äôll most likely not get banned for having 1 or 2 dupe weapons if you find 1 in a vendor
---
Place it in your camp, collect grenades from the box attached, throw them to mark artillery strike (must be nearby your camp)
---
Same i dont have f76 1st so i can even store that much lead or steel i would need to use all my gun powder
---
Anything worthwhile. The new dupe technique was hella easy, worked on anything, and just cost caps.
---
I think he might be bluffing.
---
Players are helping that happen as well
---
BE vats critical critical fills 15% faster? Yeah pretty sure we all have that one lol
---
Nice argument. Totally flawed, but A+ for effort.
---
Sure, you have your fancy brand new perfectly structured house on a lake that looks like God himself scooped it out of time from before the War and plopped it down 26 years after, so new that there‚Äôs not even any dust. 
---
But then there‚Äôs me, a wanderer who found the sweetest cabin ever while hiking. Sure, it‚Äôs got holes and it‚Äôs kinda dirty, but it‚Äôs there.
---
Is that bad?
---
I haven't used hard bargin in ages. I sell stuff for inventory management not for the caps.
---
Lower prices allows me to shed more weight.
---
You wouldnt,  so there'd be no point in duping. Hence the perfect punishment.
---
Faster reload
---
What evidence are you talking about? How can you prove something you DIDNT DO, specially if you cannot access the account?
---
It depends on where the user is.  In some markets an annual sub that will not be fulfilled might get something back because breaking ToS isn‚Äôt the sane as breaking the law.
---
i know people with accounts jammed about 100k presents (8k stash, 16k inventory x5) and still not banned. they have these presents for about half a year now.
---
Yup, my bloody commando had the same setup. Works nice
---
I've gotten like 5 flags, a handful of complete outfits and 0 backpacks. Seems more than just semi rare to me.
---
That's how it went last time too.
---
Your argument that just because someone receives a duped item, means they are also a duper or part of the same issue is idiotic. I will use myself as an example, I had a trade where I received multiple thousands of flux for a specific item. I know these are duped, but thats where their life ends. The flux will always stay with me and will be used legitimately to make ultracite ammo so that I don't have to worry about ammo. That is not game breaking because it's only providing me with ammo and not crashing a server trying to be duped. Owning a duped item or stack of items is harmless as long as the person holding didn't do it. On the flip side of that you could argue it devalues that item, which is true, but this is a game where unfortunately there will always be duping methods. But back to my main message, owning the items means nothing, it's the people choosing to turn those items into more that are the issue, it doesn't matter if I burn through all the flux until I hit 10 left, I will never dupe because it's against the rules and everyone who does it risks their account.
---
Its a status effect you have a chance to receive upon opening or being near someone opening a lunchbox. The effect is called "confetti mess" and it effects every enemy, not just scorched, its so much fun :D
---
Well for one thing it shouldn't have two  'M's
---
I'd imagine that's out there aswell the amount of fixers that were going round and still are is insane
---
Nope! Ready to squad up! üòä
---
Well, guess I‚Äôll just go straight back to FO4 and NV and never spend a single second on 76 to buy even an atom then. If I got my inventory wiped ‚Äúfor the greater good‚Äù Bethesda would stop getting money from me, too.
---
Lol I'm glad I missed all that. I was buried in work this past week or so so I wasn't even online to be susp. 
---
I have no interest in duping, ruins the fun for me but I'm like you. A massive ban is talked about you feel like you're gonna be in trouble. Same thing when a cop car follows you around. 
---
Although a quiet server may mean I get to do events in peace again!
---
Hahaha, nice one, id say roughly 100+ times on a good day, such as today, and yeah they aren‚Äôt real private worlds but that‚Äôs their sorry excuse for them, andddd it‚Äôs what ya got so live with it, and yeah there is no point to comparing a game to real life cuz the game doesn‚Äôt matter, life does, that‚Äôs why duping doesn‚Äôt matter, this isn‚Äôt even something that hurts their pockets üòÇüòÇ
---
How does the banning even work? I‚Äôve been told that Bethesda tracks your inventory for suspicious behavior (suddenly getting 99999 large present boxes) but one time I was at Charleston Train Station and there was a bag that had ALOT of plans as well as aid items (stimpacks, alcohol, water, nuka-cola) I picked a lot of it up because free stuff. I still haven‚Äôt gotten banned yet.
---
Edit: When I say a lot I mean, amounts that aren‚Äôt even farmable a lot. I know some people have like 3,000 stimpacks without duping but this bag had way to much to be legit.
---
LMAO...
---
Bethesda: ‚ÄúShould we ban him? Well, he does have a faster fire rate nocturnal fatman. Let him go. This time.
---
Me: whew.
---
Sometimes this is a bug with a fusion core in you inventory that still thinks its equiped. Try putting all your cores into your stash or dropping them and picking them back up.
---
This is totally unrelated but is your username the same in game as here, and on PC? If so I was in a team with you earlier today. Just throwing it out there.
---
First that‚Äôs ever potentially happened in this forum, so do forgive my topic deviation please.
---
Nope half the term of the contract is not being serviced due to BGS decision.  As breaking ToS isnt the same as breaking the law some places might require partial reimbursement.
---
Bethesda is a business and keeping the gun market legitimate means you spend more time in game. If that means more time finding a gun worthy of trade toward one you want or more time to gain the one you want... It's more time. Getting to your unicorn means you spend less time and they don't like you not playing the game. Bethesda is thinking long term and I bet 80% of the actual player base are casuals players who don't even know what a B2525 is.
---
I was just mentioning that the AA/Bloodied/Junkies 25/25 handmades that are going around originated with me.  Same exact setup from the old white springs dupe.  Anyone who has one almost certainly had a dupe.  Same with legacies and armor.  There is a chance people get a ‚Äòclean‚Äô item but everyone knows what the typical garbage legendaries you get all the time are.  Nocturnal Lock Picking Breath Underwater.  Furious Faster Fire Black Powder Rifle.  I could go on for days lol
---
Not really I'm on xbox no problems here
---
Lol! I'm kind of excited about it. I like to help out the noobs.
---
I would have paid a lot for that with other legendary weapons attached to it lol
---
Yeah its all about luck atm if youre chosen to be investigated bad luck for you and he had luck not getting picked
---
Nah glad you got punishment.
---
This sub restores my faith in humanity.
---
I bought it from someone I am 100% confident did not dupe or associate with dupers.
---
I love the AstroTurf! Asked someone about it in a camp months ago and it finally showed up today! Between that and the Red Rocket garage (my vending station) I‚Äôm out of atoms!
---
please do us a favor a stop. without stupid shit like this dup the game would be boring so go ahead and fucking talk about how i should be ban but idrc glitches is literally part of this game. it is what makes it fun. i am not saying for bethesda to stop fixing their shitty mistakes, i am telling them to stop banning us for them
---
Yes I remember you as your tent was where mine normally is atm (the asylum) and you either crashed or left but your tent icon remained - stopping me replacing mine xD
---
Severs, maintenance and continued development cost a  TON of money. Never think it's a good idea to run your own business.
---
Are you just copying and pasting that comment on every fucking post?  
---
Shits gettin‚Äô old dude.
---
speaking of being facetious...
---
That the old guy at the station? He‚Äôs a real dick. I tried to get the mole miners over to murder him but apparently he‚Äôs immune sadly.
---
Completed last week, now to get 100% rep with both factions.......
---
Yes they are extremely rare and come in a bundle.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs a product of inflation and scarcity.
---
Long term players make caps hand over fist just playing. 
---
I just dropped 22k caps on the stimpack diffuser plans because it‚Äôs impossible to find a random public group that can complete that event with 3 animals alive, and 22k is nothing to me. I‚Äôve been having to find creative cap sinks above and beyond Smiley because I keep bumping the cap limit on all my active characters, and I‚Äôve got a second account with 4 characters at 30k ‚Äújust in case‚Äù and 1 who‚Äôs a vendor mule who just creeps up to 30k until I dump caps on something like these plans. 
---
The reason for the prices (and the trade-only status, really) is this inflation, and the astronomical scarcity of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù items. I forget the exact math, but the chances of a specific godroll dropping are something like 1 in 5 million.
---
So, it‚Äôs inflation and scarcity.
---
They can on my fianc√©‚Äôs account hence why I‚Äôll be cancelling it. We were getting tired of all the bugs and perks not working anyways.
---
I got mine refunded through MS immediately. I‚Äôve had it for a week and didn‚Äôt expect an actual refund.
---
yet who would be tehre to buy anything, everyone is getting ban
---
You‚Äôll never be banned for things like that, you are just working around the game... somehow that‚Äôs fine because the game allows it. I‚Äôve never seen anyone get banned for glasses cavern glitch either, and unyielding glitch, etc... bans will only happen if it effects the companies interests directly not the game.
---
Did they only ban dupers or did they ban people with duped items as well?
---
sounds like you dont actually like this game, why play it?
---
I had the free santatron. The robotic ‚ÄúHo, Ho, Ho‚Äù will forever be burned into my memory. Never again.
---
Awesome!
---
Probably
---
Next time could you TD;LR?
---
Your long rant was basically repeating every previous paragraph and that's several minutes of my life that I'll never get back.
---
Yeah I fast travelled to a scorched horde event than ended up being inside glassed caverns. Soon as I arrived my game crashed. Sorry about that üòÅ
---
He's got one thing going for him, he's not Commander Daguerre.
---
If your inv is what keeps you playing then what‚Äôs the point of playing
---
I have a 2* Mutant's Explosive fixer you can have if your on PS4. It's fun.
---
While scrip is a good system to buy coins, I wouldn't mind being able to buy coins with caps. Even if they're stupidly expensive, it could bring value to the cap again. 
---
I'm a veteran of the beta, and I don't really have anything to spend caps on. I've got all the plans. My scrap box is overflowing in mats. Rarely do other players sell items I want to buy, for the same reason that they also don't need caps. 
---
But if you could spend caps on coins, and thus endgame content? I'd finally open my shop back up, and I wouldn't mind listing trade fodder as cap sales.
---
I was playing all morning past noon got my day and weekly's done the servers were eating crayons as me and my budys like to say when it seems to have stroked out
---
Starts sweating and glancing at bloodied faster swing speed +1 strength bear arm I bought from someone‚Äôs vendor and now is on display on my wall
---
Yeahh we need more caps sinks!
---
Yup just logged on today and my entire weekly challenges where auto completed. Feels bad man
---
something like 4days
---
No, it's very poorly designed.  I honestly can't think of a single good design choice there, from the fact that there is no indication for newbs that they're about to spawn something that could murder the SBQ, to the fact that if you try to join in you're probably going to die before you can even move, to the corpse often getting lost, to infinite spawns.
---
I almost invariably end up tanking because seemingly I'm the only person that doesn't die in 1 hit.  But I also need to kill the 5 gutsy shooting me and the eyebots because no one else fucking will.  Because guess what... they're too busy trying to do damage because if they don't they get screwed out of the reward.  Because bad fucking design.
---
Dammit
---
lost 6250 score last week  :(
---
List out what you suspect could cause the suspension, be understanding when they say they need time and back up your claim by backtracking your trades. If I bought a gun with caps yesterday claim it was a simple trade. Kiss ass if you really care. Either way the emails people are getting are claiming accounts are under 'investigation'. If you didn't dupe or contribute to a dupe taking place you're going to be fine.
---
Shout it louder for those in the back!
---
But it‚Äôs a beautiful skin
---
No, you would be already banned. + If they banned everyone who bought legacy this way, everyone would be banned.
---
It‚Äôs never over, never!!
---
Thx didnt hear it back here
---
It's almost as if reddit is made up of individuals with individual opinions ü§î
---
Chemist mod. I run a medic build so I'm pretty much carrying all the stimpacks since me using them for everyone thanks to the team medic perk is more efficient than my friends using them individually.
---
On Thursday/Friday it was magical. I heard about the dupe on Reddit and then went into a world and all train stations had a bunch of people. Next thing you know I have all these amazing guns.
---
There will be more.
---
yea this whole post is a circle jerk of cheaters trying to justify cheating.
---
Perhaps I'm just lucky? I've sold probably a dozen backpack plans in the last few months, they go for about 5k a pop and just after I posted in this thread, I ran the event and got the backpack plan. I am so unlucky with legendary weapon rolls, but I always seem to get good plans from events, for example I've had about 8 plans for The Fixer now.
---
Unless I am misinformed, if you didn't dupe it, you most likely won't get banned. Ive gottwn thousands of flux and presents in trades that are most likely duped and nothing happened. I never dupe myself or glitch anything in anyway and I have been fine. I only trade in those amounts because those are the only trades that seem worth it for the items I offered.
---
Wooooow. So dupers finally got duped. I‚Äôm level 70ish and play on the xboner. Gona be on tonight to see all the fun times I‚Äôve missed
---
The clean sink from the pass gives dirty water, and it can be placed anywhere unlike the pump.
---
What do you mean why üòÇ you nonce
---
That's actually very interesting as i was doing a scorched horde event in the ash heap when you left, i remember as i saw your marker nearby so held off killing the legendary for a minute before you disappeared.
---
Wonder if the crash was to do with the different/wrong location on your end.
---
That‚Äôs the problem, the bot just bans anyone with a certain amount of goods. Now if they have like 3 of the same legacy then yes, it works. But take a friend of mine for example, he has 100k+ steel he‚Äôs gotten over time from trading and hundreds of encryptid runs, and he got flagged and banned. He submitted a ticket but that means that he‚Äôll end up missing 1-2 weeks because bethesda sucks at replying and fixing their stuff. Though I also have a friend who duped the shit out of a bunch of stuff and hasn‚Äôt gotten banned.
---
They're coming for you...
---
Once it makes into the ‚Äòopen waters‚Äô there‚Äôs really no telling where it came from is my point.  You didn‚Äôt have to dupe it, the guy you got it from, the guy he got it from, but eventually down the line it is likely.  Things change hands a ton on here.  If they actually had unique ids for items it would be interesting to track it.  Does that make sense?
---
Launch it from the EXECUTABLE, do NOT launch from within the Microsoft/Xbox/Gamepass launcher....  there is a Terms of Service that need completed - then you can get on it...
---
I just assumed he meant caps, yeah cash money you‚Äôre gone, dupe or no (if you get caught).
---
That's why I spent my fo1st allowance on itüòé
---
What you have described is one of the things the bots are looking for. Excessive amounts of rare items. The bots don‚Äôt care where you got them from. They‚Äôre only looking at raw numbers. There are a lot of people who never duped that are getting caught up in this. Bethesda is throwing out a wide net hoping to catch the few really bad actors. It‚Äôs going to leave a bad taste in a lot of innocent mouths.
---
5 star is still awesome
---
My friend got banned for just having a B2525. (We guess) 
---
He had a video clip of when he pulled it from the purveyor several months ago. 
---
He will submit that to Bethesda and see what they say. 
---
And before you say anything 
---
He didn't dupe
---
He didn't buy anything from a vendor where people been duping 
---
He havnt traded anyone in the past few weeks  
---
I wonder what Betheada goes by when they decide to ban some one these days... 
---
"He has weapons and outfits, BAN HIM!!!"
---
Ok, I last played around 4pm on PS4 so I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôll be good
---
Todd's always watching
---
I did.  I submitted a ticket, and they texted me back saying I should keep an eye on my email...
---
It's help with the grind, it'd make gold extractors actually worth using rarther than ignoring, nobody builds on them because nobody needs that much gold for anything, unless this were possible!
---
I guess I don‚Äôt know 100%. I buy some smaller items from player vendors, such as ammo and sometimes a magazine (trying to complete the collection), but I‚Äôve never purchased a weapon from a player vendor and I don‚Äôt pick up random weapons or large items such as PA pieces or rare items found in a dropped bag.
---
I use super duper doh
---
The jumping one is because of jetpacks and the amount of lag in the events, I do it all the time on the sbq event and jump so high everything unrenders. As for taking the queen down super fast that can be either a godly build or glitched weapons
---
I use Level 50 Combat Armor limbs and have recently acquired the Secret Service Chest and Boost Pack. My shotgun (The only effective weapon I've been able to get my hands on) still feels the same. I just seem to take more damage than usual.
---
As for perks and character build, I do not know what to use to decrease damage taken, ( I do see Iron Clad, which increases resistance +10 when not wearing Power Armor, so I will work on that). If there is anything else you think could help, I would appreciate tips and tricks.
---
That it is. And those weapons get deleted almost as soon as they show up.
---
Not anymore! Is what I say to that robots question. üòÇ
---
*if* they were in fact duping, then I agree 100%. Have seen a few comments about false bans or bans for "buying one duped item from a vendor" though and that's concerning. Those people don't deserve to be banned and it's pretty fucked up if they are.
---
Ok good, I really don‚Äôt want to get banned, I‚Äôve been playing since wastelanders
---
Been away for a few days... whahappened?
---
I like this more, honestly. I'd love to burn through my caps.
---
Lol did you get caught?
---
I didn‚Äôt dupe, I bought weapons that could‚Äôve been duped that‚Äôs all
---
;)
---
man thats the worst comparison ever, you think that not wanting to cheat means you are a dick to random players?
---
There's your answer then unfortunately. Assuming the best I hope it all works out for you.
---
Maybe only a inv wipe
---
It certainly was! Hell, this morning EVERYONE I saw on PS4 was running around with legacy Gatling Plasmas
---
chill they are not going to ban people over 1 gun :V
---
No I don‚Äôt dupe, I managed to buy 6 Legacies though which were most likely duped
---
Well it's been months and I have never been touched once by a ban. It has to be something else they are checking in addition to this because I have had this amount for a while. Like I said though, never abuse any glitches, dupes or otherwise. Therefore I have nothing to worry about.
---
I've been playing legit up until last week. More than one thousand hours. 
---
Perhaps this is a wake up call to free myself from the grinding slavery and  cancel 1st membership to move on to another game.
---
You wouldn't get banned. Suspended at most. In a statement made by Bugthesda themselves they're only issuing permanent bans to people guilty of egregious offences. Basically, people with 10 B2525 Fixers sat in their stash.
---
Didn‚Äôt know the weapons dropped Plastic, thanks for the tip.
---
on top of the rad res fom scorchbeast and so, it also reduce your toxic goo effect by 50% +- allowing you to get 65 ish rad instead of 125 so when you die, you make sure the diluted rad x is still in effect ( or take another one, it's extremely cheap to make and you gain unlimited supplies by just playing ) popping a toxic goo will down your life to a nearly perfect spot for nerd rage, it's extremely usefull
---
The ban wave happened to me from 5pm to 6pm while I was eating dinner.
---
Lol.
---
This is why most people are running a solo team. By the time you fast travel to ane vent it's over. Yes, you get rewards, so that's cool.  But, it's like... Okay.  Fuck this.
---
Then you are in danger
---
Dupe; Hotfix; Banwaves
---
I've been playing since launch and throughout all the ban waves, I have never been touched once. As long as you didn't break the rules, my guess is you'll be good.
---
Just be careful. The bot went active today with the update. The suspensions are still rolling out.
---
What level are you? This stuff happens all of the time.
---
Not a comparison it‚Äôs an assumption.
---
Dupers, exploiters and cheaters should be banned permanently.
---
Ok :)
---
I‚Äôd be ok with this more people to fight who want to fight
---
Imho, caps are the most worthless thing in the game. I just want them to have value üò©
---
I have no idea but I don‚Äôt often crash in this game, soon as I arrived it just froze up for a few secs and booted to desktop so I have no idea what happened. Sounds plausible though if that‚Äôs the case. 
---
Well thanks for the random reunion anyway haha. Was a good team, one of the few lately where people don‚Äôt just leave and join endlessly for no reason or I get kicked with a full x4 bond (people are weird).
---
Good luck with the mini! I‚Äôve got two so far I‚Äôve kept short term, a two shot and a ~~furious~~ junkies, I just don‚Äôt have the space to roll for more right now. Probably all the gunpowder üòÅ
---
What happened?
---
Bruh..
---
What a send off wasn‚Äôt it. Truely and ‚ÄúEnd Game‚Äù experience.
---
No cheating for me i love playing this game and when i earn an amazing roll it feels so much more satisfying. Yes the game has flaws but all games do like this.
---
Ok good, all my Legacies are different and I grounded for the caps I used to buy them
---
I mean thats what bethesda is going for they want to keep the player base for as long as possible i mean alone the season pass 
---
You have to get 22.500.000 exp if you would only go for exp challenge (without daily and weekly)
---
I just wish we only had to do tadpole stuff once and then it‚Äôs done for the account..
---
Ya know sometimes I'd hit up a train station and decide to loot the small things around to find at least something decent and once I found a bag wit plans and I ended up getting 5 plans for free twice.
---
Did you get banned?
---
Yeah this is the solution I'd choose too. The games main currency is already next to useless for most endgame players, having a reason to accumulate it and then something to spend it on would be nice.
---
&gt; Theyre only helping them.
---
I just can't understand why people don't see it this way. The RNG sucks and is clearly weighted to not give you good weapons. How many Fixers do we get from the Purveyor compared to all the other garbage? I've spent thousands of scrip with her and have only gotten a single, shitty Fixer. It's clearly rigged, and if people want to take it upon themselves to do something about that and make these weapons cheaper and more readily available then bravo.
---
Why would anyone be bothered by this? They've got to be either the most brow beat law abiding goody twoshoes or they're probably just upset that their special weapon isn't special anymore. Or maybe they're upset that they can't charge asinine prices beyond the cap limit for them. How tragic, let me get my violin.
---
Thanks. I knew all that. 
---
For whatever reason I just concentrated on the settlers and didn‚Äôt do simultaneous ranking on the Raiders. I‚Äôm paying for it now. 
---
It‚Äôs almost done. I figure another 5-7 days.
---
I'm sure they looked at the accounts, figured out how many dollars they spend and weighed that against the damage they're doing to the game and then made their decision.
---
If you don't want to be banned either don't dupe or convince some whales to dupe with you.
---
Hmm have there been any cases like mine that have escalated into a lawsuit and the person won? I really feel that I cannot let Bethesda have their way anymore, they are just simply disregarding this issue and not taking any effort to solve it at all.
---
Ok, I didn‚Äôt dupe but I bought 6 Legacies for 30k Caps each
---
Nothing you say matters to them.
---
What kind of perks would you prefer? I understand that it differs based on weapon of choice and character theme and such. I am also trying to avoid a Bloodied build, as I see they are most common. (The fact that I am dying faster also discourages me from reducing health to 10 HP). I also aim to avoid mutations (as strange as that sounds), focusing on a more "realistic survivor" build, if such a concept exists. I do not know, I would love to hear some opinions and hints.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
For cobalt flux, your best bet is to hope someone nukes Morgantown, though I don't see a lot of people do it. You can easily walk out of Morgantown with enough resources to make 4 lots of flux, or more if you have Green Thumb.
---
I guess, but it sounds nice cuz then there‚Äôs no stress of trading
---
Yup but I didn‚Äôt dupe and haven‚Äôt in the past so I‚Äôm hoping after they investigate I‚Äôm unbanned.
---
Don't even care if i get downvoted to hell for this
---
But yall fuckers need to chill
---
Duping is pointless in a live service multiplayer environment as it can cripple or in some cases kill an ingame economy, diablo 3 back in the day when we had real money conversions was a prime example and its one of the reasons blizzard scrapped the idea.
---
However i would like to point out that even before dupers find a way to ply their craft, players will always make terrible vendors price wise, back when this game came out, i remember seeing people trying to sell both legendary weapons and even stimpaks, a basic ass item for 4-5x what they would normally be to buy from a npc vendor
---
So before anyone jumps down each others throats, just remember this games economy was pretty much fucked from the first few weeks out of beta and whilst i agree duping is both stupid and should see players that do it punished, they are by no means solely responsible for this games attrocius economy
---
Right? This is one of the reasons (though the main one is the rep grind) that I probably won't ever bother levelling up and playing my alts.
---
They count as containers so you can't do the same location with in 24 hours.
---
Bruh I‚Äôm looking forward to that Minecraft 1.16 üëÄ can‚Äôt wait to hop on
---
Why though?
---
They're probably as good with catching dupers as they are with fixing bugs.  Make more problems than they solve.
---
I've always been a fan of helping others out(gave him 5 of each; stimpaks, super stimpaks, radaway, rad-x, disease cures, and marsupial serum). Today though, the guy quickly puts on the pink suit(which I happen to have on) and when I change Char's and rejoin friends, he places his c.a.m.p. down at my spot. Not so cool.
---
Gonna play some Destiny 2, RDO, and GTAO. I believe all 3 of those are free in games pass rn 
---
Kind of a blessing, play some other games like this and realize how poorly built this one is. We all just love the universe so much we put up with pretty bad content
---
I also haven't duped, you aren't special.
---
Sorry must be in the wrong forum. Where‚Äôs the duping forum?
---
Quick hide them in a tree trunk
---
As much as I hate to say it, rdr2 is less broken than fo76
---
Everything in this game gets delayed now...smh.
---
Dunno if there's gonna be more bans coming but even though I received duped goods I haven't been banned yet, so still playing 76
---
Can't relate, I don't dupe so I can keep enjoying the game.
---
I‚Äôm with you man.  Xbox one
---
if its only 1 gun (and its not hacked/glitched) you are most likely not getting banned
---
These people dupe to sell for real money. I‚Äôve seen some of my own legendaries being sold for $70. That‚Äôs more than the damn game ever was lol.
---
Have you done Minecraft dungeons yet? Any good?
---
Ive heard anecdotal stuff like this a few times now. Something un noted may have changed somewhere along the line I dont know. I guess the message is if you are going to acquire plans out of order then do so at your own risk because there isnt a guarantee any others will drop
---
Funny thing: There used to be a Misc quest: 'Your camp is under attack!' Or somesuch. 
---
No idea why it was taken away for. I actually enjoyed it to be completely honest.
---
Fuck the person that started the dupe but it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs crappy bugs. I‚Äôm not going to justify doing something against the rules but it didn‚Äôt break the game, directly hurt people playing, steal actual money, or crash servers.
---
"enjoying" ü§£
---
My friends bro had played it and he loved the hell out of it, I would try it but watch some vids, it seems like a pretty good one if you like that type of game
---
It's passable but gets boring quickly. Small doses.
---
Think people just get carried away with owning the best gear, chasing that perfect B2525 and they get so caught up in it that they are willing to knowingly break rules to do it. You just have to follow the 76 Market sub to see that a lot of them were world hopping relentlessly to find duped items in vendors just to show off they'd found one and had a B2525 or whatever they wanted. 
---
Remember seeing an article back when I played CSGO about hacking, some guy bought some to see why people did it, and he said it was a weird sense of power to know that he could just win at any moment. From being a below average he could suddenly go up to a top 10% rank, and it became an issue because he liked that he was looked at more highly.
---
It‚Äôs on games pass rn, I‚Äôll give it a go!
---
As much I can, until they decide to not give me score again. Seems like they fixed that though.
---
Borderlands 3, Destiny 2, Ark survival evolved, dying light and maybe modern warfare and fallout 4
---
well he dislikes you too, pal, but at least he doesn't try to shoot a harpoon at your face.
---
90% of the players I traded with this past weekend had 1st. I would imagine they all got tagged and like myself canceled their sub. 
---
In the 2100 hours I put into GTA Online, I glitched around 800mil GTA$, and I never even heard of people getting banned. They would either adjust your bank account, or flag your account and only allow you to sell one car every 36 hours/remove your ability to add custom plates. That‚Äôs it. And that directly affected shark card sales, but they still didn‚Äôt ban people for it. 
---
Bethesda over here with the 0 IQ plays suspending subscription owners while not patching the glitch, or temporarily disabling vendors.
---
I cant blame you for this comment its kinda true the game i didnt get banned yet but i love the universe more then the game
---
It's a surprisingly fun dungeon crawler with a Minecraft skin over it. Nothing too deep or exciting but a lot of fun.
---
I Ops you get unbanned too, that‚Äôs a pretty sh*tty situation
---
Offenders deserve a lot more then a ban IMO. That is the only thing in China that I find of use, game account tied to a SS# and perma banned from all online games at that point on would very fitting (of course, the rest of that system is horrible as far as freedom goes). Cheaters will **always** cheat.
---
They made an announcement they put in tracking measures at the hotfix today so maybe you‚Äôre in luck and will get compensated.
---
i never knew about this until now. thank you, you're a homie üíØüíØ
---
I‚Äôd rather hide under a rock
---
From what I've read, people are still getting the auto complete bug, now on weeklies too.
---
Hell yeah the be flamer was worth it lmaoo. I‚Äôm in the same boat right now brother
---
It really takes the fun out of getting a God roll weapon if you can just go buy it with no effort. It no longer is God roll, it's just "normal."
---
Just part of the me, me, me, now, now, now mindset.
---
Some people enjoy pain and suffering, some people even sexually enjoy it üò≥
---
The damage bug with multiple weapons has existed since beta. If you really think this actually delayed those fixes then you are on a whole nother level.
---
It depends on your S.P.E.C.I.A.L allocation, but perks like Blocker and Dodgy can help, Blocker blocks 45% of melee attack damage, dodgy blocks 30% of all damage as long as you have AP for it to take, there is a perk in luck called serendipity that has a 45% chance to block all damage from an attack when you are below 30% HP. If you are low on damage resistance you have perks like Ironclad, Barbarian and Evasive, that can increase them for you. Even just changing a few mods on armour can help in the right situation.
---
I feel your pain
---
If you haven't received an email by now you should be fine. Seems to be two types of emails going around
---
- Temporary Suspension
---
- Permanently Banned from FO76
---
Reference is [here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/419353/account-suspensions-and-bans-july-14-2020?language%5B%5D=en)
---
If you were suspended there is a possibility of getting your account back after they are done "investigating".
---
TBH I only ever use the junk function common to all of them. Exception being presents when that was a thing. I only have Santa and the standard.
---
I'm dead ü§£
---
 I'm kind of curious now, I haven't launched the game in at least a year and have never duped. I am however not certain that nothing I've ever traded for has been duped.
---
What is duping??
---
It was hilarious
---
Happened to me too. Logged in and all my week and all but 1 daily was completed
---
What is Duping?
---
I don't see how that's true, since the entire economy of the game is based on eBay and gameflip prices. Some people even speculate some Bethesda employees take advantage of dupes while it's on the hush for free side income.
---
It‚Äôs been quiet.
---
Thanks :)
---
&gt;I was planning on buying a cheap copy of fallout 76 to put on my gaming laptop i use for university so that i can have two seperate accounts and use the second as storage and scrip farming, is this an acceptable thing to do or is it something that could either get me banned or given shit for by the community as a whole
---
Just make a second character
---
Amen on that. I NEVER want to do that rep trash again. It took forever and I‚Äôm just not going to do it. The backpack is kind of ‚Äúessential‚Äù though with its extra weight and the option to get the mods.
---
Ok. I can agree with that but what about the people that I know 100% were duping to flip and sale for real money are still active ?? Why there account is not suspended.??? It‚Äôs bullcrap!! I bought some duped weapons out of some vendors. That‚Äôs not my fault now is it.. and I didn‚Äôt even dupe anything..
---
Literally one by fucking one man. It is a pain in the ass but I did it twice. Have 1800 in stash and just now finally completed the quest. Now have 2600 gold lmao.
---
I highly doubt that is why he was banned
---
Honestly no. I didn't really notice anything. So I just in equipped them for the extra durabililty
---
I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get hit. I had two action heros, back from survival mode - one was a friends they didn‚Äôt want, and I kept mine for my heavy gunner to eventually use. I completely forgot I had them, and I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt banned for that.
---
I do want to play this game actually, a lot people do, i have 2000+ hours in this game, and i, like a lot of others, know what is best for this game, and this game needed that dupe because there was too big of a percentage of people who were trying to get stuff that they could not get, and bethesda didnt do anything to help with that situation, A lot of the things in this game are an unrealistic grind, and that is the main reason people exploit
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just a visual glitch, i logged on earlier today it showed most were completed, I just logged on again and everything was good as new.
---
How would i transfer items that way, as wouldnt that require me to either have a friend to hold said items or leave them in a public place and risk loosing the items?
---
Holy smokes? Another real person is here?
---
Probably buy supplies from gram since he's a muttie too
---
Big number make me happy
---
You have to me a masochist to enjoy this game. I play this game a lot, and it‚Äôs completely busted.
---
Heck yeah man
---
Seriously? Bethesda banned duper for real this time?
---
I‚Äôve bet this game is dead right now. Since 80% of the players were banned. Maybe even more??
---
&gt;	Some people even speculate some Bethesda employees take advantage of dupes while it‚Äôs on the hush for free side income.
---
Sounds to me like a good way to lose your job wjth the outside potential of a lawsuit to make an example of you.
---
WTF is Duped?
---
Same here. Still chugging along as per usual.
---
no i‚Äôll still pickup stuff lol
---
Where would you go to find out what kind of builds there are so I can prep myself. I‚Äôm level 13 hopefully I didn‚Äôt screw this up haha
---
&gt;  I want someone to prove to me that it‚Äôs a bad thing
---
You discount the time and or money needed to be spent and offer no recourse for the people who play the game like they would a normal Fallout game or even as they want to freely (like myself who launches nukes regularly for others, builds a camp, and trades), then you claim grinding/time gating its irrelevant when it is a core design decision, then do not deny that time-gates are toxic which they most certainly are, and then finally decide that your new point is me convincing you its not inherently a bad mechanic worthy of change for the betterment of everyone's experience?
---
How bad would it be if SCORE was never developed and all the legendary run rewards were just placed into the atom shop rotation? The only difference I see is Bethesda makes less revenue and more time is freed up for real bug fix and content updates. Instead they spent god knows how long making and implementing it and the entire time it was always a static system that added nothing new except a way to slowly drip in assets that already existed.
---
So, [sorry, but it is:](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/3e691f/grind_timegating_and_rng_as_used_to_lengthen/):
---
&gt; Are these techniques essentially bad/negative? If the point is to artificially lengthen content (or put a skinner box in there), then these techniques don't appear to add value to the game. They might make you get more "time" out of a game, but is time spent grinding enjoyable time? This is perhaps a doubly relevant question when directed towards RNG elements that may involve time investment with nothing to "show for it." If the point is merely to prevent players from blowing through created content too quickly, is that justified?
---
The resounding answer to this question is YES. Sure people will grind and some people even find it comforting in some ways like for example in Runescape (I am maxed) or Wow (multiple high level characters + wow classic) where I can grind how I want to when I want to for a guaranteed power level increase and new gear which enables me go enjoy the actual games content. Runescape/Wow/Guild Wars 2 and I am sure even Everquest is not just one giant grindfest like a jrpg, and the point of the grind is to get better gear to defeat more challenging obstacles/raids/puzzles/bosses to enhance your experience within the game world. In what way is 76 similar? It has none of those other draws, the same unchanged content and legendary system it launched with, but somehow miraculously way more bugs. Not to mention their absolutely atrocious track record of releasing every single patch with new and exciting bugs they didn't even realize were there because they don't budget/plan for proper testing. Even the PTS was community driven. 
---
This leads me to my next point which is:
---
&gt; If the point is merely to prevent players from blowing through created content too quickly, is that justified?
---
Again, no. Play how you want as often as you want much like the Netflix mentality of "here you go its your own fault if you watch all 8 seasons in a week".
---
&gt; Then you don‚Äôt enjoy the game cycle that‚Äôs been in place since day one of the game. It was always this. And since the game failed, it‚Äôs going to be this. Just because you‚Äôre tired of it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre entitled to the rewards.
---
Ridiculous, the games cycle was [Fallout](https://bethesda.net/en/article/2G2vLPyPwcMaiGASUwsoqQ/fallout-76-official-reveal-e3-2018): Exploring, atmosphere and lore, collecting and breaking down items, and the storyline except with friends online, and the newly added camp system. That is the base from which this game launched off of and has slowly but surely been completely diluted with monetization against the promises of all the higher ups at Bethesda. Once I got into it I really heavily gravitated toward camp design and trading. And the game has not "failed" which is another reason I am still here. Its frustrating as fuck to be led on and in some cases directly lied to, but I am mature enough to understand that giant game studios are run by even more colossal corporations and all they care about is money and metrics and it leads to all kinds of flawed decision making. So all I can do is have debates like this and piss and moan and vote my with money. 
---
&gt; Then to be blunt anyone who does that is a fucking idiot for spending money like that on a game for a handful of cosmetic items for a game they aren‚Äôt playing more than 30 minutes a day.
---
[This is their target audience.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) (dont get me wrong I love those guys), and the target audience of time-gates like you are defending here. People that don't take it too seriously, who love the brand/franchise with a passion or are looking for a quick reward, and cant/wont grind until the end of time for every drop of dopamine but will still spend the same amount of money. Where do you think the complaints of "devs dont play the game come from"? This Reddit, by someone like me. Did you see the project designer and lead programmer fighting the colossus in that spotlight? Its clear they aren't interested in pleasing people like you or I who spend hundreds and hundreds of hours they want cash money and to release on their own schedule which so far appears to be 3 patches a year with no significant overhauls or bug fixes. Much like "Valseek" indicated in a recent post, they know what people want but are incapable or hampered from providing it in a timely manner so they just stay silent and soldier on until its not profitable. 
---
&gt; Then don‚Äôt spend money and see what happens? So far I have heard from you - you don‚Äôt want to do the challenges and find the game too grindy, but still yet you seem to continue to spend money on them.
---
I stopped once vending was disabled in May for two weeks while keeping my 1st active. I like the camp building (hence atom purchases for camp items), and trading. I have a bitchin' camp I am always working on and collect and trade rare items/outfits/weapons via the Market discord and player vending. I also have been credited atoms a few times because its not a hard case to make to customer service that you are paying for broken shit (water wheel for example). In spite of my bitching I want the game to change and be more successful than it is. If everyone like me left and cancelled their subscriptions, there would just be casuals and people like you who think grinding should be the game. How much happier would you be if this was the Fallout 3/4 world but with multiplayer? That is what we were pitched. This is what we got. That is why I continue on. 
---
&gt; Are you that addicted and hard up for the lore of Fallout that you‚Äôll just stick around if you‚Äôre that unhappy?
---
I am a huge Fallout fan and always have been since the beginning many many years ago. I have multiple collectors items including Fallout shot glasses, thousands of hours in each of the games, and have played and bought every special edition for all of the games so far including Fallout76. The idea that this needs to be explained to you makes me feel like you are the one addicted to grinding and okay with whatever monetization dick Bethesda wants to stick out and tell you to suck on while pissing on what a Fallout experience should be.
---
edit: [LOL](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hr944t/so_many_posts_asking_about_buying_score_ranks_is/)
---
omg lol my bad
---
I agree if you felt that Bethesda needs to learn how to code a proper game seeing they make it easy to exploit/dupe but its no excuse to cheat cause its "too hard". If its not worth the grind then DON'T PLAY. Its that simple. No one is making anyone play this game and this is not the only online game out there. Also, this game is tame as hell in the "gocha" sense. There are very brutal ones out there that incentives you to pay a whole lot of money like BDO.
---
Guess the word ‚Äúprobably‚Äù also flew over your head.
---
I‚Äôm well aware of how commerce and trade work.
---
I never said I guaranteed it. I said I was extremely confident, given the very limited amount of purchasing I‚Äôve done from other players.
---
Oh thnx
---
Why play, are you actually a masochist?
---
Guns like be, je gat plasmas, be lasers and God tier fixers
---
I never heard anyone getting banned for getting a duped weapon. It's the dupers getting banned and there were a lot this time
---
Duplicating items via exploits
---
Golly that garage
---
Go out with a bang!
---
Ahhhh ok.  I feel like i definitely bought duped plans.  Some people had dozens of every plan
---
Ok but make sure you tell me the rock so I don‚Äôt touch it. I collect rocks
---
Duplicating items.
---
How did you know?
---
All I need is Heart of the Enemy... and it still won't let me complete it.
---
Son, I dont think you know what the word "everyone" means.  You need to get back in school lol.
---
if you use plastic to wrap junk to sell, I would say try making weapons instead if you have the plans. There are two weapons that give you 100+ caps per sell after seller modifications and they are easy to make.
---
Yay for downvotes! I live for them! Keep me coming!
---
It has been posted lots of times. Enjoy it until patch 21.
---
Well, since I've got a radiation barrel, it's pretty easy to keep myself at 20% health. But I rarely have to use it. Mostly when I accidentally bump into my rad shower.
---
I eat a lot of raw meat. Sometimes raw veggies, even though I'm a carnivore. Just what ever is laying around. The cannibal perk is good, too.
---
Keep a supply of disease cures in my stash for when I get parasites. I don't worry about other diseases, got the plague walker mutation, but I hate having parasites.
---
I also park my camp near some kind of radiation source. Water, toxic waste, that kind of thing. Lots of mini fissure sites around the cranberry bog, which is where I am now. Those have the bonus of providing me with raw scorchbeast meat.
---
I'm not just bloodied. I'm disease ridden, chem addicted, drunk and irradiated.
---
That‚Äôs messed up. I‚Äôve been saving up for months and I‚Äôm up to 85k. I wonder what the thresholds are.
---
Ahh cool, ill delete my post then cheers man!
---
What I remember is the case for the US and most of Europe, but I know some of the countries there have also been getting more involved in video game/online legislation in the past few years so they could be more nuanced like you said by now
---
Don't cheat.
---
First time hearing of fasnacht thing I didn't even bother. Then I saw the collectron in game, and was like damn, thats annoying. Glad I didn't bother. I still bought the collectron cause I knew about the whole swapping abilities to a different skin.
---
*me who I just wanted purified water because I'm a low level*
---
Lol it‚Äôs not flawed at all, you commented on my other post, you are just to stupid to wrap your mind around the concept that if you get something from another player, and it was a duped item, you are also guilty. Idiots acting like they are goodie two shoes and saying dupers deserve a ban are ridiculous, because guess what, they are just as guilty üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yes. Restarted game deleted saved data and refreshed all games and apps on Xbox
---
I tried this but it was too salty. Do you have a low sodium version of this recipe?
---
From what I‚Äôve read on discord, Bethesda‚Äôs banning people who went overboard with their duping. Dupers even made guidelines to avoid triggering any alarms.
---
How about you mind ur own business
---
If you have more than 100k of anything you get flagged and auto suspended by their bot. He‚Äôs been playing since beta. He had multiple legacies (pre dupe).
---
See that's just fucking ludicrous. When even a *cheater* can't get an item something needs to be changed.
---
I never said it wasn't about money to Bethesda. They're a company, of course it is. I said that this discussion is not regarding real money traders, or the idea that the existence of real money traders justifies cheating in order for someone to advance themself (It absolutely does not). Real money traders should be dealt with by Bethesda, their accounts banned and deleted. Just as any other online game does. Their profits seized, if possible.
---
Everyone's efforts are worthless, because now these items are owned by people who did not put in the effort to obtain them. The game's economy is flooded by items generated by cheating, to the point that it's impossible to trade for any rare item and know it isn't just a duplicate and the person has another 40 ready to go.

An online game needs to have an economy, it needs to have items that only the very best or most dedicated players can possibly have. That's what gives people reason to play when there isn't new content. Something to be proud of achieving. Having or staying on a solo server has nothing to do with it. It's about maintaining the value of in-game items.
---
This is an online game with a trading system. It's not a single player game. There are supposed to be rare and difficult to obtain items. For an example, do you think anyone on RuneScape complains that Party Hats (old limited time items, and now some of the rarest and most valuable items in the game) can't drop and are worth more than the average player will ever earn? The answer is no they don't, because it's an online game where items like that should exist in order to give the truly dedicated players something to strive for.
---
This doesn't really prove anything, this particular dupe was already fixed a year ago but they re-enabled it with wastelanders lol. It would probably still be ongoing if a certain individual didn't make a video to have it blow up publicly last week
---
High capacity with the SS armor.
---
Used to do armored with my solar scout set.
---
If you could only have this one of the scavenger, which would you get?
---
I was thinking about liquidating the steel and lead into ammo before they fix the ammo converter. I guess I should get to it.
---
How about you don't cheat?
---
Doubtful
---
I wouldn‚Äôt sleep if I were you. The most you can hope for is a swift death.
---
so many BOS members in this sub. yall a bunch of narcs and tightasses.
---
You can still do that trick with the water well from buillon
---
Just mind ur own business
---
Just don't cheat.
---
It was flooding the Facebook trading groups before he posted the video, the cat was out of the bag already.
---
Don‚Äôt bother reading it then üëè
---
This is great news. Most the players starting out are noobs and couldn‚Äôt use these legendaries. Now with the bans they never will lol
---
Today I ran into a public group of randos, we shot the shit for a while and I let them all take a gun from my mule, which consisted of a 2 star ZE fixer, 2 star TSE handmade, aaerw handmade, and a TSE gatling gun.  
---
They reacted as if I had just given them one of my kidneys.  
---
The average players' fallout experience is very different than those of us in the know.
---
blueprint it just in case  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKeupNkvLHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKeupNkvLHU)  (I didn't actually check if that vid is any good, but i'm sure its fine)
---
How about u mind ur own business for once?
---
The left arrow button does not work with gold bullion weapons. Make that a priority!
---
Very true. I have clocked a ton of hours into FO76 and played daily starting on release of the game (besides a 4 month break due to school) and only have had TWO great legendary drops, one of them being a TSE assault which I still use to this day.
---
How about you don't cheat for once?
---
No you‚Äôll be fine, like I said, over 100k. Which is stupid because of how easy ammo is to get. I have a few thousand gunpowder, steel, and lead. And with all taht I could easily hit 200k 5mm tonight if I so chose.
---
You're arguing that people who unknowingly received duped items *are just as bad* as the people who duped them and I'm the stupid one?  
---
Try and rationalise it all you want, at the end of the day you got banned for cheating and here you are writing paragraphs of nonsense about it and trying to claim that *everyone is just as bad as you.*
---
Last of Us remastered.  Gameplay is just as wonky as Fallout but at least there are no blue screens!  Probably going to play COD and RDR again too
---
Yeah, I haven't been able to get anything but empty containers and Meteoritic Swords either. Since the last major update.
---
I tried buying something earlier and i got some error message about the shop being updated or some crap and wouldnt process it. I figured Id try later (PS4 btw)
---
That gets me thinking: When the Brotherhood update comes around (Steel Dawn/Fractured Steel) will the paints change or do you believe there will be different ones? 
---
On the picture (For both Steel Dawn and Fractured Steel) it shows a Knight in T-60 but with a blue insignia instead of a white insignia on the chest piece. 
---
Think it'll be just texture changes?
---
Ok, it‚Äôs that big grey one, DON‚ÄôT TOUCH IT!!
---
Yeah.  A TON.  Look at the servers.
---
I stand with you! Just grind and earn, people. It takes a lot of time and effort but it feels so much better in the end. Yes, Murmgggh sucks, but every 8 or so rolls, she coughs up something that's either sell-worthy or a keeper. I don't mind getting in my 8-10 rolls a week. 
---
Not to mention, dupers disable display cases and player vending, and they make fixing bugs a lot more complicated. Ban em all.
---
Sure do! Wait a couple months for cyber punk to come out, then it‚Äôll cancel all by itself when the game dies
---
True. That‚Äôs one reason why I need to start moving it. Since I found out I can stack assaultron cards and run back to back encryptid with my group, I‚Äôm happy to start turning over 30k caps a day.
---
Same
---
I have a explosive build. Bloody mess is very important if you don‚Äôt want to blast the legendaries away.
---
Maybe the game doesnt need duped legacies or all the god roll legendary items, you are guilty, and deserve banning if you have actively duped. The whole reason this game is a mess is because too many people have those god roll weapons. Even then, you say hackers are a much larger problem, but I'd argue otherwise, hackers are easily spotted, and despite their claims, they arent clever, since they decided to make completely ridiculous hacked weapons like the broadsider minigun that shoots orbital strikes.
---
Dupers have picked up the habit of handing out some of their spares to other players to disguise their movement, purposefully including mostly ignorant players in their shittiness. However, people who knowingly hold onto duped items are also to blame, and while not as bad as the dupers, do deserve their banning.
---
I must have been asleep or not paying attention since Update 20. Coulda sworn it worked even when it did. Happy birthday btw
---
Probably not unless you have multiple of the same item
---
You could build foundations and place the rr garage on it.... Couldn't you? Or does it have its "own foundation" ?
---
If they permanently found a way to prevent duping, I'd agree with you.   
---
Since that won't happen, nope.
---
Morgantown has a higher concentration of Ghouls, you get like double the amount of glowing ones than Whitesprings, only issue is they can't spawn as legendary there
---
It‚Äôs hilarious to see. Felled good knowing a whole bunch have been banned.
---
Dupers are extra salty today.
---
i can help i just have to do it tommorrow at like 7-12 (central)
---
It‚Äôs offline because in the process of banning everyone they opened a can of worms. Atom shop items were being able to be placed down without having bought them.
---
I've reported multiple people for using hacked weapons and I know for a fact that they still play the game, if you think they are going to do something with *no* evidence, you are delusional to say the least. And by the way, it's not up to players to prove they're innocent, what kind of backwards logic is that?
---
No, I‚Äôm saying people who brag about being 100% innocent and then hating on dupers are stupid, because guess what, whether you are aware of it or not, you have duped items and if you say players who duped are bad people, then you are just as bad because guess what, you are in possession of their duped items. You are essentially arguing that dupers are all evil people who harm the game, yet pretty much every duper is sharing everything to everyone else so nobody is really left out, I guess people who like giving everyone god roll items are worse than the goody two shoes who like to hate on everyone else? üòÇüëå
---
It's a good place for hardened and glowing mass and high radiation fluids.
---
Its using exploits to basically clone the item. Be it ammo, weapons or armor. The person duping gets to make a copy of whatever they try to dupe with very little effort in most cases. Pretty popular with legacy and god tier weapons
---
Yeah persistent workshops and I could build multiple camps the way I want and then my actual camp wouldn't need a bigger budget
---
So, by your standards we should just not trade and sell items?  Basically ignore a whole function of the game?  I‚Äôm pissed because I‚Äôve never duped anything and I can‚Äôt login to my account today.  Bethesda can go straight to hell, I‚Äôve been playing since beta, and this is the final straw.  Why does the responsibility of vetting out items belong to the players?  This is barbaric.  I‚Äôve been playing online games for 20 years and I‚Äôve never cheated.  This game and the devs have been a shit show since release and now they pull this.  
---
Why should they care?  The answer is simple, It doesn‚Äôt ruin gameplay for anybody, it just enhances it...the reason is because they are making money on selling the high rng items and duping hurts their bottom line.  I‚Äôm sick of the decisions these fools keep making, I honestly hope this chases away all honest; grinding players like myself.  And all those dicks happy to see a massive ban can have fun in their circle jerk.
---
Screw it, I‚Äôm out...
---
Regardless, it existed long before this and it was fixed long before this. It took them a short time to patch it out because the work was already done
---
Ah a fellow foodie!
---
Its 'ore'
---
4 days? They've refused to talk to me at all since patch 20 launched!
---
And it's possible the best spot to farm cobalt, with green thumb you can get upto 100 raw cobalt which is pretty nuts
---
One of my alts got a BE Railway from murmrgh at level 50, that‚Äôs less than a week of play. Dupe all you like but to say RNG gives you nothing good is just a lie to justify duping for cash business. Matter of fact I got BE handmade, BE lever action, QE harpoon, BE 50 cal etc just by farming ghouls and super mutants. Murmrgh is also a good source of useful items. No it doesn‚Äôt happen every day or every week, but if you keep playing you will pick up good items, no question about it.
---
New methods will always come up. That‚Äôs just the nature of games like this.
---
The original glitch simply involved putting items into the artillery box and logging out with a friend inside the box. It was actually way easier than this last one as it had a 100% success rate, and you could stack weapons back then, so 1 TSE turned into 2, then 4, then 8, etc until people had a stack of 1000+ TSE Handmades for example. 
---
This one just pumped an insane amount of legacies and god tier rolled weapons into the economy, which for the playerbase is actually good. 
---
Apparently this one was being used for awhile before it was made public. B2525 fixers were showing up more and more where it was suspicious, and then the video got posted and it all went to hell.
---
Bethesda should have grown some balls and completely removed them or replace the prefix with the new ones. One less huge issue they could have avoided.
---
LOL!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Bye.
---
Considering how slow the fixes are when problems pop up, I doubt they‚Äôre going that deep on anything. 
---
Tons of people with Elder and other BOS plans would probably disappear, plasma grenade, etc.
---
I didn't get my first good drop until level 113, and that was a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma
---
Can confirm the BOS knight paint is achievable on PS4 too, got it only a week or two ago.
---
I hear ya, me too.
---
happy cake day!
---
Could say how pathetic it is to have to cheat/exploit to have any fun..there‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre banning over it, you shouldn‚Äôt be doing it.
---
This is the big question.
---
However, at this point, they will probably need to see how pervasive the issue is before figuring out how to go about solving the issue - do they extend the season?  Do they increase the number of tasks to do?  Do they use the logged missing score to directly compensate accounts?  And how are they going to compensate for the weeks of messed up challenges that have occurred before the logging?  It's a mess and it's hard to believe that they didn't know for certain that this was solid functionality before going live or at least having the logging function in place from day 0...
---
I think it‚Äôs been several different things. At least once it was an update that brought back an old one.
---
Honestly no. Nobody should be punished for exploiting a buggy game.
---
Items that have been duped should be removed from players' inventories.
---
There's an amazing amount of entitlement in this reasoning.
---
No need to lol, got two other accounts going strong buddy!
---
I‚Äôll be here to give you the weapons you‚Äôve always wanted so you can sit high and mighty and pretend you did everything ok ü§™
---
who is he?where can i find him?
---
I will let him know and hopefully there will be compensation.
---
The game would be so boring if god roll items didn‚Äôt exist/get duped. What‚Äôs the endgame? Most players would chase their dream weapons to have fun. Just because we supply endless amounts of caps to a vendor to get a bunch of god rolls, it isn‚Äôt game breaking. If you think duping is game breaking, then you probably don‚Äôt play the game at all. Because if you do believe that, then it‚Äôs the weapon that‚Äôs game breaking and not duping itself.
---
Were all the previous dailies completed?  I haven't had the issue when all dailies were completed well before change over.  I also stay away until well after change over.
---
I'm a super duper‚ù§
---
It was the same for him all challenges but one were completed.
---
Thanks god that you sir have a brain and actually think about this for more than 10 seconds
---
I had great fill team [off], afk skills. I‚Äôm terrible at NW but got up to 100. It was a boring ride.
---
Or you could let people play how they want?
---
And it's concentrated in one spot. I love Morgantown
---
Well, I just submitted a ticket. Didn‚Äôt mention this in the ticket... but I hope they know what the issue is by now. How long did it take them to get around on this?
---
It a server glitch , just switch servers
---
Same here, though I only had 2 completed (Build Workshop and Huge Creatures).  So frustrating especially since they're worth so damn much!
---
Always enjoy playing with other wastelanders. I‚Äôll add you.
---
Marsupial mutation, a  team with mutations, the strange in numbers perk Card and you can jump even higher, also helps to have a high agility and run faster perks.
---
Had him log in and out several times but to no avail but thank you for the suggestion.
---
So glad you‚Äôre on PC lol glitched lasers.
---
I use the refrigerator backpack.  I can make 40+ cranberry relish and brain bombs and none will spoil.
---
Even though it says it's not as good as the salt card, it is much better than the salt card.  
---
I carry a high cap if I get heavy and need to travel.  Only weighs a pound.
---
Don‚Äôt dupe lol
---
... and it is amazing
---
Oof someone's mad.
---
I get that you were by hyperbolic, however my point was just that carrying such an absurd amount (even just 100 is outrageous) makes little sense. With buffs my carry weight is pretty much always sitting around 475+ but I still regularly clean out my aid section of garbage because I'd rather use my 300+ extra space to pick up more junk/weapons/armor to scrap than have half of it take up by Stimpaks and radaways. I get saving them up to sell though. I did it when I was a much lower level. I probably sound a lot harder in my criticism than I mean to, and if I do I'm sorry.
---
I was thinking this exactly. but I've got a ton saved up.
---
I've played damn near non-stop since the Beta, and having a ego boosting super weapon that 1 shots things isnt exactly what makes Fallout fun for me. I play Fallout, not Borderlands. If the only thing you get out of a game like this is "ooh shiny new toy!" you're better off playing a 1st person shooter like CoD or Battlefield, gets you the ego boosting gratification you want without the rng difficulties.
---
T-60 calibrated shocks
---
Np and sorry to hear that!
---
Do you usually use a backpack?
---
I just did it an hour ago with no issue. A bunch of ore and the sword also. Loot boxes have been loading slowing sometimes for me. Did you try opening the transfer window, that will usual fix it.
---
You get the big damage.
---
Then you post a screen shot of your big damage. Then the other big damage guys compare their big damage to your big damage.
---
And somebody gets to be the alpha big damage.
---
This happened to me and my mom when we were still fairly new. We went to Whitesprings for a quest and Scorchbeasts love to follow my mom so one of them followed us there.
---
Of course we didn't know about the level 60 bloated feral ghouls (which at level 120 it's still a huge F you to them) not the robots that could help you there so we quickly got overrun and died several times.
---
I ran away after respawning and saw a camp. I ran inside and the owner and their friend was also inside. It got completely destroyed by both the Scorchbeast (who was still following us and attacking us) and about 10 bloated feral ghouls.
---
Yes, I know. Ore can of course be smelted into scrap, and gold scrap is worth at least one cap per unit, even if your CHA is in the tank.
---
Lol anyone who's butthole isn't sore from last night got a real answer?
---
The only thing I would cheat about is the legendary weapons and Armour system. It's so fucking annoying.
---
And pray tell how are you finding out your employee is selling dupes on gameflip or eBay? If someone is trying to do things on the hush it's not being found out, especially by Bethesda, they only fix things when it's posted in mainstream or they get crazy amounts of reports. This dupe was around for hella long, wasn't public until a few days ago, because RMT keep them close.
---
Well it comes on then goes offline again so maybe their updating something
---
This is very good news. High level duper‚Äôs got banned and now you are the overlord on server. There will still be plenty of low level noobs joining game and you will be their king now.
---
That's why power armor will always be inferior to SS armor. When you're in PA you can't wear a backpack.
---
Why walk around in a big loud make the ground shake suit if you can't even have a backpack.
---
I earned all my flux.
---
I make all my ammo (and it only takes me 4 minutes per week of effort)
---
Late game is easy.
---
Knowingly cheating is just a reflection of a trashy person IRL.
---
And dont even try contacting Bethesda. They replied to my ticket and basically told me to get fucked.
---
‚ÄúThAtS wHaT yOu GeT fOr RuInInG tHe EcOnOmY‚Äù
---
It is the people with inventories full of duped guns from any of the many dupes, sitting in their high horse pretending they never profited off an exploit
---
The fact that there is a 16% downvote on this post is disturbing.
---
Actually didnt think to do so. Next time it pops up i will
---
Same here
---
Mine was pretty full. I probably just got lucky though.
---
You mean a lot of servers are empty? The ones I joined (PS4) appear normal
---
The barrows is the best spot for ghouls, fyi
---
You aren‚Äôt late game. You don‚Äôt try to farm 15+ queens a day then.
---
Yeah but now the surviving duped weapons are back to ridiculous prices since this happened.
---
Can you start a new charaxter?
---
My character doesn‚Äôt even have a build....specials all evenly distributed and master of nothing. I die a lot. Yesterday I had a level 14 stimpak me at an event, that was embarassing!
---
Yeah, and the my carry weight will go much higher with the excavator armor, or like 20 below my normal state in anything else.
---
I have the power pack too. It's a real time saver.
---
It‚Äôs so ridiculous when I have to provide photo evidence for folks like you. Here you go https://imgur.com/gallery/ZWidT15
---
On a different account but I don't see many people doing that tbh
---
Your backpack gets unequiped when you enter power armor
---
It's fairly easy. What you do is ***redacted*** and voila! Underground!
---
Had 24 tickets got one of these today as well as the western outfit. Nice shotty even though there are no mods available for it. This only has a 1.5% chance of dropping so if you get one hold on to it.
---
It's hilarious the *denial* some people can't see. They honestly believe that by receiving the items it's not part of the problem.
---
I can't wait for the heads to start rolling. Sick of cheating wankers with shit they never *earned* in this game.
---
I stand with you on this so you are not alone! The Op has the right attitude. Fuck the dupers and cheaters! I have no sympathy for those asshats!
---
Looks like a whole lot of back peddling here while the mask slips off.
---
Presumably their developer accounts would be monitored as well as their interactions with non developer accounts. Even if they‚Äôre not actively monitored there‚Äôs a log somewhere, it‚Äôs a huge risk even if you‚Äôre likely to get away with it. Regardless, it sounds like a crackpot theory trying to ascribe to malice what is more likely due to incompetence.
---
Tell us where on the doll the mean 'ol bloodied build hurt you.
---
Doesn't seem like it tbh, you can gather up a lot more in Monongah or Morgantown
---
Hmmm. Sounds like one of the challenge/trophy ~~bugs~~ issues. You might need to start a new character to complete that.
---
He edited his comments. His original post was ‚ÄúThere are no level 59 scorchbeasts. This is lame and gay.‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs normal. Been a problem since they first released it. Not sure how to get a refund. Start with a ticket maybe.
---
Not what I said at all. Someone said I couldn‚Äôt have gotten all my items legitimately. I said that I‚Äôve *personally* bought very little from other players other than scrap and ammo.  That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm saying no one should buy items from other players. 
---
I never said the responsibility of vetting the items was on the players. 
---
I get that you‚Äôre angry. But don‚Äôt twist my words.
---
Your response to actual cheating is appeopriate for your flair
---
The alt isn't the issue, bro.
---
And where are these godroll items you speak of? They're everywhere are they? People were selling them cheap at vendors? Dropping them at train stations? Yeah, I read this subreddit too, but you know what? I didn't see a single duped weapon during this phase. Nothing that would be considered godroll or even worth duping. I didn't find B2525 Fixers for sale for caps, I didn't find discarded weapons in blue suitcases or at NPC vendors.   
---
Stop acting like this was happening on every server and that it was perpetuated by the majority of the playerbase, instead of amongst a select group of people who are now banned and trying to rationalise their ban by telling us they were only trying to help.
---
Exactly what these fellows said, you lose your backpack, plus any of the legendary effects that you had from your normal armor-- so strength and lowered weight. Some people who do a pure power armor build normally don't carry any regular armor on them, so they one jump out for required tasks.
---
Lol then you are playing the wrong game then, because FO76 is the least fallout game ever made and is in fact, more about getting those shiny items that you can use to have fun with while trolling around. Also if you‚Äôve played that long, you probably have a bunch of duped items. So if you want dupers to be banned, then they should just ban every player who is in possession of duped items, because it‚Äôs pretty clear that a lot of people made second accounts to offload stuff from their main account, also it‚Äôs quite clear that a bunch of dupers duped items to give away to everyone plus to their friends.
---
:/ .... this mightave been me. Im so sorry if it was. Is your camp right under the top of the world at pleasent valley. And did you have a bunch of cheap bobbleheads and other goodies. I started to walk away from the camp and i was over encrumbered and dont have serendipity on. I didnt see fuzzy's cage and he or she was not in it. I swear it was self defence. She went peacefully. Im sorry if this was me i was thinking to myself as i walked away " damn i wonder if they camp here to keep that as a pet" but i didnt see anyones name above it so i just shrugged and walked along. Thanks for the 20c bobbleheads üëç i hope fluffy respawns.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know the backpack part, but my carry weight goes up in excavator armor, just nothing else. I haven‚Äôt progressed far enough to grab any SS armor yet sadly.
---
Probably going to get downvoted, but I like the game in theory, like I would love to play, quest, do everything.  Problem is it is hard to access everything.  What I mean by this, is that my character constantly is hungwy or contracted super aids from the forest.  After a fresh dose of super aids I get mauled by some random mutant.  I just want to play the quests without bullshit, I want to kill mobs, I don‚Äôt need to be handheld, but I am tired of having to sneak around places because I am like 30 levels below the mobs I need for a quest.
---
If they did something like ESO where you can just quest anywhere, I‚Äôd be back on in an instant, but until then, I always end up turning on the game, realizing that I have syphillis and am overemcumbered for the 100th time and then I remember why it‚Äôs not fun and turn it off
---
hahahahah. [Come on man, give it up](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hr5ji6/i_love_the_new_score_season_as_long_as_youre_not/fy2l9wd/).  Where is your source for that? Unlike what you seem to think, this is exactly what Bethesda was counting on. 
---
&gt; Most people seem to be on track with finishing it on time, bugs not withstanding, so is it really stacked against the players if most people are going to be able to complete it without having to spend atoms?
---
Ha ha nah I didn't take it as criticism at all, no need to be sorry, I enjoyed the back and forth. 
---
Ultimately I'm just lazy is the answer, and with the mod/carry weight I don't really notice my weight/what I'm carrying until I'm over encumbered, plus I'm having a really strange bug lately where my stimpaks are actually vanishing for no reason, so I've become a bit paranoid.
---
I'll log off with my between 20-70 depending on how long since a clearout and a couple of times I've logged back in with zero. Mystifying.
---
I stopped reading after the first sentence. Blizzard shutdown the Real money auction house because kids were using their parents credit cards on shit yellows and then the parents would chargeback the payment. It was a nightmare for blizzard to keep issuing refunds so they scrapped it.
---
Its funny thou, you fill your photo log, then take another picture and the game says its full, but it still counts and you can go sell it.
---
I think the elder paint already got changed
---
That‚Äôs ok we can just swap, my HM is 1* too but fully nodded and I‚Äôm not using it so you can have it
---
*edit, if you write out the mods here you want here might just be easier to mod yours. Mine is modded exactly as angry turtle instructs
---
That might be a decent idea in theory, but I doubt it would work. The one thing that sort of works in this game is the social aspect, without any content people have to come together to make their own. Would that essentially just be a dark souls-esque softban where flagged cheaters are not allowed to join servers with non-cheaters? How would that work with 1st private worlds? Would you not be able to join your friend's private server if you cheated? If so, then that would go over very poorly with people, but if not, the whole thing would be easily exploitable and therefore pointless
---
Workshop collectrons!! Didn‚Äôt know about this, thank you :)
---
Gotcha, but why does my carry weight increase with just excavator? Like it can be 350 with that or if I go like 51b it shoots down to 210.
---
Probably his butt.
---
Sounds good to me, I'm willing to roll the dice on that. And there is still plenty of Fallout in Fallout 76, and not just since Wastelanders, just takes a little perception to notice it.
---
Amen to this post!!! Please upvote so Bugthesda can read their screw up.
---
Cancel for what? Doing their job and banning cheaters for once? Nobody really cancelled their subs when *real* issues were happening, nobody will cancel over this either
---
i'm fairly new to the game. What is wrong with vats bloody build?
---
MAGA efforts? LOL, politics? WOW. Not even related, how pathetic.
---
Also my regular weight carry is like 230‚Äôish
---
But they‚Äôve all since been banned right? Really ruins its for everyone else :(
---
The excavator has 100  carry weight by default that's maybe why your weight is going up
---
What the hell is with the cheating on this game? I've only played a couple of months and I'm already bored. My character is super tough. I have a fuck ton of good weapons I got from events or just random legendaries. Now I grind sometimes but there isn't really any challenges. I just don't get it. Why cheat?
---
its not many keystrokes.. its easy to type..
---
also.. Exhibit A
---
I don't condone people cheating, but man, I do wonder if I've bought some duped items. How the hell are you supposed to tell? You hop servers, hop vendors, and all the items/prices are so drastically different. Veteran players can probably spot the fishy vendors (I do from time to time) but most people won't be able to tell.
---
Did you suffer the ban hammer? I have mixed feelings. I really want my bloodied fixer with exploding bullets. However the RNG to actually find one is so redic low that trying is almost pointless. 
---
At the same time, if I had one, would I still want to keep playing? Have the whole score thing and SS armor as goals but still, finding that Uber weapon has always been my main goal.
---
If someone offered me one I‚Äôd take it. Most people on the trading sub are dicks frankly.
---
Gavin!
---
Sounds like ages, you need to donate your reward to do it faster. Lie about killing the raider, and give the photos to ether fraction.
---
I traded for at least two duped items (could be up to 5, but I am not sure about 3 of them) and my account isn't suspended. I doubt that people that weren't duping got suspended unless they received an absurd amount of duped weapons in the last few days or they received multiples of the same item.
---
also.. sorry it took me so long to get back to you.. 
---
I was playing on my not banned account....
---
My favourite so far was the guy complaining and saying he'd never done anything wrong.... Other than the 20k presents he'd bought off a website. 
---
I've said it many times, I don't care about duping at all, but these "I didin't do anything, but.." crowd and the idiotic denials and quantifications annoy me way more than whether someone is or isn't "guilty". 
---
Tonight it's actually quite hilarious seeing my posts on the matter go up and down depending which side of the shit head fence has gotten to it at any given time.
---
LMAO you're to much kid. Theginytickler4 on Xbox. Come get it
---
Nah. Bulking stuff just saves storage. Thanks for the tip though.
---
Ok. I only buy from within game via other traders.
---
How are they ruining servers?
---
Oh yeah!
---
That because he might cheat or intentionally benefits from it himself. Its a common thing that these types assumes that -everyone- is a cheater so its OK.
---
I have max settler, raider still has a quarter to go. Settlers are easier to please.
---
Did you still have the Flux when you logged in the next time? I need to know the conclusion.
---
Hmm ok, I‚Äôll have to mess around with gear some more.
---
big plans for the weekend eh?
---
I hope not. Tons if legit people myself included probably brought a duped weapon without realizing it. For example my friend found a be2525 for 3I caps. He told me to come over and I bought one and he bought another weapon. Was it duped? Maybe? But I don't know for certain. As someone who has no concrete proof on what weapons were duped and what weren't it wouldn't be fair to those who played legit.
---
Its probably a bunch of stuff, but for me, the one and only time it has happened was the first time I played NW, the next day most of my dailies auto completed. But I was also online around reset time, so it could have been a combination of those things, or it could be something totally different. Hopefully whatever they have done in the hotfix to help track it works and we get a fix in the near future.
---
too*
---
Isn't that what most people are complaining about though? That their legitimate playing is contaminated by cheated items they can't discern? I just never took the risk, I've bought a handful of items from vending machines but it was always something mid-tier like a two shot fat man or a junkie's minigun. Something that people wouldn't necessarily be incentivized to mass dupe. I would love to see a time where I can actually trust a good deal when I see it
---
its great.. they should ban people more often
---
Nah but I‚Äôm not gonna be on until then lol and the suspense of knowing I might be banned is killing me
---
I also have a TSFFR and it is a glorious weapon - one of my favorites :)  I‚Äôll have to try the vats thing - don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve tried that ...
---
Oh I see you're finally awake
---
Actually no, it doesn‚Äôt take any perception to notice it lol, it does in fact take some perception to understand that FO76 isn‚Äôt like the other fallout games. Get your facts straight and stop sucking up to Todd ‚Äúthe god‚Äù Howard. Was wastelanders a good update? Yes, yes it was. It brought human npc‚Äôs into the game and also added somewhat of a storyline quest, it only took them 2 years to do that. But does it make it into a good fallout game? No, not even close. You want to know what ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù really is? That is if you were trying to argue that it isn‚Äôt a game about finding loot. All of the first Fallout‚Äôs up to 3 and New Vegas were pretty much the embodiment of what Fallout is, not to mention those were also the most successful games. Also not to mention that only 3 was Bethesda‚Äôs only work.
---
So we are supposed to pay.. for a game.. we can‚Äôt play? 
---
What pray tell is a real issue? A big percentage of the player base being put ‚Äúunder investigation‚Äù is certainly cause to cancel. I have friends who aren‚Äôt banned who canceled their sub because the people they play with are banned, by the way all those people did the exact same shit. It wasn‚Äôt even a good ban. Tons of victims, I Will admit to duping, wasn‚Äôt even banned on the account I duped on, just the account I had some weapons on. 
---
Tl;dr: shitty ban, cancelled subs.
---
Dude, I am literally appaled when I see some peoples prices. It takes literally DAYS for me to get over 10,000 caps, and people are charging well over that for rare plans and thousands for decent to average guns. Who buys them? Do they not care if stuff sits in their vendors forever? I dropped a ton of my prices because I was sick of the backlog of stuff i had in my stash.
---
I have almost that exact same one. Two shot ffr reload speed. Sadly it's only level 40, but it still demolishes things. So much fun to use and the ammo isn't too heavy either, I always have it hotkeyed. Biggest issue is how quickly it breaks
---
Personally I think every dupe makes items cheaper which gets them closer to the hands of an average player.
---
Before the dupe if I wanted a B2525 Fixer I'd have to either pay real money for it (which is against ToS just like duping is) or roll on the Purveyor for months and still never get one or anything I could trade for one.
---
During the dupe, that kind of gun could be bought for caps. Which makes them accessible to the average player. 
---
After the dupe idk what it's going to look like, but I hope enough of the duped guns will survive to keep them cheap. It totally sucks to know you could have a really good build if only you could roll 2 perfect weapons and 5 perfect armors at the Purveyor, but the chance of rolling even one perfect item is so small you'll likely never see it.
---
IDK but I bet dude is typing the saltiest paragraph ever.
---
Here's hoping that it 'works'
---
Yo my man you a fool and here your proof from back in May when they first announced SCORE System 
---
‚ÄúIf you join a Season late and want to catch up, or if you just want to progress more quickly, you will have the option to spend 150 Atoms to immediately unlock the next rank and claim its reward. If you want, you can unlock every Rank in the Season this way, but they must be purchased individually and in order. Additionally, you cannot unlock Ranks this way during the first two weeks of a Season, so that all players can start on an even footing. Keep in mind that spending Atoms to rank up is optional. The Season system was designed so that all players will have immediate access to it, and can progress and claim rewards based on how much S.C.O.R.E. they earn while playing 76.‚Äù
---
Here your [source](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault- introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons)
---
What gibberish are you talking
---
Definitely try it on some moving enemies, preferably when they're moving left to right or right to left across the screen. You will marvel at your amazing homing grenades, trust me.
---
I think they did. Or they might've shruken the size of light source in camp budget. Ive notice the different as well when I redid my camp today.
---
Yes I just got a paint the other day from a tech data turn in.
---
Think you got an extra zero on that level number. The board would take 15000 atoms to complete. 150x100 is 15000
---
clearly youre worried about it.. so chances are chances are..
---
You also act like Bethesda has the resources to keep tabs on every single employees gamertags and newly created gamertags and psns. You don't need a special account to dupe, hell, all the expert rmt dupers make throwaway accounts and even have second xbox's in case of an IP ban. These traders are making more money than an Bethesda average employee hands down, so why not make the extra cash on the side? You don't need any links whatsoever to your employer to make money off duping and RMT.
---
Personally I think duper‚Äôs are the unsung heros of the trading community. I personally wouldn‚Äôt risk the ban myself, but for those who do, our inventories salute you.
---
It was awesome lol
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
Idk if it‚Äôs a glitch or not but I was able to craft all the mods onto the small backpack. Just had to learn the plans which I found in player vendors
---
&gt; What weapon was getting duped?
---
Anything that could be sold to a robo vendor was fair game. All the rare legacy explody energy guns, God roll fixers and handmades, bear arms, bobble heads, bulk junk, etc. None of it is rare anymore.
---
I hope so the suspense is killing me!
---
There is no legit reason for cheating/duping. If its too hard or not worth the grind, then move on to another game. No one is forcing anyone to play FO76. That being said this game is very tame with rng. You don't need that TSE weapon to kill anything in this game.
---
Page not found üòÇüòÇüòÇ if you don‚Äôt believe the community calendar then I can‚Äôt help you.

Yea I figured that but he ain‚Äôt backing down lol
---
Those who make easy bucks from the exploits will always defend their action by portraying themselves as the messiah who came to save the poor players from their RNG master. Then there are those who just want everything as soon as they bought the game. Any ‚Äògrind‚Äô is too much. Those who duped treasury notes are really funny too. At the end of the day they want to get cool stuff by not playing the game. What do they plan to do after they get all the cool stuff and not playing? Just sit there appreciate the stuff? I don‚Äôt really get it. It‚Äôs like going to a beach but instead of trying to find a beautiful shell by himself, some would head straight to the gift shop and call it a day lol
---
I'm so pissed off, I didn't get banned, but one of my friends did and they didn't dupe or do anything wrong. One my friends is level 44 and he just tried the game out on Xbox gamepass, loved it, and he bought fallout 1st. He didn't dupe, he picked up dropped armor in a bag at Whitesprings. 
---
My question is why? What did he do wrong? He is suing Bethesda for fraud and I don't blame him, he just dropped $100 and didn't even have it a week and all he got was an email saying they were investigating and suspending his account. Pretty pathetic.
---
I cancelled mine when update 20 hit and turned Fallout 76 into Fallout: Candyland.
---
Go dupe someone that cares.
---
You tried common sense..... Greedy Smiley didn't like that!
---
Why did you get so many downvotes?
---
It has aspects of one. But really isn't. It feel like Skyrim with that multi-player mod.
---
Honestly, as a person who refuses to use exploits in any way, in any game, it sounds like those servers would be the place to be lol. I recognize that the whole grind economy would be ruined and therefore trading would fall apart for them, but also no point in trading when you always have the best of everything.  The only real downside is pvp becoming unplayable but if we‚Äôre being real with eachother it‚Äôs been unplayable since launch lol
---
I still can't complete Heart of the Enemy after almost 2 fucking years. It's the one achievement I have left. üòï
---
I think the fact theyre selling for 5k should of been enough of a tell to kno theyre pretty rare (for most ppl) lol but keep ridin that lucky wave. Its a good money maker.
---
Didn't even take me 2 hours. And it would have been quicker but i stupidly made a crossbow instead of finding one. i had to use it for about 30 mins to get the extra condition down enough to damage it. Archery, Swimming, Athlete. No time at all. I was put off doing it for ages because of people saying it took forever. One day i was just bored so i thought i may as well do it and i when i did it quickly i was like 'thanks reddit i could have had this done 2 months ago''
---
There is a power connection on the roof for me and I cAn just go up the the door and interact with it to open and close without a switch
---
Glad I never bought those weddings rings with AP regen I saw in a vendor one time.
---
Then it's still possible but much less likely. It shouldn't happen often enough to ever get you flagged for a ban, at least. The general rules are essentially this:
---
If it's from somebody on a trading discord or subreddit: nearly guaranteed to be cheated
---
If a player runs up to you and drops you something really good: nearly guranteed to be cheated
---
If there's a bunch of non-scrip legendaries in a train station container: guaranteed to be cheated
---
If there's a bunch of scrip legendaries in a train station container: nearly guaranteed to be cheated
---
With everything else it's fair game, but fairly unlikely unless it's very obvious like 60k ultracite ammo. Like with many things in life, the only 100% safe way is to never engage with anybody and only use what you find, but if you only buy from people's vending machines, you should be fairly safe
---
I have 3 toons I rotate on PC.. all I have done is not be logged in playing the game at noon eastern US time.. have not once had autocomplete glitch..
---
that said.. if they do decide to advance all players a certain number of spaces on the board in compensation.. I certainly hope nothing I may or may not have said in regards to this issue will be used against me by bethesda
---
Nope haven't suffer it and for most part I already had my endgame weapons and this was like an add-on for legacy's
---
They should just give everyone like 5k xp as a sign of good will.  I doubt they would do anything that would impact people potentially buying levels, but if they cared and wanted to earn some good will after yet another serious bug, they really should do something.
---
I treat this game like Animal Crossing with guns. I grind for caps, I shop player vendors for things that I don't have, or things that I can re-sell for profit, I build up my CAMP regularly, I relocate often for new scenery, I garden and farm, I collect junk, I constantly swap/improve my weapons, I learn plans and recipes, I take pictures all the time. I run a soft Bloodied Build (keep health between 30-50%) because I like hitting hard but I prefer to have some survivability. I'm always having fun. 
---
Cheating isn't fun for me. Cheating is cheating. The game isn't perfect but it's enough for me.
---

---
Seems to be happening often. My commando and my melee ninja are having problems too. Enemies don't receive damage even when the hit is clear and I get damage numbers.
---
It is similar to the 'melee hit detection bug' which has been with us since forever. 
---
You hit, but you don't really hit.
---
Full Excavator has an passive +100 carry weight, if calibrated shocks on both legs +100 more.
---
The cryo effect from the cryolator, it works on a player even if you are not in pvp with them. You can be in pacifist and the cryo effect will work on you
---
Weird
---
Nope I'm on console they're so op for an level 5 weapon
---
I‚Äôm worried not because I duped but because I bought 6 Legacies and they might be duped
---
How were they being traded? To my knowledge anything bought with bullion can‚Äôt be traded or duped
---
I dont think it's a glitch, I'm able to as well
---
Those laser guns were an absolute game changer for me when I found out, you will never worry about that shit anymore.
---
Nothing. It‚Äôs the meta and sometimes folks find distaste in what‚Äôs in trend.
---
Good riddance!
---
Your point is very relatable because for myself the best weapon i ever got from the purveyor was a 2* Be 10mm smg was a good weapon back then until they nerfed bloodied and stealth builds because then i couldnt use a gun without silencer anymore.
---
But then i had to grind 1 month of trading and farming legendarys to get a Bffr+agi handmade it was alot i had to do in order to get that weapon and in my opinion the marekt before the dupe was dead because nobody wanted to trade their good weapons away but at the same time everybody wanted good weapond so i rarely saw deals happening in that time
---
When you say forever how long are we talking here? 10 hours?  6 hours? 2 hours? 
---
Because if it took more than 2 hours you must have picked the wrong 3 to do
---
I‚Äôm not sure tbh
---
No dude it‚Äôs the hoarding of weapons I have been saving since the beta and countless tradings and sales for caps and ammo that caught their eyes. Since I have a ton of gear on all my characters. Because no duping went down on my behalf. Since I didn‚Äôt want to get suspended. But I guess I did after all.. it‚Äôs funny how stupid Bethesda is really instead of fixing the adrenaline perk card and the scorchbeast queen landing issue. They literally destroyed their own game. With 80% of their player based gone lol!!
---
cool :) have a spare fixer or legacy lying around? üòÖ
---
Im here to comment because we know this post will be removed or berried.
---
God I wish I could have interviewed you for one of my projects in a past criminal psychology class.
---
He doin it wrong. Vats bloody is Chad op.
---
Sure, whatever you say, good riddance!
---
You seem like you‚Äôre a lot of fun to be around :)
---
Most people play normally, but there are a lot of people who play games just to break them, and 76 is a ripe target.
---
"Get your facts straight" when you provide no facts, just the tired "the first Fallouts were the only Fallouts" when you likely never played them, not to mention that 3, NV, and 4 respectively sold much more copies than either Fallouts 1 or 2.
---
There is actual story in Fallout 76, but if it is lost on you then that is entirely ok, I can't say I'd expect you to be capable of looking for it when you have to take shortcuts just to get your weapons and armor.
---
Yes I do but I won't touch them for about week to be safe
---
...really? Something that changed absolutely nothing content-wise made you cancel it, and not all the issues the game has had? Whatever, based on the past reaction of this sub, you're probably going to buy it again within the next month anyway, but if you're sure of yourself and stick with it, power to you
---
Actually it could. Remember that one of the ways Bethesda tracks stuff is looking at the influx of certain items into people's inventories. This is why you sometimes have white knights that at least claim all they did was steal a million items from a duper so they could jump in a fissure with it that get hit with bans. If you buy a dupers wares in mass quantities you can get hit just the same.
---
Ya people thought nuke mines were annoying, cryolators are annoying as hell
---
Never seen a glitched laser on console.
---
Sigh.
---
It doesnt matter. It breaks the rules, so people who cheated get banned. Thats how the game works, thats how the world works. Nothing that you can say is going to change any of this.
---
The bow is a lot more fun than I thought it'd be. I had a Junkie's Explosive Bow (also had Cryo arrows available) and man, it took some getting used to, but the boom is so satisfying when the shots land. I eventually sold it because I already run with way too many weapons on me but it was very fun when I had it.
---
When player vending was first launched I picked up several good legacy items just by dumb luck. I‚Äôm 99.99% sure that those weren‚Äôt duper-related because the sellers were either selling everything dirt cheap (max caps no mule alt), or selling everything based on their in-game caps price (didn‚Äôt realize certain items are rarer than others). That time has long passed, now everyone wants 3k for a stalkers rolling pin.
---
Just run the event riding shotgun 2x and you'll max out your caps for the day plus some. Way better than water.
---
This bullsh*t and I don‚Äôt blame your friend for suing Bethesda. They are low AF with their ‚Äútactics‚Äù to eliminate glitchers. I have no respect for Bethesda.
---
Keep in mind it's only a weight loss for aluminum and leaf though! Don't be like me in the beginning and waste all your plastic to bulk up bullshit..
---
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE, MAN.
---
Well I still see Gameflip with sales active at that prices are back high on amor and weapons and I still see Gameflip accounts active and not banned. So really who is loosing here?? The majority of people were buying from their atomic shop and FO1st membership.  Looks like to me that Bethesda just shot their own foot lol!! Let me grab my popcorn and see we‚Äôre this goes lol!!
---
I know, thanks for agreeing that it doesn‚Äôt matter, cuz that‚Äôs what I wanted, it‚Äôs all just a game
---
More like an explicit legally binding contract.
---
Welch Station
---
Hey mate I read on here speak to Duchess and buy an item from her and it *might* fix the issue. I've only had the issue once as I usually have enough caps to buy on Smiley Sunday reset day.
---
mate just jump on in and play solo doing your thing, you gonna like it, a lot of challenges to overcome with normal gear, and a lot of fun with some little grind to get the secret service gear to unlock.
---
Jump into the water, get the rads where you want them to be and then, just eat and drink. Rads in food will keep you irradiated, and if you get tooooo low on hp, just take a diluted radaway. 
---
That's my method. Food and diluted radaway. 
---
Keeping some inert flux with you also helps.
---
It's an gltiched laser from nw the damage output is high and oh God the range on that thing is so amazing üòç
---
It's all better cause it's only lvl 5 I've blessed so many new game pass players with those
---
Might.
---
Yeah you probably didn‚Äôt read anything that‚Äôs written lol, and if you think 76 has story, then I‚Äôm sorry to break it to you, but you, have no sense of ‚Äústory‚Äù. Also the facts? It‚Äôs all laid out in the game, if you play it, then you should know it, unless you are blind or just love to suck off Todd. I mean, even the game ratings before wastelanders was concrete evidence, wastelanders is what FO76 at launch should‚Äôve been, and the game should‚Äôve just improved from there on outüëè
---
Please link me to the whining of banned dupers, I want to sleep warm and fuzzy tonight.
---
"you have been insulted"
---
This is why they quit speaking to the fans because of toxic fandom like this, good lord.
---
They still charged me bro.
---
If no one told me duping was going on Id never know.  Everyone is a God already it's impossible to tell if people have perfect guns.
---
:(
---
TIL CMs work on fixing games.
---
The only ones who can make the distinction is Bethesda. They have the records, they presumably know which criteria they used for the ban that could be susceptible to catching innocent players, and they have a support staff that will (eventually hopefully) sort it out. Yeah, it sucks for them, but it‚Äôs an inherent consequence of an online game susceptible to exploitation.
---
It‚Äôs only bad if I get one
---
Yep, but it's not the first dupe/ban wave. Next set of weapons coming with BOS are definitely going to be character loocked like Wastlanders.
---
The suspensions and bans are actually bad for Bethesda in one major way: The spell has been broken! How many people who duped or traded for duped goods were playing for hours EVERYDAY? How many were obsessed with this game? How many played it exclusively? How many have/had Fallout First?
---
I get it, "duping is bad, mmkay?" Making people play the lottery every time they kill a legendary enemy, or exchange scrip to the Purveyor, or finally being able to craft legendary gear...is that good?
---
We agreed to the TOS, yes, but does BGS not also have terms they should agree to? Like not making players spend 100 hours grinding reputation just to get the ability to grind more for their lotto tickets? 
---
We're addicts. They're our dealers. And they just made some of their customers go cold turkey.
---
I'm aware my analogies are messy af right now, I apologize. I'm going through withdrawals.
---
First step is admitting you have a problem.
---
The sunken bace is one of the largest contributers to glitching servers. They only thing worse for server senility is the mules filled with 50 or 60 of the same dupped items.  Being beyond the map boarders causes the engine to loses tracking this causes extra processes to be usesed and every time you make things beyond the boarder the errors begin compileing. But seeing you use trash box crash it for all I care
---
Aw ok, thank you üôèüèª
---
It is fun. I would love to be able to set camp there. Lots of tall buildings, great view.
---
It was so rampant and obvious, who in their right mind was going to trade their prize handmade for 10k leader bobbleheads? Who thought duping random items was ever a good idea? 
---
It was never going to end well for them with a game pass launch on the same week they decided to dupe, the game is going to have more players rather than less at the end of this month regardless of bans.
---
clearly..

Fairly active. Shoot me a message wastelander

I honestly don't understand why people like that play video games, or do literally anything else for that matter, if you don't want to put the effort in, actually earn the reward, what's the point?
---
I'm already at the point where I have everything I wanted from bullion (full secret service and solar plans) and I'm just buying random crap, sometimes I don't even bother to turn them in, they didn't need to cheat that too lmao I didn't even know about that one
---
Today I bought dirt tiles purely to test if the increased explosive radius perk (I forget what it's called) works on turbofert grenades, and I have like 1000 just sitting there with nothing I want to buy
---
I love that analogy lmao it's perfect, that's also the kind of person who then takes it home and says "hey everyone, look at this shell I found"
---
I was actually referring to the ‚Äòplay nice with others‚Äô part, even if it‚Äôs not spelled out in ToS.
---
GL
---
With a name like yours, that‚Äôs f*ing funny.
---
Time to sell mothman
---
Good job accepting responsibility for you actions.  Hope yes get perma nuked.
---
Not a single person I know has gotten banned who was not involved in either duping or muling cheated items, so that's at least something I'm not aware of being an issue. I don't know what big percentage you're talking about or where it comes from, but I hope you don't mean that 80% meme somebody posted earlier. Xbox and ps4 don't give out that info, steam numbers are practically the same as before the ban wave. I know demon's discord has been in full damage control mode spreading lies and that silly little petition, but the truth is the vast majority of players were legitimate and unaffected by this. If you cheated and got rightfully banned, sure, cancel your sub, but that should be a given. Doesn't seem like there is any cause for actual players to cancel too if they haven't cancelled after everything else the game put them through already
---
If you die right as an event ends, you may experience the respawn bug which prevents you from respawning at all. The only solution is to restart the game. If you have a friend in the server, you may be able to recover your loot and loot the boss *IF* you are lucky.
---
Cool, dude
---
Feels great doesn't it
---
Anyone else the food holder for they're team...I am now
---
Let me lick those sweet tears of your cheeks ...hmmm so salty
---
I didn‚Äôt dupe lol, I bought weapons that might‚Äôve been duped
---
Because I wanted to play Fallout 4 with my friends. I didn‚Äôt play to spend a lot of time getting good gear just for that to be taken away to restart economy. I don‚Äôt play to have my build become the weakest because my weapons and armor are gone. I don‚Äôt care about the caps economy. I sell ammo for 1 cap each. If people buy it, cool. If they don‚Äôt, oh well.
---
I agree with this.  I've played gacha games for years and the concept of "apolo-"&lt;premium currency&gt; is as old as the model, and they rely on cash shop purchases even more than FO76 does since the game itself is F2P.  Things as stupid as typos in event notices get apolo-gems in the games I play.  It's never a game-breaking amount, but it shows that they at least acknowledge they made an error.  Bethesda just doesn't seem to give a shit beyond doling out platitudes.

That is very strange. What platform are you on? Haven't noticed any items disappearing on Ps4. The only explanation I could think of for why it would happen would be if you dropped all your Stimpaks and then picked them back up right before logging out, but the server last saved before you picked them back up and never registered that they were back in your inventory.
---
As you might or might not realized, that game hasn't had a content update in 7 months. Not to say there won't be any in the future, but for the past 7 months there been nothing.
---
I've gotten a few good deals, but it's usually amid random junk that makes it seem like a normal player just offloading stuff. Junk legendaries for less than 10 caps/scrip, rarer outfits for cheap, event plans, etc. I paid a few thousand each for the mid-tier legendaries I've gotten off vending machines, only exception was a junkie's hitman's smg that was only 450 or so. That was a long time ago though, so I guess it could have still been those glory days

Lol I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs salty at all, honestly it‚Äôs just funny the amount of idiots who comment don‚Äôt actually even know how many bugs and glitches this game has. All the goody two shoes are praising bugthesda for banning players yet they don‚Äôt seem to care about other issues that haven‚Äôt been fixed. Hip hip hooray üëè
---
Over half bought duped items thru vendors or player vending machines.
---
I hated lying to Davenport.  Also theOverseer is a full on GILF.
---
This game has fairly regular updates granted it comes with bugs and frustration but it does have content updates
---
Its super annoying. The only work around if found is looking for a workbench near a window to use. It teleports you into the base.
---
All you need is a gun with over 200 RPM and one of like 10 legendaries on it and it just does more damage than it should If you hit multiple shots in a row. If the SBQ didnt move I could use my mini gun to do it in seconds.
---
That's just something wrong in the game though
---
No, the worst ever is Square Enix.
---
That‚Äôs a good answer. 12 DefiantQuiet. 12 skins
---
I'm glad i didn't bought that Bloodied Explosive -25VATS ProSnap Deluxe Camera i've saw one day
---
It's for these kind of situations I really wish the game was somewhat balanced and allowed open world pvp. People are more respectful and the ass hats will eventually get their dues. Thanks for sharing.
---
Are they 6 of the exact same weapon? Zero chance you'll get perma banned unless you had an outrageous amount. Temp ban at most. And this is coming straight from bethesdas post on the matter
---
Thanks
---
Cut the virtuous Robin Hood crap. Most of this dupe ended up on rmt sites or being offered for trades for legacies or rare weapons you didn‚Äôt have so you could dupe and or sell. I walked into train stations during this dupe and was met with thumbs down/ angry emotes if I was there too long, rather than a God roll weapon as you seem to be implying dupers gave or sold to the community for caps.
---
You can earn both Halloween and Christmas NW rewards.
---
Everyone complains about duping but I dont hear anyone complaining about that God tier gun they bought cheap from someone's camp
---
I know the Halloween and Christmas items are available, not sure about Vault Tec and Wastelander (the one with the ghillie suit, I don't remember its exact name) challenges, I had already completed those
---
I might - might use the Atom Rewards after Rank 50ish to move forward to the step ahead of the Atom Rewards. Might.  Thinking about it.  Not sure yet...
---
Steam number are way down today. Your argument is literally ‚Äúhere is my anecdotal evidence, your anecdotal evidence is wrong‚Äù  
---
I never claimed a number, but it‚Äôs certainly a chunk of the player base, to deny that is absurd
---
Further, multiple reports of people not participating in the dupe, but being banned. Games pass people who happened to be given a gun they didn‚Äôt know what to do with, banned. Meanwhile my alt gamertag that I used all weekend to dupe, didn‚Äôt get banned. This attempt at weeding out the dupers fell far short of the mark.
---
As a handmade user this is amazing. Keep it coming. As a Fallout fan, ALL GUNS NEEDS LOVE. Please look after my fellow dudes in the wasteland Beth and let's all get some skin.
---
I want a radium skin
---
Well this reply turned out like the release day of the burrows- over in 20 minutes and highly unfulfilling.
---
Only if you side with them. Raiders have the extra mission for mirelurk meat everyday, and on top of that, feels less boring to do thanks to have two daily quests rather than just one.
---
To be honest I'd say most people have handled a duped weapon or even own one by now. Think you're safe
---
BE15 Gat Plas, AAE Gat Plas, BE Flamer, TSE Dragon, BE Tesla, BE Laser Pistol
---
As for kid in 49 and I dont use xbox but thanks for the user name makes the reporting alot easier reporting with screen shots Bethsoft has been swinging that ban hammer hard lately since I use pcs I'll just grab the game pass and get your bace with screen caps also hope you can get your mom to buy you a new Xbox and you don't have to much spent in creation club they consel ban from all Bethsoft services
---
This feels like the opposite of a positive outcome. I agree if you duped and got banned you deserve it, but I have to bring this up.
---
I can't find a server with more than 3 level 70+s so the question becomes...how is any endgame player supposed to play this game anymore?
---
I actually enjoy this game
---
Riiiiight, cause duping never took place until now. Weak.
---
this bug has been around since launch
---
I had a one star Weightless auto launcher a while back, used it just to burn through some 40mm I had lying around. Tons of fun, but was notorious for breaking constantly. Also crippled my limbs during every fight, but that was more my fault :p
---
I'm just passing by. Ooooooh some justice bans! Let's see if I can spot someone saying it is the developer's fault for it being in the game. Maybe I'll see a wild "if other people are doing it and I'm not, I'll be behind everyone else"!
---
And they‚Äôll never be able to use that bank account in any bethesda game again. They‚Äôll pay out of pocket, then never do business with them again.
---
Cheater pool would be great if done right. GTA's bad sport feature was abused to high hell tho, and often punished the wrong player.
---
Regarding impressionable young kids, it is the same thing about colleges, at age 17 pick which state government run institution of higher learning you‚Äôd like to donate $60,000 of federal government money to. Oh by the way you need this degree to do what most people used to be able to do with a high school diploma.  
---
I‚Äôve gathered this:
---
Everything is setup in this country to try to keep you working for 40+hrs a week for 40+years, mortgages, social security, lack of health insurance outside of a full time job.  Because once you stop working they stop getting their 25% from you and you go from being an asset to a liability.
---
The amount of people on the cusp of retirement that I know working jobs they dislike just to have insurance coverage is ridiculous.  10+ just in my department.
---
time to ask for a refund then, thanks!
---
I was too lazy to do do the math but something didn't seem to be adding up.... I knew they'd pull some bullshit like this
---
Oh man. I remember FFXI. Jeeeeeesus. Those drop rates.
---
What armor did he pick up?
---
I mean, if they‚Äôre banned why would they still pay for fallout 1st?
---
Excavator actually increases carry weight (https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator_power_armor) at the cost of having one of the lowest DR for powerarmor
---
LULZ
---
I have my vendors inside hooked up just fine like that.
---
Truth. While there are people that get caught up accidentally, most of the time you feel bad for someone it goes like: I didn't dupe dunno why I got banned, ok possibly might've duped, but it wasn't that bad, hey having 5000 of the rarest masks was only for their own collection they weren't hurting anyone, and further downhill from there.
---
Seriously kids, it isn't worth it.
---
Because MMO literally stands for Massive Multiplayer Online. These servers arent massive
---
I got lucky that it's space themed since I do a Science! themed CAMP but even then most of this is stuff I wont use like that garish armor paint.
---
Idk about that lol. I'm not very involved, I just saw this post about a ban spam and was curious as to what the terms are because as I said I'm not positive that I have nothing that someone else has duped. It doesnt really matter though since i only played when i did with my wife and we've moved onto other things.
---
Guys anyone have good low lev gear i have a few hundred caps if its not to much trrouble
---
I disagree i myself have not duped but i feal that it is ok in small quantities like maybe just to finish 1 or 2 more crafting mods or guns  but i don‚Äôt agree with abusing duping into the thousands of items for me that takes a lot out of the overall exploration to find those items
---
I didn‚Äôt know anyone else was doing this. I‚Äôve just been trying to get a good mush cloud picture from the lighthouse
---
I played a few hours tonight and it seemed pretty full.
---
I‚Äôve got a scorched DC on my alt. I don‚Äôt think the queen could kill his stubborn ass. This regular run-of-the-mill DC is the one I‚Äôm trying to get rid of. I never thought about the pacifist mode aspect. Pretty sure my brother won‚Äôt have any problems taking him out once I turn pacifist off. I even went and dropped my camp module by a fissure thinking that would take care of him.... Played for about an hour and then went ahead and started building in the location I wanted originally. 30 minutes into my build, SOB comes strolling up
---
If my brother can‚Äôt get it done, I‚Äôll kite something to him
---
Because they‚Äôre being a butthole about it.
---
I was able to place the armor bench with no issues today
---
Oh I'm fine with them getting it cancelled.  
---
I'm just glad the garbage is out of the game.
---
150k could buy you a real nice car, a house in some places, or the worlds best gaming room with top of the line everything and enough money to keep you rolling in games + snacks for many years.
---
Or like you said changed many peoples lives for the better.
---
Mind blowing.
---
Why?
---
Lode boring is more like it. Sucks
---
This was what I thought the gold press machine was for, taking gold scrap
---
Wastelander challenges unlock as well, just got the ghillie suit yesterday
---
No, they didn‚Äôt patch the ability to build underground camps. I doubt they can completely, there are many ways to do it.
---
I am sure you will be back though if you can't exploit/cheat enough in Destiny.
---
ü§¶
---
Most the trading sub is like "*your shitty game will suck without us!*" right now.
---
K bye
---
A week roughly
---
tbh, I don't really want the Assault Rifle to get any choice skins until it's buffed to not be completely inferior to the Handmade. 
---
I think part of the reason the Handmade is getting the total model-swap skins like the R91 and Screaming Eagle is animations, too; the magazine on the Assault Rifle is on the side, and the Combat Rifle/Fixer doesn't have a pistol grip on the stock like the Handmade does. Then again the animations for the Handmade *still* don't line up with the Screaming Eagle right now, so I'm hoping they're taking the time to adjust the animations for this and the R91 before they continue with any more full model-swaps like this.
---
people couldn't cope with having to eat and drink now and then
---
Lol!!
---
Yeh I want a combat rifle skin
---
Stop talking.
---
Daguerre's a synth
---
Never said it wasnt a game. Cheaters get bans. Not really anything else about it to say.
---
I was already tired of the game so it‚Äôs no big deal. Only thing I was working towards was to get an explosive flamer. End game achieved
---
Well yeah, but compared to the fixer, which goes for double the price and with my own personal experience in the matter, you can understand why I said semi-rare :P
---
No unfortunately if you already own bundle items you still pay full price for the bundle.
---
Ok that makes more sense, I‚Äôve only been playing about a month so I‚Äôm still a noob haha.
---
Level 10 one star leather vanguard
---
I think this happens when you drink crafted alcohols from Biv‚Äôs quest line- like Ballistic Bock or High Voltage Hefe.
---
Yeah I probably should have chosen something other than one of the photo quests. When I finally sat down to do it, it wasn't hard or extremely time consuming, just, boring I guess? I dunno, all I know is after doing it twice I don't want to do it again on top of the other grinds they have added.
---
I dunno man, it's happened twice recently and I'm on PC so there's no real way to drop them without doing a lot of actions, especially with them favourited and having the warning etc.
---
I am usually more than willing to accept human error, because it happens for sure, but in this case I jsut have no idea. I don't even know if other stuff is vanishing, that's just the one you notice most when you are about to die and have no stims :D
---
I just drank a Hoppy Hunter IPA so I am pretty sure this is it. Thanks!
---
Can't fit a car in them though for when they add them... can fit a bicycle from Generation Zero in it though.
---
I only like cheating if it's fun like using a bot in diablo II to steal loot from someone else's bot
---
That would be awesome
---
Yup that‚Äôll do it. No problem
---
You‚Äôre a prophet
---
Let's just say that wasn't added but like radstorms. Frank that up to 100 and you got those blizzards in metro where if you see it coming. Your ass better run and find a place to hunker down for a bit. I think a Collab with the studio deep silver would be dope
---
wahhh wahhh wahhh
---
Agreed - as a Blood-Died I will not Happenstance inward Your Place of Purveyance should it funnel me through any form of Decontamination Apparatus.   It‚Äôs not You it‚Äôs Me.
---
What a shit idea, people will just dupe Gold.
---
I‚Äôm sorry dude but what made you this fucking stupid reviving duped weapons either means you revived them without knowing,knowing or being ignorant asf but saying that people duped if they got some duped fucking ammo they shouldn‚Äôt ban duper‚Äôs they should ban your stupid ass
---
Power armor needs a big buff
---
I personally am trying to grind to at least 50, then just buy the rest. I have the atoms saved up (most for free and some from my FO1st). 
---
I dont care about the tier buying since I won't get to 50 for at least 2 or 3 more weeks. 
---
I'm only doing this because I won't reach 100 otherwise as I spend a lot of my time playing other games, but I dont want to miss out on rewards yknow
---
I could quickly load up a new Fallout 4 character that's fat and male and console  command in the Nuka Cola Rocketsuit outfit if you want to see a pic. Although in my opinion it probably wouldn't be the most flattering apparel choice.
---
I would enjoy this but like another commenter said, folks have a pretty hard time adjusting to keeping their characters feed and hydrated.
---
It's a build for people with 0 skill that have to glitch and exploit to try and keep up with people that don't suck but the bloody is easy to merc quad ammo gama gun you wont even reload before they are dead vats is for people that can't aim so mainly call of duty players chose this even know that they can't play without aim asist
---
great... the scorched have synths now...
---
Yeah I used to love PA in the other games, but now it just feels like more of a pain than it‚Äôs worth.
---
Exactly my plan. By the time I get to 50, I should have enough saved up (mainly from Fallout 1st and saving free atoms prior), I'll just buy the rest as I don't have the time to invest into the game nor do I want to invest the time. I play a lot of other games and just wanna have the rewards to when I do play fallout they're there. However I'm not gonna waste atoms on easy tiers lmao
---
&gt; you are just to stupid to wrap
---
Calling someone else stupid is a bold move when you don't know when to use "too". 
---
&gt; because guess what, they are just as guilty
---
This is extremely flawed logic.  A secondary buyer does not know if the item was duped or gotten from Murmrgh.  In the short time I have been playing, there have been 3 sales at Murmrgh that have introduced countless number of legendries.  Not all buyers can't tell the difference between a dupe and a Murmrgh special sale.
---
RNG is tame?
---
Lets say you want a good Handmade. You want B/25/25 Handmade.
---
Your choices are go to the purveyor and can only get 1.5 three star legendaries a day, for a chance to get the weapon you want, with a chance, for a chance, for a chance of the three stars you want. That's 4 RNG you have to through right there. Wouldn't be so terrible if there wasn't time gating with scrip, which is a common theme in this game.
---
Done with the purveyor? Now we go to legendary mobs.
---
You have a chance of a legendary spawning, but you need three stars, so that's a chance right there. Then you have another chance of that legendary dropping one or two star legendary. That's 2 RNG factors right off the bat, now you have the additional RNG for the weapon and three stars you want. 
---
RNG in this game is NOT tame.
---
Facts
---
NP
---
If you‚Äôre still on dude, I can help you right now, no charge man
---
True words
---
Steam numbers are not down you can see that here https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340
---
Don't worry about getting banned, if Bethesda were to track *every* duped item, most of the trading playerbase would just get shot down
---
Ya but the fixer has more value than a backpack skin even if the drop rates are exactly the same so its price reflects that.
---
(speculation): great, bethesda, comes up with some nonsense that you have to buy a spcial currency, not atoms, but like Zorbo Bucks, or Captain Cosmos Coins - just to use for the legendary run. because ya know, just having one currency in a game is too easy. 
---
Then they limit cap the amount you can buy (or use) each week...
---
... damn synths
---
I wouldn't say hard but more of an annoyance. Let's say that was removed . How would that affect the game in a setting like that ?! Curious to have y'all's take. What could add more survival but not be an annoyance but add a good challenging aspect to it.
---
That's the thing. It's not a miss per say, it's just no damage. You hit successfully but you do zero damage. Seems to happen regularly when target runs for cover, for example when a scorched runs behind a tree. He's basically invisible during his run, and when he finally stops he becomes killable again.
---
this guy fucks
---
I plan to play as usual until the end of the season and then buy the rest of what's left.  I'm over 1/4 the way there and we still have around 2 months left
---
Makes sense
---
just got off the phone with bethesda they said your good to go
---
Lmao after Beth's recent track record, it's not that big of a loss
---
It's not a miss though. The shot is successful, it just doesn't do any damage.
---
Considering higher up places with views and water, there is a spot southwest of Big Bend Tunnel East. It overlooks the cranberry bog/SBQ nuke zone
---
Its kinda of a popular spot tho so dont be surprised if there is already base there
---
I accidentally duped some items the other day. I got on real quick, made a couple of guns for a friend. She picked them up so I got off. When I got back on they were still in my inventory. So I scrapped them ASAP. No idea why it happened
---
I hate to be a bother but I finished the Foundation questline. Jen seems to think I killed her mother, Radcliff thinks I killed Digger. Beckett thinks I killed his brother. I absolutely did not do any of these three things.
---
How is this so bugged?
---
You wont get banned for going under the map, my bloodied VATS commando has had a base like that for a long time (hense my interest in op pitiful reply!). I'm not into budget exploiting or anything but the underneath of the map can make some seriously cool looking builds.
---
Had this issue but went to annoy and saw that a laser gat was using them as ammo. Had to drop the Gatling then put the core in the PA.
---
I don't see a problem with this. There are resource nodes and extractors for a reason. Scrap gold could easily be converted with a kiln camp item and coal as the heat source. This investment alone would make the resource farmer balance an investment to sell ratio. Simple economic game mechanics.
---
Edit: Dupe yeah bad...farming not.
---
Great point!
---
Well one is breaking the law and one is just duplicating some pixels on a tv so I mean I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a very fair analogy
---
You‚Äôre a liar, stop talking.
---
Darn, but I can live without the cow so eh.
---
Don't even bother shooting them when they land. They're invicible during landing animation.
---
Great point! You make real arguments!
---
If it didn‚Äôt drop for you or you didn‚Äôt get it from the legendary vendor... chances are it was duped. They have been duping stuff since the game came out thankfully because the RNG on drops are horrible. I remember grinding for 12k caps so I could buy an unyielding WWR BOS armor set. I was like 800c short and they sold it to me anyway. Used those pieces for hundreds of levels. So thank you to that man for duping that set whoever you are.
---
Oh, didn‚Äôt know it did that lol but yeah I agree
---
Dupers are bad.
---
Wait what? Do you have a static IP to your home? Nice! That costs extra where I live.
---
Oh here we go, pulling out the personal insults.
---
Keep up your MAGA bullshit, you lying ape.
---
You never mention what armor you are using. This, along with damage reduction perks are necessary to mitigate high level enemies' damage output.
---
Looking over your marketplace posts, I can see why you're so bent out of shape. üëÄ
---
It was a painful mistake the first time I brought power armor to an event and the second I put it on I realized I was massively over encumbered hahah no worries!
---
Haha you‚Äôll go back to ark eventually. I play this for PVE and ark for pvp. It‚Äôs a grief fest but it‚Äôs fun.
---
Personal? You mean the people above like you!
---
Great point on the topic!
---
Lol, yeah so true. But I really like the idea.
---
Do those issues include sneak damage not applying during three-way fights, or is this considered a normal feature?
---
üòÇ
---
i could resupply you my guy
---
That was a real surprise, I didn‚Äôt expect Bethesda to do anything other than hotpatching the exploit. Yes I don‚Äôt get it either why people would skip the ‚Äòplaying‚Äô part of playing a video game lol. It‚Äôs probably all about ‚Äòget stuff‚Äô so they can brag to others how ‚Äògud‚Äô they are lol. I‚Äôm doing the same as you just trying random things. This game has a lot of room for different experiences, which is why it‚Äôs quite addictive to me. I‚Äôm sitting on hundreds of improved repair kits and treasury notes, every single one of them were earned from actually playing the game. I‚Äôm glad Bethesda didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm suspicious lol, as I read here that some got banned for duping four hundred treasury notes XD 
---
Oh the explosive perk is probably ‚ÄòGrenadier‚Äô, I used to have it on all the time until my own explosive weapons killed myself too often lol
---
Stop talking, liar.
---
Has not been fixed as far as I know.
---
I would do it alot more if people didnt AFK at spawn or price comparison on fed 76 while on my vendor.  I got a life and your 12 caps just ain't worth my time.  Yes I know I'm an asshole but it's the truth.
---
Just amazing addition to the conversation!
---
Just did SBQ on PS4. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Dupe has been on for months I traded a guy 10 weapons mostly bloodied and 29k caps he had 5 b2525 fixers, when we went to trade. Beth only made a deal out of it when It went public they didn‚Äôt care before. I don‚Äôt know how many times I seen someone on marketplace bought a legacy or super rare gun out of a vendor.
---
If you have ever done anything ever, you have benefitted from The Holocaust. Shut up, you are a liar.
---
It's been ass since the first few dupes that flooded the game with way more legacies than should even exist. The only thing that will put it on a different track is for them to be removed or reworked and for meta to be changed. I say that as someone with 6 or 7 that I've had a long time. I'm fine with them going away if it brings us some kind of balance both in combat and economically.
---
Gonna need some citation on that 80% figure-
---
I don't think the alt did it.  I did the same thing.  I deleted my lvling alt, made a new one and finished the challenge about an hour and a half before the reset.  I logged in over 8 hours after the reset, and nothing was autocompleted.  
---
Did you completely exit the game?  It runs in the background on consoles.  And I would assume that pc does something similar, like keeping the launcher running or something.
---
Ok wtf predicting the future.
---
One of my favorite things to do is whip out my bloody auto GL and do Distant Thunder providing my own bombardment
---
He logged on at 1 am just to buy a plan and then was off till the afternoon and all his dailies were done  as we do them together after 10 the next day.
---
I‚Äôve only been able to buy from him once since wastelanders released. Made it part of my dailies to swing by and get nothing.
---
Lol. Your post history agrees with your comment. 
---
Again, way to contribute just like almost everyone above.
---
Thanks I'm good now since I have gotten what mods I need for it. Thanks for offering.
---
Bow to me
---
Thank you again for this - it worked really well!
---
Here ya go bud

You are a liar, stop talking.
---
Oh ya thanks for reminding me. The other day I got the scrap collectron so if I get this guy that‚Äôs nice.
---
It‚Äôs called fast typing because I don‚Äôt want to waste more time than I need to, also obviously I don‚Äôt proofread what I type. The logic is not at all flawed because all the goody two shoes saying that dupers should be banned and that they also have absolutely no duped items, are in fact stupid af because they are likely in possession of duped items. You probably didn‚Äôt understand the argument being made here. It‚Äôs just funny because there‚Äôs so many people sucking up to Todd and saying how awesome FO76 is. Yet people don‚Äôt see how many issues this game has? I mean how in the world do you even mess up the adrenaline perk and not fix it? Also fix the damn programming for the Queen like everyone has been calling for, it‚Äôs lame when the Queen flies around the entire time, never lands, dives through the ground, and walks high up in the sky.
---
I would love a fallout game in a tundra
---
I think not. At this point it doesn‚Äôt matter to proof to you anything. Just look how dead the servers are now you be the judge. But so long buddy..
---
sweet, thanks!
---
We've been waiting for nearly 2 damn years for some fixes of big problems since launch. Like the Broadsider being busted on direct hits or the Tesla Gun being able to quite easily trigger the no damage bug. You're honestly a fool if you think those fixes got "delayed". Bethesda never even bothered to fix them ever. And they're only now paying attention to the autocomplete bug (that's existed also for months) because now SCORE is dependant on that bug not happening.
---
I like pvping and update 20 all but killed it. I do have a lot of junk in my stash box and now that I can't horde I just drop it at a station for someone to pick up. I think Fallout 1st only has the stash box and tent going for it. There haven't been any exclusive outfits, that I want, offered in a long time.
---
I‚Äôm just sayin lmao
---
It‚Äôs free with game pass on Xbox
---
"Good weapons" will never be useless. There value might drop, but they are still the most desired weapons in the end game.
---
Wow, your history is rough.
---
But again, you really made valid points ( /s ).
---
Me and my friends play a type of CTF on a private world and I wanna hide my flag underground. They only thing I'm trying to exploit is the tears of my friends when none of the can beat me.
---
&gt;make a statement
---
&gt;ask for proof
---
&gt;‚Äùnah sorry dipshit you‚Äôre on your own‚Äù
---
K, thanks, just wanted to ask where you got the 80% figure. Unless you made it up. In either case, your source literally boils down to ‚Äútrust me bro‚Äù.
---
Stop lying. You are fake news.
---
You're right, this bug is not making you miss your shot, it's making your target invincible.
---
Fallout 76 is plagued with malicious cheaters; then they run to reddit to cry about breaking TOS. This game is solid, the cheating community is a cancer. Also, more then likely all of the youtube glitch people like demonasylum are profiting off of selling duped guns and items for $50 a piece. I cant believe there isn't a crackdown on these websites. They are just stealing money from children and whales, by breaking Tos guidelines.
---
Ok that would explain a lot..
---
I think it's going to be tough for the next week or so but with the large influx of new players they're all going to be looking for game items in the next little while as they level up.  Dupers and the people who got god-roll items from them weren't in the market for the stuff you get from vending machines anyways.  Ergo, seeing them banned is actually a bit of a silver cloud for those of us who plan to stick around.  I just logged to check and myself and another person were the only ones over level 100 on the server, the rest where all newbies, or as I see them, potential customers.
---
. 
---
I also think that's why Bestheda was heavy handed, they knew they could afford to loose high level players because they'll just replace them with newer players who don't have everything from the Atomic Shop or everything in the game.  Its these new players who have potential to play or much longer than those who have basically completed the game and are still hanging on.
---
Another great point!!!!! 
---
I will be pointing out to Reddit how the mods are allowing people like you to speak on this subreddit.
---
A lot of the decline has to to with the ban waves over the last couple nights regarding recent exploits. The influx of low levels has to do with fo76 being available on game pass now. Also there are a number of people who only got short term suspensions, and had accounts wiped. So they are starting fresh too.
---
If the endgame is to get the God roll, and you are just handing out God rolls, that means you are just making people log off. Are you organizing pvp where everyone has a legacy? Are you leading groups and running events? Do you stream?
---
You don't. Do you. You're just a toxic cheater that only has a few hours in the game and you want to cheat your way to the best guns and give some to your friends so you don't feel like you're being selfish. Except you are selfish.
---
I‚Äôve only done 1 trade which included a duped BE flamer since the glitch was revealed. I just find it really funny how many goodie two shoes there are that like bragging about how good they are all the while trying to bash dupers who ultimately made the game better and provided a lot of players with self made content üòÇ
---
Haha, I got to use mine there the other day, cleaned up those scorch better than that damn artillery does, thats for sure.
---
I'll take an angry collector threstening to stab me over being told my communist camp isnt communist enough
---
THE BAN BOT WILL GET YOU
---
Yep, and add the new Raider collectron to scavange for drugs and alcohol and you're in Junkie's heaven.
---
I would honestly suggest just experience the game as is, obviously there's the obvious tips like xp boost through foods and the new public groups but you'll learn the most through your personal experiences
---
Disconnects happen.
---
https://youtu.be/r3hTwsvJV_A
---
I will be pointing out to this entire subreddit that you are fake news.
---
Come on man try again. You can do better than that lame ass comeback.
---
Nah, it's still the same on my end. But wouldn't be surprised if it changes in 3/4 months.
---
look at the positive, they are giving you free ammo points
---
‚ÄúMan it‚Äôs funny to attack a guy that asked for a simple citation on a statement because he‚Äôs curious about its validity, haha wholesome keanu chungus moment 100‚Äù
---
Maybe you should stop pulling facts out of your ass to make yourself feel better. Just a thought.
---
Yeah I understand that now, thanks. I'm still learning the market, have only been playing since Wastelanders dropped, so just on 3 months now. I stupidly sold my first fixer plan for like 1000 caps and my first few backpack plans I sold for about 500. It wasn't until I started checking this subreddit that I realised which plans were actually worth something, but I'm still learning that just because I get a decent amount of rare plans, doesn't mean everyone else does either, thats what makes them rare.
---
yeah the f1st lineup has been fairly disappointing. I'm not even a sub but the only thing that would even remotely get me to buy it would be the scrapbox. Well, good luck wherever else things end up taking you
---
Sorry for hijacking the post (and your comment), but I‚Äôm also worried if what I‚Äôm doing is wrong (or can make me get banned). I placed my tent in the spawn point for line in the sand, so the mobs spawn all in the same spot. Can I get in trouble for that?
---
Lol, I don‚Äôt think you understand that to be able to dupe you actually need to be in possession of those items. You can call me a toxic cheater all you want because then you are pretty much saying every person in possession of duped items are toxic cheaters. Also why does streaming or running pvp have to do with anything? The fact that you would consider those to make someone who duped innocent just shows how brain dead you are ü§™üëå
---
What type of berries?
---
Highlight that challenge and push right. It should give you the list of things you need to build and how many need to be built.
---
Pretty sure they spent all that money from launch a long time ago fixing the game before wastelanders
---
Just means build things like walls and doors, if you hover over the challenge it will expand and show what exactly needs building
---
Oh shit you really showed me. Man, that‚Äôll teach me for asking simple questions!
---
Why not just mooo-ve?
---
In the timeliness it wouldn't make sense. The bombs in Metro dropped during 2013, in Fallout they dropped 2077. Even if you scrap that, the weather won't make much sense.
---
What exploits?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the X-ray lens mod.
---
Hrmmm.... I couple of weeks back I went to the Overseer's house for a Quest and as I was checking for loot, I found a container outside her shed with a pile of plans, mostly mounted heads someone dropped in but also some pretty good ones too. I grabbed them all, used the plans I didn't know and put the rest in my Vendors for 30 caps each.
---
They might have been duped, or maybe some high level simply collected them over a span of months and just wanted to clear stash space, I don't know.
---
I don't dupe, I don't know how and don't have any interest in knowing how, but if I find a container full of stuff while looting, I'm taking it and selling for caps. Nothing I sell is over 30 caps, regardless of how rare it might be, because I want things to be accessible to lower levels, but also don't want my stash/vendors being full for too long.... Call it a stocking fee.
---
If I get banned, I'll be slightly pissed.
---
People who do glitches shouldn't be punished. it's the fault of the devs for having a vulnerability. only ones that should be punished are modders. change my mind
---
Now that's a great way to get free ammo points.
---
What is this sorcery you speak of?
---
80%?
---
As a local, I can confirm this is a very accurate portrayal of... uh, well, most of us. To anyone from anywhere else. And most fellow locals.
---
Would that include building a camp underground..?
---
level up before you go to do missions in the savage divide or eastward..
---
stay in the forest at first doing events, discovering locations..
---
then move north into the Toxic Valley doing more of the same.. just keep hammering events and dailies and discover as many places as you can
---
when you are ready to move on from there go south into the ash heap.. and repeat the process..
---
I would still be doing events in the forest and in the toxic valley too...
---
keep swapping out your armors to whatever has the best stats.. until you start getting legendary drops and to max level gear
---
as for weapons.. keep upgrading whenever you can.. try to have weapons that use different ammo.. and carry something for melee too... ammo is a crunch at first...
---
you should collect and scrap all of the weapons and armor mobs drop that you arent going to use so that you learn plans and have materials to craft with..
---
I wouldnt hit it until you have some mediocre gear and a few levels on you but the Leader Of The Pack event is great for low level legendary drops to help you while leveling...
---
anything on the map in the Savage Divide(exception being the immediate area of Top Of The World) and Eastward to the Mire and Bog can potentially spawn max level mobs..
---
Avoid that unless you enjoy having your ass handed to you repeatedly.. youll need to be in a protective team or have some decent gear and better perks unlocked(aka more levels) before you head out East
---
personally.. I dont do much more than rub up against the early Main Questline missions until I am lvl 50..
---
some people DGAF but if you want the mission rewards to be max level youll want to wait until youre lvl 50 too.. again, some people just do them and level with those items..
---
**when leveling up BE AWARE you do not have to pick a Perk Card from the same stat you place your level point in!!**
---
after you place your point for leveling up you can scroll the stats and pick any card you have unlocked..
---
ALSO - you cant "bank" levels waiting for cards to unlock.. for example you cant pick a card that unlocks at level 10 until you have spent your points for the previous levels...
---
also.. my advice for when you fill up your stash...
---
you dont need to keep tons of all the various junk materials.. for the vast majority of them having between 50-100 is enough.. you probably dont need 800 glass..
---
I keep most junk between 25-50 personally.. but I dont base build so I only need a lot of the gear crafting/repairing materials
---
of course there are exceptions to this such as exceedingly rare materials like ballistic fiber or some of the other materials that are used often while crafting/building/repairing like screws
---
make sure you are breaking down all junk before you store it.. sometimes things slip through or require manually breaking them down.. check your junk tab
---
check your misc tab for gunpowder and unsmelted ores.. that is a source of weight that often sneeks past many peoples notice..
---
get rid of heavy ammo you do not use.. you dont use it, why do you have it right? no need to have 30 mini nukes or 200 missiles..
---
as far as weapons and armor go.. scrip or scrap anything youre not wearing or trying to sell..
---
also in regards to vending legendary gear.. trying to insist on getting max top dollar for every mediocre legendary item you come across isnt going to help your stash problems.. those things sit in vendors forever for a reason..
---
if it is a truly desirable weapon.. sell it for a fair price and be done with it.. dont try to get rich quick off it unless you enjoy holding onto shit forever..
---
thats my sloppy opinion on early game for noobs in short...
---
Haha sounds fun. I just used a foundation close to the ground with sunken stairs, place a mat then a terminal on top, pick up the mat and the terminal should come with it. Then place it on the stairs submerged about 4 or 5 steps down. Its takes some fiddling around to get it to work sometimes.
---
Apparently, it‚Äôs a problem with how the Bethesda server pings to our internet provider (in my case Singtel) that sort of blocks the connection. Not really sure how it works but the workaround solves it. 
---
Anyways, after 1+ week of the Steam release, the problem solved itself and i don‚Äôt need to connect the game via VPN.
---
duping
---
No need to call him a pedophile though is there ? Muppet
---
Every time Bethesda hits the ban wave button on their bot I get suspended because I‚Äôve accumulated several resources over 100k. It sucks but I‚Äôm back in business 4 or 5 days later. I doubt you‚Äôll have any issues if you haven‚Äôt already.
---
Buy my stuff faster.  One dude stood at my vendor for an hour today and bought two things.
---
Bananas
---
*Sounds like someone had too much sodium today*
---
Not like a ton of people duped the treasury notes or anything
---
We can only hope, they have to know its a popular gun now, I can only assuming they're acting accordingly and will have some designs ready for the atomic shop soon enough. But lets be honest, we'll probably get a new set of pickaxe skins.
---
I am glad i took a break a week after wastelanders dropped lol
---
I have a red curtain at the base of a stair and I have to jump to go through it.
---
That doesn't matter. That's the kind of thing middle school bullies try to use to justify their rationale. "It's only two dollars bro why are you making a big deal out of it". If those pixels don't mean anything to you, you wouldn't be breaking tos to get them
---
I've NEVER gotten to use it lol. I'm level 94 and started playing in like February of last year so you think I'd know a little about it. It doesn't say anything when I walk up to it.  Guess I'll have to Google it. I'm in the northeast by a railroad store.......on top of a cliff face and I built around a set of huge metal power line things.  So mmt camp is a big cube that is hollow in the middle and I fill with crops and other things. And the while thing is on stilts too with a raised platform going around the top so I have the high ground during the occasional battle. There's a little power station down the cliff that always has 3 scorched in it that I can snipe for some quick experience after I sleep in my bed and get the added exp boost.
---
But really....why doesn't the cannon say anything when I walk up to it??
---
There's a glitch where people were able to place or build atom shop items without buying them first.
---
I think i like him best. His comments are short, so he seems less annoying than the others to me. Not sure how great the ammo and weapons are. Might be good for lower level players to scrap and learn mods. The ammo might be okay to throw into the exchanger.
---
I'm so happy they did :)
---
Yep that's the only reason I can see lol it's so hollow and pointless
---
It's probably more a case of, "Well this person has gained 400 notes in a few days" as opposed to already having a stockpile, but I'm glad too :) we need to keep all the honest players we can get
---
It totally is Grenadier thank you so much lmao :) I just got on and I've been scrolling through looking for it, I expected it to be an intelligence perk like demolition expert
---
if your not being sarcastic (text format, im sorry hard to tell)  at tier 5 of the legendary run (fallout battlepass) you unlock the ammo converter in the resource tab.  (should take less than a day to unlock if starting fresh)
---
 you can trade those explosives in for points.  said points are then used to purchase ammo you actually want from the machine.
---
Recently there has been a duplication glitch for nearly everything in the game. I don‚Äôt know how to do it, but the market was flooded with god tier weapons. Now the people who duped them, and some who are In position are getting suspensions, bans, and account wipes. It seems to be a large percentage of the player base.
---
Then why is it when I display my gold in a case its the size of a small gun
---
Yeah I could but do you think other people will? No. So how about instead of going out of their way to ban people who are giving them money, use that time to resolve the issue causing all of it instead. I deserve what I got but I‚Äôm just saying from a business stand point it doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some sort of reasoning behind it
---
Cool thanks for the information,and I didn't know they explained the task in the game.
---
3 missiles is worth 60 ammo points in the ammo converter. Dunno what the mini nukes are worth as I haven't picked any up for a while.
---
You are saying that you are helping the game, yet giving away the best items is the last thing people do before they quit playing. So how's that helping the community? You give out God rolls to everyone, they shoot it in the air for a few minutes and log off because there's nothing else to do. Don't tell me you run events with God roll gear for more than 5 minutes and call it fun.
---
You are handing out God rolls and calling it a good thing when it's actually bad for the community.
---
Awesome :) happy to hear everyone has another chance at that
---
I was surprised to see we can't equip the ghillie armour from the Legendary Run for NW
---
Thanks for the information.
---
Great breakdown right here - just to add: ricochet stacks with serendipity for a flat 18% chance to avoid range damage.  I run that instead of class freak on my heavy gunner because he doesn‚Äôt use PA anymore.
---
Don‚Äôt think so, I think it‚Äôs mainly duping. Haven‚Äôt heard anything about underground bases.
---
That's ass. Why get banned for owning a duped weapon? Especially if A. You didnt make it and in some cases B. You dont know it was duped
---
&gt; You probably didn‚Äôt understand the argument being made here.
---
I understand it (it's not an advanced concept, come on now), and know it's a flawed argument. 
---
&gt; It‚Äôs just funny because there‚Äôs so many people sucking up to Todd and saying how awesome FO76 is.
---
The way you present this situation is that if you fault the dupers, you're sucking up to Todd and failing to recognize the flaws in the game.  The fact of the matter is FO76 has flaws and duping is wrong.   It's not one or the other.  The fact that duping is wrong has absolutely nothing to do with perk glitches or event bugs.
---
Mostly mounted heads means someone was spamming Christmas gifts. Yes they were duped, but I don't think you'll be banned for that. I did that too when I was new. Learned like 200 plans right in the beginning.
---
Pherhaps so but then again rad storms are in fallout 4 and 76 but not the rest of the fallout games. In a twist of science or should I say fallout science lol. Radiation affects differently in climate. Like I mentioned the setting before. The rad storm becomes the rad blizzard and freezes everything and anything in it's path. Giving it a another sense for survival. In metro you can't survive without your air filters. Instead of food and water. Air filters during a rad blizzard is a must. The air thins and you can't breathe. Need that air filter.just a thought
---
I removed (stored) her console to make her disappear, restarted the game, then added her console back in.  Took a few minutes for her progress to 'update' but then the quest chain moved along again.
---
So are you saying that it‚Äôs better to not have any god rolls at all in the game? Or let them exist in an archive but never let them get in the hands of players? Everyone has their opinions, I just believe that it‚Äôs better for the community because these people chase dream weapons because it‚Äôs the only thing they want to trade for + use for the rest of the game.
---
I have always been 4 lone wonderer but have shifted the 4 spots to 3 inspirational and 1 bodyguard. How do I share?
---
Luck seems to affect strange things for some ppl on some things and curse them for others. Like i rarely get plan drops from events but one day i had 5 out 7 secret service armor crafts turn up unyielding. But you can here from ppl that can go 50+ crafts without getting one. I just wish my good luck in this game was in something i could actually sell lol
---
Maybe when you were playing was when people were getting off work or something? I played all evening on PS4. Had people at my vendors all night (which is actually rare), plenty of public groups, and there were tons of people at SBQ. Just my experience, but it seemed like business and usual on the server.
---
I am a BETA player and i can tell you there's no legacy pre-dupe. Duping has been around forever.
---
You have to understand that any suggestion with a foundation in cold hard logic (scrap gold and bullion being the same element) is without fail going to have the same morons spouting off about duping this and economy that. Anything that *could* make things easier for someone who wants to game the system is going to get shot down by those who get outraged at the thought of someone else getting more than them.
---
‚ÄúSuing for fraud‚Äù hilarious.
---
I do such in a respectful way. But if they afk. Imma DC even if they are still there
---
Seeing it left you with nothing but to ask me to give you something to come back to shows just how good it was but you though you were smart with that mock right
---
Ahh so the almighty Godd Howard hasn‚Äôt abandoned me after all. There is hope for me yet. Thank you vault dweller.
---
Maybe Dank Matter will be able to be applied to it? who knows, Todd knows.
---
I cant even get to that point, shes at the bunker, won't get past the flight recorder fetch quest.
---
thats what happens when you duping with private dupes. and also with your main account and no vpn ( how stupid of you).
---
been duping and selling shit for money since beta.
---
if anyone needs resupply for a new account hmu
---
I often imagine that the creatures in the fallout wasteland are almost as dangerous as Down Under.
---
The jumping really high thing is a bug with jetpacks. They glitch out on public servers and launch you into the sky ridiculously high. I die a lot because of it. I'm certainly not doing it on purpose. In fact I hate it, and I don't really play on public servers because of it.
---
It honestly probably took them days to be able to patch the dupe knowing their development speed, and the shit game engine that causes all these issues doesn‚Äôt help
---
It a visual bug. Just click on it. And it will play the closing animation and just open it. That what I always do.
---
Don't blow it.
---
Keep it simple.
---
Count your caps.
---
You‚Äôre literally comparing stealing someone‚Äôs property to the idea of duplicating something that Bethesda net no profit off of. It‚Äôs not a fair analogy lol. All what I‚Äôm trying to say is from a technical and business point of view it would seem easier and more profitable to just fix the glitch and remove the dupes compared to manually going through everyone‚Äôs individual profile
---
I never said it isn't true, I just said I wasn't aware of it being an issue because nobody I know was affected wrongfully. The steam numbers thing is [objectively wrong](https://gyazo.com/88b445492fbb1ba6e1b5fe06e0c2388d) though lol. 8451 online right now, 8300 online at this time yesterday. Peak of 11500 today, peak of 11200 yesterday. The cheaters aren't as important as they think they are, sadly
---
Yep, been there forever, will be there forever
---
That‚Äôs the main complaint I‚Äôm seeing so far. There are a number of people who have gotten emails about being suspended, but can still access their characters and account. There are also some who haven‚Äôt gotten anything but can‚Äôt get on because a ban. It seems that in typical Bethesda fashion, whoever is in charge of suspensions has messed up. There is seriously no way to tell if you traded for a duped weapon or apparel, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so concerning. 
---
If I had to guess, servers will be less populated for a decent amount of time.
---
Why would they need to sell stuff if they've got duped stuff. Not everyone dupes to sell
---
So it sounds like right now you are defending Bethesda for having bugs and glitches, may I mention that duping is due to a glitch. Also it sounds like you‚Äôd also be someone who‚Äôd defend magic weapons? Aka weapons that are glitched and players are exploiting? Hmmm, sounds a lot like the same thing with duping... believe what you want, the point is, the argument is not flawed at all, the players who consider themselves ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù are just naive and stupid. And no, you don‚Äôt seem to understand it if that‚Äôs all that you got out of it. You probably didn‚Äôt read my post and instead jumped right to the comments, bravo keyboard warriorüëè
---
Snozzberry
---
No, I'm legitimately asking you to do better. This is starting to get boring.
---
Do you have calibrated shock on your legs. If not what system you on?
---
Nope. I‚Äôve been doing Silo runs under 5 mins clipping through walls via photo mode for months. Even though clearly that gives me advantage &amp; access to Queen loot, drops etc quicker than a normal silo run, but I‚Äôll never get banned. In fact, people get famous on YouTube for doing stuff like this.
---
Now that is the real way to mess with people!  I think nukes are three per deposit as well. So drop precisely two missiles or mini nukes on your victim‚Äôs doorstep. They‚Äôll feel obligated to save the inconveniently heavy ammo until they find a third, so they can cash them in.  Head games!  Bwahahahaha!
---
Or not.
---
This games economy is shit anyway, the second things became worth more than caps it was gone
---
That's actually garbage lmao. Someone who wants to do serious damage could dupe a shit ton of plain looking weapons and just drop them for people to find
---
Are you new to Fallout 76? You should have seen the great duping of Christmas 2018. From posts on forums to Youtube and people even twitching while duping and the devs kept the servers running.
---
Incorrect
---
Been having this exact same issue. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not just losing it.
---
Yeah lmao I know
---
I have those fixers and levers people dream about: bloodied, faster fire, junkies, etc. All combos, because I have put too much time into the game. Too many characters, too many levels, too many builds... 
---
The lever is really satisfying, but the fixer is good for all situations. You can turn the lever into your sniper gun and the fixer into your silent full auto killer. 
---
Most of the time, I choose according to my looks. Cowboy hat means lever and revolver, for instance. Army clothes and helmet mean fixer. BoS outfits mean laser rifles. 
---
Once your build is polished and your damage multipliers are set, you will overkill most enemies in the game, whatever your weapon. 
---
Have fun.
---
Don't play 76 anymore, what is the prob with dupeing? I mean, PVP isn't even that relevant from my knowledge. Why is Bethesda banning players for dupeing when the game (again quit playing a while back) still has a lot of issues.
---
Dude we're on the fo76 sub, I would be surprised if someone didn't compare dupers to a pedophile lol.
---
*gets a suspension email*
---
Even those who didn‚Äôt got banned. Secondly nah you‚Äôre wrong no one deserves a ban. It‚Äôs a HMs breaking mechanic been in the game since launch and if they chose not to fix it then it‚Äôs ‚Äúpart of the game‚Äù period. It‚Äôs no ones fault but Bethesda‚Äôs. I mean if you are sticking with this statement ima tell you that because you sin and do wrong sometimes you deserve to go to hell simple
---
The exact kind of advice I was after, thanks a TONNE!!
---
I can totally understand this i think the loot system is too unbalanced 
---
First of all legacy weapons:
---
Why are there op weapons in the game you cant get anymore if youre not trading? Idk
---
Then why are there weapons that are useless as shit like a legendary wrench that have the same rarity as other weapons mean if i go and kill the endboss of the game (SBQ) i want to get a badass weapon thats decent and not a 1* stalkers wrench i mean cmon 
---
So i am not wondering if everybody starts duping because the weapon you want that has a 0.00342% chance of dropping. I mean at the end we are still just humans with a life we dont want to grind that game forever until we get what we want
---
If you crashed when loading in for the first time of the day it would autocomplete atom challenges for me. I bet it is linked to the failed load in attempt
---
They almost certainly weren't duped plans, but they very well could have come from duped presents or pails.  As such they are lefeditimate products of rng.  Duping presents is still duping, and is rightfully against the rules, but the results of opening them are essentially laundered.
---
And to back this up, if you glitch into the area when the event isnt on the stuff can all be looted and it doesnt spawn for 24 hours still
---
I think it has to do with being bloodied. I played a year before I went bloodied with zero issue. Ever since going bloodied, I get it all the damn time. So frustrating.
---
Picking up a bunch of individual plans isn't likely to flag anything, picking hundreds of copies of the same plan is another story.
---
they should have just made them untradeable when they removed them from the loot pool in the first place..
---
I would still be on board with it if they did it tomorrow.. 
---
the people who originally did get them as legit drops have certainly gotten their due value for them by now..
---
How did they discern who to ban? I have a couple good weapons that could very well be duped because i bought them from a player like a year ago and i haven't logged on today yet
---
Check your mods that you have learned against the ones you dont know. You might have unlocked everything and it is bugging out on you.
---
Agreed 100%
---
ill dupe and u cant stop me uwu
---
I was in a server where someone was trying to do that.
---
For sure. The system isn‚Äôt broken, it‚Äôs just designed like this, and it fucking suuuuucks.
---
You're not supposed to think about this and just accept his fancy math. Like a gold extractor is going to be pulling up the amount that's inside a circuit board during its entire production. Ridiculous.
---
So it's actually going to be a thing? ü§¢
---
I feel attacked
---
this....is great. listen to that man.
---
I believe this game is already piss easy. You can solo the queen easily with a non legendary pipe pistol in 5 minutes. Legendaries are fun but you keep missing the point that there is no "rest of the game" after getting them. I played from launch up till a month ago. 3k hours. I have literally everything and when I finished my ss set I haven't logged in again. If I was a new player and got all my stuff handed to me I'd just stop playing right away.
---
Getting a cool gun doesn't make the rest of the game better.
---
Great! Thanks for the info!
---
thats all just in general and tip of the iceberg 
---
you could go down a wormhole on any one of the points.. and others I didnt touch on
---
I figure thats a pretty large wall of text as it is.. lol
---
hopefully it will get you headed in a solid direction 
---
I totally agree. Historically in these situations, Bethesda has been good about striking only the duper‚Äôs. But here it seems like everyone will be on the hot seat. The next couple days and into next week will be telling. I think today was the biggest ban wave of this bunch. But tomorrow could be bigger. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt know if the exploit still exists. But from what I‚Äôve seen, it seems as though it‚Äôs still around which makes 0 sense. Bethesda usually just disables whatever is used for the exploit until they get a fix.
---
My only request is for you to put your vending machine in a place I can easily find it.
---
I've seen a video that had a guy with the mini gun launching mini nukes. Think it's at that stage where youd know if it was hacked
---
I am absolutely loving this reddit page right now. 
---
I've been calling for permanent bans for dupers for months.  Just knowing that a lot of them are getting suspended, banned and account wipes just makes my day.
---

See I'm not here to entertain you little one you genuinely have nothing worth a better effort when you start wishing death you have lost the argument and now have nothing but anger and feefees go pout have a gogart and watch some rick and morty you'll feel better
---
This is automatically sent to your email. 
---
Although the fact your asking about this makes me think you‚Äôre another POS that‚Äôs destroying the game. 
---
But hey, have a great day.
---
Haha yeah rapid-fire mini-nukes would be pretty obviously hacked.
---
But I might have thought a Gamma Gun version was legit.
---
Sounds nice :)
---
To be fair, Bethesda is still in the game.
---
hahahaha, man I haven't heard/said that in ages.
---
Interesting. I hope none of the shit I have is duped. I'm gonna be tilted as fuck if my account gets wiped...
---
My workshop taker carries the armored one. Just for fun .
---
I have the equipment to make power armor, fusion generators, and plasma weaponry. Pretty sure I can handle stamping gold bars.
---
He use maths, he must know what he talk about
---
Here I have some spare punctuation you can borrow .?!,,..??,!.,
---
Because you deserve it.
---
That would be a decent solution!
---
Hey, don't threaten me with a good time!
---
all of your points in favor are pretty much moot. none of them hold any weight.
---
except for the 4th one, which you yourself debunked. partially.
---
a limb damage LMG is considered a "magic" weapon, a bugged pseudo-furious legendary mod that shreds through anything in seconds. legacies deal little damage against bats but work as expected against other bosses such as the imposter. they weren't removed for being op, they were removed because the Austin couldn't figure out non-ballistic projectiles.
---
honestly I can't really blame them in this case, as this is a limitation, kinda, of the engine. it's something even modders had a hard time circumventing back in Fo4. lasers, plasmas, flamers and even hit scanners are essentially TES spells, and you can't strap a grenade to them without bugging and reverting them back to a regular projectile.
---
the reason why they seem op is because a lot of the mechanics involved are broken and don't behave as intended.
---
having said all this, I see little reason to remove them from the game.
---
Farming resources.
---
I hate pvp and thus bush camp all the time. I got to the top 5 three times today. My go too move is to wait until it‚Äôs me vs the final 2 guys or so of the enemy team. I pop out with zero armor or weapons and do the protectatron shuffle. No one hesitates to gun me down but it‚Äôs glorious to see the confusion.
---
No dude, that's salt
---
Fun story of mine. Back in March (31st to be precise) [I received an email](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ft19dx/real_april_fool_to_me_account_suspended_for/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=fo76&amp;utm_content=t1_fy3zmtb) out of the blue from Bethesda stating I was temporarily suspended until investigation since their system flagged I had used a third party software to duplicate, which I never did in my entire life.
---
Submitted a ticket, tried to defend my case, dying from panic attacks. How do I prove I haven‚Äôt done something unless I monitor every play session?
---
A few days later, I receive a reply that they had solid proof of my wrongdoings and my account was now permantly suspended without possibility of appeal...
---
For fun I tried to log in anyway the next day and... Turns out I was silently unbanned despite their replies saying otherwise. Had I not verified myself, I would have never known about the suspension lift. My account has been running fine ever since.
---
I was **never** told what evidences they found, what exactly happened, what supposedly flagged me and all I ever got from them was automated replies.
---
Their system is pure shit. This shouldn‚Äôt be happening in 2020.
---
If you're going to take it so seriously, then you can't just decide to look at it from your one perspective that happens to fit it. Cheaters ruin a game's reputation under any circumstances and especially dupes ruin end-game enjoyment for dedicated players. Somebody probably really wanted a bloodied fixer and kept playing to try and get it, and now they can get one for dirt and probably found a bunch dropped off at a train station. Now they're going to get bored of it in a few days/weeks because that main thing keeping them playing was taken away by some spoiled children who want all their shiny toys now. The people like that start playing less and less, and atom shop revenue starts to go down as a result. IIRC lawsuits against cheat distributors for online games have usually gone down more or less that route.
---
The dupe is also fixed, it was fixed a year ago but got reintroduced with wastelanders and they just suddenly became aware of it because it went public. So not sure what your overall point there was other than trying to avoid taking responsibility. The people abusing it are banned because they ruin the game for the rest of us. They also need to finally start setting a precedent, maybe they realized that almost two full years of letting cheaters go with a slap on the wrist isn't going to deter them abusing more exploits
---
We got a smarty pants vault dweller on our hands.
---
With the way this game is jury rigged together paid DLC would probably do more harm to it trying to separate it from the base game servers for people without it. Easier to implement and manage everything if everyone is kept on the same version, and feeding off peoples' addictions generally makes more cash anyways. 
---
(Fallout 1st also isn't cosmetic only which is really the one thing I'd call Bethesda out on for being liars.)
---
Is this your announcement to the community that you finally installed FO76 since it‚Äôs on Game Pass?
---
Not everyone, some of us prefer not to cheat.
---
3k hours is a lot, some people just don‚Äôt have the time to grind for that long nonetheless get to 1k hours. If you are someone who quits after collecting everything, then that‚Äôs what you like to do. I can guarantee you that pretty much everyone is tired of how crappy legendary drops are and also that 2-3* enemies are just 1 stars in disguise. New players also can‚Äôt use these god roll items until they reach level 45-50 anyways unless they somehow got a low level god roll. What would you consider to be more boring, play for thousands of hours and get absolute garbage unless you know someone who can dupe you high end items, or have a fun gun to use once you get high enough level and then you can play the game to your pace all the while having a really cool weapon. Not to mention, a lot of players quit not because they completed sets/got what they wanted. A lot of people quit simply because FO76 is infested with bugs and lacks content. Wastelanders was a great update, but like a month after it drops everyone quit again after doing all the quests.
---
Lol there ya go I knew you had it in ya. Welp it's probably past your bedtime sport and I gotta get ready for work. It's been fun and don't forget to report me again, if you missed it the first time it's Theginytickler4. Goodnight champ.
---
I was gonna say.
---
don't think so. the fixer is a combat rifle skin in itself, and I'm willing to bet they couldn't change this without breaking every single legendary fixer currently in the game.
---
I love whenever the dumbass duper‚Äôs of the community get shit on
---
Karma whoring post, no shit if you dupe you deserve to be banned. This is not a discussion this is a fact.
---
You are sexist
---
That was there biggest mistake , they should have done paid dlc.. probably would have been good quality dlc like over at eso
---
Nope, there is no slot for skin customisation on fixer
---
It‚Äôs closed on Tuesday and Thursday‚Äôs I think
---
Gonna collect all this salt and use it to cook some tasty squirrel stew for the double exp weekend
---
What you‚Äôre gonna wanna do is take your controller and place it in a bowl of water then grab your Xbox, and your credit card and burn them and then once you‚Äôre done you‚Äôre gonna want to buy a plane ticket to Bethesda Maryland we‚Äôre actually would fly in to most likely Dulles international airport and then you‚Äôre gonna get a rental car and then drive actually instead of to Bethesda Maryland cause that‚Äôs actually not where they‚Äôre at you‚Äôre gonna drive to McLean Virginia and once you‚Äôre there you‚Äôre going to go knock on their door and ask for your money back.

Bethesda servers suck, I thought we all knew this

This is why I glitch through locked doors on these camps to get around it, as a sort of "no u"

You admitted to aquiring and knowing it was duped gear but other people are douchebags?
---
Riiiighhhtt.
---
Copying over an old comment from a previous quest suggestion. I‚Äôd like to see both now.  If I remember correctly, FO1 or FO2 had a post-apocalyptic Nuka delivery man tasked with restocking the machines. Maybe this is where it all began.
---
Quest (Daily): The Taste of America!
---
Bradberton, the computer supervisor of the Nuka Cola Bottling Plant, has decided Appalachia needs a taste of pre-war America to get back on its feet.  He has tasked you with delivering supplies of Nuka Cola from his vast underground stockpile to still-functioning machines randomly scattered across the map.  Return to Bradberton every day for inventory to restock three different randomly located machines.
---
Reward: One random Nuka Cola product on pickup, one to three Nuka-Tokens per delivery (depending on difficulty of locations).  [Locations are random, but list is tailored to player level.  A level 50+ may get locations anywhere, but a level 10 would only get locations in the Forest.]
---
Nuka Tokens can be redeemed for valuable prizes:
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Ice Cold Nuka Cola/Nuka Cherry/Nuka Quantum (1/2/3 tokens): Ice Cold variants have improved effects, but decay back into regular Nuka after a given time out of the machine [time as per food decay].
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Nuka Cooler Plan: 25 Tokens - Placing up to ten Nuka products into this refurbished Nuka Cola vending machine for a short time [similar time to Fermenter conversion] converts them to Ice Cold variants.
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Nuka Cola Recipe: 15 Tokens - The holy grail! Make Nuka Cola from wasteland materials (nuclear material, sugar, mutfruit, firecracker berries, glowing resin syrup, tarberries, etc. etc.).
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Assorted Nuka Cola Memorabilia (varying): items of clothing and camp decor.
---
You‚Äôre on PlayStation
---
The update do you mean the release of new bugs?
---
I think the sooner they rebalance the game, the better.
---
People use these guns since you don't need to be bloodied to have the same insane damage output, or even more damage output.
---
Commando, no doubt about that. And if you want to PvP, it is the only viable option. 
---
Rifleman is ammo efficient. And gunslinger is stylish.
---
Beth has so many projects so I guess they wont lose a lot of $. While it is so hard to get good gear players who bought the best gear have no reason to spend so much in this game. So these dupers can cry as long as they want but the 1st membership wont make any difference.
---
That is a good chance, either their down or you‚Äôre banned there‚Äôs no middle ground.
---
Shouldn't we just use the actual weight of Gold Scrap instead if the amount of gold in a circuit board? Sure, purity is a question, but even if we're losing 90% to the refining process it should be considerably less than that figure
---
You should never build your camp near any water source, here is why, water is for pussies.

---
The kind that doing something is better than doing nothing. It takes me 5 minutes to type up a ticket to plead my case. Also just because people arent banned in a timely manner doesn't mean they aren't being banned.
---
Agree. If you dont know your spawn point at this point in time you can go to hell.
---
I doubt that they were banned permanently. So there is no reason to pay them back... just suspension.
---
You should really read the Bethesda terms of service and code of conduct. Bethesda takes any exploit in their game very seriously, they are for anyone who exploits their game in any way shape or form or looks at it wrong will be banned.
---
The concrete base won't clip through foundations except for the very edge of it but you can get it pretty close and build the foundations around.
---
I get your point but i think the if newbies start playing this game they first have to find something they want to grind for because besides the new Storyline there isnt much interesting content  for new players, maybe a couple of side quests and the dailys that are always the same or some other events because the grind is almost everything you have in this game if you reach the endgame, and not everybody like these kinds of games, for me the the fallout Universe is one of the last things that kept me from quit plaiying, and yeah they re bringing new content but for me its just like they bring 10% Useful new inovative content that you really want to play and the rest of the update is 90% grinding alone the new pass is such a grind i mean now i am forced to the exact dailys i ve never done before. 
---
At the End its just the Universe that is so special and uniqe that no other game could replace it
---
Nice!  Kinda cool hearing from players like you a month later that they are having success.  I'm not the original poster just noticed that the ally's sometimes spawn far from the road.  Even saw the foundation ally on the mountain overlooking the pylon.  I didn't even know you can run into the foundation and raider allies outside of their strongholds.
---
Can u get banned if u traded for a gun
---
it is. but that's also old news.
---
t65 has the absolute highest defense but due to diminishing returns you won't see much benefit at all compared to t51b. maybe inside a nuke, kinda.
---
SH is the overall best in my opinion because of the acid. it's minimal, but more damage never hurts.
---
Thunder Mountain does, or did, the same; I stopped taking it months ago because of this bug. Additionally, if I don't complete the defend events my game lags to an inevitable crash once the retake activates. Fast travel away, leave world, quit game, clear cache...non of these work to remedy (xb, two accounts, always private).
---
My three best weapons are drops I personally got myself, that is between my two characters that are over 200. 
---
I roll my eyes at your claim ‚Äúthe dupers who 100% are the reason people can have nice things.‚Äù
---
I love instantly falling off a cliff or into a rock....
---
F
---
Lol naming a duper during a ban wave.  Not a great way to thank him.
---
Dont forget T65. It beats t51b in DR and ER, and it beats X1 in RR.
---
I hate GTA and that is why I‚Äôm going to give you a down vote however this is a good idea.
---
Good day sir!
---
No not the weapon itself i mean the market of weapons
---
I keep getting emails about their game news. I think I'm signed up to some kind of newsletter but honestly I'm too lazy to check. I just know that once every few months when I check that email there's a bunch of stuff from bethesda about 76 updates I already know about
---
Except people **can** be actually banned by accident. [This has happened to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ft19dx/real_april_fool_to_me_account_suspended_for/). 
---
Received an email that I was caught using third party softwares to duplicate, which I have never done. Tried to log in, yep, I was suspended.
---
Opened a ticket. A few days later I‚Äôm told they have strong evidences and my account was now permanently banned.
---
Tried to log in out of curiosity the next morning and my account was now operational. They silently unbanned me. Had I not tried, I would have never found out about it. They never explained nor told me what happened, I just received automated replies.
---
My account has remained operational since.
---
It‚Äôs really frustrating when false positive happens because we have people like you encouraging mocking potentially innoncent players as if accidental bans couldn‚Äôt happen in one of the buggiest MMO out there... And that people are wrong to have good faith in those who claim their innocence. All of that make dealing with our false positives unsufferable and even more hopeless because the minute we ask for help here or feedbacks, we‚Äôre laughed at or accused of cheating and lying instantly.
---
Real fun.
---
sorry, I dont look forward to 1 wasteland..
---
I like going to the forest and gathering all my crafting materials without worrying about wrecking my armor or wasting my good ammo..
---
many people asking for this are going to be kicking themselves in the ass once its implemented.. people dont think
---
I don't see the lower tier guns as "pure garbage" because the game is already pathetically easy. I rocked a simple 1* bloody combat rifle for a very long time. I can't tell you how many times I've cleared whitespring with different builds. There are no tough enemies in this game except organized pvp. I think that if you rush into God rolls you probably don't even know how to build your perks or how basic mechanics of the game function. Even if you just keep your ear to the ground about buggy weapon combos, you can be OP with anything. Shotguns right now are insane with the right mods https://youtu.be/nETieFaCmiY . Limb damage guns are still doing a damage cascade, and melee is still OP if you like that playstyle.
---
Should be it‚Äôs own gun or a skin for the assault rifle
---
With you 100%, refused to deal with any dupers. So glad they got what was coming.
---
Don‚Äôt dupe. You‚Äôll get your PP slapped.
---
Alternative idea is that duper‚Äôs/ hackers can play, but only on private servers. Or is that too exploitative?
---
I don‚Äôt dupe but I‚Äôd want to be on the duper server. They‚Äôre way more fun to hang out with
---
Let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôm behind and didn‚Äôt realize T-65 existed Hahahahaaaa....
---
Do you know how many death claws I has to kill to get t51b armour in New Vegas? Im wearing that shit for life.
---
The hacked b e 50 cal wipes the queen and the legit ‚Äúmagic weps‚Äù
---
Bethesda updated the game and caused many bugs, then they had a hot fix that caused more bugs, then another update to cause more bugs, then another hot fix that caused even more bugs, and now we‚Äôre at a point where there is another hot fix that supposedly fixed stuff but we don‚Äôt know about the bugs yet Ohh people got banned.
---
at first, some useful link:

in general: go out there and discover. follow the overseer quest and welcome every disctraction. there is just one thing, you should definitly do: [the order of the tadpole](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_the_Tadpole) quest. can be started at every station afaik and rewards you with a backpack, you definitely want. the quest is kind of annoying but you should do it. a small version of the backpack can be found at morgantown airport, be sure to take that early, grants 30 additional capacity. (regular backpack later gives 60 capa with the possibility to upgrade it up to 120 with a mod)  
---
have fun and welcome to appalachia.

---
if you're on xbox, dm me if you want a weapon modded or something. in general, like 90% of the community is very helpful and provides a lot of stuff to the ones fresh off the vault.

Only Chuck Norris has this answer.

Considering they risked cheating fully knowing the risks and consequences, that's probably not a major concern
---
wait wait wait. Pumpkins have ballistic fiber?

It's a price you pay for free items. Your sanity
---
I used to use PA all the time.  Now that I got secret service armor... my DR n ER  is over 100 more then the best listed.  And my RR is about in the middle.  I still carry a PA mainly for certain events, or extra carry weight in a pinch.
---
for reals though, I could drop you a link to one of my several bloody builds with a brief explanation as how to be a bloody build as it is the best build of all builds and you should be no other build except the bloody build.

Hi all
---
Can someone explain to me HOW I can choose the Ghillie suit ? I see people in the Pre Match area with it, and since I reached Rank 12 I should have it ?
---
Any help appreciated
---
Thank you kindly
---
Jean
---
Yeah. I usually use no PA but I wanted to try a heavy gunner build and part of it is the Stability(?) perk where if you use a heavy gun and wear PA you get Armor Piercing (35%?) and better accuracy.
---
Well, pre last dupe. But people shouldnt have to do a screening tracing every item they buy back to the person who got it a year and a half ago. It‚Äôs just not possible. So I simply meant that there was no reason to expect it was when he bought it.
---
Also, being a BETA player doesn‚Äôt give any extra credibility, one of the guys I play with has been playing with me since BETA and knows absolute shite about trading and weapons/ metas.
---
Ever thought for one second that they too are exploiters/dupers only showing support to weave in more unstable elements into the community?
---
If u have budget n bullion, look into the crop floors. I use these to plant my food in house. Never again do I have to find a level spot to plant all my plants in one spot.
---
Beth screwed something a patch or two ago. Two toons on two accounts have lost the ability to craft certain mods, specifically ultra light, and neither can seem to relearn them; I've crafted and scrapped hundreds of armor pieces between both without relearning. (xb)
---
If you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about, go to Bethesda.net and submit a support ticket to get it appealed it is a thing that happens quite often because a computer is the thing that‚Äôs banning you it‚Äôs not a person.
---
Try appeal it but I believe most people should Remove legacy weapons since there are no unique ids.
---
No one cares about your rant
---
In that case I think I saw you today or yesterday too. Did you buy my bloodied swing speed super sledge then start whacking the air around me?
---
Op, did you just start having the issue?  
---
I‚Äôve done both some over the past week without issue, didn‚Äôt try it tonight.  PC
---
That thing is the most temperamental little shit ever when it comes to deciding on what's available and what isnt
---
&gt; Also it sounds like you‚Äôd also be someone who‚Äôd defend magic weapons?
---
Why would you jump to that conclusion?  Making wild assumptions like this does not build a logical thesis.  
---
It's obvious in your post that is replete with statements like "brain dead haters",  ‚Äúhigh and might‚Äù players (your typo, not mine), and "dupe haters are too thick skulled" that you're not interested in in an earnest discussion of that facts.  
---
You bring up magical weapons as if that makes duping suddenly alright, when in actually it's an entirely different issue that has no bearing on the morality of duping.  
---
&gt; then you are just as guilty as any other duper because guess what, you probably are in possession of duped items.
---
Not a logical conclusion at all.   Even if you call me a "keyboard warrior" and try to insult my intelligence with phrases like "if that‚Äôs all that you got out of it" it's still not a logical argument.   You could call me short, fat, ugly and dumb and your point here would still be illogical.
---
There are separate perks for normal pistols and auto pistols

Just looked at T-65 and it‚Äôs kinda sorta ugly haha.

Many F‚Äôs in the chat
---
This is not true, I would restart your game.
---
I saw someone absolutely wreck every single ghoul in radiation rumble.
---
I‚Äôd be cool with it if there wasn‚Äôt a new dupe every five minutes, but there is so...
---
If Bethesda released items to the Atom store on sale the first time they came out, then left them up forever at full price, a lot of more people would be happy, and Bethesda would make a lot more money. Answer explained. Prove my answer wrong before you down vote.
---
1 - Save your breath since people here will not believe you unless they knew you personally.
---
2 - The nature of some of your previous posts clearly indicates you made an effort to profit off the situation. 
---
3 - Bringing up what others are doing makes you look even more guilty since you are attempting to deflect responsibility of the decisions you made.
---
More server load, but I like the idea.
---
Likewise on the XP exploit. If you use an exploit to go up 500+ levels in less than 3 hours, you deserve the ban.
---
4 days in public ;)
---
How do you know I duped?? I have a citation for that sir.. lol!!! I love it when dumb asses think they know something and they end up looking dumb
---
There actually was an exploit at one time like this after an update and they pulled the whole severs down in a mater of moments when it was first discovered.
---
they look for actual multiple specific weapons inside a single inventory space. anyone caught with that isn't being very smart.
---
Yep, just did done found it...
---
how many did you pick up?
---
They need to just reintroduce them or remove them and fuck the RMT dupers crying about it. When items are being traded for exorbitant amounts outside the game, the economy is fundamentally broken. They should also add a banking system to the game so players can be legitimate traders inside the bounds of the game environment, could even have pack brahmin and the ability to hire other players as mercenaries to run our own version of Riding Shotgun.
---
Ok bye then.
---
I find it more or less irrelevant due to diminishing returns. but also due to how expensive it is.
---
personally I'd invest in Strangler Heart instead. still the best, 2019.
---
I was getting a weird message saying something about Atomic Store being unavailable a little while ago when I tried to get the new Lunchbox emote from the Featured panel, but when I went thru the emotes list and tried grabbing it from there it worked.
---
Whale is a term commonly used by inconsiderate blueberries to help them compensate for their lack of intellect and their vast flux of incompetence. Hope this helps
---
This post is dumber and more ridiculous then the posts from people who duplicated complaining about being banned.
---
Pleasure! I had to make and scrap so many HMs so I feel your pain. Now having to do the same with my fixer :(
---
yep, after playing for a long time i can count on one hand the amount of really good weapons i have got, even with the purveyor on two characters every week and hundreds of queen runs. The rng in this game is too blame.
---
T-51b definitely is the best bang for your buck for DR and ER. The problem is that it has pretty terrible RR, so in rad zones (like nukes) you‚Äôre going to be taking on rads to the tune of 2-3 per tick.
---
If you‚Äôre going to live in your PA and don‚Äôt venture into highly radioactive zones, 51b is your jam. But if you need better nuke resistance, you‚Äôll need to mix in some T-60, 65, X-01, or Ultracite.
---
I‚Äôve heard if you do and resist (besides rads) Ober 370 it‚Äôs diminishing returns.
---
Well you could appeal each time they ban you for that legacy weapon or just scrip it.
---
I used xo1 for my heavy gunner.  Simply for the RR. Its just my Preference. Never had issues. Those rads creep up fast sometimes. Lol
---
Well, I didn't want to be THAT mean with my comment :D
---
Never used any game-breaking mods, not supporting or encouraging it at all BUT... Surely you need some context as ti what counts here. For example, I use s reshader because the original colours and vibrancy hurt my already fucked up eyes. I also used a better/higher res map mod a while ago, the perk manager is outstandingly handy, the inventory marker mod is also really handy and none of those really change much of the gameplay, if any at all aside from cosmetic and quality of life purposes
---
If you can get hold of a vampire mini gun or alike you're pretty much invincible as long as you have bullets
---
that's bs through and through. for one because I traded for mine ages ago, but also because Bethesda can't ban half their playerbase like this. I'm thinking they're reverting some of these bans.
---
I would not look into it too much if you were not doing anything wrong.
---
Wow! I just start shooting them ASAP; but now I'll try to listen (and record) this! very interesting
---
There are tons of things they could do to make the game easier/less grindy without adding a way to create valuable currency with scrap, which would obviously be duped like crazy.
---
Good god what a glorious conversation. Good laugh. It's 2020 and people still use 'nerd' as an insult XD
---
You are just one of those crying babies that whine other players have legacies and you dont, so you try to scare them "scrap it or baaan, quickly". How immature are you?
---
Holy shit, they never fixed it... Beth. Beth never changes.
---
I mean specifically mods that break the game and crash the economy. not visual aid mods.
---
Weapons don't have unique ids so there is no way to track duped weapons.
---
Maybe they could implement one but as far as I know they don't yet.
---
Yep, moat my comments have ben downvoted because the duper arent in game, theyre all on reddit manipulating the votes to make them seem like they have been wronged somehow for being banned
---
they are so lucky they don't have to deal with scrips or bullions...
---
nobody knows for sure but 350~450 is a safe bet. most, if not all PAs have more than enough DR and ER anyway.
---
Thats true
---
I guess people will have to appeal every ban wave.
---
There's still bugs from launch. Headless unkillable enemies have been a thing forever, still no fix. All sorts of CAMP bugs (items saying they are floating when they aren't) are still out there. Its just a mess
---
I personally 10 to put my camps either in the Meyer or the bog as they are the most ideal places for endgame content a.k.a. queen fights but also typically I run into more ideal players on the right side of the map additionally the cranberry bog is the best place to be.
---
Eh, the rewards are just meh unless it's a rare plan
---
remember, some players use the "cannibal" perk card...
---
I recently hit level 50 but never did any quest. Not even wayward, the only bullion i have is from the season map. But i plan on doing quests soon to get more
---
Why would you think it'd be good quality because it certainly wouldn't and the game would just be split in half and in worse shape. 
---
Considering how many people I see with Fallout 1st icons, camps, scrap boxes, noisy emotes, etc. I can only assume they're making a boatload of cash off of it and the entire game still lacks in quality. 
---
ESO was built on a foundation designed for MMOs (and it was also terrible for a long time till they fixed it up), this game was built on a modified Fallout 4 foundation which already had bugs and flaws.
---
I got a suspension email today, but I‚Äôm more than likely certain that it‚Äôs not from a weapon I have in my inventory but because I have several resources over 100,000 in my scrap box. Which yes we‚Äôre all obtained legitimately.
---
OP is a dupper that got banned that's why he made the post and he tried to lie to a bunch of people saying his account was legit but his post history on reddit market place is nothing but him selling duped gear and in one he openly admits to it
---
False you can still drink and then spam collect, I did it yesterday. Just make sure you drink purified water first or else you will get the parasites.
---
On paper certain Power Armor have better stats than other Power Armors but in practically it's already been tested that they are all pretty much the same thing. 
---
The only real difference between Power Armor outside those numbers you see and aesthetics is that Excavator Power Armor gets you more ore from mineral deposits along with more carry weight and that Excavator Power Armor is the only Power Armor that can't use a Jetpack.
---
Also speaking as someone who has a Full Health Heavy Gunner Build you don't need to use Power Armor (I don't) you're only missing out on a bit of Armor Penetration by not using it which means you might have to use a handfull amount more of bullets to kill things but it's not a game changer.
---
I mean some are flat out broken and shoot more bullets than they should.
---
I am mostly responding to people who are getting banned for legacy weapons.
---
Especially two shot explosive plasma gatling guns.
---
Yeh I still got my legacy gauss rifle and I ain‚Äôt scrapping it lol. Haven‚Äôt been banned either but I didn‚Äôt do any duping so makes sense.
---
Pretty sure both of the things are made of the element gold, which surprise, comes out of the floor.
---
And you're missing the point of size doesnt matter it's a fucking game you dult
---
I know. which is why it'd be doubly stupid to ban people blindly, like they've been doing. the Austin team might be incompetent but Bethesda wouldn't nuke a revenue stream like this.
---
also, weapons do have an "unique" id. it's not exactly unique, but it's close enough. I just don't think they're able to track it down. I'm also not sure if dupes generate a new id.
---
Yeah I guess that could flag you for cheating too.
---
Yea i was thinking there, so far mine is in the hill by lucky hole mine and its not too good.
---
There's still a lot of debate on this subject. There's a line in Fallout 2 (first game with Jet) that suggests that Myron (the "inventor" of Jet) is a filthy liar and at best developed a variation of a drug that already existed. There's an old woman who claims to have been hooked on Jet long before Myron was even born. This was mentioned by the original writers to be an error, however it seems to be that Bethesda chose to roll with the discrepancy and solidify Jet as a pre-war drug in the lore. 
---
Some fans of the series refuse to accept any lore decisions Bethesda makes and will tell you it's an inconsistency or a retcon. In my opinion Bethesda just chose to interpret an inconsistency from a previous game differently than the original writers had intended. They actually turned a mistake into something that is more interesting and lore friendly then it otherwise would be.
---
Is the sbq bug not new?
---
Thanks for the idea. I usually see a couple of bases near mine and never had much use for the Arty. I won't go all willy nilly bombing everyone, but if there's a jerk, I now know I have more options.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm only level 45 so no 50 only PA rn but I was planning Ultracite or T-60.
---
You're not doing enough damage. What is your spec, and what weapons are you using? turn on your damage numbers, how much damage are you doing per hit to the queen? not what the gun says  in the pipboy but what you're actually doing during the fight.
---
Unless you run thru hiker, which makes water weigh significantly less. To each their own however.
---
Try moving your camp south west of Watoga, lots of great spots over there some patches of flat areas and bodies of water.
---
You forget to add the link?
---
The amount of downvotes lmfao
---
True the problem I hear about more is RR. And most people say you‚Äôd need more DR since most enemies do ballistic damage besides the scorchbeast echo.
---
They‚Äôre not banning anyone who traded. Just anyone who did the exploit.
---
I‚Äôm fairly new to fallout franchise and I don‚Äôt know what are duped or not or if it‚Äôs an illegal item 
---
So me assuming it‚Äôs like a happy gift and then getting banned isn‚Äôt really funny
---
Yeah, ifs it's like other Bethesda games every item has a item code and a reference code.
---
The reference code will be generated again if they are duped, atleast they should since console spawning will generate a new reference code.
---
I only have 1 mod (of 7) unlocked for the gatling gun
---
True. I think the big difference besides the points you made are repair cost and how easy it is to repair them.
---
I use a lever action rifle I'm a sniper and I have the gauntlet powerfest and incisor and all that and sometimes I don't get a lot of hits on her but I'm killing all the other scorched around me hitting her when I can.
---
One of the updates this year was supposed to fix it so that power armor loads the least charged core first. I wish gatling lasers loaded the lowest charge core as well...
---
Explore the wasteland at your pace
---
And always careful with deathclaws :)
---
That one might be okay, I have an explosive railway rifle but I believe it was ligit since its only level 40.
---
I owe you a nukashine for that
---
Had some ask me if I wanted to try duping while trading an item; politely declined and I‚Äôm really glad I did. I‚Äôd hate to be banned for something like that. But cheating is cheating.
---
I think you need to do 1,000 damage total to get rewards
---
I don't have any of the dances but I would do the same if I did lol
---
Oh I detest that guy. As I walked past him one time, he spit and, because of his dialogue I swear it was at me. I stopped and unloaded about one hundred shotgun rounds into him and then again when he was playing his banjo. I hate spitting. My brother was, ‚Äù What the hell are you doing?!‚Äù I just lost it. I always shoot him when I go there.
---
That man does not skip leg day!  
---
Seriously looks like he's ready to team up with Flash Gordon and kick some ass. Well done.
---
Want to be realistic about bullion?  Assuming the kind of bullion we're dealing with here are the gold bars kept in vault 79.  From Dead Money we know that a standard gold bar weighs 35lbs.  From this game we know a single piece of gold scrap weighs 0.05lbs.  This means that assuming gold scrap is even pure enough and wouldn't need further processing you would have to collect 700 pieces to process a single bar of gold bullion.
---
I think his crazy train derailed thwre at some point, they literally just went batshit crazy with those replies wtf, it was like i was watching the maturity fly off a few years with every comment they made as they descended into a blubbering mess
---
Yes, fuck yes this is so annoying. I will bomb every camp that does this with a nuke three times in a row I will follow you to your new server and continue to nuke your camp. I hope anyone who does this has their game crash more than anyone else.
---
nope.. nobody is salty in here...
---
Thank you thats very helpful ill remember that
---
Are you on now sorry I didn‚Äôt see someone commented
---
But your not one of those innocent if any innocent people did get banned. But I really hope no one on hear believe a word of that smoke your blowin your a liar and a cheater
---
Wow this one giant circle jerk lol
---
Rip me.
---
Get all the mutations early on
---
Personally I feel that the inconsistency in FO2 left the door open for Bethesda to tweak the lore the way that they did. The original writers can say that the line with Mrs, Bishop was a mistake, but the fact is that the IP is in Bethesdas hands now and they can choose to interpret her line about being a jet addict before Myron's birth as canon if they want to.
---
No but the hundreds of other bugs and terrible design choices that have been here since beta are. The fact that major bugs like adrenaline and the queen bug coming this late into a products life cycle is an indication of poor IT dev processes (I audit IT departments for a living btw). There has been several situations were fixed bugs become unfixed after later patches.
---
Maybe rethink your words very carefully
---
once you hit the 350~450 threshold, more DR or ER is largely useless. the practical difference between t51b and t65 is like 5 less damage from an assaultron's blast.
---
there is a noticeable difference between t51b and, say, x01 inside a nuke. but frankly it's not enough that you can walk around indefinitely, like with a hazmat. but on the same vein, x01 has more than enough DR and ER, so. it depends on which one you like the best, really.
---
personally I'd still recommend you grind for SH instead. enough DR, ER, RR and some damage on top of it.
---
Didn't manage to get one near enough while I was doing other things. Always over encumbered heh.
---
Yeh we‚Äôre fine I reckon. I got mine a long time ago, hopefully they can track that too lol.
---
Oh yeah, I'll buy too. That's kinda earning it too.
---
Update 21 will be released promptly in the spring of 2021. So I hope you enjoy not having adrenaline for a few more months.
---
Agreed! I've bought the Fasnacht one, built it, and immediately scrapped it---what a waste of atoms....
---
She's also immune to explosions now and doesn't take limb damage or maybe it's just her wings that can't be broken. so keep that in mind as well.
---
They don‚Äôt care about you

I didn‚Äôt say that. I was helping you answer your own question.

that's the thing though, dupes are not generated naturally. though the console. so I really don't know.
---
Dosnt matter i mean like having it at all
---
True. I eventually want to get most if not all the PA. It‚Äôs just deciding which one to main

I‚Äôm just mimicking a virgin nerd that‚Äôs waiting for the golden dildo award hahahahhahahaha!!!!!!!

Stocks and bonds, second safest roi over time besides precious minerals
---
Ammo converter is good. Secret service armor if you don't do PA, or the Gauss weapons
---
Secret Service armor is best armor in the game currently. Downside is that you‚Äôll have to craft it randomly hoping for that one good roll of legendary effects. Also, ammo machine is pretty efficient, it produces 5.56 roughly 200 rounds in half hour.

Idk because it be a paid dlc. Wastelanders wasn‚Äôt that bad I enjoy the story

Which dev room apparel item do you have that has you so concerned?

Much  sodium buddy lay off of it lol!!!! Hahahhahahhaha!! Why are you so hurt ??? Stop crying!!! Lol!!!! Pathetic boy!!

I'm very happy you posted this. Like seriously Bugthesda... we know your all there and reading this backlash.. another bait and switch to which we expected nothing less. Lmaooo I won't even get into the other current outrageous issues  and preceding unanswered issues that are still floating around.
---
Not even sure but GG on getting to level 33. Glad you like your backpack.
---
at the risk of sounding like a broken record, SH. until then, x01 is the best all-arounder I suppose. unless you don't go venturing inside nukes all that much, in which case go with t51b.
---
She is Certainly my Type
---
its not, you can use any mod you want on it. or skin.
---
But its worse than the standard backpack that you need to get before you can get mods for backpacks.
---
Whats most annoying is: the Small Backpack, is the only world drop plan that is available to pickup from the world with no requirements that makes something that is untradable in any way.
---
all other plans/items that are locked that way are behind a quest/event/gold purchase.
---
Fallout was never meant to be a PVP game
---
There are no legendary sets of PA...
---
Unless you mean like the set bonus stuff.
---
And agree, to an extent. Atm I‚Äôm looking to combing peices all with the atomic onslaught paint
---
Level 35 now. Missed day 1, still have 3 weekly challenges to do
---
lol, I've a feeling this may have been more than just some guy being generous, with all the posts I've seen today... akin to trying to flush the drugs down the toilet when the police come knocking.
---
Im not sure the sbq being unable to be crippled is a "major bug"
---
Utility of what? It‚Äôs not like I can actually use any perk cards with the extra points and you don‚Äôt get any endurance with it
---
Ok. Thanks for the advice. I really only go into nukes if it‚Äôs near white springs (not Watoga yet)
---
I thought it was 1500?
---
Good luck, I got suspended today, pretty sure it‚Äôs because I have 145,000 lead in my scrap box. I will be playing catch up soon.
---
True man
---
You sound like you need a heavy dosage of butthurt ointment. I‚Äôd be glad to give you a suppository.
---
Huh?
---
People it‚Äôs a video game. This specific dupe caused zero server crashes. It didn‚Äôt inhibit anyone from playing. That would be immoral and selfish if that was the case but it wasn‚Äôt. This dupe helped a vast majority out by helping them trade/receive the weapons they wanted. It‚Äôs not like people were stealing actual money from the atomic store. Everyone needs to get off their high horses cause I‚Äôd be willing to bet they don‚Äôt lead perfect lives. Using this dupe or buying a duped weapon doesn‚Äôt make you scum of the earth like everyone‚Äôs acting. Sure it‚Äôs against the TOS so people broke a rule but so many people were generous.
---
Hopefully they fix it soon I want that raider scraptron
---
No they haven‚Äôt :/ it still ‚Äúunidentifiable error has occurred‚Äù and I mean I can tell what the problem is.... but it really is the most infuriating thing. I‚Äôve had my camp in the same spot since like a month into launch and I‚Äôve spent so much time on it and love the location but the only way to get rid of the dome is to move :/ and I really refuse too
---
That's me. I used to have a set of armor for excursions outside of my metal womb, but ditched it recently to clean up my inventory. I only get out to craft and sleep now
---
This is why I have only the excavator PA in my inventory and the other PAs in the stash. DR might be low but it is still good enough for most situations and I can use it whenever I need it without worrying about weight.
---
Because all of the google search questions and answers about Fallout 76 are all on Reddit!
---
Very frustrating. Especially because I talked to the master Dev at fallout 76 and they don‚Äôt bother to look at Reddit. Ever.
---
&gt;PVP ??? LOL rebuilt pvp for a survival mode + NW model. Non legendary  weapons or armor with no vats , but in a open world with respawn and  score.
---
I rather like this option.  Not sure why they didn't implement something like that after the abysmal failure that was survival.
---
It might be, I've always seen others say 1,000 but I've never actually tested it.
---
I dont but you are wrong
---
Honestly... I think it‚Äôs hilarious. Like everyone was talking about an economic crash on the marketplace and etc but in reality I don‚Äôt think anyone expected a mass ban which in reality removes all of the stagnant wealth in that market. Like some innocent people got hit but in the end their sacrifice has completely wiped the market slate clean
---
Just had my entire daily already completed. God damn I hate this game sometimes.
---
Oh that‚Äôs what you take baby. When you hurt like this lol!!! You are a funny boy hahahhaha I love it when you nerds get hurt that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt shut up lol!!!!
---
yep! apparently the game keeps track of the last 200-250 containers you have opened and if you return before it‚Äôs out of that log it‚Äôll be empty/the same. i read this literally about 5 minutes ago so if anyone else has a different answer feel free to share!
---
No one cares to change your mind. If you act against the terms of service and use exploits you should be banned. lack of self restraint and discipline isn‚Äôt a pass out of of shitty decisions.
---
Something costing more doesn't automatically make it better. If you like and trust something enough go ahead and send them donations though and hope they actually put it to good use.
---
Yes I am, my psn is the same as my username
---
This has been said before and I hope it's something they eventually do but you know what would be a killing blow to RMT? If they unlocked the 4* Weapons/Armors.It would instantly make the current RMT market significantly less worth it (including Legacy Weapons). 
---
I would some caveats such as 4* Gear only obtainable from Raids or 4* Legendary Enemies/Bosses (So purveyor Script Farming nonsense)  and if you want to trade 4* Equipment between players either don't allow it or make Players use a different currency that's not Caps.
---
Be *very* careful with this right now, picking up "gifts" that other players have left behind.
---
Deja ve...
---
Because someone asked a reasonable question and instead of just answering it, OP chose to be a dick.
---
I dont im simply curious
---
But that pin makes the best meat pies.
---
One of the new weapons. The new armor (or PA if you use it more).
---
Poopdick
---
Bullshit. Make whatever excuse you want and cry alone. You are a cheat and a liar. Please go play something else.
---
Ive been enjoying myself immensely this evening
---
 I've experienced this countless times on pc, the one way I've found that works all the time is spawning back to vault 76.
---
Oh that‚Äôs what you call whatever you take up your rectum. When you hurt baby Hahahhaha!!!! Keep me laughing baby keep going I‚Äôm having fun lol!!!
---
Gonna be honest, I don‚Äôt care if you duped or not but like you lost any credibility to your argument when you just started acting childish. Like maybe we did lose 80% or maybe not you could be wrong? Who cares? No one who isn‚Äôt banned, that‚Äôs for sure. But like you lost any sympathy or even a shadow of a doubt when you started just typing shitty insults and curse words like a 10 year old kid on Xbox live
---
I believe there are two bugs, one prevents her from taking off again leading to meta players downing her so fast that anyone else at the event doesn‚Äôt have a prayer (especially melees) to hit the 2000 damage threshold . Her unable to be crippled has been around for a very long time and certainly isn‚Äôt minor. She‚Äôs the only end game boss we‚Äôve had up until colossus and a default game behavior doesn‚Äôt work on her. 
---
Out of any enemies in the game (minus assaultrons), the queen is probably the most broken
---
angryturtle made [a video](https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0) about spawn/respawn some weeks ago. as far as i remember, container respawn quite quick but im not sure anymore. im at work and cant watch the video now, perhaps it helps you. pretty sure it was empty bc someone just looted it...........and thats the point i realise, the lock would have been open, so it cant be that....so, no, ive never seen something like that.
---
So because you personally benefitted from the cheat, which allowed you to circumvent your own incompetence around the game, it‚Äôs okay for people to disrupt the game economy and profit off of it? You sound like a very selfish individual.
---
Hey, serious question, what‚Äôs your opinion on emus?
---
dare you touch my pet rock!
---
its Bethesda's way of making up for their own shortcomings. players shouldn't be punished because they used they devs' idiocy to their advantage.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve missed an entire mag when they‚Äôve just been standing near me, though.
---
You should also tell them how to remove rads without removing mutations. Because the perk is close to lwvel 50.
---
Dryer chemical plant at night
---
Very true. My apologies this got out of control. I‚Äôll stop. But honestly my Friend that are still active state that the servers are quite silent. And they feel bored. Not a lot going on with all these players missing.
---
I‚Äôve been talking glances but watching this community burn is honestly amazing. Cause I think a good portion if not all of the major PVPers got taken done, most people using dupes and glitches and most of the buyers for it too. I legit Bethesda just took out all of their major issues in a single unannounced cut
---
&gt; Listen the players and understand their needs , give them tools to get what they want without needing to use the black market or exploits. 
---
Agreed. There have been a lot of great ideas I wish would be considered seriously. It just seems like Bethesda has their own schedule/priorities and nothing but the most severe public outcry can alter that. 
---
Guaranteed unlocks wouldn't be bad. For example, pay extra script for a guaranteed major/minor role and then leave the prefix up to rng for pretty much everything. The way they set up bullion is a little too stingy and time-gated, but isn't a bad concept. Increasing  bullion drops around the board would be great like getting bullion for events/queen reward.
---
Thank you so much, I was really confused
---
Probably just opened a bunch of presents and needed to drop the extra weight.
---
Can you destroy it with a flamethrower or something?
---
If some random high level player does the gift emote and drops stuff take it.
---
If they drop a vintage nukashine drink it because it gives you 100% more mwlee damage for a while.
---
Yea I‚Äôm so glad that Bethesda acted too. It‚Äôs really necessary for the longevity of the game. The guy probably gained 400 t-notes within minutes not hours, it‚Äôs like a private money printer put to work lol.
---
Np and it‚Äôs confusing to me as well lol, I had always thought it would go under Intelligence too, together with Ammo Smith and Field Surgeon. I‚Äôm sure Bethesda has their logic about the placement of those perks, it‚Äôs just harder for us average players to grasp XD
---
Looking at the legendary score chart your exactly where you want to be for today.
---
Stop shooting your brother
---
Got caught cheating, huh? Thoughts and prayers.
---
This. exactly. you have to spend the time and a few caps to get it right, if it matters to you.
---
"  I'll fast travel to and from a couple times and if I don't like it, I'll move my CAMP module again(keeping in the same spot, just turning around a little), based on how I spawned in last time. I'll do this 2-4 times until I've got it exactly how I want it or close enough to. "
---

---
All power armors still get 90% radiation damage reduction before their RR is actually factored in, that's why people say that they're all basically the same. Because of the diminishing returns in damage reduction. They also get 40% damage reduction before their DR/ER is factored in.
---
Haha.. the image of that is a good one.  Possibly true!
---
Watch where that dudes rocket ship is at? If it‚Äôs ahead of you then you gotta catch up
---
Great! Thanks! Do you have a link to that chart?

When I had that problem I avoided talking to him on any of my characters for 1.9 weeks and he worked again (to make 100% sure an entire week cycle passed for him without interaction).
---
 I did it based on a random post I read. I dunno if it's the actual cause but it happened sometime after I bought from him on an alt and then tried to buy on main character.
---
If i don't see a group i just start a building group. Because new players who are trying to build their camps join them often. If they have a mic i tell them its bonus exp and they stay for a while even if they aren't building stuff.
---
Fair enough for sure!  All plans so hopefully less at risk.. i heard the plan duping was from a while back.  Rolling the dice will see what happens!
---
The estimates I‚Äôve heard are maybe half but it seems exaggerated at best. But to be honest, most of the people banned will find a loop around or just not come back or what have you. I honestly don‚Äôt care, even if you didn‚Äôt dupe, most if not all duper‚Äôs are gone even if for just a little while. I guess you all were the sacrifice Bethesda was willing to make
---
You mean the green ship? That‚Äôs ahead of you from day one. It‚Äôs basically ahead most of the time
---
As IDontUseReddit said, visit Dyer Chemicals at night. The Swamp Plants are the same game object as Strangler Blooms. The Strangler Blooms will transform into Swamp Plants at night. Good luck and happy hunting.
---
Don't kink shame!
---
Great! Thanks
---
On PS4, so no noobs wave for us. But there are more new players since Wastelanders. Always a pleasure to help them.
---
Yes. At least that‚Äôs how I gage mine, I am at rank 46 &amp; leveled up with the green ship
---
Thanks! Does the secret service armor have stealth? Or is that part of the roll?
---
There are rumors floating around that BGS are laying the banhammer on anyone with a heap of duplicate items, regardless of how they obtained them. Whether thats true or not I don't know, but I can imagine some people are panicking over having profitted some way during previous dupe waves.
---
I didn‚Äôt go full Mothman, but the red walls and the cherry floors are really nice

It's like he shot himself in the foot... But with a 12-gauge.
---
Stay in front of the Zorbo game piece and you're ok. 35 is great considering a double XP/score event is coming up.
---
But yeah pass Zorbo and all is well.
---
I‚Äôm glad 35 is good, but Zorbo is WAAY ahead of me
---
It is not the LMG , there for it is bad.
---
Not sure. I only bought the buttressed mod for the armor, it could have shadowed. Also, yes you could potential get an let‚Äôs say Bolstering/Sneak roll or something like that with sneak [Harder to detect effect].
---
Dude, you ok?
---
If you use excavator, use calibrated shocks on the legs and the torso that gives +1 to strength you can approach what you can for non PA carry weight, but it will never come close to Unyielding air with a backpack.
---
I don't use pa, but I'm open minded! What did you like? I already got a couple of weapons from the secret service and my legendary rolls weren't great, so I'll have to try crafting again.
---
Very true indeed. For the record I never claimed to duped. But I did received legacies I never had before and picked up some in containers and also bought some from vendors but for the same reason of avoiding any type of ban I didn‚Äôt practice the duping method. But never the less I still got suspended. But seriously I know of some people that were duping hardcore and they are still active and their accounts did not get affected.
---
I think a heart emote would do the same job lol. I‚Äôm just waiting for the day when they just laugh and don‚Äôt immediately kill me. Feel like I‚Äôll be waiting a whileü§£ü§£ü§£
---
This is awesome.  Do this over the weekend
---
Not enough people will get this \^\^. Shame.
---
Is why the game felt empty today? I'm on Xbox and I noticed that there aren't nearly as many player vendors. Is that the ban wave or was the ban wave pc only?
---
They did note in the hotfix today that they have a tracking mechanism and are watching it so you may have some luck.
---
I‚Äôve only lost about 1750 so far.  It‚Äôs not even a full rank at the end so no big deal.  Losing what amounts to 2-3 ranks at the end, which is 4-6 days?  That‚Äôll hurt.

Damn, I'm glad the game never allowed me to put it on the ground despite the green outlines... I also camp north of whitesprings at the lead node and it's been a year and a half since I moved here. I simply don't see any reasons why would I move again.
---
What do you mean by stocks and bonds?
---
Np, I don't know how accurate it is but it looks like you're right on schedule. Double XP weekend coming soon btw!
---
where is the bullion shop? i dont seem to see it seen any shop
---
He moves 1 space per day, I pulled level with him at 45 yesterday and overtook him with the weeklies today, once I get the 2 more level ups done I will be at rank 50.  Alot of people may not overtake him until the last week of the season, but I believe that may be Bethesdas intention anyway.
---
I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm on schedule, considering I missed day one.
---
It's just human nature to cheat, it's more pronounced in some than others. If there's an opportunity to cheat a system for more rewards with lack of perceived risk then people will always cheat, even if it's not necessary. Happens in virtual and real life over and over and will never stop.
---
Regarding this game in particular, I have no idea. A 4 year-old could beat this game even without decent legendaries.
---
Just a real world comment, nothing in game
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I think. The idea is that you are racing Zorbo across the galaxy. Gotta have that sense of urgency!
---
Then I‚Äôm sure they will soon follow, I don‚Äôt feel like Bethesda done yet. As much as I don‚Äôt like this method, it works. It has effectively wiped out the black market dealers and buyers thus eliminating in most of its entirety. With the demand gone, most of the remaining duper‚Äôs will stop or try and mass produce to fill in to make profit and get themselves caught that way or Bethesda will just start watching the forums and etc and banning people who seem suspicious that way. Both work
---
I know a toxic kid who duped. Did he get banned? Nope. Do I want to take away his 47 levels of work because he duped 230 holiday gifts and 53 fixers? Yes. Please Bethesda, it‚Äôs annoying to see people who are just being a ass duped and cheat while the rest of the non cheaters work for the guns and gifts and ammo and caps and scrap.
---
i‚Äôll take any rare outfits off your hands just to be safe. you‚Äôre absolutely spot on with your assumption that they‚Äôll be banning people if they even have so much as a single piece of uncommon apparel. I would get rid of any legendaries in your inventory too!
---
Nope.
---
Even the nocturnal board
---
For sure,  i work this weekend coming up unfortunately but I will be able to be online from 11:30pm to 3 am us eastern time Friday and Saturday.
---
Oh okay, that's good to know! I do really like the stealth and that's kind of made me reconsider my build a little. I'm a riffle build rn and having the additional stealth has been really fun!
---
Then why does it weigh so much?
---
Endless salt.
---
Haha gotcha :)
---
Anyone comfortably reading these posts and then suddenly realise.....
---
Oh shit. Assaultron Helmets.üòÅ
---
Nice info. If I actually would want to use it lol.
---
Unless it effects that sweet sweet money rolling in
---
I‚Äôm with you on that. I don‚Äôt support the black market for in game items for cash. I agree that people duping for a profit for cash should get banned. I would suggest keep and eye on Gameflip. That‚Äôs were they will catch all these duper‚Äôs turning out for a profit on their game.
---
I had this happen too. The strangler blooms don‚Äôt spawn for you until you do the quest An Organic Solution.
---
Honestly I think this dupe was allowed to go on to flood the market with them in order to allow a fix without a lot of bellyaching.  They can‚Äôt throw top tier weapons (gauss) in the game as a carrot when there‚Äôs a bigger and tastier carrot in the game.  Now they can fix legacies in the weapon rebalance and it‚Äôs not going to be the end of the world as it would have been if it were fixed in the capacity they existed beforehand.
---
This game has many, many problems.  Anyone that thinks this is the last dupe, I‚Äôve got a bridge to sell them.
---
Wait is that why I am not getting any loot from the queen?
---
Well for one the dupers whole thing is selling stuff to other people, and since you need multiple people for duping, putting them all in their own servers would backfire massively, and in NW there's barely enough people to make matches as it is, let alone make matches with only a tiny fraction of the playerbase.
---
I think you misunderstood. I'm saying that gold scrap is a substantial amount. A gold extractor running for a while would get you a lot.
---
Oh god, remember when these first started happening?
---
People would be like "I definitely didn't dupe!" and Bethesda was like "Well, our bot says no one with less than 20k of an item in their inventory was banned so... clearly, you duped."
---
Play stupid games...
---
They don't even compensate with atoms now. My friend filed a ticket about 5000+ score loss a week before and they said they won't do anything about it and he needs to wait before they resolve the issue. And that might as well never happen...
---
They weren't there initially, but showed up after I logged out and back in. Weird, but glad to have them! Thanks for the reply!
---
If this was a PVP game, you'd still be a-ok with dupers ruining a server?
---
The people who never duped, but offered 30k caps for a b2525, or trading masks for a b2525, or trading rare apparel for the red asylum that was duped thousands of times. Those same people pretend they wouldn't have taken a dodgy gun.
---
This \^ you're perfectly fine. Do what you want with them.
---
You want people to change how they build their camp because of your build?

If you hate this game so damn much, what are you even upset about?  
---
It's a buggy mess?  Okay.  Dont fucking play it.
---
Holy shit, it's seriously that simple.  You sure are letting Todd live inside your head, rent free.  Why waste so much energy on it?
---
It's a shitty game.  You made your point.  It sucks.  The game has flaws.  The lack of story.  Worst RNG of any game EVER.  It's not even a *real* fallout game.  It sucked when it came out, and it still sucks today.  I just dont get why you kept logging on to such a terrible game in the first place?  Nobody held a gun to your head, did they?
---
We all got you loud and clear.  Move on.  There are plenty of other games with devs that fix bugs, listen to the community, etc., etc., etc..  
---
Go find one.
---
I haven't touched the PA yet as I'm still getting the normal SS armor from them (busy with work for the past few months) but for a good spread of damage resistant types its a great set to use.
---
Man, no love for it's slower brother lol. Been hoping to roll a 90‚Ä∞ reduced weight agl to carry around for memes.
---
I picked up around 5 in total in a 4 day span. They might of all not been duped but I highly doubt it.
---
Yes I even kept it Untill I recovered naturally and still won't reg
---
I thought you were going to talk about it placing backwards in the doorframe. That closed/open visual bug has been around forever
---
Would also recommend sh over t65 for all the reasons the other guy stated
---
Its broken, you can contact support and they will grant you the atoms for the challenge, its what I did.
---
im.not saying it's not in the guidelines. just saying this is still Bethesda's fault
---
Cranberries,  man, cranberries!
---
I too am getting this, but I am a heavy weapons/power armor user, no vats. I didn't notice this till the last few days. 
---
The only way for the damage to accrue is with a melee weapon. But that doesn't solve the problem, only logging off that server fixes it. I rejoined back on my brother and still had the same problem, so it is server side.
---
I mean, there's an economy in prison, isn't there?
---
previous post I made about me duping weapons actually never happend since I made a resolution to not do it due to the risk of getting banned and not knowing how to do it. I'm not using this post to get ppl to believe me. Idc if they think I'm lieing its just a discussion. And wdym by "decisions?"
---
have fun with your gun! Enjoyed the internet arguing
---
And I have zero interest in playing the game legitimately. That's just not how I enjoy games. I want to enjoy the latest installment in the series, but I feel like I can't do that without hurting other players. 
---
/Vent/
---
same here
---
If u don‚Äôt care then don‚Äôt comment
---
you nearly copied my build :D  
---
as QOL i got CHA at 5 for inspirational 3 and travel agent with luck only 11 without ricochet and serendipity bc i 99% kill everything before it hits me. grind for the secret service armor and hope for unyielding rolls, try to get a fixer (dont have to be bloodied, Instigating or mutants is great also) and you ve reached the top.
---
Yea i did they are looking into it
---
The fast travel landing points aren't consistent. I am near a cliff. Most of the time you land on a hill opposite the cliff. Sometimes just behind on the other side and a 1/4 mile drop.
---
I dont think they would ban for buying stuff from a vending machine unknowing. But those are definitely not legit items so who knows.
---
Happens during the night.
---
Awesome post. I just came back to the game from all the way back in the first month. I am lvl 40 now and wished I had stayed away from questing, as I have gotten some sweet rewards that are unfortunately like lvl 30 or so, such as the fixer.
---
Yeah sure i fear no god so why not
---
Ah, yeah I think the largest quantity was x25 or so crashed Santas. Everything else was either single or 5-10 of each item. There were like five of each Ultracite PA piece and a few jet pack plans too.
---
All 30 caps each, come one come all. Lol
---
yea i did, it probably just saw i had to used to have multiple of the same legacy
---
I can see people getting banned for buying but possessing is a very slippery slope as people could have gotten them and didn‚Äôt know they were duped but it could also have been transferred from the dupe account.
---
They'll be back.  No one is banned yet, just suspended
---
Here, have some psycho, mentats and daddy-o with that and you'll have a great time.
---
Some ppl got banned for no reason, they should get banned yes but some cunts went under the radar
---
He's leveling about a space a day. After the events coming (and keep up with the daily and weekly) you'll be good.
---
I‚Äôd recommend getting another hunting rifle that‚Äôs identical for the day. If your PS4 I should be able to mod it for you
---
Also, the ghillie paint looks amazing
---
Seriously though, when are we getting some new hairstyles!? They could at least bring the ‚Äútube wave‚Äù back to the atomic shop, it was only purchasable for a day and then disappeared. I‚Äôm not even crazy about it but at this point I‚Äôll take whatever I can get, the same hairstyles for over a year are getting stale. Pleeeease Bethesda give us some new styles!!!
---
Hey I've been playing since December 2018 (on 2 accounts 1 that I lost) and I have never bought anything other than like armor or mods from the in-game vendors and I've always been very anti social and careful in the game so idk what you're talking about but don't keep trying to convince yourself that duping and cheating is "fine" and "everyone does it" but just know from another fallout 76 player that the rest of us actually play the game honestly and don't cheat just because you cheat and dupe doesn't mean everyone else does too
---
This. As far as I've seen it might and might not help to stay logged off during rotation. I personally have seen several times the rotation itself in real time (when the list depopulates and populates with new dailies one by one) and it never bugged on my side. But once I came in the evening after the rotation and found 70% of the dailies autocompleted for me.
---
Didn't even bother to file a ticket since it was just about an hour worth of xp-farm I was going to spend sometime anyway.
---
Call your credit card company and cancel your payment.
---
Thanks for the information. I like using power armor but I dont like how much of the screen the display use seems cluttered,  also weapons seem a little excessive on how much of he screen they take up.
---
I thought the red ship was mine as its always on the spot im at.
---
Yeah, it's random music that plays at night occasionally.
---
I was weirded out, but then I wanted the alternative song for my camp instruments.
---
im duping because im bored and then sell them for 0 caps
---
Yeah, not counting AFKers. I had a guy go full Goldilocks in my bed before logging off.
---
Maybe. Tbch I don‚Äôt think it should have one
---
Wonder how many casual players got their hands on top gear they would NEVER get otherwise...? Im with you on this one though we   will get downvoted to hell by Todds boyfriends ( oh no i get downvoted by strangers on the internet )
---
Funny fact is 90% of these preachers are using Shitty tse weapons that was duped last summer or when it was, they probably 100% legit drops lmao
---
Cool story bro. Tell it again.
---
There's an option in the display settings to turn off the power armour display for the normal one, way better
---
Yeah red ship is yours, the green is his.
---
The m79? I haven'ty really used it much, I did hear that it uses shotgun perks aswell as demo expert or something though, so its possible to increase the damage a fair bit, is that true?
---
Magically lost account; magically doesn‚Äôt use trade system or player vending. ‚ÄúLost‚Äù am account. Fishy. It‚Äôs amazing how no one will have any strong arguments. 
---
I never once said cheating is fine or everyone does it.  But nice try.
---
You‚Äôve played the game, you‚Äôve benefited for duping.
---
I love moments like this in this game. I‚Äôll never forget freaking out on my first visit to Alpine Cabins. I thought I was losing it at first lol.
---
This is the weirdest, most hilarious internet argument I've ever seen.
---
My game crashed about two minutes after I traded an armor item for caps and I was sweating bullets worried that I may have unintentionally duped. Got back on the character and was relieved to find that the item wasn't back in my inventory.
---
It's not unlocked by rank. But by xp earned. Once you earn it you select it in the atom shop. Once you do that it should be equipped next time you log in to nw
---
This. The toxicity on this sub is extremely high considering we all share something in common. 
---
I truly wonder what is wrong with humanity when I watch people genuinely get upset over something that absolutely does not affect them whatsoever.
---
I'd love it if it was a new gun to buy with gold bullion. I've already bought everything I want and being a commando the weapons don't interest me
---
YouTube that shit it‚Äôs free
---
Saying this brings nothing to the conversation.
---
Finally got to log in after work and apparently the atom shop is offline on ps4...
---
if you have any ghoul slayers too i‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a red flag for the ban team
---
Done! And I even have big arrows pointing to them. ;)
---
Those sneaky marketing geniuses over at Bethesda have finally figured out that if they update the store faster than my FO1st subscription doles out monthly Atoms, the temptation to buy more is greatly increased!
---
This is the exact reason I stopped playing TD2. The insane RNG turned the game into work. It stopped becoming fun, so I walked away from it. I work 40 hours a week already for shit pay, so I don‚Äôt want to work more when I‚Äôm on my own time. If I‚Äôm going to play a game, it better be more fun and less work or I will just not care about it anymore.
---
Well yeah, you snooze you loose.
---
Cows milk is the best at low levels
---
What's wrong with duping?
---
I don't play Fallout 76 so I have opinion on this one way or another. But I fail to see what's so inherently wrong with duplicating items.
---
Honestly I do frown upon duping, but y'all shouldn't make the game such an annoying grind, that would probably prevent a lot of duping.
---
I think people who are at cap limit do it so they won't lose money too
---
Exactly. And "life's too short" is the exact reason (well, one of) they're eager to impulsively spend these $300-500-10000 and even more on stuff most people will never consider to.
---
I will probably scrip my legacy weapon just to be safe.
---
Not counting those (at least I don't think) but three in one night as I hopped around seemed a bit much. I also worry about it with folks who have super high up houses (like on tram tracks).
---
Yeah I already figured out by myself xd
---
My personal philosophy is: when you clearly aren‚Äôt getting through to someone, play them at their own game.
---
Neither does this.
---
Man, let me share my most recent experience which is  more or less all of my RR experiences.  I show up, there‚Äôs one other person so they of course activate the event.  Alright I‚Äôll defend one side and wait if more people show up.  Guy # 2 goes to the other side, cool.  Now he runs back to my side for no reason and keeps blocking my line of sight.  So I go to the other side as ghouls are running in, I hold down the other side just fine l, guy #2 comes back and blocks my line of sight leaving the other side exposed, cool.  More people show up and do the same damn thing, alright I‚Äôll get ore.  Run some ore come back and 3/4 people are dead, awesome.  Everything is a cluster and ghouls are everywhere.  Clear it out and stick to a side and everyone is running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  At 10 seconds I deposit ore, no one else did....cool.
---
If you publicly shame dupers, you should never, ever buy a God roll off of anyone. Ever. For any reason. Try your luck with the crappy RNG system, then tell me duping isn't the *only* reason people have good gear that fits their build.
---
Trade secret: most people that bitch this publicly about dupers are just mad that no one showed them how to do it, or would help them do it, or do it for them for free.
---
Duping will stop being prevalent when they make it feasible to get the gear you want on your own. You don't see a bunch of duping in ESO, or WoW. Why? Because their loot system doesn't suck.
---
what makes a weapon legacy? on a melee? or is just the explosive one ?
---
Dude it‚Äôs silly tho.  Shouldn‚Äôt be like that.  Roblox games have less problems.
---
The expedient solution (which Bethesda appears to prefer) is to drop the atom shop keyword on any energy weapon that has the explosive perk.  \[BOOM\] no longer transferable.  
---
Then spend some time making a cross character stash to they can move between characters, but be traded to other players or sold to vendors.
---
The vast majority of the "wrongfully banned" players may not have duped first hand but they absolutely benefitted from the duping exploits. I'm sorry, but if you're part of the crowd that picked up crazy amounts like 10k Holiday Gifts and were banned for it I have no sympathy. You should have known damn well that was fishy and that there might be consequences.
---
Edit: And this is one of the many problems of the 76 community. "Cheaters are ruining the game!.. (except when I'm benefitting from them)". Sorry, but you can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
Been playing for about 2 months and all i ever get from the purveyor is flamers, cryo, and laser pistols. Not a single bloodied rifle after about 3500 scrip
---
You can mine gold out of the ground in the game and smelt it into gold scrap, all bulk gold scrap would be is a bar of gold.
---
alot of power armor skins take up 1/3 of the screen. mostly they are low res aswell...
---
Op  already removed his post lol. Probably realized how ridiculous he sounded .
---
Starlight!
---
For every week this goes unfixed Bethesda should extend the season one week. They want this to be the first of many seasons so this is an opportunity to show good will to the community and get off on the right foot.
---
Actually I played on my dads PS4 account that since he was kicked out of house years ago he hasn't used and changed the password and in turn locked me out of the PS4 account and in turn my Bethesda account that I had all my fallout 4 saves on and my 76 saves I guess and how does playing the game make you benefit from duping that's like saying if you've ever worn old navy you have enslaved kids which the company old navy has done but just because you play something or wear something doesn't mean you've done anything wrong
---
Sent you the friend invite if you stil wanna launch a nuke
---
No I didn‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt see it, it‚Äôs moderated.
---
Ignore him.  It‚Äôs ridiculous that we even have to do that.  Soon we need to turn console on and off five times while spinning or a bug wrecks the game.
---
It‚Äôs cross platform, and yeah. Apparently thousands of people got suspended, and it‚Äôs no suprise hardcore players got hit hard as well.
---
That was a journey and a half.  And sounds more like the fake kid saying he got cancer with over 200 gold awards.... than ANY vailed point.
---
Dude. Not everyone plays the game the same. What is end game for you might not be end game for someone else.  
---
Its a game. Its supposed to be fun. I've played since launch and farming 15+ queens a day doesn't sound like fun to me.  But you do you.  Thats the point. Just don't belittle others because they don't play the way you do.
---
I personally have not had my account suspended nor have I knowingly benefited from dupes. I've simply seen many friends and acquaintances report that their account has been suspended. Given that chances are their suspension came from one or several duped items, it's possible that people may have unknowingly purchased or traded with people for duped items. Because dupes have been around for so long, it's possible that there are a significant number of duped items in circulation through trading of unknowing sellers or recipients.
---
well, it's not all about dupers.
---
i cancelled my sub last week like many others from my comunity, i didn't exploited or got banned. the "content" we have right now is a shame, also the legendary run is a hoax and cashgrab. since we won't get proper content soon (colossal problems and brotherhood are months away) there is no reason to play on if you reach endgame.
---
there is simple no reason to keep 1st active the next one or two months.
---
OK , makes sense. They wasted no time to get it down lol. Really though man. You have the weapons you want and are happy  from what I read before it was removed.
---
Yea sometimes for me it‚Äôs just lag and the damage will appear a second or so later. Could have something to do with server lag in general. Though this time I was right in front of him and he was attacking. Oh well at least you don‚Äôt really lose anything if you die.
---
So what is your late game? Running around not shooting ammo? Only base building? You need a lot of materials for both.
---
This post was removed by mods trying to tamper the conversation.
---
I was one of the people wrongfully suspended. Do I have to reply to the automated message or make a ticket and submit it to Bethesda support?
---
How would I write it out? Do I explain how I shouldn‚Äôt I be banned?
---
If you have unlocked it then it will be in the atomic store. Click on it in the atomic store and it will equip it when you go in to NW next
---
Cold weather issues may eventually come to 76.  The winters in WV can be harsh sometimes, so there's no lore issues there.  Not as bad northern states, but sub-zero temps are not rare. 
---
They could add a status bar similar to food/drink that follows body temp or some similar concept.  Wear heavy clothing (at a cost to agility and move speed) for complete protection or thinner clothes that cause you to get cold and begin suffering the negative effects of that.
---
Somebody else linked it before me otherwise I would have, good luck on the board anyway!
---
If you sneak in the main room undetected, you can actually see the Wendigo playing the organ while the other ghouls are praying on their knees. After a while the Wendigo leaves the organ and starts fucking a ghoul in the ass. Bethesda did a good job at illustrating pre war catholic church.
---
You guys dont understand sarcasm, jeez. :(
---
LOL, he's a tweaking.  I started twitching a little bit like him when I saw all those quests active all at the same time.   Happy gaming.
---
i also just won my first game but i was hiding in a bush between two wall edit level 7 btw
---
He makes fun of Beckham for having to get the honey himself.
---
I recommend making a ticket to Bethesda Support.
---
They also took out a lot of their revenue, which ya know, keeps the game going? 
---
You think casual players are buying Atoms or 1st?
---
Hey man, I found this double explosive flamer inside the suitcase fair and square, don't blame me, it's the big bad dupers' fault! ^^^^^/s
---
its how far zorbo is on the board. he moves one space every day
---
With the way you‚Äôre responding to comments, there is no ducking way you got banned for anything else other than duping. Cheat elsewhere shitter.
---
What‚Äôs the point of it?
---
Yep, from the entire series and also picks from other longe music from the 30s, 40s, and 50s
---
most likely removed as he said it was one of his many throw away accounts under a fake email. Seen many post like his today and they are  still running fine.
---
You should post some screenshots.
---
I tried to get people to fight in my arena camp before, the FO76 playerbase in general doesn't seem like the type. In my experience, those who want to PvP prefer to do so unfairly against an unsuspecting opponent, rather than in a fair arena fight.
---
Well I‚Äôm buying atoms and I‚Äôm a casual player. And tbh, I don‚Äôt think Bethesda cares
---
so you can beat him to the end im pretty sure
---
We talking taters or Winnie Blues? üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs a lot of exclamation points
---
Wth??? Are you ok?? What are you talking. About ??
---
Bethesda is...um...bad at online. They've always been bad at anything online. I think ESO is their one shining success. I've been playing Bethesda games from back before morrowind was a thing and that's always been an issue for them.
---
 But also, the engine they're using for fallout 76 is the same one from fallout 4 and that was a stupid mistake. It's full of holes and frankly was never meant to do this.
---
When it became obvious this was going to be harder then they thought after launch they should have just dumped their live service concept and gone full Conan or Ark with it. Let people install it on their own servers, do mods, whatever, work on stabilization and then keep putting out expansions and content packs for people to buy.
---
Yeah but why what do you get
---
I helped a friend with this a few months back, let me see if I still remember how we fixed it.  I believe the solution was to catch a different disease then immediately server hop and go catch sludge lung right away while you still had the other disease.
---
&gt;...really? Something that changed absolutely nothing content-wise made you cancel it
---
isn't this one of the biggest reason to quit?
---
When did they nerf bloodied?
---
no idea. i guess we will find out when we beat him lol
---
Bye bye
---
True. If you cheat, just accept the consequences.  Even my middle schoolers get that.
---
Nobody is being banned for one or two duped items. People are banned for large stacks of rare items and mutliple copies of the same high value legendaries. If you pick up a paper bag with thousands of a rare item, you're taking the risk that all those items are illegitimate and will get you banned. Maybe there's a very small percentage of players that truely were ignorant enough to pick up duped items without having any suspicion, but I find it hard to believe the majority of the community is that ignorant.
---
Hey if you haven't gotten rid of it you wanna sell it? I run bloodied and have need of a handmade. Though if your interested I cant get on till tomorrow night. Btw I'm talkin bout the one star I'm not trying to buy your new 3 star.
---
Oh
---
I believe this cryptid was inspired by early concept art of the Scorchbeast.
---
which card is that in Nuclear Winter.
---
I sure hope my friends didn't get banned, they've played with a duper and even recieved a few items (Large Gifts) from him. The funny thing is, he said that dupers won't get caught since he didn't think they could be tracked.
---
Basically a progression goal.  It shows how much longer you have to finish.
---
Like most players I have no illusions about the origin of some weapons I acquired through trading. If I do end up being banned I'll be slightly pissed tbh.
---
I do not condone d00oping but with the gating mechanics &amp; stupid RNG this game really had it coming. When the d00p wawe was live was offered a BEFR GP for free &amp; I declined it, could've traded anything for it. After a few days of playing I'm not sure I did the right thing anymore...
---
Some random dropped 10000 captured frogs on my pool table yesterday lol
---
I agree. 
---
I would love to see a useful arm mod. Stabilize like the armor have. 
---
I am fine with that there‚Äôs no legendary effects on PA. 
---
But I would like to see them add extra mods for the outside of the PA. Like pocketed, deep pocketed, lead plating, explosive plating for legs, arms and torso. And you should learn them by scraping PA armor parts.
---
Yeah but why do i need a green space ship to tell me that when i have my own piece that makes no sense

I had to meet the minimum character count for the title, and I went a bit overboard with my frustration.
---
This is why caps are still king 200+ years after the bombs.  Only Crimson Caravan figured out the secrets of duping caps.
---
T60, because it's cheap to repair and has the BoS paints. 
---
T51b looks like it was made out of five gallon buckets. 
---
SH has to be watered every day and the fertilizer really adds up!
---
T65 may have the best stats, but seriously lacks in the aesthetics department. 
---
X01 is my second choice behind T60, but the shoulder plates just say "Murmrgh's shawl" to me.
---
Congrats
---
I agree.
---
We do have Feral Ghouls in Australia. We call them Bogans.
---
Yeah my homie got banned, it‚Äôs stupid cause Bethesda doesn‚Äôt fix their games and expects people to not cheat or exploit, it‚Äôs like not building a wall and complaining about people breaking in
---
Well no just because I have played the game on 2 separate accounts that I never used cheats or dupes on any of them doesn't automatically make me a cheater people can have alt accounts all the time and the only cheat involving 2 accounts was that dev room glitch from like a year ago that the internet historian made a video about which btw I don't know how tf that dev room glitch even worked or any glitch works for that matter and you know what I have more productive things to do
---
Only half drunk?  \[burp\] Amateur.
---
Try snapping on a wall
---
Well I forced quit my computer before I left for work. Takes too long to do a proper shutdown.
---
Lol. 
---
‚ÄúNerd!‚Äù
---
How ever will you sleep tonight?
---
That calculator also claims it doesn't take into account the extra dailies we now get, so I think its an extra 500 score per day, meaning most people should finish faster than expected if they're inline with where the calculator says they should be.
---
üòÇ You don‚Äôt think they care about money? Bruh
---
Theyre going to care when they have to explain to their stockholders why hundreds of people canceled their 1st subscription today. 
---
And I really doubt you‚Äôre spending at a minimum $13 a month on Atoms.
---
Nobody deserves getting banned when F***** Bugthesda can‚Äôt even fix their broken games
---
You and I both know there's a huge difference between buying a single decent legendary from a vendor vs being gifted thousands of rare items for free. Sure, I'll concede there's a possibility I've gotten ahold of duped items, but I've never taken anything that is so obviously made through exploits. I can't fault someone when there is legitimate plausible deniability, but you and I both know that if you're buying off someone that has 10 of the exact same high value legendary or 500 copies of a rare plan you're supporting a cheater.
---
I am. Feel bad for those who got their mains banned though. Some I have played with regularly. Almost convinced a few of them didn‚Äôt even dupe but rather just accepted free stuff from others.
---
I tried submitting a massive list of bugs in the past, it just got a generic reply and most of them still are not fixed to this day. If we are already doing their unpaid QA work, you would think they'd at least make it easy to gather the info. There's also no real place to request an atom refund for the atom shop, the closest is a refund for a site purchase that does not really line up with the atom shop. I talked a bit about that with their customer support while trying to get a refund and it seems like they are used to getting sent in under the wrong tags because fitting ones don't exist. It's like they are doing the best with what they can, but the layout of their support page and support tickets is absolute garbage
---
Thanks for asking this! I‚Äôm actually in the same boat. I just hit level 8. I‚Äôm not too happy with the micro transactions though. I enjoy building and it‚Äôs a shame to see camp items in the atomic shop that I can‚Äôt earn in game. I‚Äôm also scratching my head over the fact that I can‚Äôt blueprint my whole camp even though I‚Äôm only half way on the build limit. I made a 2 story camp and could only blueprint the 1st story...
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt like the look of T-65. But is T-60 easy to repair base or with the Perk that makes power armor easier to repair? I read that T-60 is good because it doesn‚Äôt need screws to repair but when I went to repair mine it did (I don‚Äôt have the perk)
---
Got it. I just thought you were real mad.
---
Earned. I don't buy a lot from the store. I did have F1st for 2 months so that's 1650 atoms *2
---
But those are gone since I bought 2 bundled and a PA skin.
---
Good advice, people seemed to have missed the Grocer mod which reduces food &amp; drink weight to almost nothing, if you're running those perks it will free up perk points. You can obtain it from The Foundation bullion vendor after hitting neighbourly IIRC
---
I remember hearing about people getting banned for simply having impossible items, so they would have probably been banned
---
Because we're only left with speculation on how the bot targets certain players, I can't really speak to its accuracy beyond the words of friends and acquaintances who claim they have never knowingly duped or used duped items. Although my only evidence is anecdotal, given how wonky moderation bots can be at times, I believe it's likely that some innocent players were caught in the crossfire.
---
Good one. LOL
---
They increased the repair costs recently, but it's still lower than the others. Not sure about T65 yet, I haven't had to repair it.
---
It‚Äôs a 2yo account, although made for this purpose exactly. Doubt it‚Äôs due to the account. It‚Äôs just censoring inconvenient opinions :)
---
I saw a comment recently that said something along the lines of "Lol you dupers are so dumb". My dude was selling multiple IE legacy lasers and flamers TODAY lol wtf
---
Man you had the time to write a book but not enough to play the game correctly....
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the info!!!
---
I‚Äôm fairly sure the stockholders and everyone in charge wrote this entire game off after the fatal launch which has been a couple years and with some big names coming up on their releases, I don‚Äôt think they care. This community has been repeatedly neglected and milked for crash. And a move like was most likely given a go ahead by someone in charge. I‚Äôm not really gonna argue
---
Good tip, I don't run those perks, but I'm sure many do. Thanks for adding your 2 cents :)
---
I get these from my scavengebot if i have it set up to collect food/meds/etc...
---
This is wrong lol, they're looking at recent acquisition and just generally any suspicious activity coming in/out of your inventory in the past few weeks. People I know who have dev room items like quantum paddles have not gotten any suspensions. I have 100+ weapons on my character, including many removed and bugged items like impossible legendaries or NW attachments. Surprise surprise, no ban, because I haven't done any duping or associated with anybody who did
---
Avant-garde sculpture on living animal
---
I still do not see a problem if you don't have time to grind but you do have spare cash.
---
Both are OK in my books, grind or pay, granted that the grind isn't impossible
---
guess more burner accounts since gamepass only takes 1$...
---
Touch√©
---
...took like 10 mins. Was more of a rant than anything. If I'd actually taken the time to properly format everything, I'd say fair enough, but it really didn't take all that long.
---
If you need to cheat to enjoy it, you're playing the wrong game.
---
2 hours is still a good chunk of time. What 3 are the quixkest/easiest?
---
To put more pressure on you to keep grinding.
---
the nukashine will most likely teleport to you a dangerous part of the map if you are a low  level. i use them as an emergency teleport if I am pinned down and over-emcumbered
---
Love mine for line in sand, put my tent over the spawn trap so they all spawn in middle. Goodbye scorched lol. 
---
Yeah the durability is really weak they need to look at some of the durability issues guns have can you imagine been in a war firing 50 round sorry guns broke not a chance. Maybe 100 then maintenance but not broke.
---
Yeah it looks like a giant vulture or something, but apparantly its very similar to early scorchbeast concept art. Can anyone confirm if its been in the game since launch or was it only added in Wastelanders? Seems kinda odd they would use an old model if it was only added recently. Thats the only thing that gets me about this.
---
Yup me neither, but it really makes a difference, currently playing with a carry weight of 68/310 or something like that. That's like an extra 200 stash space if needed.
---
If you have the cards I can help tmmrw morning
---
Think of it as a timer. When he reaches the end, the season is over and if you haven't passed him and gotten to the end, then you will not be able to progress any further in the season. He moves 1 space per day for this exact reason. If you count the amount of spaces he has left on the board, it should correlate with the amount of days left in the season. He started at around Rank 30 I believe.
---
Again, some of us enjoy games differently than you do and that's perfectly fine. 
---
What's not fine is gatekeeping me from my favorite franchise of a time because I like playing differently than you do. 
---
Picture a reverse scenario, where fallout 76 has all of the superpowers and cheats from Saints Row 4. Would you not want private servers so you could download immersion friendly mods to play how you want to play?
---
It was added a when back with Wastelanders and it's based off the original design of the Scorchbeast Queen (it wasn't a bat originally). Some people think it was put there by an artist because they already had the texture for it and nothing will come of this. But other people like myself hope that this becomes the new Thunderbird Cryptid and it's a mega boss they add to the game that we can fight just like the Scorchbeast Queen
---
Lmfao why project that on others
---
To be honest, dupers have never hurt me. I see high level players, players with tons of kinds of junk that they duped, millions of ammunition, but I don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs problematic to some people. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt engage in PvP, I just like to play, unlock achievements and do quests, Queen runs, etc. And I‚Äôve never had a problem with dupers, like they aren‚Äôt hurting me nor my experience in the game. At least that‚Äôs my opinion &amp; experience.
---
So, I kinda agree, like removing lot of players isn‚Äôt going to help anything. Plus [None of these super dupers that got banned were actually using their accounts] so they just banned accounts that were mules to start with.
---
I saw a video comparing it to the West Virginia Roc. I feel like it makes more sense than an early concept for the scorchbeast since it has feathers and other features of a bird
---
What company writes something off then continues to spend money adding content? Do you hear yourself?
---
Look at Anthem. *That* was written off after a failed launch. Bethesda *just* added seasons to the game, and Wastelanders was one of their biggest updates. Games that are written off don‚Äôt get that content years later.
---
See my comment above...but basically your spaceship is showing your rank, his spaceship is showing how many days are left in the season.
---
Oh yes of course. My apologies. I forgot that there's no such thing as personal responsibility. 
---
Lol seriously though, I feel like a lot of players seem to think that just because they didn't do the duping directly doesn't mean they should be punished for accepting ridiculous numbers of rare items that were obviously obtained through exploits.
---
Well im missing the green ship. I dobt think ive ever seen it. Where is it supposed to be today?
---
Don't cheat, loser
---
A-fucking-men! What happened to fallout just being a game about chilling and surviving in the wasteland with a good story? Why do we have to play with other people to get the full experience? I liked walking out of the vault into my matrix-like prep room with every weapon/amour/mod known to humankind so I can wreck shit in the way I want to role play. I like fallout solo because I get my pvp fix in games made for it! Fallout needs to go back to single player or at the very least co op with friends on a small not so bugged server with just great stories in mind. Not this grind till you lose your fucking mind bull. Not one more dollar of mine is going to fallout till they make something a bit more enjoyable.
---
Ps. Still like 76 but needs more content and less skins.
---
I agree with this duper‚Äôs never effected my game they only made it easier for me to get some weapons or other things
---
Well, if you do, enjoy your ban.
---
Sounds about right, its pretty unfortunate.
---
I bet, this whole duping incident of late, I bet it was reported long before it broke out. Somewhere in a collection of ignored support tickets, itll be there, clearly laid out by a player trying to do right.
---
And if you have the capacity and can make it there. Buy the nuka cola grape.
---
Giving cheaters their own server is a waste of money and bandwidth. Ban them all.
---
What you're not understanding is that this is an online game. No matter how much you want it to be offline, it is not. That simple fact alone invalidates your entire argument. You have 3 other games in the series that are similar, in which you can do whatever you want, but you are playing an online game.   
---
As for your reverse scenario, if Fallout 76 wasn't a game I enjoyed, I would simply **Play something else**.  
---
I can't believe you even think this is some kind of valid argument.
---
On top of that since later levels cost more score you‚Äôll have to buy less levels if you wait til the end to finish (long as you are actively working to make score)
---
[Definitely not this... (this)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFYMzQ3Vfq0)
---
Can I see the evidence?
---
Good for Bethesda! the same shitbags that complain about bugs &amp; bans, are the very ones that are causing problems on the servers.
---
I have no sympathy for any of you that are getting kicked out it should have happened a long time ago.
---
I wholeheartedly agree and I'm glad to see I'm definitely not the only one who shares this sentiment. I think co-op fallout would be by far, the most amazing experience in the world.
---
Ive never seen a low level (under 10) get teleported out of the forest. I guess they where just lucky.
---
Correct. Granted I wouldn't trust only 30k for b2525, but I'd definitely consider trading for one. I also wouldn't touch a hacked weapon since I don't want to get banned and there's literally no point playing a game when you're cheating at it.
---
I just swapped from a stealth commando in the Chinese suit to a bloodied stealth rifle in a SS Jet Pack.  The Chest piece is chameleon.  Don't have the other pieces yet, so use regular unyielding pieces. I do miss the Chinese suit, and keep it to swap if I want to go in a nuke zone.  I bought the $200 protectice lining, but can't craft for some reason.  Supposedly that's the best one with the added special stats.  
---
Damage with the bloodied rifle uses much fewer rounds of ammo.  Die more often than the full health Chinese suit.  Still adjusting perks.
---
Each SPECIAL have associated stats that scale.
---
* Strength boosts carry weight by 5
---
* Perception boosts hit chance 
---
* Charisma affects barter
---
* Intelligence affects XP gain
---
* Agility gives 5 AP and boosts sneak
---
* Luck affects max condition from purveyor and critical charge
---
Etc.
---
Full unyielding set gives +15 to all but Endurance. 
---
You basically get free Strong Back, Inspirational, Sneak, Critical Savvy, Action Boy, Hard Bargain and more.
---
+75 AP makes Dodgy significantly better as a source of damage mitigation.
---
That's a lot of utility.
---
Whereas any of the other armor prefixes give nothing by conparison. Who needs Chameleon when the enemies don't detect you anyway?
---
My feeling exactly. 
---
I just with it was also **visibly**  smaller...
---
Yeah. I could perhaps understand the durability issues if the explosive weapons were still as powerful in 76 as they are in previous Fallouts, it would make sense that for something so damaging, the tradeoff is the constant need for repairs. But it isn't like the explosive weapons from previous games and I think it needs to be looked at too. I haven't counted, but how many grenades would you estimate you can fire off before it breaks? For mine I think its less than 2 clips, but I will have to try and actually count from 200% repaired to 0 and see just how many I can fire.
---
Think it about 50 not sure
---
I‚Äôm a mod in a glitch server for fo76 with around 500ppl, I‚Äôd say 2/3 of players had an account banned between pc, ps4 and xbox
---
I'm on PS4 and noticed a lack of vendors today. When I logged on and saw the challenges, one being to buy things, I hit the map. There were two vendors with maybe 10 items in total. It was weird.
---
That was my thinking. Very much reminiscent of the Thunderbird legend.
---
We actually play on Xbox One! The voices from the family were over the games' world chat/mic, while the messages I referred to in the post were sent over Xbox Live's messaging system on the console. Because neither my girlfriend nor I have access to a microphone, we primarily use Live messaging to communicate anything too complicated for the games' emotes.
---
Again, I‚Äôm not arguing here. But do you think the players were really ever being brought into consideration if the company is suddenly willing to ban half of its player base? Or all of the many other issues this game has had while it‚Äôs been updated and etc each one seemingly gonna ‚Äúbankrupt the company‚Äù
---
Facts.
---
u can find lots of bloodied build based on different weapons on this website.

He‚Äôs like 10 spaces in front of me at lvl 30
---
Bullshit. So if somebody breaks into my house and rob's me it's my fault? No, when we play a game we agree to terms and conditions, it doesn't matter what issues the game may have, the terms and conditions don't change.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize anyone played this game.
---
The game has gone a long way since release. Though it doesn't necessarily compare to the classic Fallout experience, it's pretty good as an addict of the game myself. The game is a tad bit too grind-y at times with mechanics such as gold bullion and the Legendary Run now introduced, but there's much to enjoy about the game regardless. Presently, there is a banwave going on over duping, but it shouldn't have any effect on your experience. Just be cautious of duped items such as OP legendaries or massive amounts of presents.
---
ü§î I've never used one but next time I get one I'll try it out üòÅ.
---
lol, damned if you do damned if you dont indeed eh.
---
It‚Äôs not free you literally have to get it, so you know how much script I spent for my set
---
I totally get that I‚Äôm far up in the mountains on the monorail line overlooking Watooga, the back patio view is too good I just don‚Äôt wanna leave and it‚Äôs far too complexly decorated to even attempt to blueprint it, not a brag either just if you‚Äôve ever tried to use that system I imagine you get it haha
---
Go put on T-51b PA and stand in a nuke zone. Then put on X-01 and do the same.
---
I know the flat reduction is a thing, but there is definitely a noticeable difference between the low RR PA, and the higher RR PA. Enough so that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend loitering in a nuke zone in armor below T-60 or X-01 for long periods.
---
I was level 15 when I did the quest and it teleported me to the middle of the bog, haha. I ran like the wind and unlocked the watoga rail station, so I can shop for plans
---
Yeah, it's possible a handful of players are innocent. But given every other past ban wave I'm inclined to believe they handled it in the same way; only banning those with many copies of the same high value legendaries or excessive numbers of rare items.  Most players are not legitimately obtaining high enough quantities of the rare items they look for and it would be next to impossible to legitimately have enough duplicate copies of the Legendaries they look for in the bans. 
---
Everytime there's a mass ban wave the cheaters make a huge shit storm and throw their tantrums and there's plenty of claims about "unjustly being banned." It almost always comes to light later that the people making these claims are lying/distorting the truth and aren't as innocent as they say they are. 
---
I feel for the rare player that is innocent and got caught up in a ban. I don't have sympathy for the players that knowingly (or with good suspicion) took advantage of other players exploits and think they should get away with it.
---
Never duped, but I feel like small amounts of duping (aka, does this actually work, experimenting) doesn't deserve a full on ban. if you are regularly exploiting the system, then yeah, you deserve it
---
So go play ESO or WOW......
---
And nobodys "complaining" about dupers.... everybodys saying they deserve to get banned
---
No the majority of players aren't thieves. Nor do they justify their shity behavior by blaming Bethesda.
---
uuuuh. couldnt read, was distracted by a big face popping up on my small phone screen.
---
count me in. playing for over a year.
---
I‚Äôm sacrificing so many other perks for the damage, sacrifice never going another armor set. It‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows it‚Äôs a big commitment for a high reward play-style. You can easily go junkies and do all of 10% damage less and not have to worry about any of that
---
Wow 0 comprehension
---
People needed to dupe in this broken ass game?
---
 I'd like to see a separate Olympics where everyone is required to use drugs
---
&gt;What you're not understanding is that this is an online game. No matter how much you want it to be offline, it is not.
---
Tell that to the plethora of "online" survival PVP games that I've hosted locally on my old desktop for my friends and I to play on. Plenty of them such as rust, Eco, etc... Are all sold as online only games, but those of us who are tech savvy enough can host our own servers if we so choose to do so. I see no reason (other than monetization) that Bethesda couldn't do the same thing. 
---
&gt;You have 3 other games in the series that are similar, in which you can do whatever you want,
---
And I've played that absolute shit out of those games. I've spent so much time in them that I could probably recite half the diologue from memory. I've gotten every single ending. I've gotten as much enjoyment as I realistically can out of fallout 3, 4 and new Vegas, and I want more. 
---
I love the fallout universe, and I want to experience it how I want to. If I'm a paying customer, I should have the right to do so. 
---
Other games just don't cut it, so don't go telling me "just go elsewhere". If you can find a game that checks all of these boxes, please, let me know:
---
- post apocalyptic setting
---
- base building
---
- 1st and third person
---
- deep weapon customization
---
- captivating lore
---
- NPCs
---
- crafting and loot system
---
- offline
---
If you can name a game that checks all of those boxes that I haven't already sunk hundreds, if not thousands of hours into, I'd absolutely love to hear it, but if you don't, please stop dismissing my points.
---
I don't like people who need everything handed to them, starting the game with every single best weapon in the game and shit? That's for pussies, if you duped fucking fourty BE gatling plasmas you should be banned
---
A guy was selling stealthboys mk3 at 10 caps each, I bought like 200, should I dropped them?... At first I was like man what a bargain, but now I'm a little worried
---
I clearly understand what you‚Äôre saying, I‚Äôm saying you having those perk cards and other armor is utility you can swap thins out. Bloodied you‚Äôre stuck with that gear switch to anything else and you‚Äôre worthless.
---
amen
---
and f*** **f all those "i DuPeD bC beThIsDI fOrCe Me wItH bAd RnG aNd PaY tO wIn MeThOdS" not my fault
---
To be honest, running Bloody let's me take off damage perks so I can use Fortune Finder and friends. Sounds like you're wasting perks for the damage.
---
And I was talking about Unyielding Armor, not weapons.
---
I can see now that typing up all that help for you was wasted effort.
---
You say ‚Äúfree stats‚Äù as if people arnt burning though 1000s of script yo get it. What is free in this
---
My camp is up by the raiders with meg I bomb super mutants all the time with mine. It's fun watching their bodies fly through the air.
---
If it didn't have the real life consequences of fucking up your body, same. It'd genuinely be cool to see just how far we can push it, right?
---
Why are you getting downvoted
---
That‚Äôs not right.
---
I remember when the perk was apparently nerfed to reduce the players' jump height if they used it too often. I say 'apparently', because I have never noticed a significant difference in the enemies I've faced.
---
That said, I actually don't mind fighting Frog Legs users, so long as I'm far enough away to not give them a height advantage. What makes me nervous in a fight are those crazy rifle builds that can one shot you without any error. Even had a teammate get downed by a single crossbow bolt, while at full health with undamaged Scout armor. I'm not much for theory crafting in terms in gameplay and builds, but man I wish I was that good to ace whole teams with 4 bullets.
---
Wow I didn't know that thank you.
---
They're very easy to tell since hackers have no subtlety at all. It's not like "hey that's good, hope it's not hacked", they're obviously "oh that deletes the queen immediately because you want to be a dickhead" level.
---
maybe you used super duper and crafted 2 of each type? xd
---
Oooooh!
---
I never have &amp; I'm doing great. No excuses - ban them sll
---
No shit there are no such things as unyielding weapons. Sounds like you‚Äôre using utility perks 24/7 instead of when you need them. If I‚Äôm gonna be fighting I have 100% damage perks why would you play any other way
---
It's wednesday, my dude !
---
You can have a faster hard drive and load in quicker than other people, you can use photo mode and pretty much disappear by using poses. Didn‚Äôt get to experience much of survival myself but would take that over that mess anyday
---
What points? You think you actually have a point in amongst all these long winded walls of text? (You can't host fallout 76 on your home PC, so I've no idea what you think mentioning games like Rust does for your argument lol)At the end of the day, your argument amounts to "I pay for the game, I should be able to play how I want" and I totally agree. In singleplayer games. Which Fallout 76 is not. If that is what you need to do to enjoy the game, then you **are playing the wrong game.**
---
Don't spam craft so quick and maybe the RNG won't hitch on Nocturnal 4 times in a row
---
Not if Donnie has anything to do with it.
---
I think part of the problem may be how stupid trades are in this game. You cant trade items for items and maybe it looks like when you sell the weapon to another player in part of a trade for 1 cap or drop it or whatever, the method of transfer is seemingly making the other end of the trade look like an alt and therefore an accomplice to the duping. Some of the dupers seem to dupe on one account that is for alts and then trade to another. A lot of the letters I saw indicated that the accounts were just suspended while under review and not actually b&amp;... yet.
---
Mmm sweet succulent BE plasma... I‚Äôm gonna cherish mine for a loooong time
---
Indeed they should. Went and got the corvega backpack now :-)

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.
---
Totally agree, Bethesda is bad at online games. One thing to clarify though, ESO was developed by Zenimax and not Bethesda which is probably why it was a success.
---
As I touched upon in my post, if you like progressing and scrounging through the wasteland for the absolute best gear you can find, good on ya! Seriously, I'm happy that you enjoy doing that so much because there are a lot of games that accomodate that. However, as I recognize that there are people who play differently to me, I ask you to do the same. Some of us like playing fallout DOOM style just absolutely letting all hell lose from the moment we get out of the vault-- that's just how some of us like to play. I understand that fallout 76 is an online game and that playstyle would absolutely wreck it for those of you who like to play that way, which is why the actual point of my post is advocating for private servers, so those of us who wanna cheat can do so in peace and we can all get the most value out of the game.
---
That's just my opinion though. Happy trails, partner.
---
I...   Just take my upvote.  I'm tired.
---
I have full set 3 star ss unyielding and got lucky with a nice bloodied gauss shotty trust me I‚Äôm fine.
---
A wise man once said, everyone in Shawshank is innocent.
---
I think it is intentional, the firebreathers gear has an tank and so does the engineer it is most likely for those kinds of outfits to avoid clipping.
---
Do you mean series x and ps5?
---
I doubt there'll be an upgraded version. With backwards compatibility you can already play the current version on the new xbox series x so Bethesda surely won't spend time and resources to update the graphics and create another version of the game.
---
Sorry, but if you're getting pounced and 'naded by Frog Legs users you either need to up your tactics or your situational awareness.
---
Your issue could also potentially be solved by adding Fireproof to NW instead of removing Frog Legs. That way you could reduce the effectiveness of the Frog Legs/Grande Launcher strat in a more balanced way that doesn't take the fun out of a lot of people's play. Instead of being selfish and only thinking about how the game could be changed to benefit you, why don't you work on coming up with suggestions that benefit everyone.
---
Definitely :) I've been using the game RuneScape as a comparison, since it's an 18 year old online game with a thriving economy, including items that can no longer be obtained which sell for more than most players will ever make

An economy is so important to an online game
---
And yeah it had to be something obvious like that lmao
---
Grenadier doesn't seem to work on Turbo Grenades, but on the bright side if you throw one in the exact centre, it will just perfectly cover a 3x3 pad of foundations, which you can fit a fair amount of crops on :)
---
Yes
---
You can tell who all the salty cheaters are.. you mad bros? Wouldnt be suprised if all the people with the end season items start dissapearing too...
---
Dope! Just send you an invite!!
---
I signed up through bethesda.net, so I am unable to cancel through Xbox. I looked that up
---
How in-depth is the base building system? 
---
Base building is why I have 800 more hours in fallout 4 than I do 3 and NV. Gotta have base building.
---
I'd say play it for yourself and make your mind up. Majority of us here play the game and we love it so we will say yes but that said yes there are many bugs in the game, though not as many as you may think if you follow YouTube and the like but give it a go. It's fun
---
Still waiting on Descenders to get patched so it loads past the loading menu too - only reported that to the devs and M$ like 1 year ago.
---
I've got an explosive build guy running around with a  mirv, m79, auto grenade and a missile launcher, every single one twoshot. It's not the most hard hitting build but holy fuck do you suppress enemies. 
---
Power leveling at line in the sand has never been easier.
---
Unyielding / +1 Charisma / Waterbreathing
---
NICE
---
combined with a M$ $tore Xp3ri3nc3.. definitely the pits.
---
I would and will never buy anything from M$ $tore.. UWP is the worst platform/DRM in existence.
---
I get the anger and I‚Äôm trying to withhold judgment for now. But lets be real. Duping has been a problem for a while. Everyone has gotten a duped item at one point or another. Especially buying from player vendors. No one is morally superior here. The only ones that should be receiving bans are the ones that obviously knew the items where duped. Someone that traded for an item or found it in a suitcase shouldn‚Äôt be caught in this. Unless it was something really obvious like 50 treasure hunter outfit plans. 
---
However if Bethesdas idea to handle dupers really is to deploy a bot during a huge event.  To preemptively hand out bans/ flagging accounts and screw over what very well could be some innocent players.  Then i think thats it for me. 
---
A company that has constantly failed to ban NW hackers and allowed the weapon resellers to run wild. Decides now is the perfect time to roll out a ban wave.  This very well may turn out to be the laziest attempt to handle dupers iv ever seen. 
---
Has anyone even bothered to ask why now? When duping has been a problem since launch. Why during a large event where you must complete events every day. 
---
My own personal opinion they did this because they know most of the legitimate players will attempt to reverse their suspensions and happily pay atoms to catch back up during the event. Dupers will just move onto another account and be right back to cheating. 
---
Either way i think between the poor handling of this ban wave and with how grindy this game has become fallout 76 is gonna lose a lot of players over this.
---
Couldn't tell you. I used to trade a bit in the old days before vending machines, but now I don't even touch anything with a remote chance of being dupe fodder. I'm more or less just using what I've found myself, and since I've been playing since launch that's at least a pretty good collection. I wouldn't enjoy the game myself if I knew my gear was cheated
---
I‚Äôve just noticed what seems like a slowing of event occurrence, maybe? It used to seem like there was one after another to hop on, but lately it seems the map is less active, at least to me.
---
You think you‚Äôre the only person in the game with good gear? Lmfao
---
Ain‚Äôt no problem! I just spent a lot on my PC ask I‚Äôm holding off on spending for a bit to save for a good headset. 
---
Just sent you an invite on steam!
---
Hmm honestly it has been so long since I may have thought there was base building but there isn't actually. I just remember before 76 came out I was in the same boat, had a fallout itch that I couldn't scratch, and stalker with mods was highly enjoyable. Also it is exclusive to pc sadly so this might be useless info to begin with. 
---
The game is usually very cheap on steam though. 
---
Someone else said 7 days to die which if you like base building would be a good one for sure.
---
If bethesda did that, then 75% of the player base would be in there. Im not complaining. SBQ fight will be much quicker.
---
No base building, but still amazing. You wouldn't get those kinds of hours out of it vanilla though.
---
Gauss shotgun is a bullion item, so if you've bought the plan from the settlers. You can craft it using legendary modules from the purveyor. Once you've learned the plan the purveyor can also drop them. You cant trade them. 
---
As for a good combat rifle, there are discords that exist where youI may be able to find one or one could drop.
---
So, is it not possible to get a legendary Fixer from the Rusty Pick anymore?  I haven't completed encryptid yet.  Got the level 30, but no plan.
---
This is the same dupe that was fixed last year lol, they just brought it back. I noticed a week after wastelanders that they re-enabled it, didn't bother checking myself but since nobody else was talking about it I just assumed that they added some other measures to prevent it. Surely there must have been some people who did check it and found out immediately, then tried to warn them. Oh well
---
Ok thanks!
---
Imagine being a 49 year old man acting like a 10 year old on Xbox 360.
---
While I get where you‚Äôre coming from, I‚Äôll play the devil‚Äôs advocate to your devil‚Äôs advocate. 
---
Fallout 76 just isn‚Äôt designed to be an offline, play it alone, mod it how you want to game. Not in a simple ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it play something else‚Äù kind of way, but in a ‚ÄúThat just isn‚Äôt the business model Bethesda has in place for this game‚Äù kind of way. 
---
The minute they would make offline, truly privately owned servers an option, 90% of the PC population would disappear. Another huge chunk if that were available on consoles, which people would scream for and they‚Äôd have to give in. Once people could mod their own games, no more Fallout 1st subs, no more Atoms, no more influx of revenue from the players.
---
The game is designed to be an ever evolving world with regular content updates. That cannot be done if there isn‚Äôt an ongoing revenue stream. It just can‚Äôt, and ultimately, that‚Äôs the vision. Could they do paid DLC for years to come? Maybe. But it likely wouldn‚Äôt provide the same revenue and wouldn‚Äôt allow for all the smaller updates along the way. 
---
So while I get the desire for this, I also get why it just isn‚Äôt realistic, and certainly isn‚Äôt a solution to duping and real money trading‚Äîwhich is the real problem here. People aren‚Äôt duping thousands of valuable items because they want to ‚ÄúPlay their way.‚Äù They‚Äôre doing it to sell them and make money.
---
‚ÄúB-but the economy!!!‚Äù üò≠üò≠
---
I've seen a few TS Fatmans and have been tempted to grab one just for the lulz, haven't though. Kinda regretting it now lol.
---
Why can't it be run on home PCs? I've reached out to devs asking and gotten incredibly vague responses that seem like BS to me. Unless they're running it on some weird server architecture that is.
---
give mirelurk meat to those raiders by the river. (raider rep)
---
It is fixed, but it reduce the enemy's energy resist.
---
You know 70% of all statistics are made up
---
Unyielding / AP Refresh / Blocker
---
Sound like your server may be the type of people they were hoping to ban if I am understanding glitch server right
---
It really doesn't take much to have a high damage Rifleman/Commando build in NW. The ability to 1-2 shot someone in Marine Armor mostly comes from getting lucky and finding a Small Guns/Energy Weapons Bobblehead. 
---
Also, Frog Legs definitely got nerfed. Now you only have maybe 2 successive jumps at max height before the height of each successive jump is significantly reduced. You also have to wait a good few seconds before you can jump at max height again.
---
On a glitch server... Wouldn't you agree that it is quite expected to have high rate of bans there? :D That does not reflect the game as a whole. Good riddance.
---
R.I.P
---
everything in this game gets delayed...smh.
---
it's not just now, it was always like this. we waited more then half a year for wastelanders, wild appalachia got delayed, heck every update with some content got delayed.
---
the only thing that didn't got delayed, but needed a very long delay was the game itself. oh, and shop items ofc, this system works flawless even if the items are broken and low res - but you can always buy atoms and 1st!
---
FO4  
---
Dunwich bores :))
---
It has been broken since beta. Same with a lot of other challenges like discovering Beckly and killing a SBQ. They supposedly fixed it about a year ago, which obviously didn't work, and they have ignored it since.
---
Hence the need for true offline instances of the game. I don't wanna set the economy on fire, I just want a cool flaming skeleton guy
---
Are you reading off your gear or do you honestly think saying random effects will change the gear I have?
---
Yea that would hurt getting tossed there.
---
Which ones?
---
Yup your right, it‚Äôs also a trading server , however it‚Äôs not hard for someone from Bethesda to join as its public nd get a list of everyone usernames and ppl talking abt duping tbh
---
It's just a game, lul.
---
No that's what I have
---
Nice
---
I bought one on a tr@ding subreddit if you look.
---
Only the scope is important
---
Seriously. I had to log out for the day after I blew through the limit. Now I'm stuck there, over-encumbered until it resets. Guess I live at the Rusty Pick now.
---
This right here. I guess what they should've done was something similar to GTA V. I think that would've struck the right balance between both player bases, but unfortunately they didn't. All in all, money makes the world go round and the kinda games I like just don't generate enough cash to achieve what they're going for here. A shame indeed, but you're right.
---
Thank you for this post. I know that something like this was going on since there was so many accounts suspended. I did had a bunch of the same Fasnacht mask in my account that could had triggered the bot to suspend my account.
---
The season ends when he gets to the end.  If you dont beat him you dont get whatever you havent claimed yet
---
NO. NO FUN ALLOWED.
---
Memories! Got garage also, probably will make something similar. Downsizing from horrible mess I have right now.
---
awesome. :D
---
Now you removed it?
---
You know what makes me more upset than duping? The fact that people used a glitch to max out raider reputation in the first few days of wastelanders - I couldn't figure out how people had ammo machines so quickly until I saw that it was a thing on a youtube video. They spent like a single hour max on something that's taking me months, super fucked.
---
ah so it reduces the stat it needs to? Thanks!! I assume the glammed is a heavy gun? Or is it classified as an energy gun for perks?
---
Yeah welcome, you got it easy then. 
---
You see, cheat engine running in the background it's like cocaine in the airport and 100 hundred dogs(the most common anti-cheat systems targeting the most obvious things with a quick scan) snuffing you around, probably Bethesda dog wasn't that smart before but he is getting better and detected you...
---
an easy search in google and you can see people getting banned since ages from triggering VAC, fortnite would probably alert you that it cannot open the launcher bc you have cheat engine installed and millions of other examples. 
---
i'm not telling you what to do or how to play your games man but it would probably get you 1 or 2 problems in the future, they are doing their job.
---
have a great day.
---
tys
---
I had to grab it, it was 90 percent less weight as well
---
A lot of the earlier duping methods required crashing the entire server. That affected me. Early weight glitches so people could carry 5000 pounds of crap caused serious local instability and lag for anyone nearby. That affected me too. The long pauses/lag while using the stash etc is because of anti duping efforts, along with items and options removed from the game, like being able to order from the waiters at Whitespring, all affect my gameplay like it or not. Things that had value are now worthless, like mounted plans. When I got my first tse as a drop in the wild my excitement was tempered by the fact that they had been duped so thoroughly that Bethesda had to nerf the damage and my 1% drop could be bought cheaply all over. Duping removes value from my game. Anyone is welcome to play however the style they want but when these things negatively affect me I‚Äôve got a problem with it. I know the game will never eliminate all duping/xp/glitches and I accept that and continue playing but I will still consider dupers and cheaters to be scum who ruin things for others.
---
Well, thanks for the recommendation anyways. If I'm ever in the mood for something fresh that's fallout-like, I'll definitely give it a peek. A few of the stalker games are actually on my Excel spreadsheet wishlist right after the Metro series.
---
Maybe people should reflect on the reason why people dupe like hell. The shit rng in this game is just a punch in the face and I know several people that have quit the game cause the only good drop they ever got in almost 1000 hours was B/E Handmade and that still is far away from godroll. So instead of patching theor game and incentivising people having fun in this game by adding some sort of normal grind they just ban people that are upset getting nothing but jackshit. I duped aswell I dont regret it even if my account gets banned BUT i played this game on Ps4 for 150 levels and on PC for another 200 levels and the best world drop I got was literally an Instigating limb damage +1 Strenght Polehook all the "good" weapons I got I traded this game gives you nothing but dropkicks in your face as far as rng goes.So it's no surprise to me so many people duped and tbh the dupe was more a bug than an exploit and yet Bethesda just keeps on banning people instead of making their shit game more enjoyable.I was a fan of fallout and this game in particular but I couldn't care less at the moment of I get banned it's okay if not I'm fine aswell but something needs to change if not it's just a question of time until the next dupe comes up.
---
Honestly? It probably can. But as it stands, Bethesda don't allow that. Its entirely possible that some parts of the game are coded to require data from the server, meaning that to turn it into a singleplayer game, they would have to change a bunch of things to be done entirely client-side. Its not impossible, but Bethesda can't really monetise a singleplayer game the same way they can a multiplayer game and that is why we have Fallout 76.
---
Yeah, I keep having to hit ghouls 5 times with a bloodied power fist before the hits register.
---
Making it a serum would benefit everyone. It's not situational awareness or sight or anything. It's people jumping in front of each other,without the ability to be shot. I usually stay in matches till the end and they often finish with 2 guys jumping and wasting 2 magazine until one cannot anymore.
---
Youll have to wait buying tiers isnt posible yet
---
No problem. Happy Fallout-ing.
---
No news yet, but hopefully Bethesda will say something soon
---
The flamer counts as a heavy. The fuel benefits from the "batteries inclueded" card.
---
They‚Äôve always banned people for it. They‚Äôve also always tended to do it in big clumps at once.
---
i found the prefab fan!
---
I just drop them all off on my alt, I use my friends that are online when i don‚Äôt have anyone I trust to help me, I‚Äôm over 800 pounds on that character
---
Yeah I‚Äôm getting tired of the constant rotation the shop has been doing since day 1
---
Exactly. It's just frustrating to see their business choices get in the way of me enjoying my game, but that's pretty commonplace in this industry. Thanks for the discussion though :) üëç
---
IKR!
---
That is obviously dubbed then and may get flagged
---
Personally I wish they would just put actual gambling in the game, the Whitespring should have a casino, the Greenbrier in real life does. Gambling minigames were great in NV.
---
It would be backwards compatible I‚Äôm sure, they could optimise to run better on the next gen hardware I suppose (PC would be harder to optimise as of the various different possible component combos I‚Äôm guessing) I‚Äôm not sure but they could bring a next gen version of the game with like rockstar did with GTAV but i highly doubt that would happen. I‚Äôd love them to intergrade a new engine for a official nex gen release, I‚Äôm sure everyone would but that‚Äôs another topic right there
---
this is the reason i left destiny for this game since they banned me and nobody would give me an ounce of help, it was all just laughing and mocking or "just make a new account bro" type ppl so i joined this game thinking atleaset this community must have more sympathy but then i stumble upon posts like this.
---
Idk why you got downvoted. It‚Äôs true
---
dunno but he was giving me tons of mentats and threatening me about burning my camp lol
---
Mods did I assume
---
Ooh or the first time in the Salem Witch Museum thing with the deathclaw that you can only hear at first. I was on pins and needles my first playthrough!
---
Ok. So it uses energy ammo but is a heavy gun. I assume since it‚Äôs ammo is energy it‚Äôs affected by Grounded‚Äôs -50% damage.
---
Only if you cook them with diseased cranberries and gourds, with at least +8 INT and the Plasticize It! Perk card.
---
You think they are making tens and hundred of thousands of dollars selling items from fall out 76
---
Nice. Does anyone know how to get rid of this wet/glossy overlay on every surface?
---
Modded servers would be a cure all. Sort of like a ranked secure ecosystem and one you can just go crazy in.
---
Cheating is terrible in 76. people who think they are clever are really just destroying the economy.  Hate cheaters as much as bloodied builds
---
How?
---
Thanks for the recommendations :) 
---
I've tried 7 days to die, but it's a little too minecraft-ey to me. Stalker is on my radar after the Metro series :) rn, I'm checking out miscreated, mist survival, and this other one that I can't remember the name of set in Alberta Canada. Unfortunately it's in closed alpha rn tho lol. Again, thank you for the recommendations, I really appreciate it :)
---
would be cool!. there are some props that are big and count almost nothing to the camp budget like the trees, hope they can make cars that way.
---
Still tons of garbage in game. Most of the content is garbage for example.
---
Same here. I don't feel any sense of achievement when I cheat in games, especially online games. Nearly everything I use is stuff I acquired myself. The few rare plans I've traded for came from sources that were not so obviously duped. Maybe they were, you can't really know. But it's not like I could tell based in the players inventories or like i was given ridiculous quantities.
---
Either way I think there's a pretty big difference between maybe having picked up or been gifted 1-2 duped items vs getting hundreds.
---
Ngl I drooled a little when I saw that hot face ü•µ
---
I have one star B handmade. Yours if you want it. I guess will have better use with you then just rusting in my ammo display.
---
Since my main gun is a gatling plasma, and flamer is a side arm for me,  I can not test it for you, I do not have that mutation.
---
It should reduce the damage you deal, but nithing is certain in this game.
---
S.T.A.L.K.E.R is probably more up your alley than Metro, while they are both excellent series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R beats out metro with its open world survival-esque gameplay, whereas the first 2 metro games are both very linear. The latest metro game is more open world, but its done in a linear fashion.
---
No way dude the anti-dupe, anti-pvp echo chamber in here is way too strong to fight.
---
Are you really reposting this? LOL
---
surprisingly this garage took almost nothing of my budget and i was on the verge
---
That is absolutely fantastic!
---
I can try to test it. I‚Äôll turn on number and see if it deals half. The listed damage says 21 so I‚Äôll see if it does 10-11. (It‚Äôs 10.5 but I have a feeling they round down?)but that‚Äôs the best I know how to do
---
do you want hardened receiver or drum magazine? on the house, no caps needed. :D
---
Is there any way it can be fixed before then? I really miss it.
---
Edit: typo
---
Holy shit. Waaaay too much thought went into this post.
---
Also can't figure out a way to stop them from just flipping it again to open the win door after all the tesla traps are spent -- I need some way to shut down the switch after a lose. I really wish the power switches weren't so limited in comparison to FO4.
---
Only way to tell a duper is via the items.
---
Yeah they killed off 10-15% of the player base. Now they definitely won't sell enough atoms this quarter.
---
You jealous?
---
At most, we can hope for Cross-Platform play, but at the least(bare minimum), PS4/PS5 and X1/Series X. At least until PS4/X1 gets phased out, much like Square Enix did with FFXIV on PlayStation.
---
&gt;uping removes value from my game. Anyone is welcome to play however the style they want but when these things negatively affect me I‚Äôve got a problem with it
---
And I don't want to ruin your game either!! I 100% respect the way you play and want you to get the most enjoyment out of it as well. Unfortunately the solution isn't one Bethesda can easily profit off of, so that's why we are where we are today. We need offline servers so I can go do my own thing and cheat to my heart's content, and you can do the same with your playstyle. Unfortunately that's not happening anytime soon :(
---
The quick way to do it is to go to events like encrypted or the SBQ , you‚Äôll find lots of victims
---
lmao nice trick
---
Can't wait to get banned so I can finally stop playing this shit game.
---
Vbeaver in here whiteknighting all the dupers is funny
---
How about you let the man enjoy his damn game
---
If you're ok with getting rid of it that sounds good. What price point were you thinking.
---
If someone robbed a bank and scattered the money across the streets, there won‚Äôt be a single soul who wouldn‚Äôt scoop up all the money they can. 
---
To me, they were wrongfully banned, the most that should happen is the incriminating weapon removed.
---
I hope the dupers all get banned
---
The best guess people have come up with so far is that Bethesda is trying to figure out how to compensate the people that fell victim to the challenge auto complete bug.
---
Yes "I found a 4 BE plasmas 5 BE fixers, 3 BE combat shotguns and one BE laser and a set of BOS sentinel unyielding at whitespring station and the one near Poseidon energy plant" yeah sure you fucking did... found them right after your pal duped them in there maybe....
---
Yeah, they must‚Äôve delayed the option to buy them because they originally said that it would be July 14th but obviously that just passed and there‚Äôs no option.
---
wish that we have that mini pitch like in the vault, i would just run around pushing balloons
---
Claimed cabins?
---
Pet rocks huh? lol
---
I'd be curious to know this aswell, all of the premade buildings I have that already have concrete on the bottom, like the train car and one version of the greenhouse cannot be placed on foundations. If there is some kind of trick to allowing you to do this, I wanna know it.
---
Good to know. Both series are pretty far down my wishlist (by pretty far, I mean like 5 games in, but that's still a ways away for me). Usually when I actually go to buy games, I research in detail, and that's when the wishlist shuffles tend to happen. Thanks for your insight into both series. I'm definitely going to take that into consideration (along with the good prices you mentioned as well, cheers).
---
Lmao wut üòÇ
---
It depends on what mood I'm in.
---
I have an AAE 10mm pistol so sometimes I'll equip some of the pistol cards. Other times I'll use Marathoner &amp; Action Boy.
---
Seriously though. I can‚Äôt *wait* to craft my single plasma caster for the day every day
---
ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
---
(100 caps)
---
*angry bone rattling noises*
---
Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Hopefully they add the option soon. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm in a rush to spend my atoms or anything but it‚Äôd be nice to have it.
---
Wait... my friend was saying the same thing on Xbox... maybe he was right
---
This please!!!! 
---
Idc if u make it a mod that u need to unlock. Make it a score reward in the next season. Along with ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù mods/paints for each armor pieces. 
---
I can‚Äôt be the only one to want to walk around in my vault suit and a light leather chest and that‚Äôs it!!
---
i had a red rocket theme for my camp since the treasure hunter event till Friday fk me! xd
---
I ended up having to reload my gatling laser, then the glitch resolved itself.
---
What's your build? Are you specced for power armor? If not, just one.
---
For every duper that has been banned there will be another fresh noob to replace them. I logged on to check on my character recently and was pleased to find my legacies and legendaries intact. I knew duping wasn‚Äôt worth the risk. There was also a full server of level 1-10. Time to reign over them all lol
---
I think I read a post stating AB could also be broken.
---
Don‚Äôt really care what people dupe or not, they never hurt my game. The argument that I can‚Äôt feel excited about a god roll because multiple other people has it [thats little selfishly &amp; silly]. If I got my hands on a god roll, I‚Äôd care less how many others have it. I am still gonna be able to use it and play, if I mind my business, then I‚Äôll be happy and enjoy the game.
---
My account is still up, guess im deadly
---
Can someone fill me in, what is duping?
---
Couldn't have said it any better. It all sounds very asinine. It is what it is, an online game and people that cheat ARE affecting the economy in a very bad way, that's coming from someone that loves playing that part of the game, building a camp around offering the best service possible etc. It's like, I like multiplayer games then proceed to log into the forums of Fallout 4 and make posts about how I would like it to be an online game that is tailored to my needs instead. It's just.. mad.
---
It's an online game, very imperfect but ever changing, and I love it, I knew this when I purchased the game. People that cheat should be punished severely. End of story.
---
Are you planning on grinding out any more levels or were you just going to buy out your season? Reason I ask is, it makes more sense to grind through the early stuff and buy the later stuff, if you're not planning on using atoms to get through the whole lot.
---
At any rate, as u/Nathan_TK mentioned, the current theory is they have been delayed while bethesda works out the challenge autocomplete glitch and most likely work out some form of compensation for people losing S.C.O.R.E I think I saw mention of them making an official announcement. but haven't seen it personally.
---
Quite frankly I don't miss it. I tweaked my deck and I'm happier with what it is. I'm still a noxious, lethal killing machine, but I'm a well adjusted noxious, lethal killing machine.
---
If your level 20 plus, go to the scorched fort next to the train station at the top of the world. Clear it all out and you'll get plenty, and combat shotguns, each visit.
---
As the dude once said:
---
&gt;Yeah, well y'know-- that's just like, your opinion, man. 
---
(https://youtu.be/pWdd6_ZxX8c)
---
Wise words, dude. Wise words.
---
I been playing fo76 for months so I sign up for  1st and it definitely worth it ,  if they add dlc sale it fund for more dlc , no?
---
I have a perk that extends power core lifetime. I carry about 3 sometimes more. Im a heavy build tho.
---
Can you share your best acid farming tips? I‚Äôm desperate. Apparently the vendors no longer sell it in bulk, and it‚Äôs tiring fast-travelling from one Snallygaster to the next just to get like 6 acid. There must be a better way?
---
Mmmm gonna have to disagree. This wasnt the first time a wave has happened, and not the last. Worst is that you lose a day or two of play time because the ban bot flagged your account. I honestly dont think this is a do or die situation for the game, theyre just weeding out the problems in player base. Shoulda happened long before but better now than never
---
EDIT: Ill also add most of these flags are temp suspensions, meaning they will be back after Bethesda reviews their account. Most likely have a few duped legacies they bought or traded for. Only a very small amount of players will be banned for duping or other serious accounts of dubious activity
---
You're correct, I believe it broke sometime in the weeks since Wastelanders launch.
---
So say your server would have a much higher rate of banning then most communities
---
Same, for some reason people are only now beginning to notice it
---
Yes, let your anger cement my foundations, let it flow through the the surface covering all that the earthworm can see. Should escape your early grave, I have salt at my kiosk, it's only 30k caps, I selected only the very best for you to partake of, please enjoy responsibly.
---
The fact that you're comparing it to a real life situation like that goes to show how seriously you take the game. And that's truly sad. Get a life and stop whining about those who have more than you. It's pathetic.
---
I'm a new player I'm nearly 50, have 3 sets of power armour so far 2 I can run rn and I dont think I'm specced but I do run power armour alot in high lvl events like scorched earth
---
Also what power armour increases carry weight l, cuz for me only my mining one increases the carry weight

Research different builds to try and get the special abilities and perk cards you want.  It's random when opening the perk cards, so sometimes you may have to pick a poor card, but you'll have the point in the right special ability.  My original character is level 49, and I don't think I'll ever play it again to fix the mess of the cards.
---
Bethesda designed it beautifully to incentivise purchases. The way each level gets more and more work to get is just driving our brains to find any way to escape... and that's where the atom man comes in!
---
Only as many as you need. Depends what you're doing. Do you PA all the time? Do you use a gun that uses them? Do you have power user perk?
---
I looked at my character earlier, and apparently I've been getting them from events and dailies because I had 57 on me haha (I use ultracite fusion cores and have also like 30 of them on me too that are actually used).
---
The others are just waiting to be upgraded, with just one or two saved for the excavator armour for grabbing ores now and again.
---
Wait what are perk coins and legendary perks? Can someone explain? I just got back into the game after almost a year of not playing
---
Let ppl play the game how they want, if they buy the game and wanna risk their account doing a glitch let them have at it no need to get bent
---
How did you get the 1/3 of the player base number?
---
Nice. I use a TSFFR also, but with 25 vats. It‚Äôs great for Queen fights or anything else tanky. Also using vats on a Scorchbeast turns 40mm into homing missles
---
I plan on at least grinding out 80% of the pass. I just want to have that added security in case I for some reason can‚Äôt finish the challenges, or if I miss a week and I can‚Äôt finish the pass without buying tiers.
---
I saw a CAMP which had the following written in big letters on the outside wall:

'Coronavirus-Free Zone'

And people think PC is where all the cheaters are. Smh
---
The real world also doesn't have you drop a sack lunch when you die.
---
Can't stop trying to improve the game because dupers might do something.  Well, other than do a better job preventing dupes.
---
Hell no I can‚Äôt live without that thing I‚Äôd be Swiss cheese in seconds
---
The ban wave hit this sub hard because most the sub duped. Thousands of other accounts, mine included are untouched and the game hasn‚Äôt had this much new blood coming in since forever (Xbox game pass). It‚Äôs actually a glorious time to be high level with legacy gear !!
---
No and hell no. I wasn't banned, but I have been before. It is your game, and you should be able to play it how you want. This is not a competitive game. Almost no one does PvP. Your duped items cannot be taken into NW, the actual PVP mode. If someone wants to dupe weapons or junk so they don't have to farm for months on end to get it, who cares? It is their game to play how they want to play it. It generally does not affect other players in the slightest. 
---
Not only do I think there should not be bans, but I think they should have a special version of servers where people can dupe and exploit to their hearts content. People should be able to play a game they purchased however they want to play it.
---
But...he obviously wasn't doing anything because they unbanned him? It seemed more or less the automated problem he was talking about and then it was resolved. Literally a false positive. Did you not read what he wrote?
---
Make sure you look at mods if you're on PC.
---
People keep posting stuff like this, but it's purely anecdotal. I was on a long time today and had servers filled up completely. Friends couldn't get in. Tons of vending, event presence, whole servers farming the queen.
---
One dead server means nothing, there are tons of them at any given time, waiting to be shut down and restarted.
---
I've talked to my girlfriend about the potentt of adding Marsupial Serum to the loot pool. You give all players the potential to have high jumps, plus the harder to find item version would have a carry weight buff that makes it superior to Frog Legs, while remaininbalanced because it's based on luck and not your SPECIAl pool and build.
---
I disagree though that dealing with Frog Legs isn't a matter of tactics and situational awareness. If you stay hidden and ambush players from a distance you take away the "significant" advantage Frog Legs users have up close. Even when the circle gets close there's plenty you can do to get around their advantages.
---
I've noticed that too. Theres been a massive lack of events, and each time I do Breach and Clear I get fuck all from the motherlode...
---
Its weird. It worked fine last week and now all of a sudden boom its gone.
---
Nah the regular Joe's holding onto every holotape and note under the sun are what's slowing down servers
---
I can help you real quick before I got to bed. My ID is Eldyrus3. I will log in now.

Edit: I haven't heard from you. I am assuming you were probably able to find someone else to help you. So, I'm gonna log off and go to bed. Have a good night.
---
Same place the "most of the community" part came from in regard to that made up number, I assume. 
---
I agree in principle that mass suspensions of people not really doing anything is extreme and not the way, but the fear mongering after literally a few hours is insane.
---
Unacceptable prices. How about 1k caps
---
Well, I work in the fraud department at a bank, and if you the recipient of fraud funds, you get spanked as well as the fraudster. If the recipient was unknowingly a victim, we refer them to the police. As this is just a game, the recipient should just receive a temp ban and the items in question deleted.
---
With the surge in new players thanks to gamepass, this is bethesda's opportunity to sort of soft relaunch the game and undo some of the negative press from the past year and a half. If they aggressively manage the game, and with all the recent additions in content, they can really turn public opinion around about this game.
---
Or, and hear me out, maybe don't be a dick and cheat.
---
There are more unacceptable bugs than there are minor ones to be honest.
---
Yeah :D damn, I feel urge to visit Boston now ... and the great, peaceful Glowing sea :)
---
That‚Äôs the only one that increases carry weight.
---
No cause anything new they add they just make it glitch and blame us and ban us when they can't make a shitty game

---
I feel you, mate. Not that the blueprint system's limitations will ever allow to accommodate the entire camp budget... But the game won't even let you put that camp blueprint down if it's more complex than one crafting bench on a 1x1 foundation... Damn, sometimes I really start to question my sanity having to deal with all that crap every single day and still playing the game after 1800h+ spent in it...
---
76 is a joke, Bethesda gets mad when people cheat but they don‚Äôt even bother to fix the most common exploits and cheats
---
I‚Äôm always in PA, I carry about 5-6 with that one perk that makes them last long. Throw the rest in a stash or mule character

I agree with the bans in principal. I hope they get their accounts back completely stripped down of the dupes.

I read a post on a final fantasy brave exvius forum of a guy offering a cautionary tale for others prone to addiction, where he dropped 15k (all because of the gacha rng) and had to break it to his wife he spent thier savings trying to get some pixelated character in a mobile game.  150k is unfathomable.  Gacha games are pure evil.
---
It's a symptom of the rot in the community. There has always been a contingent of people who are far too willing to exploit and abuse the game in the community, and it's only grown since BETA.   
---
I'm really hoping that things turn around, but community acceptance of these practices is way too high.
---
I wish you could tell rocksie you have never killed the run away raider
---
Yeah, I have jumped servers at times, and surprised of the few that on teams.  I have gotten used to stranger in numbers and picked up herd mentally since Public teams.  Also using 3 star inspiration.  Never used any of those before.
---
Ooof, there you go. That explains a lot. Thanks my guy lol you know where I can find that plan?
---
I never rock power armor
---
I need at least 5-10 full cores if you want 3 SBQs easy.
---
Bad advice
---
You always keep multiple fusion cores on you no matter what the build
---
I don't think it counts as sneak damage if the creature is aware of an enemy, even if that enemy isn't you. Not A sneak build though so I could be wrong about this.
---
The way I finally got this to complete was after catching Sludge Lung, I server hopped and sat in the water drinking to increase my chances of getting another disease.  Soon as I got the 2nd disease the challenge completed.
---
There are people who will unironically argue that exploiting bugs is part of the game and they aren't doing anything wrong. They get mad when you dont agree.
---
Nobodys innocent, im not. I wasnt an active duper but i passively benefitted from my tse handmade from the first few months to plans.
---
Go look at player vendors right now and its still full of duped plans. A bans not enough, inventories need to be wiped clean of these obviously duped things from everyone. There shouldnt be a single unlearned mount, unopened gift or santa crash plan in this game.
---
Why the downvotes? Lol
---
Edit: Downvoted for asking a question.  r/fo76 everybody!
---
Nvm I found one in my Stash üòÇ I feel like an idiot now
---
It's pretty funny, honestly.
---
"Uh, what's a large amount I can say? Half? No, too much--I know! It was a third. Yeah, Reddit will buy that, it's already a tiny microcosm of the playerbase, they'll probably believe anything if we post enough.
---
The servers are all dead! Don't check though."
---
Not just the drop rates but the spawn rates on some things.
---
Since theyre mostly useless...youll rarely see good ones for sale
---
i got  3* bloodied...it stays on my display gun rack...its cool but overall useless
---
Fucccckkkk.... the build up of 14k cloth over time (thanks to the scrap box) might be my down fall
---
Haha ghoul slayer gun go pop-pop
---
Prob cause I took a break from fallout and i guess not being a everyday active player gets down voted lol
---
The people who hold on to the dupes, yes they are actually. Each God rolled weapon was selling for over 200 dollars, and they were selling pretty fast. Hell, some dude on the FB exploit page made 1k the DAY the dupe released publicly, and he's just a run of the mill duper that started when it got posted the night before the dupe was on youtube.
---
"How dare he stop playing!" Followed by angry torch and pitchfork waving. Something like that I'm guessing.
---
If you are a new player and your introduction to fallout series is FO76, you‚Äôll never play this game anymore than a month. 
---
I have and Xbox &amp; most of the newbies that are playing don‚Äôt even know what the fallout series is, besides most of them being teenagers, while this game offers nothing of ‚Äúfun‚Äù value to younger audience, certainly fails to compare to any other games available on game pass.
---
Also i took a break to allow the dev's to clear up some of the issues. I get hit with a lot of blue screens while base building and traveling between the open world and a inside area.
---
The problem is the best part of the game is the market and duper‚Äôs ruin that.
---
Update: I think I was? I was fighting a Level 50 Scorchbeasts and did 9 damage.
---
TIL I'm casually carrying around 175000 lbs of gold.
---
In all honesty, i agree with the ban of dupers. Obviously if you didnt dupe and get a temp suspension, thatll be sorted out in time. But concerning Bethesda's actions, i agree. I see people saying "play the game how you want" and thats all well and good. For a single player game that is. This is multiplayer, its a different ballgame. Since the Fallout franchise is historically singleplayer, i feel like people are a lot more laisez-faire about exploiting. Its still exploiting in a multiplayer game, and whether its intended or not it has consequences on other players in subtle ways. And just to compare, what if a dupe wave happened in a game like ESO, WoW, or even a game like Rust? It'd be an absolute madhouse, people would riot. But that doesnt happen in Fallout 76 because of peoples association with it being usually a single player franchise. So in the long run, i agree with this action by Bethesda. I think it'll push the game in the right direction concerning multiplayer interaction.
---
I‚Äôm not even going to lie, I have such a fear of using a mic outside party chat!
---
Not agreeing at all with the bans since the rng in this game is dogshit and you most likely get weapons that are completely useless out of world drops.So I support duping cause it makes good weapons accessible to a large player base.The economy was already fucked and since this is how OP said not a competitive game they shouldn't get banned.No wonder everyone is duping when all you get for a SBQ is a 1 star pipe revolver and a 2 star garbage armor nobody needs...
---
Very nice. My first win I hid like a bitch the whole time. I never even had a weapon. Scorched beast got the win for me.
---
I tried to solo that thing and got my ass kicked with my junkie build lol. I even lured it to a bunch of enemies to fight it out with. Only thing that really helped was a Colonel gutsy and a legendary deathclaw
---
The burden of proof is on the accuser, saying "we have solid proof" means nothing unless it's presented, so they're basically swinging their dicks around hoping peoples reaction will be "ok..."
---
There a never been a better time to get into the game. All this new blood is exciting
---
Im carrying 57 at the moment. Ive got the double fusion core usage perk. I also have the reduced energy ammo perk. If im not careful I can blow through most of the cores in a single session.
---
sure thing. hit me up tomorrow night. :D
---
I never thought about it like that before. That‚Äôs a valid argument
---
Regardless whether your friends like the game or not, there is a surge in new players, and their perception of the game is what I was referring to. If they see Bethesda properly policing their game, and actively developing it, they may just stick around, and they may even spend some money on atoms, which is their goal in the end.
---
you kind of can.
---
IGN is the same as here, would love to check it out!
---
I am basically debating if the items you get from the raisers work not going to the camp killing everyone I can hahahah
---
Why would it be tense there?
---
Uhm this is an exploit I hope you get banned
---
I don't think so, unfortunately.
---
I'm on PS4 so maybe someone will know something I don't, but while you can copy them the game won't recognize it as a loading screen. Lost many of my favorite shots after reinstalling.
---
No and anyone else playing on a 1 Xbox share the 50 photo limit.
---
so everyone should suffer till the end of the time, because Bethesda cant ban dupers properly or fix their game?
---
And whats wrong about farming? When there will be some reasonable transfer ratio like 100 gold scrap 1 gold bullion, why not.
---
if you charge back on ps4 you get an instaban
---
Do not really care. Their duped weapons don't really affect me at all, this being a pve game. I'd be more interested in people getting banned for being shitbags, like trying to sabotage events, or one shotting legendary creatures, or harassing players over mic, etc, etc. 
---
Maybe all the duped weapons will make them worthless now. I'm sick of everyone wanting to trade their mediocre weapons for legacies on the market. No, your nocturnal assault rifle isnt worth a bloody explosive gatling plasma, Gary.
---
So these weapons were duped in to the game by players and weren't originally created by Bethesda? Interesting
---
Bloodied and instigating bows are the only ones worth anything, prices all vary depending on the buyer, pre dupe a buddy of mine trading a b3390 bow for a BE90 laser rifle, but I've also seen some bloodied bows in vendors for &gt;10k
---
I know Xbox is really pushing for free upgrades for Xbox Series X enhanced versions of games. So if Bethesda does port the game, atleast to Xbox, i'd expect the upgraded Series X enhanced version to be free
---
My alt with 50+ dupes and 40k presents didn‚Äôt get suspended. My main with 6 duped guns, zero multiples, got suspended. 
---
Whatever their bots criteria is, is fucked, and that alone leads to me believe people were wrongfully banned.
---
Yes it makes no difference whether I connect it to the power conduit or not. It simply will not let me place it in side anything. I use the flamer to destroy the dresser but no dice.
---
I'm using the standard small generator NOT the Atom Shop one
---
EDIT Here is a piccy :)
---
https://postimg.cc/zymymcnt
---
I don't play pc but a video said put the ini on your C or root drive.  Other people moved the whole game but its just the ini you gotta move.
---
Are they mutually exclusive? Lol
---
We all start somewhere. Congrats.
---
As much as i would like to see this. I dont think it will happen and the reasoning behind that is the smart delivery is supposed to be able to launch the gsme where it left off and fo76 has worlds where people join and leave.
---
Kind of an annoying bug. I have fixed this in the past by building back up to it from the other side from the ground and then once its reconnected remove the glitched pieces and then your new support structure. Good luck.
---
Oh I know that trouble haha damn.
---
The only way how to get rid of it yea this could be a problem. Try to clip an other foundation at this one we're the stairs goes up. Now you have the flying foundation on the stair connected with the one in front of the stairs (on the ground)
---
BUT ATTENTION! When you do this its a 50/50 chance that you can now scrap the upper foundation. But when you are unlucky you won't be able to delete the new foundation too. It's a hell of a building problem that I encounter everytime when I try to build a new camp. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Good luck!
---
Well ur saves data is on Bethesda.net not ur Xbox or ps4 so u might be right and wrong at the same time.
---
Equip batteries included perk
---
I find it difficult to reconcile that the community decries duping and celebrates bans, while on the other hand endlessly complaining about the RNG of getting the weapons you want and the chances of landing on the mods you need to complete a build.
---
Duping is a consequence of making the RNG too aggressive, ensuring that most players don't get god-tier weapons or armour. It is a consequence of making your players grind, making them trade in hundreds of shit-tier legendaries that fill up their inventory and spending it at the Purveyor, only to roll the dice and end up with a three-star pipe pistol after spending 100 scrip.
---
If the game was fairer, this wouldn't be a problem.
---
I heard next Bethesda is banning *over 66.66%* of false statistics. Get ready!
---
You have to be allies with the raiders though to get it, which can be a very long and tedious process.
---
Always online games are here to stay, there‚Äôs private servers if you want to dick around. I‚Äôll blame Bethesda for being less than proactive at preventing duping in the first place, and for repurposing a single player engine into multiplayer leaving too many possibilities for exploitation but I‚Äôll blame duper‚Äôs for using those exploits to the detriment of other players. Just because the homeowner left their door unlocked doesn‚Äôt justify a burglary. If you want to play at god mode go play Fallout4.
---
No I have that one. This one is the actual machine from the workshop by vault 79! Apparently a glitch allows u to blueprint it and build it at your camp
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!  I DID IT :DDDD
---
Sorry, they are just dealing with dupers that basically dont affect anyone gameplay instead of gamebreaking mechanics... score challenges may not be working right now, but if you swipe your CC $$$ you will be able to catch up just for 150 atoms a level. &lt;3
---
Thanks!  I agree, it is actually so annoying lol
---
Glad to hear it works :D
---
Cheers mate and much fun while building your camp!
---
Are they innocent? No. Are they just as *guilty* as dupers? Also no. Life isn't binary.
---
That thing was terrifying me more then the flames.
---
I'm surprised people are still dicking around with glitches even after todays huge ban wave. People don't learn I swear.
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm loving how supportive this community is.
---
Wtf seriously?! ü§£
---
Nah, see most of their time and effort seems to be directed at fixing exploits and dupes, because if left unchecked it will ruin the game. At it's most simple, why would people continue playing a game if they own everything, and have nothing else to play for? 
---
 If people would stop being absolute cunts, then maybe they'd have more time to fix the actual game
---
I was so sad when I lost all my photos, I thought they‚Äôd be tied to your account
---
I‚Äôm trying not laugh at your comment
---
Jeez man... and they have the audacity to ban people ü§£
---
I did the SQB fight for the first time just recently and you‚Äôre telling me her flying off into the distance periodically isn‚Äôt normal? That‚Äôs a relief
---
Yeah but it takes a while as the anti cheat guys can still play the game
---
Not accusing you or saying how you picked them up, but to them it looks like you bought them as a real money transaction.
---
Right, you‚Äôll never get banned for stuff like this so there is no risk in abusing a glitch like that.
---
It's still a bad fallout game, but if you're just playing it with friends to have a decent time shooting things, them it's okay, the map is pretty fun to explore too.
---
However, the story, dialogue and characters aren't very good imo and I have a lot of bugs and server issues that at best make the game feel a little unresponsive and at worst make it unplayable.
---
But like I said it is a decent shooter, where you can have fun exploring the world with friends. Just don't expect anything special.
---
Any reason for 2 shot?
---
Its better to go with a build to max out damage.
---
Bloodied, junkies, berserkers........
---
its a beth game glitch are apart of it, and bug, they still have bug  from f03 that are in f76 and its to funny.
---
chill out bender.
---
wow, thats at least creative. i would never have thought about blueprinting it.
---
Basically projecting lol
---
I carry a lot too, 40 or 50 at a time, same perks.  The perk for weight reduction doesn't work if they're in your stash, so I just keep 'em all on me.
---
Sure thing, if you're on PC just add me IGN: Wardy. I'll give it you. I don't know what time I'll be on but it will be after I'd say 5pm British time since that's when reset is and plus I've been up all night due to bad sleeping patterns.
---
In the Gamebryo engine, at least at the level of Fallout 3, NV, 4, and 76, each item has a base object ID, and that object has properties (what mods, scopes, barrels it has, X, Y, and Z coordinates in the world...).
---
Take the FO4 10mm Pistol.  You can spawn in a standard, run of the mill pistol with the base ID 00004822.  And every unique variant, like Wastelander's Friend (001f61e6), and even some carried only by NPC's, like Piper's 10mm (0005df2d) will have similar properties.  Because every object is this base ID number with various properties, it's easier to store in one gigantic database.  Even more so when you have hundreds, if not thousands of players who have literally the same object.  
---
The following is my own exercise in explaining the reasons why Gamebryo uses baseIDs rather than unique IDs for each object, and it's going to be oversimplified.  Please don't take it personally.
---
Bob, Billy, and Bran the Broken all have the standard Combat Shotgun.  Each object is unique, and each object takes up 8 bytes of information, for a total of 24 bytes.  Bob adds a better stock to his, which increases the space taken by another 4 bytes.  Billy adds the drum magazine, 4 bytes.  Bran, well, he sits in a chair.  We're up to 32 bytes.
---
But instead, if each object is just a base ID pointer, with a property, you start with just 8 bytes.  Mod this, 12 bytes.  Mod that, 16.  And Bran keeps sitting.
---
Then Bran figures out how to dupe.  Because a child-king with the power to take over others is not wish fulfillment.
---
His new 3-star legendary shotgun, with mods and all the perks that everyone's wanting, takes up about 20 bytes of info.  He wargs into a peasant (extra account), and dupes it 100 times.  It takes up no more space in the database, since it's a core object with some extra properties.  It's impossible to really track without logging every player *action*, which will fill logs with all kinds of hot, hot garbage.
---
So, the admins filter the logs.  And filter some more.  It takes ages, since every new method of dupe is (relatively) new, so they don't know what action they're looking for.  Then they happen upon it, replicate it, filter on those particular sets of actions in the logs, and then they issue the ban hammer.
---
But Bran was smart.  Because he isn't the one who did the dupe, he doesn't get banned, the extra account does.  He just pops into another, and wash, rinse, repeat.
---
So what I'm saying is, finding dupers is hard, D&amp;D are terrible writers, and THE NORTH REMEMBERS!
---
...I'm sorry, I got a little carried away there.
---
Nuka girl hides it
---
I think that's how most people get their first win. I was the same and only ended up winning because I had 2 stealth boys an Auto grenade launcher and power armor, still felt good though.
---
No I'm good thanks I have a powerful auto receiver on mine. Thanks for the offer.
---
Yep still cant finish beckly
---
Just leave it dude, the human ego is a tough adversary lol
---
Yeah I can say I got pretty lucky I was server hopping for about 2 hours last night looking for one and just decided to test my luck since I got fed up of not finding one in anyones' camp.
---
The first 50 levels you'll pick a perk card for a specific SPECIAL but also get a point toward that letter. As you go on your special will stop growing but you'll still get perk cards ~or~ the ability to move a SPECIAL point from one letter to another. Don't fret picking the wrong SPECIAL as you learn which is better or worse for your build. I have around 100 saved perk points to play a bit.
---
What ever letter you do pic, the number allows for cards ranked 1-5 stars to be used under that letter. Say you have 8 points under S you can put a 3 star card, another 3 star, and a 2 star card.
---
Here's a quick video (there are many) for a reference. https://youtu.be/wdRRbjA6i18
---
Over all don't fear too much that you'll mess up and be locked into something.
---
some people have better things to do than waste their life grinding in a game, skip the boring parts play the fun. simple
---
Yeah like the fast traveling issue where you have to attempt a fast travel atleast 3 times before you actually fast travel.
---
Eh, I'm not going to give them crap. But four weeks to figure out and fix what the last patch broke is worth a mild exclamation.
---
Awsome, will do
---
I think I may caught dupped plans from someone dupping holiday presents cause they were selling head mount plans for 10 caps each.
---
But I know none of my weapons or armor are dups! Cause none are very good (also I got all myself and none from trade or suspicious drops... But yeah my main weapon is a furious switch blade )
---
Unfortunately Bethesda's implementation of 'private servers' falls quite short of what many of actually wanted our own servers for. 
---
&gt;If you want to play at god mode go play Fallout4.
---
I have. For over a thousand hours. I think I've seen my fair share of the Commonwealth. If I could even just have the map of 76 and the workbench items in fallout 4, I'd be satisfied, but unfortunately that's not a thing. In the unlikely chance that anyone from Bethesda is reading this, I'm sure there are others who'd just love to see the fallout 76 map and a few basic quests ported into 4. What I'm trying to say is, there's probably a lucrative oop for some extra dollarydoos there, since money talks.
---
We try our best, if you plan on grinding nuclear winter for its cosmetics, I'm not exaggerating, you have a long grind to 100. Godspeed, sir.
---
&gt;
---
Is it possible to get 2 shot, 25% fire rate, 90% weight ones?
---
Yes it is.
---
The gatling plasma is a plasma weapon. Not as good as the gatling laser but the ammo for the plasma one is a billion times easier to craft. The gatling laser is better and has a perk which doubles its ammo from fusion cores (from 500 to 999 for a full fusion core) but crafting the ammo sucks but you can farm them easy enough (i just steal all the 25% cores from frames when i come across them)
---
You pick which special stat to level up and then which perk card you want but you don't have to choose A card under the same stat that you leveled up so you can level up your strength and then pick an Intelligence card if you want.
---
that's a night and day difference, thank you for the heads up
---
You would definitely NOT get banned for something out of your power like that bro. Bethesda is incredibly lenient on glitches and stuff like that. You had to know what you were doing to do this dupe glitch
---
Is the forum Something Awful?
---
I think he may have a few if those illegitimate. A millions I could but but 200 million is pushing it.
---
You do realize that the more you try to deny this the more people are inclined to believe you are that type of person? 
---
The best course of action for you was to stop talking from the beginning when it was clear that most people strongly disagree with you.
---
The other person pretty much nailed it, you also don't have to choose a perk from the same Special you put your point into, if you scroll through it will let you pick any card
---
Pretty sure they do it because it‚Äôs really easy to just make a burner account, hack in weapons or whatever, and give them to your main. It bans the main accounts who actually benefit from it and the temp ones. But, because it‚Äôs impossible to be 100% sure, things like people accidentally picking up duped weapons and getting banned happen.
---
God forbid Bethesda doesnt wring every cent out of your pocket ü§£
---
I have 3 legacies, 1 I got from mama moleman (it is a legendary the Dragon, with medicore rolls), and 2 from trades (and I traded legitim items for them). There is a high chance that those 2 are duped... like everything has the chance for that that is outside of my own items.
---
Imagine playing fallout 76.
---
I ended up having to closed the game out completely and restart.
---
Yeah, happened to me yesterday. 
---
Poor raider.
---
So, what? Cheating is the only way to get materials? you're either delusional, havent actually played that much of the game, or a pathetic troll.
---
What I've done to fix the 3rd person missing feet shadow bug while still using the high shadows preset was by editing Fallout76Prefs.ini and changing iShadowFilter=2 and iShadowOrthoFilter=3. I'm not so sure about the other issues, but I think it should still fix it since I haven't notice them at all.
---
So you say that we should ban everybody who bought any items from any player vendor, just to be safe?
---
THAT OLD COW BETH NEEDS TO RELEASE A BETTER  PRODUCT! THIS ALL STEMS FROM BETH RELEASING "GOOD ENOUGH PRODUCTS" STOP PUTTING THE BLAME ON THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY AND BE PISSED AT THE PEOPLE RELEASING THE TRASH TO BEGIN WITH! But seriously it's been 2 years of the same thing buggy/broken updates. It's time for BETHETHESDA TO GET THEIR SHXT TOGETHER!
---
Especially since a lot of those legacy weapons are INCREDIBLY overpowered.
---
IMO they should be completely removed but since they are so rare they're more like curios than weapons, at least to me.
---
And I'm getting downvotes because nobody can find an argument to disagree with me so they just click their "I don't like you button".
---
The going back to the same place multiple times in a row annoyed me and made me feel like it was trying to push fallout first and the survival tent.
---
To be fair. Ive missed out 3 times on Queen loot because people are almost insta killing it with dupped magic weapons and legacy weapons. I as a normal player can't deal enough damage within the 30 seconds it gets killed.
---
As foe the score challenges. Yes that is unacceptable. They are only now trying to fix it even though the problem has been happening with the challenges for a very very long time.
---
Too bad most of them will be back in like 2 weeks on the same account.
---
Agreed, some are really game breaking.
---
The two shot explosive laser rifle I got is ridiculous for PVP.
---
Literally should not exist IMO.
---
Theres no reason to cheat in any fallout game be it offline or online (unless you're doing pvp). There are so many ways to make your character godly that you dont really need the best weapon or best armor.
---
It's okay to laugh at my comment, only fair since i find your existance to be a joke
---
I had it happen first time today and I think I figure it out and it let me earn the stuff fadded out by just doing them thou
---
Strength increases melee damage and carry weight. Perception increases vats accuracy and how close you need to be to an enemy for them to appear on your compass. Endurance increases max health, disease resistance and decreases AP drain from sprinting. Charisma affects your prices at robot vendors, your rewards from events and let's you share perk cards. Intelligence increases xp gain, materials from scrapping and durability of crafted items. Agility affects your stealth and max AP. Luck affects how fast you build crits and the durability of items you loot.
---
not soon, it was launched in may 19th for 27 days and the furniture RR theme was in june 9th for 27 days limited time too.
---
Not my first rodeo, but I appreciate your backhanded concern.
---
A person who illegally duplicates items will try to trade them in the real currency for money. Hackers also seem to want to destroy the game. These guys don't really seem to enjoy and play the game, so it would be futile to prepare something like a bad-sports server for them.
---
What level are you?
---
Send a ticket to Bethesda ‚Äòi duped please ban me‚Äô, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get help fast lol
---
There are quite a few perks that can be used to decrease damage taken:
---
In Luck, you can find Junk Shield, which allows you to get up to 30 dmg resistance by just carrying Junk.
---
In Agility, you have Moving Target, which allows you to gain up to 45 dmg resistance while sprinting. Also, there is another perk, Evasive, that gives you 3 dmg resistance for every point of Agility. 
---
In Intelligence, you have Nerd Rage!, which gives you 40 dmg resistance for being under 20% health. 
---
In Charisma, you have Lone Wanderer, which lets you take 20% less damage, when alone. 
---
In Endurance, you have Ironclad which you‚Äôve stated already. 
---
In Perception, you have Refractor, however this gives 40 energy resistance.
---
In Strength, you have Barbarian, which similar to Evasive, adds 4 dmg resistance for every point of Strength you have. Also, there‚Äôs Blocker, which allows you to take 45% less damage from melee attacks. Finally, you have Bullet Shield which lets you gain 60 dmg resistance while firing a heavy gun.
---
**Note: All of the stats stated above are when the perk is completely maxed out.
---
Where did you find out about this ‚Äúbot banning a certain amount of goods‚Äù? 
---
Do you have a source link?
---
Congrats ü•≥
---
Hmm. I will try kill 3 huge creatures tonight and see if it  triggers.
---
Go the 625 ammo one, think its tesla capacitor, gunner sighrs, prefered receiver but leave barrel standard. Try it out cause it might be preference but the dmg i get with standard barrel seems a lot better. Lvl 95 Behemoth in under 2 seconds give or take with standard vs behemoth taking 7-8 with tri at close range.
---
Oof the budget.
---
No people dont get furious about dupes in fo76 cause the game is 100% rng you can play this game 20.000 hours and still aren't guaranteed a good weapon.Take WoW for example where you can do raids and get tokens for weapons atleast it used to be that way. So people that grinded a lot eventually got good gear in Fallout 76 it's a whole different story with all the daily caps and limits this feels more like a mobile game on PC than a mmo.
---
When you level up you should have to choose A letter and it automatically shows you the cards for that letter but you can scroll over, are you sure you didn't click it very quickly without noticing?
---
Stop snitching, jeez... Snitches dig ditches, remember that.
---
Nostalgic AF. Love it üòé
---
Yes, i agree. Dupers ruined the hoarders.
---
As if I ever had something worthy of duping. And even if I had I wouldn't dupe 'cause omfg I have something that I can't lose by getting banned.
---
Honestly I couldn't care less if I get banned it'll be like that but I'm not gonna bother getting a semi decent weapon by grinding an absurd amount of time.Same as with the gold bullion and the season pass.Sure wastelanders was a step in the right direction but this still feels like it lacks potential.
---
sorry bro :/
---
Yes it's been happening to a lot of people.
---
[=\)](https://media1.tenor.com/images/a47274c97fe2a0433f4e7eeacf3c25b2/tenor.gif?itemid=13030909)
---
I think you mean 76% of players were banned.
---
Well, when you bought the game, you signed a contract with it. That is called Terms of Service, and there are a few others. You accepted them when you log in.
---
And cheating is against to the ToS.
---
Yeah, the dupewave is Bethesda fault, they left bugs in the game. But again, ToS states it clearly, abusing those bugs are banable.
---
A fully private server sounds good, but private server character should never ever able to enter the real servers then.
---
Sounds about right thank you just making sure it‚Äôs not just me
---
yeah, i read and tried to explain that the most common anti-cheat system would detect cheat engine so he would find the same problems in the future.
---
i don't know how he used (apparently dark souls) it and i don't care i just advised him that cheat engine have a bad reputation in the gamer community since forever, it triggers all types or anti cheat system out there and it's common knowledge.
---
he is not the first having problems and not the last one but he can do whatever he wants.
---
Banning everyone would eradicate all dupes and glitches. Just wipe it, there is no content whatsoever anyway. Actually, dupers brought more content this week than Bethesda did since Wastelanders.
---
It's quite a common issue, if this subreddit is to be believed. The team is hard at work diagnosing the root cause of the issue. The hotfix today with extra logging should speed that process up hopefully
---
I haven't had the issue since the legendary run began. However, when it was atoms not SCORE I had it all of the time.
---
What I've been doing may be superstition but had worked for me:
---
Always end your gaming session in adventure. If you do NW go back to adventure then quit.
---
Do not check your legendary board or the atom shop prior to your first adventure load in after reset.
---
Give yourself at least until 12:30pm est to log in. Some will say even 1pm est.
---
Load adventure first. Do NW dead last.
---
Again this could be the equivalent to rubbing a lucky rabbits foot but this has worked for me. Why this keeps happening has been debated and misunderstood. The only thing from Bethesda has been an acknowledgment and that it will be fixed (or has been it's sometimes hard to understand).
---
Good luck and sorry this happened.
---
Nah, it is an old stuff. I stuck in pebles everytime, everywhere on PC.
---
You say a gat laser is better than a gat plasma, do you mind explaining why? 
---
I'm leveling my first a heavy gunner so I'm not overly familiar with either weapon but I've always felt the plasma hits harder (figured it was due to higher base damage and armor pen) or am I missing something?
---
Dawg I know what you mean, I‚Äôve struggled to get it to copy 6 letter neon words, I can‚Äôt imagine trying to get it to copy decorated vending machines or wall hangings anything I‚Äôm just stuck with the dome haha. I think I‚Äôm about half that playtime and I still question it. Luckily I got death stranding, horizon and grounded to look forward too so I can break away for a while. I missed the first week of the season pass moving apartments and I realized I was never gonna finish it, that actually helped me break away a bit as excited as I was when it was announced.
---
They're now banning for Xmas gifts
---
Well.. I received a few nice and (probably) duped weapons from someone on my friends list. I duped 2 of them 3x and gave them away to friends because i didnt want to be selfish.... No regrets tho... If i get a ban that's alright
---
Yeah, and Bethesda needs duppers... Why? Because dupers provided more content past few weeks than Bethesda did since releasing Wastelanders.
---
Won‚Äôt surprise  me if people don‚Äôt want to come back cause of the lack of game play üëçüèª
---
5 server hops. Usually find the server I want in one or two. All low levels that were just noobing it up together.
---
It's there to give context to the whole board game theme. Would it be a race with only one ship?
---
Honestly, it's not even dupers who got banned. One of my buddy's got banned and didn't dupe. He got weapons out of someone's player vendor, and also did trades on market. Which, I don't think that should count as a ban atleast. It's kinda dumb, considering he just bought/traded for them and that got him.
---
Fried mushrooms?
---
Had a guy do this at one stage, complete with asking me to kill him via his mic.
---
But I have pacifist on so couldn't.
---
D/oh.
---
Well, if we ban everybody who ever bought anything from another player in any way... almost no player would left.
---
I sell ammo in my vendors, and I do not dupe. My customers would be banned then. Not fun.
---
Wipe out/ delete all and every duped items from everybody inventory (and remove the known plans, they have to relearn them, etc) is a good idea, that I support.
---
I have some pics on my profile but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to post them here,  I don‚Äôt think they allow pictures here?  Thanks for the advice,  yeah we‚Äôve reached out to many high level players with only a few who showed up tonight.  Was great fun still.  Even got to melee.  The PVP community is small,  especially us that treat it like sport and not like we‚Äôre trying to get a mark.  I only ever pvpd people that fucked with me or against friends/strangers I ask for fun.  Look I like farming as much as the next fallout player but I think a lot of the community is sleeping on the pvp in this game.
---
I did NW first today that could be the reason 2 of them where already complete
---
The last guy said a third of players, now it's more than 50 percent. I honestly don't know who's magical made up numbers to believe anymore. 
---
By the end of the day and the 47th post about this, I expect everyone will be banned, and half the people from TES as well at this rate :D
---
Dupers don't affect your game play? I am curious to how you came up with that conclusion?
---
I would say there are quite a few areas of game play that could affect other players due to duping.
---
**Player vending economy**
---
Any normal player with non-duped items has much less chance at competing at all these low cost god rolls. Or at the very least it stops players from buying because.. well you have nothing of worth anymore because I have already duped all the good shit.
---
**Enemy time to kill**. 
---
More OP weapons in circulation would probably skew the already out of whack game balance. If these weapons are available at low cost, then the general player population becomes even more OP than before which in effect just squeezes out the less equipped players (non-dupers) to get participation in events unless they also get the high dmg weapons to compete with tagging / getting SBQ credit. 
---
I already go to some events and see low levels just barely get a hit in due to FE Gatling Plasma spam just absolutely annihilating everything in their path. This would only get worse if everyone had a duped legacy.
---
This is going to hopefully be somewhat remedied in the One Wasteland patch coming in the future though.
---
**Server Instability**
---
I don't know if this is still as prevalent as before, but I seem to remember a while back that some exploits caused various server instabilities. I am not sure if dupes would cause a similar instability but I wouldn't rule it out.
---
You can also posit that if someone has a lot more items spread across their account due to extreme duping, then that might result in their account taking more server resources than your normal player (e.g.: more API requests to whatever handles the item transactions, larger amount of database rows to store item logs / transactions). Maybe that's not such a big deal for the occasional duper, but if it's widespread enough I could imagine it showing up in some sort of traffic / memory usage analytic on AWS.
---
**FPS Issues**
---
This is a weird one but can you imagine what your FPS would look like if you had 15-20 players all with duped explosive gatling plasmas just spamming all over the place.. I've run into some servers like that and.. it's actually quite glorious to behold but at the same time fuck me my fps drops quite a bit.
---
Still I know fuck all about how they made the game, I only know what I've experienced thus far, but yeah I think the evidence is there that duping generally has affected peoples day to day game play whether they noticed it or not.
---
Gatling plasma is level 50, gatling laser is level 45.
---
Therefore plasma is better. Higher damage, cheaper core.
---
Those are fair arguments. 
---
&gt;A fully private server sounds good, but private server character should never ever able to enter the real servers then.
---
I 100% wholeheartedly agree :)
---
Banned 1/3 of the player base in the first dupe last year. Don‚Äôt think the games suffered to much. People who used the exploit knew the risk and now it‚Äôs happening there‚Äôs all these butt hurt posts.
---
Both foundation and crater have a shop where you can spend bullion on their items, the raiders is inside the instanced area in center of the crashed space station, talk to a mister handy. At foundation talk to the guy in vault Tec clothes, close to underground elevator. Lastly at vault 79 on your map, head down the elevator and one of the ss agents is a vender
---
Both arnt that great imo, use minigun, 50 cal, lmg or gauss minigun
---
I know a friend with a explosive paddle ball and it's the coolest thing ever and it's a "glitched" weapon. It only does 0-1 damage, but it makes a quantum explosion that looks really cool. And that's not really cheating, just a wacky and terrible weapon. Lol
---
Doubt people complain about people who cheat on GTA online
---
Someone else already offered but I will gladly buy it if something happens and i cant get it from him
---
I am 1h melee high armor build! I run around in full ss with a switch blade stabbing things.
---
I've never had a legendary now drop.
---
Too bad they will be back in full force in 2 weeks and duping like rabbits. Thanks Beth...
---
I couldn't say for sure, but I think I've seen people talking about it as if it still works since wastelanders.
---
https://imgur.com/a/wuhbjLi
---
i done did it.
---
He didn‚Äôt say 100%, learn to read.
---
The game was still in its infancy and there have been a great deal more controversies since then. yes wastelanders would have brought some new and returning players but a game like this one only bleeds players over time.
---
Oh well I haven‚Äôt finished vault 79 yet
---
I won my first one with 0 kills and being revived 3 times. Feel bad for my team.
---
Personally i like my Gatling Plasma better, with heavy gunner perks maxed out and a normal Gatling Plasma, the damage is always superior to that of a normal Gatling Laser, but the accuracy and recoil suffer compared to it. The ammo is cheaper too.
---
People out here are downvoting your comment just cuz they‚Äôre jealous they don‚Äôt have their grimly hands on our juicy legacies
---
Not more than the game was ¬£86 at pre order for beta access.
---
People i know duped up to 200 000 bobbleheads, 10 k is a joke :))))
---
Ngl this made me chuckle
---
Honestly it would take away scams as well. There's so many scams but nothing done about them
---
I'm not sure how they stack up damage wise but I think the Gatling Laser can get near perfect accuracy  which makes it good for fighting scorchbeasts, especially the queen who never seems to land anymore + the plasma weapons projectiles have A travel time which makes it easier to miss with them.
---
Better Inventory mod.... only add what you said to the pip boy menu, so very harmless.
---
I've worked, (well played) genuinely hard to get my nice things and cool stuff. I have like 30 formula P for sale in my vendor. Someone asked if they were duped. Um, no? Just hours of flower picking and getting melted by many many assaultrons.
---
I bet you say that to all the ladies
---
Cause for some people, its a disease of the mind. You know those felons that serve their term in prison, get released but end up back in prison a few months later cause they just could not help to keep themselves clean? Same thing.
---
"You just don't like the game, wait for next update and free atomic shop item"
---
That comment is ridiculous. Have you seen the amount of players that just joined with the free passes?  I hope, but doubt, that they can identify and ban, or reset, every single player that used the dupe. I would guess a good 80% duped last time as well making caps flux ammo etc useless commodities for trading and now having brought down the entire in game economy they deserve to be punished.
---
I'm right ther with you and I don't bother doing the NW ones.
---
Don't know where you're seeing 1/3 but most of what I've seen has been an exaggerated 75% and upwards, 50% was a cautious generosity. I've also witnessed anecdotal evidence of players who had upwards of 100 active players in their social menu to then under 10 the next day.
---
Yeah what‚Äôs the point in scamming if you have infinite of your own trade. Unfortunately it‚Äôs pretty difficult for beth to do anything about scammers besides make an even semi intelligent trade system lol
---
Tbh dupers kinda prevent scams, in a sense. There's been scammers taking weapons and anything they can get their hands on cause they don't have it or want it. I've been scammed a few times. It sucks. And Bethesda doesn't help in anyway, not even with a new trade system to prevent scams like other games. When the dupes come along, everyone has everything basically, or everything is worth caps for the first time in a long time, and there hasn't been as many scams. More legitimate people
---
You can use any backpack skin on it. I use the Ghillie one I got from SCORE so it blends in with my ghillie outfit. But I also dont play 3rd person, so I never see it anyways.
---
Ding ding ding, we have a winner!
---
Honestly fixing the beyond shitty grind for decent legendaries would fix 90% of the duping problems in this game because then you wouldn't have to dupe to get viable weapons.
---
Until they actually fix the reason people dupe, people are going to immediately try to find a new way to do it as soon as the old one gets patched. It'll be a never ending cycle.
---
They always did. There's a banner that pops up and asks if you want to spend caps to claim it.
---
Great idea- but a little OP with just cans and jars. Keep the jars, drop the Tin Cans and make it the aluminum cans. Make the players think about if they want the valuable scrap or the forever food.
---
No I‚Äôm talking about already owned workshops.
---
Most games have a trade system that works. Like borderlands makes you confirm trades on both ends. This game has no fail safe in place and it's perfect for scammers. And honestly, with how easy it was to win me over the 2 times I got scammed, I realized how stupid it is to not have a system in place
---
Was it me or the fireworks we get free litterly do nothing and are a waste.
---
They don't even explode
---
I had no team lol. I turned off fill team that round.
---
There‚Äôs plenty of new map mods already available for 4 with the Capital Wasteland project still being worked on and a 76 map in the works. Find those modders and donate to them. If Bethesda did a remake of 3 I‚Äôd love it but they already get flak for the many Skyrim‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt expect it. Scratch your new map itch with the awesome modding community but when playing with other people behave yourself and be a respectable community member. I know that‚Äôs asking a lot these days...
---
That undersells it.
---
That makes sense, I tend to use them in closer quarters and leave the 'sniping' to my gatling gun (or lmg when I have the ammo to spare). Thanks.
---
Yep, energy heavy guns that aren't explosive which are considered legacy now or have the bugged "magic" will be outmatched by ballistic heavy guns. However, they are great at conserving ammo so just save them for trash mobs OP.
---
 If you had to choose though go for a gatling plasma since the gatling laser is trash unless its an ultracite gatling then thats a different conversation 
---
And if you wanna know why the gatling laser is trash i primed both my 1* Bloodied plasma and laser and the plasma was killing mobs much faster.
---
I would assume this is normal but I've never actually taken one from somebody else.
---
It‚Äôs 108 with ammosmith just so the OP knows
---
I was trying to get a revive from events so i missed you reply. Much sorry
---
Funny how they ban dupers and yet STILL haven't taken action against a load of nuclear winter cheaters. Very obvious cheaters who have been reported many times for several weeks or months.
---
This is rather annoying, yes. 
---
I mean, you can move your camp spawn point, so unless you are creating your camp on top of a sacred burial ground and is waiting for those souls to come and wreck havoc as revenge for their deaths, there is no point in having bodies stuck on the floor of your house.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaha that isn't sustainable at all, virtually giving away the game for free is a desperate plee for new players further proving bethesda's need for new players. Just wait and see how many of those new players actually stick around.
---
I spoke to my mate Raoul, and he has lots of friends. The most friends, really the best friends. He knows Todd's sisters uncles substitute dog walker, when his main one is on holiday. 
---
He told me eleventy billion people had been banned, which is at least 3 quarters of one fifth of the third of players who logged in last week. 
---
He wouldn't lie, because last time he did I gave him a chinese burn and his arm went all red for hours.
---
This isn‚Äôt normal. Last time I took a workshop, it would place my icon above the workshop and fast travel was free. Now it is requiring me to pay caps to travel there.
---
Very valid points. However, Beth is the police and the judge.  If we were to apply real world scenarios then we would be discussing habeas corpus. But we‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs simply a suspension on all suspected accounts. That being said, dupers knew the risks. Marginal cost vs marginal benefit analysis in my opinion. But very valid points.
---
More of my friends are banned than those who aren‚Äôt üòÜ, some who haven‚Äôt played in weeks even got the boot. It‚Äôs pretty widespread this time, shame on people for trying to crash the cash market and make the game more enjoyable I guess.
---
I'm not sure how else it can be implemented, the whole game relies on menu interaction or at least hot keys.
---
Nope, sometimes i've been interrupted and could not continue playing until the day after, where i maybe only pick up a few things i was farming.
---
Still refreshed the day after.
---
And ive never seen any indication that picking up enough stuff would reset, then the farming would be infinite more easy than it is.
---
I can walk around picking up material and farming for hours straight, perhaps gathering 300-500 materials, but going back to my start, it has not reset. not until 20 hours has passed
---
Plasma does more damage per shot and is easier to craft ammo but is wildy inaccurate evevn with perks. Laser is easier to control and gets more shots per core, especially with power user, but does less damage per shot and requires fusion core. That's the general gist.
---
wastelanders is 3 months old. do you want a dlc like this every month? also, there came new stuff with the legendary run (dont want to call it content, its mainly cosmetics), at least something.
---
watch over to RDO: 7 months of absolutly. nothing. at. all.
---
Careful though, it's also very intensive on your computer since the shadow distance presets are OBNOXIOUSLY high. I think ultra for fo76 is 10-15 times as high as ultra for fallout 4, which is clearly much more than you need or will ever see. If you're in the forest and want to see the shadows cast over watoga, I guess you can do that, but good luck finding anywhere to see that far. I think maybe off the top of seneca falls it might work, but even then the textures wouldn't load in, so you would be looking at shadows over colored blobs
---
I‚Äôd guess around 30%. Content wise the game is picking up speed. More events in the next few weeks. And these comments were made in the initial duoe wave. And yet. Look at the size of the player base now. If u duped I think a fair way, if they could do it, would be to strip the inventory and reset the toons on the account to level 50
---
That‚Äôs a impressive feat. I‚Äôve never won solo. Maybe I should give it a challenge haha
---
Use an auto tesla rifle or explosive ahotgun for that. Less weight more dmg :p
---
It would be more effective to just grow some balls and perma ban all of them and create background programs to track activities and items server side. Let them dupe but would then be caught and banned in a day, including items. You might think it be a lot of trouble to track items like this but there are several good methods on the programming side but what I have understood is they don't even have the talent/skill anymore for that anyways.
---
Same as trade glitch but using scrip machine I believe
---
Yes and the more stuff that is built the more they cost.
---
Never said that, just I think it would be a shame to remove what we have.
---
Anyway, Bethesda will do what they think is best, nothing I can do about it.
---
That they don‚Äôt Bethesda are like apes
---
&gt; I've also seen those with such ridiculously high DPS they've taken down a Scorchqueen in about 2 seconds flat. I mean I may not have bloodied weapons yet but I can't imagine it'll be so much more powerful it's the equivalent of 20+ people. That's the most extreme example but I've seen several instances of very powerful weapons that one-shot pretty much any high-level monster other than something like a scorchqueen (take down a legendary scorchbeast with maybe 2-3 shots). Don't know if that's just an insane build or if that's likely some sort of hack?

There's a few legendary types (I forget which ones) that cascade. Think furious where each successive hit deals more damage. If the legendary is on a weapon with a high rate of fire like a minigun, LMG, or 50cal, and you hit the same body part over and over again, it'll bug out and each shot will deal exponentially more damage.
---
So it's due to a bug but done with legitimate weapons.
---
Oh I thought you meant to claim it. Yeah fast traveling is free if you own the workshop but if it isn't showing your icon then you probably have A bug that's been happening quite A bit recently. Do you see unowned workshops on the map as workshop icons or normal ones?
---
But why? That's such a malicious mindset. Are you familiar with how the doop worked? People put in actual leg work and actual resources to obtain these doops. They didn't just appear in their inventories and they sure as shit weren't free. In addition to that, a vast majority of players put in that leg work and those resources in *private servers* that they pay actual *real life currency* to use. That subscription makes Bethesda their bitch, not the other way round. They can snatch funding for Bethesda just as quickly as Bethesda slapped them with a suspension. If Gary from Kent wants to dupe himself a single legacy BE gatling plasma to tackle hordes of enemies at West Tek and Whitesprings in his private server then that's nobody else's fucking business. He's paid for the privilege.
---
This was happening to me the other day. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a visual bug. I never heard the register sound, and I‚Äôm 99% sure no caps were actually taken from me.
---
Well, I don't really play anything else atm but I had an extensive history of playing plethora of different games,so I'm sure I'll get hooked on something else after the season's end (and I plan to finish it in 9-10 days at the current pace).
---
Since there's nothing I can do to earn atoms to get cosmetics I might potentially like beyond seasonal rewards, I will eventually take a break from the game after I reach level 100.
---
I have no wish to fuel that disaster of a development process with my cash buying atoms anymore (and I only did it via buying subscription for several months) until Beth will get their shit together. So I'm only interested in playing the game while I'm able to grind for the cosmetics to pretty up my char/camp. Beyond that I already got everything I wanted/needed to successfully steamroll all the content this game has to provide.
---
If they take mine away I'm done, I've spent 10+ months making sure I don't drop or sell it on accident. Having a legacy weapon should've been something special that you could only get early game, many games have items like this. Instead they allowed people to dupe them and made them near worthless because people scream eBay at the top of their lungs as if legitimate legacies don't exist.
---
It's probably a visual bug and somebody else has claimed it out from under you but it hasn't updated.
---
ToS don't mean shit when even cheaters don't get the items they want because of unfair drop rates (see u/vanrast comment). Doubt there are many people complaining about GTA online cheaters who just exploit to get gta$ and sell accounts. Atleast money doesn't have a random drop rate and rockstar fixes every bug which helps getting money.
---
How do i know if i have been banned?  
---
at work atm.  
---
Will i get an e-mail from Bethesda?
---
Its mostly down to damage and accuracy.
---
The gatling laser and ultracite gatling laser are super accurate at most ranges. The gatling plasma even at close range isn't very accurate.
---
The gatling plasma has like 3 or 4 mods (can't remember how many but its very few) the gatling laser and ultracite gatling laser have more mods.
---
I'd be down for that for sure. Love a bit of fisticuffs, I've been doing it a lot lately against mobs, especially at lower level events etc. Manhunt is a great one, bitch slapping Super Mutants and giving old mad dog the old kangaroo powered flying fist. 
---
I have never really PVP'd in the game but I'd definitely put up my dukes in a designated area like that. Could give out prizes and everything.
---
agree.
---
I  am on XB and 2 servers i was on was busy.
---
Canceled mine a few weeks ago too. I think I am done with this game and Bethesda for good this time around. Bethesda office(Austin, TX?) under FO76 is terrible and I don't think it will ever improve. Just gonna wait on this last week and see.
---
Listen man no need to get sassy it's all piece and love ‚ù§ I'm just reporting on what I've seen, feel free to stay ignorant but it doesn't hurt to be a little open minded and consider  everything on the table from time to time
---
Yes fair enough, wasn't thinking about the buff aspect, that would work, but if you're going to be interacting with menus to consume buff items isn't that eating and drinking anyway, what's the point of risking who knows what game breaking bugs from Bethesda attempting to change things.
---
I'm shocked the top rated thread on this sub right now isn't something like "I'm a five year old brain cancer patient playing this game 24/7 from my hermetically sealed anti-covid bubble and Bethesda banned be for having the ten million rounds of ultracite ammo I honestly crafted over the last week"
---
People usually eat that shit up.
---
I took A short break after wastelanders so I'm not sure if they patched it but Explosives were still getting double damage from Two Shot instead of +25% like everything else.
---
When fausmaucht was running
---
I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but most people I know who were involved were doing what they did to get better gear out there and to crash the cash market. The game is more fun when everyone has decent gear, and when decent gear isn‚Äôt only obtainable with real money. Ban people who have 40 copies of the same armor set on a mule, don‚Äôt ban people who just wanted to give shit away so their friends could also have nice things. 
---
Duping for IRL profit is scummy, sharing with the community doesn‚Äôt bother me a bit. So I‚Äôm on the fence, we don‚Äôt know what the criteria for the ban was, how people were flagged, or what they‚Äôre trying to accomplish. Maybe fix the fucking game before of punishing people who were duping out of boredom and with good intentions. There are still mules out there with piles of stuff just waiting to hit gameflip, the people who actually play are the ones who suffer IMO.
---
Im sure a lot of people wont come back. Some friends i know duped. Why? Cause the RNG is bad. Me for example have over 70 rolls of the Guass shotgun. Still havent rolled a single bloodied one. But oh yeah here you go! Take all these nocturnal 1\* shotties! 
---
Its frustrating.
---
You made me chuckle but at what cost?
---
I'm fine my dude, just poking a bit of fun and being light hearted with a semi serious point wrapped up inside. It's not really malicious. Most people are open minded I think, but the absurdity of trying to vaildate your point with numbers and figures you pull outta your ass is never gonna get you taken seriously. 
---
You'd have had a semi decent point if you hadn't added that portion I think. It's not that I or indeed other people may not be slightly worried about the game population with this blanket approach, and it is an absurd approach from a player standpoint, it's just that when people start doing the textual equivalent of running around like headless chickens on fire and making shit up all over the place, it's hard to take any of the rest seriously really.
---
That is hands down the worst idea ever on Bethesda's part. Someone dumped thousands of gifts on me when I was brand new to the game, and had no clue what they were. I opened some, figured out what they were, and then just gave the stack to someone else. They need to focus on the accounts who are actually making the dupes, otherwise so many people will be banned simply for accepting a gift from someone. So many times on this subreddit I've seen someone ask "hey this person gave me a ton of X, is it safe to take? Was it duped?"
---
I still don't understand, I have a shit ton of legacies and rare outfits and plans and I'm not banned, I see people saying they didn't dupe and got banned but I don't understand why you'd be banned if you did nothing wrong, I've don't nothing wrong and I'm still here
---
What do you mean? If I change the scope will it lose its properties. ie 100 percent vats accuracy or infinite clip?
---
Thinking about your comment and that does actually make sense, I guess I miss out because I can't compete with these heavy hitters shooting wide dispersing gauss weapons, mini guns etc. My little sniper handmade can't compete with the shear area of effect these big guns have.
---
Even with Gun Fu, Vats is too slow in its snapping to next enemy, by that time everything's already dead.
---
Which is why my stance is that the game would be better off without it. I would take no implementation over a poor implementation that drags the rest of the game down.
---
That said, other possible tweaks to the food and water system could be to lengthen the time it takes to go from full to empty; or have characters auto-consume marked items once the meter falls below a certain limit, with player interaction required to get up to the bonuses of being well fed/hydrated.
---
Diseases and mutations never bothered me as they cause impacts but simultaneously can be ignored in the short term (which imparts an actual decision, do I deal with this now or let it run its course), but the water and food system demands constant menu interaction with no actual difficulty and no allowance for the player to actually make a decision beyond "eat now" or "eat in 30 seconds". That the related rate reduction perks only work in camps, and reduction items are time limited to a measely 5 minutes adds insult to injury.
---
TLDR: My real problem is the food and water system, diseases are fine as is.
---
Indeed, cheaters are trash in game and an indication of how they are like IRL.
---
&gt;This game is solid 
---
Yeah, no, it really isn't. The core game mechanics are fine on paper but the entire game is held together by tape and craft glue on a programming level. With as ridiculous of a grind for decent legendaries as there is in the game right now it's no wonder people dupe good weapons instead of farming for hundreds of hours for shit ones. If Bethesda would fix the grind duping, and the RMT market, would go away.
---
I need access to these percentages. I feel like it could be a great case study in how company balances ToS enforcement and player numbers. We have a lot of data analysis here in 76 clearly.
---
üòú
---
Food for thought, this mass duping might actually fix the market soooooo...........
---
How about you shut the hell up?
---
Unless you like Gat Plasmas and Legacies going on ebay for 700 fucking dollars.
---
"Feedback" tickets on the site are where you report bugs, they used to say "bugs and feedback" but I guess they decided to change the name for some reason. You will usually not get a response back because it is usually one way route.
---
some mates and i are playing since beta, found together in the early few weeks after release and stick together till today. we saw alot of people come and go, second one more then the first one.
---
there were always the "i'll wait till next patch and see if it's worth to play on", but it never was. people waited months for wastelanders, a few weeks later several teammates quit and were never seen again. the game is designed as a cashcow, they don't put any effort in the game - they never did. i can tell you that the next update will not change the game in any way, since it never had.
---
You're suggesting that OP keeps 30-40 of their carry weight in power armor they may or may not use? If all of these sbq fights are inside the nuke zone, hazmat suits or Chinese stealth armor are far superior to power armor; if not, your standard armor will give you plenty of protection. Of course, this is making assumptions. Assuming you have no perks invested in damage resistance, or traveling pharmacy, you're better off using that weight for stimpaks, radaway, and rad shield. The only reason I ever use power armor on any of my non pa builds, is of I find myself over encumbered, too far from a camp or train station, I can pull out my excavator armor to get where I need to go
---
As im free ones or stuff related to real woeld money?
---
You're right. I edited the post to clarify that this only applies to the Shadow Quality setting. I personally have Shadow Distance at Low.
---
I just posted my ideas on another similar post about this issue:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hrizh4/2_of_my_weekly_score_challenges_where_already
---
Hope it helps. Sorry this has happened to you.
---
As in stuff that you can currently get in the game
---
Starlight and firecracker berries: the classic berry mentats berry taste.
---
Yeah played 10h ago and the servers were realy bad/laggy, more then usual.
---
Copper is really useful, especially for energy weapon users. Gold scrap has really limited use.
---
I also miss out as I don't cheat or trade (my loss) so my best gun is a 1\* bloodied handmade, a great sniper gun but too slow against mobs to compete with AOE weapons.
---
I guess I need to embrace the Tesla Rifle but I just love a more surgical approach.
---
My bad, I wanted to write since the release itself. What wastelanders brought? Oh, just 3 vendors and 2 daily quests to farm currency and buy overpriced plans that are not even good. So yeah, no content at ALL. NPCs should be part of the game since beginning, that's why it got like 30% rating luuuulw.
---
I‚Äôm on a private server
---
If you buy the calibrated shocks plan for which ever armor you use, it will increase your carry weight. That being said, the excavator armor increases it by 100 over your basic strength stat, and you can buy calibrated shocks for it as well.
---
Apparently you must logg in to Adventure/Private server before you can play NW to avoid this
---
I can never wrap my head around why they don‚Äôt bring certain content around again but repeat the same stuff over and over. I mean they took the time and effort to make this stuff, why wouldn‚Äôt they put it out for us to enjoy. There‚Äôs quite a few items I‚Äôve seen that were ‚Äú24 hour specials‚Äù and then they never made their way back to the atomic shop.
---
Yes. It's even happening on my private server. I get 1st every few months and the last few times I've had it before, I may have crashed once. I have been crashing several times in the last couple days. The public server is crashing even more.
---
Nuka Cola Clock and the 2 Power Armor paints are the only ones I can think of, might be more.
---
Edit: Nuka Cola machine?
---
Why do you hate bloodied builds? lmao What a ü§°ü§°
---
You realize Fo76's economy has been busted for months now anyways, duping would make more expensive items that people sell on ebay for 700 dollars easier and cheaper to obtain, Ultimately making stuff like caps and weapon trading viable rather than having to shell out your ACTUAL FUCKING MONEY
---
Maybe you some want to play low health armor and addicted?
---
Never taken a duped item here. All my gear is earned legit off kills/event rewards. I do sell things though.
---
There are power armor skins for T51 and X01. Not sure about the other stuff but these skins are cool, the X01 is Nuka Quantum themed.
---
Ah, idk then. I haven't used my private since public teams came in.
---
Well probably, but I mostly see PA users exploding this AOE mayhem into mobs eliminating whole groups instantly.
---
Its just it removes the 'public' from events when you just camp out and dominate the whole thing.
---
U can't even craft Ultracite ammo lmao
---
Fix? It was never broke they purposely changed it to 1v1 only, if you want team pvp go to a workshop
---
Its been an issue since wastelanders, I made an extensive thread about it back then, sadly its not something we can fix ourselves, but the more tickets we get to Bethesda, the bigger our chances of a fix.
---
The solution is so simple and obvious.
---
We don't need cheats, we don't need offline servers (servers that are offline are a contradiction) and we don't need many other things either.
---
And this is exactly where the solution lies: if you do not have the time to earn various things, you should resign yourself to not having them and not finding them easily and easily.
---
I have been playing since beta and have not owned a single legacy, have never owned it and will not own one unless current weapons become legacy in the future.
---
I have had a scout mask for a very long time and until a few days ago I didn't know what it was worth. Probably not now anyway, thanks to dupes.
---
I had the fancy revolver from pleasent valley and scrapped it because until a few days ago I didn't know how valuable it was. Probably not thanks to dupes anyway.
---
Conclusion: do what you want, stick to the rules and accept that you can't get every single piece of potentially available rewards
---
Love how people in this reddit downvote logic.
---
Shows you the dipshit snowflakes in here don't like opposition and common fucking sense.
---
Most are getting emails but some reports say they never received one. I suspect the majority are however.
---
My instigating explosive dragon is a legacy? ha, I never knew! I would give it up easy though if it meant the removal of all of them though with all the trouble they caused.
---
For me I don't need any more legendary items, it is that XP farming in public events becomes a huge explosion fest of PA heavy guns melting mobs before anyone gets a hit.
---
I said above, I realise I'm going to have to get a tesla and just tag everything as fast as I can.
---
Funny how absolutely no one knew you could dupe the treasury notes before the hot fix
---
oh - that sux.
---
Excuse me? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Adding to the list there are two wallpapers, the nuka lamp, nuka girl costume, and big ligt up nuka quantum
---
Doubtful. The were a few hundred bans, not one third. Everyone who gets caught, claims they were innocent. I've seen more people complain about dupers, cheaters, and hackers, than Bethesda's administrative practices (even though they're a direct result of said practices)
---
This ban wave is Bethesda putting a bandaid on a massive problem that isn't going anywhere. Until they address the reason people dupe, it's going to keep happening.
---
thank you for this! me and my missus bought some mothman backpack mods and haven‚Äôt been able to use them yet (bad shop explanations, booo) so this helps massively!
---
Weightless is a 3rd star effect.
---
I saw, well it's there if you want it. If you get the other one I'll just sell mine.
---
Can you just clarify does this show data for people who have been actively playing the game or does it just show the amount of times someone has started up the game?
---
Actual effing science! Ty for this. I guess we don't have to believe the guy who had a friend who's friends mother's boyfriend's son knows a discord server with between 50-136% banned.
---
I agree with the bans or suspensions it should be validated and reported for cheating/exploiting the game but i dont agree is what bethesda lack of fixing major bugs such as right now with the score points of people supposedly losing them (haven't experienced this yet thank god) and the horrible drop rates of weapons and even worse the armor legend rolls,  I for one like the new gauss weapons you can craft but it's Grindy and leaves a bitter feeling knowing you didn't get what you want after hours of grinding for your dream weapon with the perfect rolls or even just one good prefix at the very least for that matter and these score points not being rewarded entices others into cheating in god mode or just not play the game at all . I know people enjoy the grind but i feel like people are just frustrated with bethesda fixing things in biggest patch or fail to recognize obviously noticeable bugs. 
---
I just wanted the vent about maybe some reasons why people dupe/cheat , maybe they dont feel acknowledged when people report these issues feels like talking to an empty shell sometimes
---
Really annoying in darker areas getting caught up on rocks and stumps, jumping about everywhere seems to be the game's meta in fighting and traveling. Makes me want to fast travel everywhere and not explore.
---
So what you're saying is that you made a bet  that you don't know how patches work.
---
Congrats?
---
You're not going to see shit like this fixed until there's been an actual update to the game, that sort of shit doesn't happen during the weekly downtime when they update the atom shop.  People like you expect they're just going to roll out a hotfix for download to pc and consoles just to fix your favorite perk.  It doesn't fucking work that way.  Because of the restrictions on console certs and the time and money required for them hotfixes like that are restricted to the really serious shit.
---
No one who knows how games like this actually work would have expected any of these recent bugs to be fixed until update 21, thinking otherwise would just be foolish.
---
Just out of interest did you load into adventure first or did you do a game of NW?
---
It just works.
---
Item duplication by using a glitch.
---
It is just damned hilarious reading these wierd justifications and "i didn't do anything wrong!" posts :D And absolutely, do what the hell you want. But don't come here crying when you get burned.
---
Silos have always given next to no xp. It's to stop people farming them.
---
I did a game of NW first. To get it out the way.
---
I literally laughed out loud at that.
---
Have you played a Bethesda game before üòÇ
---
You should probably work a bit harder and your game might not have so many bugs.
---
Steam charts is a terrible metric to use when it's split between numerous clients. Majority of the player base is not through steam, but through the bethesda client itself. Plus the burner accounts that people use are going to be through the bethesda client because you can get the keys cheaper that way.
---
Not in online games.
---
There is a nuka cola clock you can pick up from the random encounter , responders vendor at Charleston station
---
The idea is great, Bethesda implementing such without breaking other stuff I think is unlikely.
---
Build a water purifier in your CAMP and done.
---
Was there a mass ban that I missed?
---
Geez, I had a bunch of legit masks simply from farming the crap out of that event.   I didn't realize it would be such a good thing to get rid of them asap.   Ridiculous.
---
Oh my god!! You must be a genius. The top of the class. Accept my deepest respect.
---
Even if you are banned and start the game, steamcharts count you in. How else would they track offline games? Microchip from G5 I guess?
---
Glad I could help. I know I wish I had known about it months ago :)
---
Bethesda often times seems to go easy on a lot of people, aiming to take out the most egregious offenders in the hopes of scaring everyone else straight.  It's also a lot easier to grab the people who obviously went overboard without hitting some innocent outlier.  This was how things went for a lot of the early ban waves at least, before they really had much in the way of monitoring character inventories.  Odds are as the game progresses they're likely getting better at singling out people.
---
think it is a bug. i had this happen to me the other day as well.
---
Bethesdaü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I know, a flippant answer but really, it just seems the kind of thing they do, no rhyme or reason.
---
I wish there was some option that instead of the 800 weight stash, we could choose to have 600 stash and an extra 200 weight container that is only accessible from our camp so we could keep the stuff we want, safe lol
---
And the mothman papoose backpack skin looks very cute!
---
Nice. Nothing feels quite so much like a virtual home as that Red Rocket from Fo4. Whenever I replay 4 I just feel so safe whenever I'm there.
---
I'm not sure if that additional 1/4 rank per day will help much, but we'll see.
---
The only 'legacy' weapon I have is a Quad/Explosive Harpoon gun I got from mamma Murr 6 months ago, if that was flagged as *untradeable I wouldn't have a problem with that. Making all legacies untradeable would go a long way to fixing the duping issue.
---
Yep, all legendary Dragon is a legacy. I have an I/limb..  and some vats variant :)
---
It depends what style you prefer. They are 2 very different build so you'd have to pick one or the other imo. Both commando and heavys do very good damage.
---
It is best to have 2 toons, I mained a pa heavy gunn for a long time, currently level 341. And I didn't think I'd like the stealth commando life. But I made an alt, currently lvl 81, and have been loving it.
---
It's really nice to be able to switch up how you're playing by switching toons. It is a pain that my alt doesn't have any plans or mats. But I just use it for playing and give him stuff from my main
---
Your answer is most likely spot on, i was just praying for there to be an actual reason lol
---
You get downvoted in this reddit as soon as you say something negative about fo76. I'm almost sure most of the people downvoting aren't even playing this mess of a game right now or haven't even played close to as much as I have.
---
I have alot of plastic and i dont see why people need it so badly, please could someone explain, thanks
---
I've considered it, but just been lazy. Kicking myself cuz I missed mondays level up challenge when I could have done this
---
Removed immediately lol
---
The bans are trash smh picked up a whole bag of guns the other day from a vendor and now I‚Äôm banned for it what am I supposed to do ... pass this stuff up... fuck that
---
Hey I‚Äôm trying to help the community out here
---
If they were super rare plans than probably
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/wuhbjLi](https://imgur.com/a/wuhbjLi)
---
It works pretty well. Only takes 10-15 mins lol
---
I've not done it but considered it if it was a problem. I've been running some nice XP buffs and have been able to level twice a day on my now 427 level character. If I am desperate or want to level fast I jump to my alt and bump her faster (level 81). Leveling the alt takes me about 15 mins of intense grinding.
---
I would've watched it lol. Wouldn't have done it though, this ban waves got me a bit scarred haha
---
because moo-ving a camp often means that you have to build the whole thing new.    
---
I remember moving my camp once, even when it was green, it did not want to place the thing!
---
Sometimes when I miss, the enemy still takes a small amount of explosive damage from my explosive weapons.
---
This isn't just splash damage from hitting the floor either, as it happens with flying scorchbeasts too. So there's nothing else I can hit.
---
Nah, with buffs it's easy enough to still level in my 200s.
---
Fast traveling issue has been going on for quit some time now. Yesterday there was a new issue, my character dies, I respawned but I couldn't do anything but respawn. I must have responded 5 times before I decide to shut the game down completely and restart. Im level 361 and never have had this issue before [im on Xbox1].
---
Also it seem like there hardly any public events that popped up.
---
What are all the best buffs?
---
Archer, Athlete and Mammologist (if you know where to look) imo. 
---
Mammologist is mostly just pictures so providing you have a camera you should be just fine. Some of them are a little hard to find but here you go to save time:
---
-  Squirrels and rabbits: there's a little hill behind the Whitespring service entrance that reliably spawns both. 
---
- Same goes for foxes and Big Fred's BBQ shack. 
---
- The cat upstairs at Wixon Homestead (Cheswick II) counts. 
---
- For the dog, in theory the dog of the Responder in Flatwoods should count if the named cat at Wixon does (I got mine through a random encounter so I can't confirm).
---
- Wolves and yao guai are easy to find and corpses count. Leader of the pack event is nothing but wolves and yao guai are common enough in the Toxic Valley/ spawns outside Dolly Sods unless it's recently been killed.
---
Edit: fixed location of rabbit and squirrels. Added dog location. Formatting so its not one block of text.
---
Probably not, I and a lot of people sell head mount plans for cheap, they came more common I forget from what tho
---
I just jump to my alt to level. Takes like 3 west tek runs to level him up, not to bad honestly
---
Edit, alt is in the 80s
---
He collects at decent rate to keep you supplied but not if you use automatic weapons. 308/shotgun is great. Makes your life easier especially in early game
---
. If you like using chems , junkie, quack doctor etc. He's perfect.
---
You can trade away extra ammo or not exchange.
---
Temp bans are only temporary if you can actually play again by the time they're over.  MANY games use that period to run a deeper review and issue a full ban before the temp period is over.  Even if people do get off the hook you'd have to be delusional to think  that people that have gotten their attention once aren't getting flagged for extra attention from then on and could land a full ban in the future.
---
Unjustified Bans are a real thing, i am talking from experience (not in fo76, but an other game). Ofc cheaters lying about being innocent is a real thing too.
---
Ufffff I hate when I do this. Never fails, every time I build I place a wall or something in a weird ass spot and I can‚Äôt get get rid of it. Last time I had half wall on top of my roof, deleted everything around it and it stood there in the air all by itself just mocking me. After a week I couldn‚Äôt stand looking it at and deleted   my whole damn camp haha. Silver lining is I love my new build way more! But I feel your frustration, glad you got it fixed!!!
---
Who dupes on their main account anyway!!!
---
Ok thank you
---
Ultracite PA plans is common loot from SBQ, and sometimes you can find them thrown away after "kill three SBQ in 15 minutes" near the drop point...
---
Only for the NW overseer rank up challenge. The adventure mode i lvl up at least once or twice a day doing normal game sessions (lvl 207)
---
Umh. Pretty much everyone involved in duping or being on certain discords knew. It‚Äôs capped anyways, so no one bothered
---
thats a problem. Known problem, dont do it and everything would be fine. Also dont do challenges  when they reset +-30min.
---
That's a great idea! GENIUS! I need to do that for now on for as long as I play. I will set it up RIGHT NOW. I'll put one on the outside and one in the inside!
---
I try üòÅ
---
Archer, swimming and athletics. As long as you find a crossbow
---
Sorry I can be more help lol. Bit after playing both with god tier gear they are both great. It really depends on how you like to play. I do think heavys will out dps commandos on the Queen if that helps at all

You say a known problem. So not only must I commit 3 to 4 hours per day to playing, I must be in the sub reddit and make sure I am up to date with all the new bugs and work arounds. Ridiculous.
---
Bethesda doesn't actually care about dupers. In fact they sometimes secretly encourage it. Without mass duping, legacy weapons go for $120+. With duping they are worth nothing. The little niche market they have accidently created is an actual business. I've seen guys makes $20,000 a month off of this game. 
---
Bethesda doesn't like this because that's money they can't control going into their pocket. The people they are banning right now are banned for profiteering off Fallout 76. Not just because they duped.
---
Hmm im surprised i havent seen him yet
---
It's also cause there's a lot new players from gamepass. I have been seeing a lot of lower lvl players since they don't really have anything to sell or probably don't know about vendors, you won't see alot of vendors
---
 "Dupers don't affect your game." Saying only one kind of people. People playing multiplayer game as single player on they own paid server , but for some kind of reason they come to social forum and start saying that.
---
I am 99% sure it does.
---
I would like to make a recommendation if you do decide to use gatling lasers. 
---
I would say to prime your laser(if you have two, prime just the main of course). Ultracite fusion cores are much easier to make than regular cores and they are still affected by the perk "power user". 
---
What I've done is use regular cores in power armor or a regular gatling laser and drain it down until it is less than 10/100 charge. I gather all of them up(suggest having a friend hold onto all other fusion cores), put on "super duper" and "ammosmith" and then start turning all those depleted cores into ultracite cores. It's been weird lately but even though the game says it costs 2 fusion cores, sometimes it'll only use 1 core. 
---
Basically, at the cost of 1 or 2 depleted fusion cores, 1 violet flux, and 1 ultracite scrap, you can get 3-6 ultracite cores that are all at least 100/100 charge(depending on your int. of course).

Laser gun applies to both pistol and rifle.

The laser gun is both the pistol and rifle

Oh ok I get you thank you! üëç I know what I must do

Every workshop spawn is bugged. They tend to spawn in a close space and are standing there doing nothing

I found him headed south of Freddy Fears house of scares on the part of the highway where it swerves

I can make a few of them if you have he materials.

HAHAHAHA! Love using this glitch! It works everytime too!
---
I think when Wastelanders dropped, there was a bunch of emotes that were available that shouldn't have been. Including some relating to Pet commands and the Tricentennial Salute. I assume that lunchboxes were always a planned object, whether they were always planned for the legendary run I have no clue, but I'd say it was removed because you were never supposed to have it in the first place, being that lunchboxes hadn't been released when the emote became available and it is now free for this exact reason, because people would be wondering why they now have to pay for an emote that they already had at one stage.
---
Back in the day when you had to hunt the plans for BOS they became a good source of income I learned while completing my set. Of course, they where later sold in npc vendors for 50 caps :/
---
What's needed ? Never crafted them myself .
---
If they were restricted to keep the items in their private server nobody would care. That wasn‚Äôt the case !!
---
Someone‚Äôs simplest thought could be another‚Äôs worst nightmare of complexity
---
Ty
---
I tested it last night and it doesn‚Äôt work :(
---
nobody forced you to play it...
---
Stable flux changes on which is needed depending on the ones.
---
Best way for me is unyielding armor and low health. For mutations either herbivore or carnivore and herd mentality. Then, using herbivore for this example, brain bombs and cranberry relish ( tasty squirrel stew and broiled scorchbeast brains for carni ). For perks you want inspirational and strange in numbers and stick mostly to building teams. Pop plenty of berry mentats. That's it for regular stuff but lunch boxes can stack up to 100 xp bonus. Also, I'm running a high intelligence build. 
---
 Best farming is super mutants. They normally give around 500xp so can be 1000xp+ with lunchboxes. I hit West Tek, Huntersville and Abandoned Bog Town repeatedly. I don't even bother looting most the time. Also, if you have FO1st and want to really maximise your xp grind do all your cooking and prepping on a different character and trade over, especially if you have a lunchbox buff. No point wasting it farming sugarbombs.
---
Let me torn on my xbox to find out.
---
Well, I must be going to hell then, im level 361 and I still don't know my spawn point because I spawn in different spots at my camp.
---
A laser pistol can be turned into a rifle and vice versa, its just a matter of changing the grip to a stock. The same can be done for some of the pipe pistols/rifles.
---
You know you can play solo right
---
Tbf the garbage is the game.
---
And getting banned from a game isn't going to jail. What's your point?
---
Yes but there's a few mods that you have to by the plans from vendors for. Aligned automatic barrels for example.
---
That makes sense, too. I was consistently playing on servers full of those little buggers. It's nice to see them give the game a chance.
---
There is always duping going on but I would not worry too much for those unless some how they are given a reason to look into your account. But honestly man, its pretty obvious they where duped while you where getting them. But if you are legit honest in that footage then I would man up and report it asap with those recordings.
---
Yes. It quickly becomes a pain in the arse and attacks anything. I think it's intentional lol.
---
Brill thanks for the  reply contains all the knowledge i need friend thank you
---
I paid for it. It should work.
---
&gt;Including some relating to Pet commands
---
Yes! I remember that.  Well that makes a lot more sense.  Does that mean we're getting pets at some point?
---
Also do you know anything about the emotes that were removed?
---
Yeah idk why they did to it, I feel like it died much faster when it first came out. Takes less damage then the queen for me
---
What a load of shit. I have friends who didn't dupe because they wanna enjoy the game and not ruin the element of surprise. The only thing they did was buy items from vending machines which were possibly duped. The script they are using to catch dupers is flawed and has been. It flags people who didn't do anything wrong.
---
LOL closest I got was slashing a fellow player when mindlessly killing a horde of scorched.  Embarrassed enough to server hop :)
---
twisted muscles requires flurescent flux. 
---
marsupial requires crimson flux.
---
healing factor requires cobolt flux.
---
From my experience since the start of the game  everyone has been chill AF and more than eager to help fellow players out! I agree, best gaming community I‚Äôve ever seen. There‚Äôs always going to be some shitheads, but I like to appreciate them for what they add to the game. Not everyone in the wasteland would be friendly or forthcoming and it adds to the adventure all the same!
---
It used to but they patched that out iirc.
---
Define earned. Is grinding for 600 hours part of that definition? Or do you mean they earn it by being exceptionally lucky? Because that's all it is, luck.
---
You can doubt all you want
---
I play with him 100^% of the time in online and neither him or me have duped. 
---
Needless to say he has disputed it and is awaiting reply. 
---
Mistakes do happen.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs been a huge gripe I bought a year sub at like the start of the quarantine thinking ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll play a ton of this now‚Äù and have done like nothing haha I think mostly I realized a lot of the cosmetics are recycling and more so my original issue is like my camps been at budget for so long I can‚Äôt really use anything anyway, and then with all the games caps on everything I just feel totally blocked out of progression of any meaningful kind, I‚Äôm generally a huge fan of season passes and I think the group addition is excellent but the power armor at 100 is like the only appealing thing to me personally it‚Äôs honesty like exactly what happened with animal crossing. My island got totally teraformed and finished and then I had no desire to continue anymore cause there is no endgame there either. It‚Äôs a real shame cause I do love this game I just have no real reason to continue it, like I could hunt endlessly for the right weapon but to what end really? And I‚Äôd love to respec completely but knowing I‚Äôd need another 60 hours to do it effectively it just feels, again just another wall up
---
When I have stuff like that, I put it in a vendor and set it to max caps. No one is going to drop 30k on something like that. If you want to be extra sure, put the vending machine in an unreachable part of your camp...completely wall it off to help prevent access. I agree, there should be some safe container or way to lock an item to prevent scrapping, but until that happens, this is a decent temporary solution.
---
wait, really? shit.
---
Nah, I just remember downloading the game after Wastelanders came out and checking out the Atomic shop and grabbing a bunch of free emotes, I had actually totally forgotten about the lunchbox one, as I never understood its use and therefore never used it, now it makes alot more sense.  
---
 I'd assume that something akin to a proper pet system is coming in the future, but its not on the roadmap so we can only guess as to when it will be.
---
After reading these other comments of yours you sound pretty shady actually. With that you should be banned but this is Bethesda sadly. 
---
Funny, I actually knew a person named nick IRL. Something like this would be no surprise if it was his actions.
---
No worries. It's worth doing the unyielding thing even if you don't have a bloodied weapon for all the extra gains. Just maybe respec a bit to include perks like nerd rage. It takes a little getting used to the play style but you should score yourself enough to change back once this is all over if you want. I've running a couple accounts and both my xp toons are sutting on around 40 level ups.
---
I would advise against the following Mutations: 
---
Healing Factor: It only works while NOT in combat and it reduces the potency of your Chen's including Stimpaks. Even with Class Freak and First Aid Equipped I still "felt" the difference in how much less my Stimpaks were healing.
---
Plague Walker: The Damage it does is not substantial enough in my opinion and it breaks Stealth/Sneak for you because even with zero diseases you still have an aura that's doing zero damage to enemies. 
---
Electrically Charged/Unstable Isotope: The damage it does is a complete joke and at the very most it *might* two shot Lv.1 enemies and each time it triggers your are taking 10 points of True Damage to yourself (True Damage bypasses all of your DR/ER/RR) and no Class Freak doesn't lower the amount of True Damage that you take.
---
Thank you. I do that as soon as I am home.
---
RNG ruins this game
---
But there are no dupers. They all just found those items.
---
You know you could just... Not play it?
---
Ah yes
---
Mmmm i would think 200 could be safe actually. But also who needs that many stealth boys, maybe pawn some off to some new players just to be safe?! I‚Äôm sure they be ecstatic about it.
---
none of the actual dupers got banned, only their throwaway account, since bethesda don‚Äôt have a way to track duped weapons they can‚Äôt really do anything about it, it is a sad reality
---
Good tip! Thanks.
---
I won my first one in an epic action scenario where I charged out of the flames with an auto-grenade launcher, wiping an enemy team.
---
I won my other 4 by hiding, letting my team carry me.
---
Everyone's a bitch in Nuclear Winter. But you will get your action movie moment.
---
Where's Dogmeat? üêï‚Äçü¶∫
---
If you don't even enjoy the game then why do you even play? I mean, there is something incredibly wrong here with a person who plays a game they have never enjoyed tell that one time they exploited/cheated.
---
Because the icon for the emote looks like a briefcase, i used it as a way to suggest launching a nuke (nuclear briefcase and all that lol) when playing with friends lol
---
But it makes more sense now lol
---
I love it when people call other people dumb while not even using proper grammar.
---
I wonder if it was the same camp I came across one time, I cant remember the specifics of it but there was a makeshift boxing ring setup with "ropes" made using power connectors and wires hooked onto stair poles or something. Was pretty cool, reminded me when I used to play RDO and come across people doing fight clubs.
---
I really wish that was true. Bethesda may have the rules in place but they also have to enforce it and that's hardly ever done to the fullest.
---
I'd like to see 100% proof that if you're holding 100k+ steel (or any other mat) that you're "auto-banned" by Bethesda's "bot" b/c that sounds like some b.s. excuse dupers are using to scream bloody murder knowing full well they're guilty as sin.
---
Any vet knows you can farm 5k to 10k+ steel inside of a 6 hour session. 100k steel? That's a boring ass weekend Thurs to Sunday farming Uranium Fever and Westek + Fallout 1st.
---
Common sense should tell anyone that Bethesda wouldn't take canceling paid 1st'ers lightly without HARD proof of TOS violations - they just wouldn't f\*#k with their money on a criteria so simple as holding 100k+ of materials. For gosh sakes, they provide 1st'ers with an UNLIMITED scrap box so 100k+ of mats nearly north of 1 year since F1st would be more common than uncommon.
---
I think there are SOME dupers out there who know gosh damn well the b.s. they have their noses up into and are trying to place the blame on Bethesda talking about, "Everyone CANCEL Fallout 1st b/c I gotz banned for having 100k steel!" Bethesda be like, "...and x6 BE Gatling Plasmas, x50 of every Possum badge mod, x20 Explosive Legacy's...."
---
The vast majority who got the ban hammer today got flagged for MULTIPLE offenses. If that is you, it's not b/c you have 100k steel and you know it. Everyone knows it. The same shameless ignorance cheaters use to cheat is the same shameless ignorance they're using to convince you that you're stupid enough to believe their lies of innocence. Cheaters stop bullsh\*tting.
---
Edit to add: Anyone replying to my post with salt is likely a cheater that got banned and will try say they didn't. Everyone else, stay ahead of the clowns.
---
Exactly
---
I‚Äôve threatened to escalate it and they got their asses in gear sharpish because they knew they were in the wrong. I‚Äôve never been forced to actually escalate it yet. Cite your consumer rights.
---
ask for refund then. Fallout 76 doesn't work well from the start and i dont think its change somehow in future.
---
Oof
---
Well I haven't played today to see if I'm OK, but now I'm concerned about that container I looted at the Overseer's house that someone left a pile of plans in that I grabbed and put in my vendor for cheap. That was about three weeks ago and I grabbed them all because I figured the container was a bit obscure and they'd vanish before someone else came across them. Decided to sell them for 30 caps each so low level players had a chance to get something they needed.... And so they didn't sit in my vendor forever.
---
I'll be logging in soon, but if I find out I got banned because I grabbed a bunch of stuff some other player left behind for others to take, I'll be a little pissed.
---
90% of the plans were mounted heads and pretty common crap, so to get banned over some mounted heads I grabbed while looting that someone else may or may not have duped seems a little wrong.
---
I don't follow the whole duping crap and have zero interest in learning how to do it. I'm just playing the game, found plans in the game, took them, learned what I needed and selling the rest for dirt cheap to help out other players.
---
If they detect they're duped items that I grabbed, delete them from my account/inventory.... So be it. More space in my stash, but don't go and ban people  for other people's actions, frig.
---
you know whats right or wrong. NO ONE made you play the game, let alone cheat/exploit. That is 100% on you.
---
That's what I always try. About half the time I can grab the aggro and let her land.
---
this is really what its coming to, eh...
---
That's so depressing that most people don't even bother asking for new things because they Know Bethesda will find a way to completely fuck it up.
---
I got two of fluorescent and crimson , four of cobalt .
---
Seven
---
Never taken? Have you ever purchased any gear from another player ever?
---
Huh didn't know . But thanks for telling me . Not going to get those then .
---
With one hit I will do 5k damage to the Queen with my incomplete melee build in sneak, headshot and power attack. If none of these conditions are met it‚Äôs still 1.2k which is enough to tag.
---
sounds great.I'll start looking for a new camp site
---
Only if they had a far better system in place but Beth is too scared of mob outcries it would bring about to even think of that otherwise FO76 would have better balanced game mechanics and the legacy items would have been deleted or changed by now.
---
I found him roaming Cranberry Bog, just outside the main road entrance to Watoga and he followed me for a while. Then I think he fell too far behind me and went berserk on me.
---
I've tried to threaten them that I will bring it to social media, no use, they are still dragging it. I asked them to bring out their manager, they take that chance to say they have "escalated it", need to wait again. I also mentioned that I will escalate it into a consumer rights case, still not taken seriously. I have seriously lost all the patience I have, is there nothing I can do to force them to resolve this issue? I really feel like they are treating us paying customers like shit. Maybe the next step I will do is try to send an email to Zenimax.

Yes. There's a normal RR garage door that was part of a different bundle.

At least the (non radiant) fetch quests only happen once each though. The same dialogs seem to happen every 2 minutes when you're at your base. Forever, if you want to continue to get the benefits of your companion.

Maybe your homie should stick to single player games

&gt; leaving the game from NW 
---
So this is the reason why some people get their challenges auto completed even though they were not logged in during reset? Good to know, that sucks.
---
Jesus, I‚Äôve never had to take it that far... Definitely try that. Zenimax is Bethesda‚Äôs parent company. The Bethesda Austin Studios people are so god damned incompetent it‚Äôs unreal. It took them a week to fix the dupe that most recently went public. And it took them six weeks to give me a hundredth of the junk I lost in my scrapbox. I got legal advice but I don‚Äôt have enough evidence or I‚Äôd have taken it to court lmao
---
"more than you" that's rich. I don't have to cheat sweetie, I know how to play the game. Most of us do, you know. You should try it sometime!
---
 It's a game, yeah, but this is Bethesda's business &amp; when entitled little f ups 
---
make their own rules, I think it's great that Bethesda drops the hammer. I'm just waiting for their legal team to get their hands on the hackers!!üòÄ
---
Drip üëåüèª
---
Easy fix: make it so that being a conduit is incentivized, e.g. it gives extra rewards like a higher chance at the desirable loot like Fixer plans, and automatic contribution to the IS kill.
---
Same deal for the ore drops at Radiation Rumble.
---
But as we've seen again and again, Bethesda is really no good at using incentives other than FOMO and time gating.
---
This is how you lose clientele. Not only in Fallout76, but with all of the Bethesda games. If I were unjustly banned, and they would respond like that, I would never, ever, buy or play another Bethesda game in my life (legally). And I think a lot of people would feel the same.
---
A slippery slope to bankrupcy or mass layoffs if you ask me.
---
People are their main income. They should treat them as they would like to be treated.
---
Inspect the item at the appropriate workbench and you should have the option to do A "workshop repair"
---
That's a very good way to look at it, man.

Jet is... One of the more complicated items in Fallout lore.
---
When it was first introduced (in Fallout 2) it was both said that Myron invented it, and that it existed before Myron invented it.
---
Fallout 4 obviously had it be a pre-war drug in Vault 95.
---
It doesn't exist in the best Fallout 76 game, until now with the Raider Bot mentioning it.
---
So... Whether it was an oversight in 4 (and now 76), or they're canonising the "Myron was lying about inventing it" (which 100% makes sense for the little bastard) is yet to be fully seen. 
---
I mean, why not include the drug in 76 if they were going to change it's origins? 
---
So, yeah. Complicated.
---
*Workbench repair
---
Speaking of missing emotes, my group up emote is missing.
---
Good catch.  You forget things after a while.
---
you either don't do enough damage (1000-1500 total until she is dead) or its lag. probably the first, however, ONE time I didnt get any loot right when she hit the ground dead. ran around and looted other stuff, after about 2 minutes I passes her corpse and the loot was there. so, might be worth some patience but I suspect its due to too little damage. 
---
turn on your damage numbers in the game settings, and do a rough estimate next time and try to accumulate 1500 damage at least during the fight. 
---
a good tip is to unload everything you got at a fairly close range when she lands, headshots only if possible as she is pretty stationary during this phase.
---
That Uranium Fever bump gets me EVERY time. And I‚Äôm pretty sure it has done for a while... It gives me phantom Mole Miner fears.
---
i see the post was removed. do you still need them made or did you find them all?
---
Man this is getting old. It's pretty ridiculous that you're still dragging this out. I guess you're just not that busy. A Google search doesn't represent a depth of research. You clearly haven't been honest. As I've demonstrated. Ah, so now it's "close enough to". Interesting.  
---
Again, the links you provided are inaccurate and garbage. The first, is just an article written by someone who doesn't really know what they're talking about and are very disingenous. Where were the links to the actual data? There were none. Just them claiming a bunch of figures. As I mentioned to you before, I'm not going to pay $500 for the data. 
---
Second link was a link, to a bunch of numbers. The problem, is that it does not define "gamer" and is inclusive of mobile games as well. Thus providing inaccurate numbers. And on top of this, these numbers were united states only. Which as I'm sure you can at least agree, is not indicative, of all console owners. 
---
It's clear as day that you're no specialist. It's actually getting a bit embarrassing for you now. Linking me to Wikipedia, articles with a ridiculous pay wall or vague data that's too broad yet restricted geographically. 
---
This conversation is over. There's nothing else to add. We're going round in circles. So we're done. And I know you're gonna reply because you'll have to have the last word. Cuz you're immature :P

oh my LORD thank you so much haha, i feel like im going blind every time i play this game üòÇ

Don't need the healing factor anymore
---
I mean, mostly? Because they said you'd be able to do it today.
---
I've no intention of buying ranks, but I figure "this isn't out as advertised" is a pretty good reason.
---
Well, you have to ban over 60% players of the whole game, it won't happen, people dupe, people exploit, use glitches, own duped items, hacked items or hack NW game mode, if you added all them up, you'd end up with maybe 500 players world wide.
---
And if you‚Äôre at a SBQ fight...Chances are pretty good that there will be a tent or two around where you can access your stash
---
isn't it obvious...
---
they take out items from the atomic shop so they can re-add it in the future, it means they dont need to design new shit

Ok. My gamertag is. mark error 404 invite me to a party or join my game.

there is a secret nuka cola door only available if u buy the whole damn nuka cola bundle

Wouldn't need it to slow down time. Just give it it's old effect of increasing your Max AP.

Alright then, hopefully they fix it soon along with the damn fast travel bug
---
Really... I‚Äôll test that out
---
Yeah. If it's a weapon you want to repair then make sure you are at a weapon bench and in the "modify/repair" menu.  Inspect the weapon and then select workbench repair.  Check the bottom of the screen for what buttons to push.  Ps4 equivalents should be triangle to inspect and square for workbench repair.
---
Part that confuses me is what you were doing when you played at launch since repair kits didn't exist at the time as far as I know.  Lol.
---
And for the love of God don't spend money on those kits or even free atoms on them.  Doing scorched Earth will award you a couple improved repair kits every time that repair things to 150 percent instead of 100.
---
that or simple remove legacy weapons which should not exist in first place. Also they should start balancing things not only adding to make even more mess.
---
And yet Anthem is being worked on as we speak to be rebooted.
---
Maximize your character. You can always just make one run to overseers camp and do the three misc objectives and delete it. However I make a character do the opening to Wayward, and do the misc objectives to get one level up, I then run to flatwoods (shorter run then to the wayward from start) then I log off for the day. The next day I do thirst things thirst quest in flatwoods, should be enough for another level, log off. You can get one more easy level by doing the second helpings quest. Ive come up short a time or two and just went and did fertile soil event across the river from flatwoods for the last dab of xp needed. Delete chacter and repeat.
---
If you play on console you'll need to get a whole new system. Your account is linked to a main console. That console has a ID, and any account related to that console will not be able to access their servers.

This is currently a bug caused by server hopping. 
---
The first time the game is booted and you join a server the icons will be correct.

However switch server via social menu or main menu and the icons bug out.

To get them back you have to fully close Fallout and reboot.

Hahaha-haahaha, wait you are serious? Oh no, that's so sad.

I did for the Nuclear winter Increase one Overseer rank

Honestly? Not really. The two packs you get are purely cosmetic (aside from each one giving you a placeable farming ‚Äúplot‚Äù (e.g. the raiders pack unlocks a dumpster filled with dirt) but they‚Äôre quite small and won‚Äôt fit much in. They do have some cool cosmetics, honestly the only reason I bought the raiders pack is because it gives you a half face mask like something out of the Division and it looked cool, plus I had the money to spare. If you have the money it‚Äôs up to you if you like the cosmetics in these packs. 
---
Honestly though, if you‚Äôre gonna spend extra money on anything, let it be a month of Fallout 1st (I think a month is a similar price to one of the packs) because honestly the subscription is game changing. It gives you a camp item called the ‚ÄúScrapbox‚Äù which is a stash box solely dedicated to storing junk, with NO space limit. It is amazing how much space junk takes up when you get to higher levels and have to start hoarding it, whether it be for crafting, building, or repairing (you‚Äôll need a lot of steel and lead to make lots of bullets). Aside from that you also get access to your own private server, which is really nice after you‚Äôve hit level 50 and need resources, because you can go round claiming each workshop for yourself with no competition from other players. It‚Äôs also nice to chill on with friends (I‚Äôm part of one of the largest BoS faction discords and we often chill on a private server together). You get the ability to place a survival tent for free anywhere that isn‚Äôt too close to map locations and other players‚Äô bases, and these are really nice because they contain a scrapbox and stash box (for emptying and sorting your inventory), a bed for sleeping so you get that well rested XP bonus (sleeping for 30 seconds gives you a 5% XP bonus), an instrument to get an AP bonus, and a cooking station for making food. Then on top of all that you get 1650 atoms a month, as well as a bunch of exclusive cosmetics in game.

I realise after reading back through that I sound like a god damn Bethesda sales rep (what have I become...) but honestly the subscription is a worthwhile investment if you plan on playing the game long term, but to be honest you could probably get away with not having it if you‚Äôre just a casual player. Price-wise it‚Äôs actually pretty good if you‚Äôre someone (like me) who likes to get a lot of the stuff from the store because that constant flow of atoms allows you to get a lot of stuff, and the subscription is around the same price as buying that many atoms as a lone purchase lol. A lot of people have stopped their subscription though in a sort of protest-fashion towards Bethesda in response to them taking their time to fix certain problems in the game, which is understandable because they do sometimes seem to focus on making money before the QoL of the game, but since most people are working from home at the moment I imagine it‚Äôs quite hard to fix such a large game when you don‚Äôt have access to the resources you normally would. 
---
Anyway, that‚Äôs some more insight into the ‚Äúspending more money than you technically have to in order to play the game‚Äù part of 76. 
---
TL;DR - if you have the money, buy the packs if you really like the cosmetics in them, but fallout 1st is a better way to spend your money because of the benefits.
---
Can't join on you . Sent you a message on xbox
---
It was fine the first time i put it on. Hard rock abs on top of a fat belly. Then it glitched.
---
You had any legacy weapon in your inventory? Maybe they flagged you for that, you know, because dupers have been duping legacy weapons.
---
Being on line at reset is not the sole cause. Many posts, mine included, have described losing score when logging in hours after reset. I also only play on a private server.
---
It only happened to me once. since then, workshops have been working fine. just wanted to let you know you weren't the only one out there that had this issue.
---
Yeah because its a paradox you see, your game fixed the paradox!
---
Exactly. If I‚Äôm even buying it is at the end of the board.
---
I usually level my main toon to the brink of level up (takes awhile you see as i'm \~550) and leave him there to wait for daily reset. That's one level up for a daily. If it is for a weekly 3 level ups then i just make an new toon and run him to the Wayward to level up (lv3), as it takes only \~6mins for the whole process. Delete, rinse/repeat.
---
Possibly, I‚Äôve got 3 legacy weapons. Two of which were TSE Gatling Lasers like I mentioned in my post.
---
Have they added that feature yet? Because when I went online yesterday I couldn't buy them.
---
BTW I wasn't planning on wasting my atoms on early ranks, like most people I'll wait until the later ranks.
---
What gave you the idea they shouldn't exist in the first place?
---
No honey. You don't look fat in that suit üòÖ
---
Same. Bought the camo suit, hid in a bush with no armor and just an auto combat rifle. Twice someone hid in my bush with me and twice i killed them.
---
Yeah I noticed it the day after it came into gamepass. It is nice to see new players getting into the game. They just need to hurry and level I got caps to burn and I don't wanna fail sqb and encrypted lol 
---
Yesterday I player lunched a nuke at sbq and I was the only person to come. Everyone else on the server was low lvl and like two others were 50 and 100 but never came. I felt bad haha
---
People are getting reported and banned from Live for advertising that they are duping in LFG, I guess M$ is getting involved now as it's on GP.
---
Duping erodes the experience by spoiling the economy fun factor, lessening the 'reward' from grinding, and dilutes the 'challenge' experience for folk in events with so many OP weapons running around. RNG is what it is. Crying about RNG as a justification is non sensical.
---
More active policing for duplicates, hacking, malicious exploits will be most welcome. There is no grey area here. you duped, have duped items in your inventory...sorry. Next time don't cheat/ support the cheaters.
---
This. So much this. Unless you are planning/wanting to buy all the ranks in one sitting, do not buy lower ranks.
---
Without siding, so does those who claim to moraly right... not exclusive to the cheaters...
---
Hmm that'll be hard to explain to Bethesda if you got flagged because of that. I also have a legacy weapon but because I was playing since launch, maybe they can see when you dupe something and when you don't? I don't know, I wish you the best man. Good luck.
---
Because your character is ugly af
---
Wtf is there left to do if you have everything you need, it defeats the purpose of the game, that is what negative effect it has, ridiculous question. The way it has affected me personally is when everyone at the sbq has God guns which then leaves me without a hit (the person that set off the fucking nuke)!
---
I was sad when wastelanders was released and I learned all the gold I‚Äôd been saving was useless.
---
I suppose it‚Äôs anyone guess right now. Hopefully they‚Äôll remove my legacy‚Äôs or something and reopen the account, I‚Äôd love to keep them but if it‚Äôs that or lose my account then so be it
---
Hmm i see where you‚Äôre coming from and I have to agree. Although at the end of the day, if you do get everything you want to get legitimately, you‚Äôre left with the same problem of having nothing to do. I think it outlines how the game severely needs more content beyond just grinding.
---
You should do the Wayward Quest before Morgantown airport. Also check to make sure your gear is near your level and not still level 1.
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek u/CM_Pipboy  
---
This person has a nice little bug report package for you üëç
---
Yeah I wouldn't mind if they erase my legacy, it's just a explosive harpoon gun xD it's fun to use but I consider playing the game to be more entertaining.
---
I think I would rather wait a short while. I suspect there's going to be some very angry people who will be attempting some form of revenge - although the last 'War on Bethesda' was basically a damp squib. 
---
In the long run though I would mind the 4th and 5th slots being dedicated to passive perks just not 'battle' perks. We already have +1 Int/Chr etc and lock picking so how about tiny xp boosts, slow food spoilage, longer chem effects etc that stack with existing?
---
Not true. I know someone that was banned and used a different xbox live account to log in on the console they were banned on.
---
A huge part of the game is trading up to better weapons and armours. By destroying the market first by making caos/ammo/flux worthless for trade and so driving all mid to high tier gear into trade only realms and then flooding the market with genuine god tier and legacy items making mid to high tiers worthless as nobody wants a SS A powerfist when u can get an SS S or a B5050 fixer that u can now get a B2525. So that massively impacts the game. It‚Äôs like a core element of the game.
---
Yeah 
---
Edit: Do you happen to have Xfinity? Because I just happened to notice that my wifi cut out when I have had this issue today. I mean it came back pretty fast (well fast for Xfinity) so maybe it's just an odd coincidence but it could be a connection ü§∑.
---
Did it ruin Fallout 4?
---
You're probably right, there must be some other bug causing it. I just wanted to point out what worked for me so far..
---
I couldn't understand it. 8 weeks to go, is everyone planning on having a long holiday? (talking non-banned accounts of course)
---
i only played to level 15 and kinda just used my stuff into the ground then probably boxed it is my best guess lol 
---
thanks for the heads up tho! i dont plan on spending any more money on this game than i already have (friends and i all got the tricentennial on launch and Oof)
---
I wouldn't like more stars
---
I acknowledge this issue it created, but I was asking for examples outside of disrupting item valuation.
---
Do they use a VPN?
---
Anywhere you want. Whichevwr ones you want. And yeah when you start off theyre pretty nice to pool up on
---
I know 3 people that were banned and they were showing the emails off in our chat like they were something to be proud of and what's worse is they are supposed to be apart of a sub that is against things like griefing and duping but nothing will be done about it
---
And I‚Äôm happy you did. A lot of players want to ignore this issue since it hasn‚Äôt happened to them yet, so I thank you for addressing it even though you‚Äôve been safe so far. It just the root of the bug is different then the last time it happened with the atom challenges. The more voices will get action on fixing it.
---
Try it and find out?
---
Noone duped me an old man winter mask and now im sad :(
---
Um, what is a B2525????
---
Well nothing. But that‚Äôs a huge core of the game. A negative impact on game play is u now have every man and his dog with the ability to one shot everything in the game thus making events not about team work but a free for all to who can get the shot on the legendary!
---
I wonder if him attacking you was why he was abandoned. Like a bug in his code (bug if the robots code in fallout universe not a bug in the game lol)
---
any fix coming for adrenaline?
---
Thank you for the appreciation :) 
---
I do hope bethesda manage to address it and fix it once and for all. At least they added the logging thing that may help them find the root of it
---
Bloodied 25 faster fire 25 less vats
---
Yup, as if Thanos himself snapped his finger and wasted half of Appalachia
---
How many legendary effects are possible in f4 per item? Right. Just a single one. Kill a legendary and you might have the perfect item you want.
---
F76.
---
1. RNG to chance of spawning a legendary
---
1.RNG +2. RNG it has to be a 3 star enemie
---
1. RNG +2. RNG +3. RNG the drop has to be 3*
---
1. RNG + 2.RNG +3. RNG +4.RNG it has to be item you want
---
1.RNG +2.RNG +3. RNG +4. RNG + 5.RNG +6. RNG+7.RNG  The rolles you want.
---
EDIT : Oh and 8. RNG hope that not an other player was at the spot before you and killed all enemies there.
---
EDIT2: 9.RNG the enemie has to be max lvl lol
---
Except we all hate cheaters.
---
Which is ridiculous. They are stopping people from legitimately gaining xp from kills?
---
Its like why? You can farm whitesprings easy enough no?
---
Totally agree. I've been consistently anti-duping and saying repeatedly they should be banned. I'm usually downvoted and replies start "*Yeah, well Bethesda...*".
---
Today it seems to be the other way around.
---
It really would
---
brb, gotta wash my eyes with bleach
---
No, they just used a second xbox live and bethesda account. Although I'm not sure if they were banned yet or had just got the email saying they were being investigated so it's possible that that's why. I haven't heard of the entire console being banned for anyone though and I think that's why people use alternate accounts to transfer stuff to their main.
---
I knew the risk, I did it anyway, got banned, I deserved it, end of storyüòä
---
There were people in the Star Trek Timelines subreddit casually dropping $7000 on loot boxes a month like it was no big deal.
---
That's more than my highest yearly income.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I think too. A fried circuit most likely.
---
Walls became walkthrough for me when this season launched. üôÉ
---
i'd like to see more selection there myself. I've been waitin for the raider vendor and possibly the survival tent skins to come back, not even sure that they will honestly.
---
Yeah like maybe a captain after the bombs dropped rewired him to be his personal body guard only to goof it up
---
Yes it is annoying that every event is getting wiped out in seconds now. I think since the damage is done, Bethesda needs to severely rescale enemies and events once more.
---
Silos produce an infinite wave of enemies. If the xp was any good people would just sit in them all day farming which would also prevent their intended use.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Imagine just banning a load of people instead of having the basic intelligence to make the game enjoyable to grind so less people are inclined to dupe. Swear not a single person that works within bethesda has an IQ higher than 50
---
I got a pretty good weapon a few days ago genuinely and joined a party with some of my regular friends who had made friends with this guy I'd never come across before. After a couple of hours of playing, I mentioned the gun I got and he was like 'hey if you're on tomorrow, can I dupe that gun you have and I'll give you an amazing gun in return?'
---
Everybody in the party went quiet and it was really awkward because we all play legitimately and grind our way through the game. We all expressed our concern and he left. But earlier on in the party, he was asking to dupe things that YOU GET FROM BASIC MISSIONS. It was clear he had not played a lot of the game and didn't realise that a lot of the things he considered valuable were actually just regular items. We all said no and told him where to find it.
---
But it does seriously spoil the fun for everybody else that does play legit because when Bethesda shut down the vendors or the displays, we're ALL affected. I lost so many collectables because of the latest disable, I was so pissed.
---
Stop spoiling it for the rest of us!
---
It goes back into your stash box.
---
You get XP from how long you survive as well as many other factors, (players downed, players killed, AI enemies killed and heavy enemies killed) so if you camp all the way to the end it‚Äôs possible to level up your overseer rank and get the rewards from them.
---
That doesn‚Äôt exist
---
I got the same glitch. I submitted a ticket just to have it on record
---
Don't worry too much about camp placement early on, just build the basics and move it later when you've roamed around a little more.
---
Progress the Wayward questline and early stages of the Overseer. If it starts bouncing you around the map put it to one side for later after you've leveled up.
---
Pick up everything and whatever you don't scrap you sell at stations. They have a daily 1400 cap limit so you can throw a lot of broken or useless weapons at them for example to get things moving. Also join public teams, building (int/xp boost) will likely be most useful. You will also get small boosts from team mates when bonded.
---
The interior of the airport buildings doesn't always allow easy escape if you get stuck in a firefight so stay away for a bit longer until you at least have a full working set of armour and usable weapons with ammo.
---
Or reset the servers to last Wednesday eliminating all the weapons and returning all the ones traded and then going back from that point and banning everyone who used it before it became public knowledge. Gets rid of those doing it for money
---
You should be safe. I believe anything on display, in your vendor, or such is counted towards your stash limit.
---
Quests: see above 
---
Camp: find a place in the Forest that seems nice. Odds are you'll move it, so don't worry too much about it. 
---
Caps: at low levels caps seem to fly out of your pockets. I suggest not fast traveling unless it's far or you're pressed for time, and selling any excess food that's spoiling. Guns and armor should be scrapped for mods rather than sold until you know most of them. You probably don't want to keep more than one hundred of any junk type, so sell your excess.
---
yes it does 
---
limited atomic shop item
---
Funny thing is the serious supers just switch to a different account whereas people that did it to escape a stupid grind system that is completely unrewarding feel like they have no motivation to play the game anymore
---
I got banned for buying items (unsure if it‚Äôs Cus of that but I didn‚Äôt know if they was duped) their fault for releasing a game with bugs and I suffer for playing the game as intended? Ok cool
---
They are not "complaining about people breaking in", they are just throwing them out. It's more like they build a wall, people break through the wall, gets thrown out and then cry when they didn't read the text on the wall saying "don't break the wall" (which is the ToS btw, your friend agreed to it. Legally)
---
Ahh cool I can move without worry then haha thankyou!
---
Thanks! :)
---
Next time you have a thought, just let it go. It deserves to be free, far from you. How is it remotely fair to fuck over everyone like that?
---
I love doing this and I‚Äôm actually disappointed when a camp isn‚Äôt locked. Sometimes I‚Äôll hang around for a few minutes hoping the person shows up.
---
HELL NO! I didn't get banned, but one of my friends just bought the game, is a level 29, and he picked up script next to the Whitesprings station and he got suspended. Like what in the hell? For picking up script out of a suitcase that another player purposely left behind to be gift for another player? How is that worth a suspension?
---
Did people exploit this, yes they did, but who cares? It evened out PVP with everyone getting Legacy Plasmas, and it ruined some scumbags who sold these guns for real money on gameflip (yeah I said it).
---
Lastly, it was Bethesda's vendor bots. It's not the players fault that Bethesda can't get their house in order. I hope everyone signs a petition and gets everything back. What a joke. No bans for Xmas presents, ammo, or any of the other exploits, but now they hit everyone when it gets to a pretty even point? Makes no sense, shame on Bethesda.
---
[Cosmetic DLC is definitely a money squeeze.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce5CDrq4dGg)
---
In no way, shape or form.
---
God-awful game mechanics doesn't justify cheating.
---
If they do that now, I feel like they should unban a lot of people. It‚Äôd be very unfair. Although this is a good idea I haven‚Äôt heard from anyone else yet, they should have done something like this sooner.
---
Nah your right. There not allowed to do that, only Microsoft or Sony can do that. You need to just make a whole new Bethesda account and a new Gamer ID. You have to buy a new copy of the game if you're on PC.
---
Doop? lmao
---
How is fucking anyone over?  Did u honestly believe the b2525 and exploding plasma u got Friday for 20k caps was just a good deal lol. You‚Äôd have lost nothing. Not a thing
---
[They do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcebekI9F7g)
---
If you can‚Äôt do the time, don‚Äôt do the crime
---
Yeah if I type it properly my posts get pinged
---
Completely right, and down votes by fanboy fucktrumpets as usual
---
poidh
---
So placement/time survived matters most in terms of overseer rank (level), lots of people play very passively by just sitting in a bush, that is true; however, I'd say roughly 80% of the time they will just watch you go by and not engage you in any way. The only time they'll attack is either when you are going toward their bush or you fire first.
---
I am horrible at battle royale's. I sit in the bushes in NW and watch people go by, getting nary 1 kill/game. I am able to kill bush campers if I am not camping (even when I am, sometimes we end up a bush apart lol) because they don't usually have good gear.
---
This is for the most part negated if you are in Morgantown, that's the area people spawn in to fight, not many bushes to use. You could give the mode a go, at worst if you hate it but win you lose ~25 minutes of your time.
---
*breach and clear intensifies*
---
Gotcha.  Repairing at the bench is the way to go and later on you can unlock perks that let you repair everything up to 200 percent condition so you are doing less of it. Only downside is having to find stuff like screws, adhesive and ballistic fiber for repairing your stuff but eventually you build up a healthy stock of all that junk.  Can also buy it a lot of the time too from other players.
---
When my vendors are open (which isn't very often) I sell all of that stuff for cheap to help players that might need it.
---
Yep anyone who used the exploit since last Wednesday should be reinstated and just ban those who used it before. We‚Äôd all lose the lovely stuff we got over the weekend but would have the stuff we traded returned. Extend legendary score by a week and it‚Äôs like it never happened. Also get rid of the player base that used the exploit to gain money by selling on black market sites. Win win win
---
So players who never even touched duped items should be punished for something dupers and thier "friends" did? Why?
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
There might be items a few levels ahead they really want now for camp building or such.
---
I bulk everything. Goes very fast.
---
That‚Äôs also a big part of this ban that I can‚Äôt overlook. The playerbase is taking a big hit. One that this game probably cannot afford. On one hand, ‚Äújustice‚Äù is served, on the other, this game‚Äôs lifespan has just been shortened even more.
---
I have been online during the reset every day for the past week, as it is my prime time and I have not had any challenges auto complete. 
---
I always exit properly and dont play NW, so maybe that is why I havent had any issues. I heard other people say it due to having alts, but nobody really knows why it happens.
---
Hmmm that‚Äôs a very low percentage of players. And explain what they lose exactly?
---
PC has had a lot of issues in the past, but not consoles. It's a lot of fun, just be aware if you spawn in a hotly contested area, lag could kill you cause of everyone else loading in and starting to loot before you can even see the world.
---
No ur fine.  They only went after ppl who dooped large numbers of items
---
This.
---
Played since day 0 of B.E.T.A, and they have probably made my game experience better tbh.
---
I'm 99,9% certain my last 3 main weapons I've traded for were all duped, and probably a few of the armor pieces I'm using, and I've enjoyed using them all rather than the shitty drops I got myself.
---
People generally having good weapons makes the queen easier too. Well, to an extent at least. I don't like the impossible hacked weapons, but that's another discussion.
---
Can‚Äôt see it. It survived the ban wave last year and the content coming up plus the influx of game pass players will keep the game moving forward
---
Completely agree. But as in real life people like that will try to justify their rule breaking shenanigans with everything they can. It's always someone else to blame for their own actions. Look, you know the rules and you understand why it's not cool to break them in fact most players dont like cheaters / dupers/ whatever (dont let the vocal minority fool you). 
---
If you do it anyway you should man up and take the punishment or even better man up and dont cheat.
---
You cannot cheat by accident. Oh I'm sorry I just fell on top of my gamepad or keyboard and accidentally duped shit or hacked the servers. Yeah right...
---
However those who get banned in error they should be angry at the cheaters for making the ban wave possible.
---
I knew the tide of opinion would be unfavourable, as this sub is all about the charity. The instant I went against the grain, I‚Äôm sure a lot of people had an image of me cemented in their heads and no amount of reasoned debate will change it. 
---
That said, obviously I disagree that the best course of action would‚Äôve been to be downvote browbeaten into not saying my point of view. Whether people choose to believe it or not is up to them.
---
I wouldn't think the guns matter, you only have two, the 1k? presents, I'd not be so sure really, that seems a pretty unreasonable number to be holding and maybe they will flag that as suspicious.
---
Exp they grinded for the score. Legitimate items they found. Caps.
---
I find this kind of funny since early on when I played, it was a while before I heard about repair kits and I would sometimes run low on scrap. Now with how often people launch nukes and take out the SBQ, I only ever repair using improved repair kits lol
---
I‚Äôll take your word for it bc I just recently came back. Really looking forward to the BoS!
---
The treasury notes are easy to get anyways, which makes the time gating the biggest obstacle to obtain Gold Bullion
---
I have a skinny female character and it happens to me as well. It‚Äôs been like this since release unfortunately. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn‚Äôt.
---
On pc it would be bots farming bots.
---
You mean caps?
---
Well easiest way is to drop as many water purifiers in your camp as you can and collect purified water, which you can sell to vendors (thanks Fallout 4 for the idea). Always sell with hard bargain equiped. And if you can get Green Thumb perk, just collect razorgrain, corn, mutfruit, tato ... etc. They sell for 1 cap each (even if you have hard bargain 3, you may not get higher price). Collect everything bottles, burnt magazines.books, cups ... etc. Sell them without scrapping the junk. This should cover you until you reach level 50.
---
I actually gave all the present away. I think I only have 100 left, I meant I HAD a thousand all together. My bad
---
That's the best of both worlds. Players dont have to play with hacker/cheaters etc, but Bethesda still gets revenue from them.
---
How is furious at all comparable to junkies? Junkies is 50% extra damage and furious increases damage after lots of hits but if I'm not mistaken it still never gets higher than 50% making it entirely useless compared to junkies weapons
---
Holy crap. Do you know any other weapons affected, or just the gauntlet &amp; legacy harpoon? It happens to me sometimes, but not to this extent.
---
Thanks for speaking out considering how this sub‚Äôs been reacting to the recent ban wave. I‚Äôve noticed people doing events that otherwise would have been ignored because they have better weapons now!
---
DOOPED.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm just kinda nervous because from what I‚Äôve read legacy weapons are pretty much guaranteed to be duped and I‚Äôve read people getting banned for owning them
---
Score extend by a week. Caps and items well it‚Äôs a small price. And anyone who played over the past 5 days and found something good and didn‚Äôt trade it for a legacy or top tier fixer must be in the very very very low percentages
---
Yes for the past two weeks ... tried all the trouble shooting suggestions from BGS an MS but To no avail. Ive missed out on a lot of score as a result. Unfortunately, no seems to know what to do to rectify the situation.
---
Got banned don't have any duplicates but I do have alot of legacy weapons aquired in the last week.
---
I remember it not being a total amount held, but gaining a certain amount of hard to obtain items within a certain time period, and that was a few months ago they mentioned that.
---
They were vague on purpose about the specifics, but it only targeted bulk Dupes, not singular ones.
---
Because they couldn't be more broken and were clearly quickly taken out with Bethesda saying that they shouldn't exist..  A tesla rifle should not fire exploding bullets, shouldn't fire any bullets for crying out loud.  I'd like them taken out even though I have a couple. BE laser rifle and BE tesla.
---
Last ban wave took out 1/3 of the server. Games done great since. And with the content coming up it will continue to
---
All the bugs Beth keep adding are just features then... Suddenly it makes sense, we've been getting loads of new content all along!
---
You are wrongly presuming the majority of players are cheating scumbags. You may be surprised that the majority of people are pretty decent, but the shit heads tend to be the loudest and more vocal.
---
OH I'd lose about 50 levels on one character, and 20 on another.
---
 I'd lose the level 50 season progress on my main account and the 35 on my mule account. 
---
I'd lose the countless legendaries I found during the last week. 
---
The caps I made from vendors. I'd lose the non tradeable legendaries I rolled for with modules. Yeah, clearly would lose nothing. 
---
Go stand in the corner and think about what you did wrong.
---
People do the water thing - build tons of industrial purifiers and sell them for 5 caps each. Dont bother picking up plans for 1 cap each? WTH is that idea. That is worse than doing chores.
---
Yep that‚Äôs my plan !
---
I‚Äôm not sure that weapon is even capable of giving someone a headache.
---
&gt; fairest and easiest way 
---
Thanks for the laugh though, made me smile.
---
Personally, I found that knowing the exact health amount where you activate nerd rage then watching the health number in the pip boy when ever I need to bring my health back up works well. If I'm in an event and I die, I'll use a gamma gun and shoot the ground 2-4 times depending on if I'm using any rad-x or radshield. A nice thing to keep in mind is that 10 rads is 1% of your health, so something like toxic water, which gives 30 rads is 3% of your health, or around 7-8 health depending on your max health.
---
yeah
---
No I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm presuming correctly that a huge percentage traded for a top end weapon that was created by the cheats. They lose that weapon. Have what they traded returned and the ones who did the creating get banned
---
What is duping in the context of fallout 76?
---
Thanks!
---
They were crashing servers to dupe items.
---
Explain how it‚Äôs not? Because u lose the plasma gat u traded for????
---
Exactly.  I'm waiting for the last week to see what I need to buy before it expires. No point in doing it now, plenty of time left
---
OK, just dump them then, you may be lucky and disposed of them before Bethesda ran their player inventory scan.
---
Best I would say is 10 k at most the dupes killed the fasnact value
---
Plus for the next 5 days we have 9 challenges instead of the regular 5
---
Yeah it sucks cause I didn‚Äôt know anything about them until I started reading about people getting banned today. :/
---
There are people who used hack for unlimited storage and have 1 million gifts on their character. Your argument is invalid.
---
From what I have seen, dupers slow down the servers with the massive amount of stuff they add in (whatever that might be). I know anecdotaly I've loaded into worlds with higher-level players that have 20+ bloodied 3 star weapons with other various (very good) prefixes for sale, usually around 5000ish caps each, some exact copies of each other (lots of bloodied handmades). Whenever I would go to craft something/open any interface, the game would do 2 things: take slightly longer to load the interface, and do this thing where the game pauses/resumes every 0.5s or so until I exit the crafting bench. When it was paused/stopped, none of my inputs worked, so I had to either spam it or time it when it wasn't paused.
---
I'm not entirely sure if it was the duped items causing this, but I'd always check a few of the vendors anyway and just noticed the pattern of having multiple of 1 legendary prefix for sale.
---
Well it would suck for u. But you‚Äôre hugely in the minority. Most of the player base was trading for Legendarys
---
Or use this  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368)  
---
(Sorry console players).
---
This \^\^\^\^\^
---
Tge fast travel charging I'm assuming is a bug. They messed up the icons last patch. 
---
If you start a fresh client, you get the old workshop icons and free travel to owned shops. 
---
If you quit to menu then rejoin a server, you get different workshop icons and it puts a cap charge pop up when u travel. Doesn't seem to actually charge caps though. 
---
So yeah just started happening after patch 20.
---
Yeah I remember that about PC. It did sound odd that it would be the same on console, but then I realized, as you said, that it would be up to microsoft or sony.
---
This game is completely broken and it not keeps me to stay here event I am not banned!They didn‚Äôt fix this game in two years
---
Also weapons, armor and chems. At level 22 you should be able to easily clear out Morgantown and Wade airports, the jail and Grafton dam. Sell all the guns and junk you get. 
---
Whenever you have more than 5 radaways or rad-x, sell those too.
---
None of the other weapons I currently use are affected by this but it's an easy test, if you are having rubber-banding issues just switch weapons and perform the same test I did.
---
Not my best CAMP build but this was more challenging than I thought it would be. Thanks though! Now, if only we could flatten terrain so grass wasn't growing through all my floors.
---
Oh wow and they haven‚Äôt gotten the boot?
---
This
---
Not only does it look great, but you actually put it next to a road. Take all my upvotes! Well, take one, but take the rest in spirit.
---
Yeah, flamer bash doesn't do anything.
---
This is true. My tip is to save remembering a number and constantly opening my pipboy. It's truly a lazy way of assessing if health changes are needed.
---
so there are 3 players left now?
---
Man, have you studied at Harvard? This idea requires some really complex thinking. Good job mate.
---
I liked my other CAMP much more but I enjoy building and this was challenging for me. The mess with my previous CAMP was I think it had hidden space taken up from scrapped wires.
---
I got banned no duplicate items not lots of legacies on my character. Def cancelling 1st.
---
PC
---
I‚Äôve had this glitch as well in the first week. It should work but it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúbug‚Äù they aren‚Äôt intentional (though fallout/Bethesda games are riddled with them) so having a tantrum saying ‚ÄúI paid for it. It should work‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it so. You now know the solution is so if it happens to you again it‚Äôs your own fault.
---
You're being a condescending shit
---
Will do, thanks!
---
I have a buttload of obviously duped items that I traded for. I even had a laser musket at one point, but I've never been banned and the musket was just removed at one point and my other stuff left alone.
---
Score is extended and so what? I should lose me week progress because of cheaters who can't play fair? You say items earned by legit players are small price... I say accounts of dupers and people who hold duped items are even smaller.
---
If I was Bethesda I would permabanned all people who duped or hold lots of duped items on their account. The one who didn't dupe and got only like one item from a vendor I would rollback to before dupe.
---
I just want more weapon skins, man.  I don't mind them looping the big bundles and CAMP items but all weapon skins, icons, and poses should be available in the AS year-round.  Holiday, event, and seasonal items, I get cycling in and out of the AS, but basic weapon skins should always be available for every weapon type -- even the "junk" weapons.
---
build up water purifiers and sell the purified water to vendors. also collect every meat, cook and sell it. weapons might be better scrapped in the beginning to unlock/learn the mods but they can be sold also.   
---
all vendors share a pool of 1400 caps per 20 hours, it doesnt matter, which one you sell something.  
---
the value of items is connected to your charisma skill, the more charisma you have, the better (capped at 27 afaik). dont skill too much CHA just for selling, use buffs like the hard bargain skill, grape mentats or alcohol which provides +CHA but be aware of addictions you might not want at the beginning.
---
That‚Äôs a relief to hear. Phew. A laser musket??? That must‚Äôve been fun
---
No shape or form.  I believe that they have helped the game.  Made it easier to get legacies,  before ppl were wanting 20:1, nowadays u can either find them in a bag or for pennies in ppl vendors
---
Well mayb someday, but it looks like people only launch nukes for Scorchbeast queen
---
So many ppl wanna kill him... no wonder he's behaving like that.
---
What does it mean to you? Just curious
---
Some supers traded their duped items to unsuspecting players, and now the unsuspecting players are being banned. 
---
Personally though, I can't get tags on the queen/sheepsquatch because everyone is suddenly running god roll guns.
---
They did remove them from the game, that's how they became legacies.
---
Or how about just a not trash inventory system period? It was already bad when Oblivion came out, I have no idea why they keep using it.
---
Oh so you aren't angry at cheaters and dupers? A bit of a suspicious attitude.
---
That's fair. Generally, I'm already in my pipboy to eat food or whatever. I find managing my health the way I do it to be more accurate, but it does take longer with a small bit of number crunching. A gamma gun does work very well as a quick solution for rads, especially during the queen or encryptid.
---
This. We have time. We could buy the missing ranks at the very last day...
---
Combine both and become more powerful than anyone has ever known haha üòÇ
---
I know, but better to get it sold fast than face the possible ban hammer. And again, I had no idea about the value of the gun.
---
If only Bethesda could implement this on all platforms.
---
I do love how loads of people have deleted their trade history lol. I didn‚Äôt say it was perfect. But banning everyone from Wednesday last week who did it seems harsh. If u rolled it back and banned before it was public u ban, as u say a far smaller percentage and get rid of the core of the cheats
---
Valseek, the Community Manager for Beth' Austin commented in the forums: 
---
"Hi everyone,"
---
"The ability to rank up using Atoms during The Legendary Run was planned to begin today, but we are delaying this feature for the moment. We apologize for the inconvenience and should have more info for you in the coming days."
---
"In the meantime, we've added a couple of bonus Daily Challenges for a total of 9 each day this week, until July 20. So we hope you're able to pick up a little extra S.C.O.R.E. along the way this week."
---
"Thank you!"
---
Taking minmax to another level. Take a single rad? Time to reset I guess.
---
If you use the app, there are 3 dots in the top right corner. It says ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù there.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me with blood bugs, sting wings, and floaters, usually have to to close the game and reopen to regain my sight! Seems to have something to do with enemy attacks with visual effects like poisoning and such. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This game does not deserve my integrity. If it had, i wouldnt have dupped the hell out of it
---
Not that large really. My firend got hit and he barely made a couple of guns for his own alts.
---
There must be some othere criteria.
---
all i remember from those quests is spending hours/days trying to get help from another player to complete the multiplayer required parts of it.
---
Did they eventually remove those requirements?
---
Thank you kindly :)
---
If I join a public team at such a low level, wouldn't I cause problems for others?
---
i have got like 5 really good drops in my whole time playing this game lol, duping is necessary because of the rng in the game
---
As a new player (level 38), I'm now worried about accepting gifts/drops from strangers. I don't want to be gifted any duped anything.
---
Last night, I had two level 200+ players in my camp, and they ended up dropping several plans I did not have yet and several legendaries, including a couple 3 star. And I've often come "home" to paper bags and gravestones filled with nice items.
---
Should I be worried about the "kindness of strangers" in this game, especially now with the bans going on?
---
For some context, I'm new to video games in general and don't understand this underground black market that's been going on. I'm just a simple soul who just wants to walk around Appalachia and shoot scorched in peace.
---
P.S. Because this has been bothering me, too: Please don't turn low level players, who don't understand the game yet, into mules or places for you to drop stuff you don't want. We aren't your trashcans.
---
I logged in this morning, just to check. Not had any emails. Both accounts let me log in. Phew.
---
Oh I‚Äôd gone further and wondered if they could just reset the stash and leave everything else like levels and score alone. I doubt what I‚Äôm suggesting is even possibly but it would solve the two biggest problems. 1. The massive amount of created weapons and armour and 2 get rid of the core cheats who were using it way before it was public knowledge some if not most selling for cash on black market sites.  .
---
What kind of argument is that? Everybody knows the rules. If you break them it is your fault. Why do you play a game that you dislike so much to start cheating ?
---
No,it is a weak argument ...it is just an excuse to do something like this (very uncool) and then blame the system for it.
---
2EC is energy ammo after all duuh. Now i'm just curious how many ppl not watching reqs for making stuff.
---
I know a handful of people that right now,  this very second of me turning on my PS4 and see them in game,  have DUPED millions of stuff (ammo, presents, tokens, guns) and they are STILL playing. 
---
They have never been banned once and 2 of them are day 1 accounts. 
---
This ‚Äúban wave‚Äù is a joke and just makes a bigger mockery of Bethesda even more. They can‚Äôt even ban people for something properly. 
---
If they want to come out of this with any credibility then they need to be consistent in banning, fixing bugs, fixing exploits and what not.
---
If you‚Äôre truly friends then just trade or let them borrow it for a while..?
---
It's been data mined and it's all over this sub, I'm surprised you've missed this info. If you still don't believe it do a quick search and see! Cheers!
---
Anecdotal evidence, if that's true then Bethesda must not have a very good system of finding players who have contravened TOS.
---
There were screenshots of exploiters who hit 100 within the first week
---
way 1) grind the hell     
---
~~way 2) buy the ranks for 150 atoms each. its possible since yesterday~~  
---
edit: way 2 isnt possible rn, sorry
---
Exp glitch related to god mode which supposedly has been patched now.
---
That genuinely sounds terrible.
---
Ok so ignoring the drop in value of items, for me everything being duped has made it less exciting for me.
---
You used to get a little buzz of excitement if you found a good roll weapon. Dont get that now, since they're everywhere.
---
Used to get a little buzz of excitement if you found a rare item/plan. Lets be honest - the red asylum dress wasnt sought-after because of it looking awesome, it was because it was rare. Now its not rare, its about as exciting as finding one of the common ones.
---
I liked the little flex when you showed up with an item that was near unique, or if you encountered someone with one.  Now its just "meh" because the item is now common.
---
Whats the point of treasure hunting with maps, if all the things you now find arent rare?
---
Whats the point of running a shop of "rare" items now - you might as well stock missiles and fertiliser.
---
By making all these weapons/items common, they've made them far less interesting
---
No that you say it, I just realised that I currently have no armour on me and am wearing the basic 76 jumpsuit. What would be the best way to get proper gear?
---
I saw one a couple days ago as well. 
---
Theoretically I think its possible, just grinding xp. I think it would take a huge amount of play time though.
---
More likely they used an xp glitch.
---
Hmmm... this way we could make the food machine too from that workshop...?
---
greath write up, its like they're tempting us with leaving the leagacys ingame, they're so rare most of the people only heard about em in whispers, like a glimps of bigfoot. everybody wants to have one or atleast try one out, but most wil never be able to, and then there is this opportunity, yes its an exploit, but this is THE opportunity for the regular joe to get his hands on one, ofcourse its gonna be exploited, thats human nature, the game is supposed to control what happens, but the code is such a mess that shit goes wrong the whole time, this time the player can exploit that to his advantage,... so yes, alot, if not most, will. and for all the times the game code screws up in the players disadvantage,.... what... we just have to lay there and take it? bugs that are in the game for so long, and dont get fixed, while they gladly keep taking our money for 1st and atoms.... double standard
---
Not only there are innocent people who don't even know a dupe existed and would have their week wiped. But it would also wipe a week of the season....and you'd have a riot.
---
They have not enabled buying ranks yet
---
Which is still their own fault for cheating...they should be banned and I hope permanently. Because by what you said they do this because they dont like the game anymore. It's not like they would be sad for being banned,right?
---
No but sarcasm aside , most people here find the game enjoyable. Most people who play MMOs always want to find a shortcut to do shit faster. ***No matter how polished the game would be cheaters would always blame something outside of them for their lame crap***
---
People still having millions of items in their stashes over a year and this guy above thinks they are running "inventory scans"? Hilarious.
---
Yup, I hate them
---
Thanks for the advice. Does the cost to move your camp increase the more you do it?
---
I don't dislike the game... I dislike the disgusting obvious tricks the developers put in the game to trick people into buying first memberships, trick them into buying second accounts for storage and keep them playing a game that is very fun but has no good repeatable endgame content in the hope that one day they will get the weapon they want which is like a 0.0001% chance. If you are not intelligent enough to understand this that's not my problem, carry on being a mouth breathing fanboy :)
---
Not if u extended the season by a week. As for progress throw in another dbl exp weekend. Minor things to fix a huge issue.
---
I wish that were a legit part of the game.
---
It'll deal with the current dupe, but what about the one before  that, and the one before that, and...? There's been several. It's not a new phenomenon just something that is more widespread now that the theres more locked and legacy items in the game. 
---
Personally I think a system rollback is a very very bad idea, especially with an influx of new player  - 'hi, welcome to FO76, thank you for a week of hard leveling, you are now Level 1 again"...
---
Yeah, but getting that 15 min after reaching lvl 50 vs weeks or earning it? Lamo
---
You see, you are still presuming guilt in everyone. 
---
I have never traded and never cheated, I know that must seem impossible to you but really, not everyone has the inclination or time to cheat in something as unimportant as a video game.
---
Most people just play the game for fun as it was designed, regardless of all the bugs etc.
---
You act like it was the first dope in the history of gaming. 95% of people who play online games know what duping is. Duping = cheating and you can be banned for it. Why should Beth give a second chance to dupers if they break TOS of the game?
---
Welp this is a sign boys the game is know fully dead. My last words is fuck this game and the system. Hope the system gets lit on fire. üëç
---
Mouth breathing fanboys enjoy being fed Bethesda's faeces... who knew?
---
This is what people don't understand - Disagreeing with a system doesn't give anyone right to break it. You may think whatever about the design of the game. You may(wrongly) think that game drops are designed after gAcha toys. You may even think that there's an ugly goblin sitting in the server room who assigns bad drops only for you. 
---
But in the end whatever you think about it, it doesn't warrant breaking the systems in any way. Just like in real life, disagreeing with laws isn't an excuse for breaking them. And that's what the dupers only have - and excuse for their shitty behavior. Because they wanted to dupe in the first place and then just found the excuse. Normal people don't do that. They either accept the system as flawed or they nope out of the game...
---
I‚Äôm one of those in the Thunderbird camp as well. I posted my thoughts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g55bku/very_curious_about_this_giant_dead_bird_at_seneca/fo1uni4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). I think perhaps we‚Äôll get more info when the BoS arrive to nearby Atlas and start exploring there.
---
From what I‚Äôve read it seems to be a mixed bag, but I don‚Äôt know. A lot of people who did the act seem to be getting hit, not sure how many who just have run into those items have been hit too
---
First real argument. Yep that would be a big problem with the new player base
---
Nah don't worry. It's just his twin brother Feckett.
---
Good thing you got him and not his third twin named Fuckett.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm presuming correctly 
---
OK as you like, time will tell.
---
Peace... out! üëç
---
"a very low percentage' never duped or used duped items? Wheres your evidence? Are you really saying that basically all players are cheats?
---
I'd assume it vanishes. Just like every other currency in game after you hit the cap
---
We badly need a mute option for Collectrons. Even if they‚Äôre not annoying at first, the endless repetition of lines drives you crazy within a few weeks. I liked the utility of having the communist Collectron in my camp, but unless I mute all NPC voices in the game then I can‚Äôt stand being there for long. 
---
I guess you could add allies to that, as well, seeing as their constant waffling doesn‚Äôt seem to be on Bethesda‚Äôs radar.
---
and his cousin Sukett
---
They are the people with no impulse control.
---
ie. The kid who ate the 1 marshmallow now instead of waiting a minute and getting 2...
---
Todd uses it to line his pants for that extra support and comfort.
---
Nothing. Score doesn't do anything when the board is complete
---
The trade forums over the weekend?  People dropping stacks of legacy‚Äôs and top end fixers.
---
What platform are you on? If you're on PS4, I have some stable cobalt flux you can use.
---
You're wrong. Just because you don't get it doesn't mean it brings nothing. Maybe it will getg someone to wonder why it is relevant and then look it up. Thus, ya know, LEARNING something.
---
But grats on slamming something on the internet you're not fond of.
---
Yes ,of course ,insult my intelligence thats how you convince people who disagree. That is very intelligent.
---
Because the game is so unrewarding in your opinion (I disagree and I dont play for hours on end,it's mental) you are willing to excuse cheating and you're questioning my mental capacity. I find it amusing.
---
Oh no you insulted me again. Oh the humanity.
---
Without Bloodied builds you‚Äôd fail the Scorchbeast Queen every time! üòÜ 
---
I run Bloodied in three of my characters and I have a good time! Two are melee, ones mine and ones my gf, it‚Äôs not as easy as you‚Äôd think to run Bloodied, constant changes in the environment can affect your character so you have to adjust and adapt. 
---
Don‚Äôt hate Bloodied, but people profiting off selling weapons on EBay!
---
No, I believe it's a flat 40 caps now. The highest I ever paid was 140 over a year ago.
---
Or his uncle Cuckett.
---
I‚Äôm not even sure they do what I‚Äôm suggesting. Just clears out the weapons and gets rid of the cheats. Win win
---
I didn't know what duping was until I read this post! I have been gifted or picked up stuff people dropped with multiple plans, etc. I thought it was just high level players being generous! I hope I am not banned because of it!
---
You don't need the legacy items to play the game. They've been made unavailable for a reason, you know.
---
This is just another excuse to cheat.
---
They look the same, I'm on PC in Europe. Are they empty where you are?
---
Furious Combat Shotgun is decent. Up the range and with points in perception consequent VATS hit like a truck.
---
Junkies good too if you go that route.
---
Explosive is best for easy crippling. Only use mine for Rad Rumble though. Otherwise Furious with enforcer makes bigger enemies / tough ghouls a breeze.
---
I see. Then I will not have to worry about moving my camp too many times.
---
Yawn. I stated some valid points and this is the best you can do ? Heheh ,that is cute.
---
Thanks for the confirmation anyway.
---
Lost track of how many times they've 'fixed' godmode
---
The past five days you‚Äôve not traded at all. For anything. U just rely 100% on drops in game?  Sorry I do find that very very hard to believe
---

They knew the challenges when they promised it though, they didnt promise it day 1 :-)

There's no way around it. Also, aquaboy is endurance not charisma.

Nice roll. I had got something similar back in the day and I'm sill kicking myself in the ass for putting it in my vending machine.

---
Let's not forget they knew what was involved when they promised it. They didn't promise it at release. They knew exactly what it would entail yet they promised it anyway :-)
---
One of them is synth but you will never find out which one...
---
The more people that have those broken magical weapons,  makes it harder for those without to get drops,  specifically  SBQ.
---
I have never traded in game or on trading subs, I don't even know how. All my gear is from drops in game or bought from a player or robot vendor. I run about in Lego armor and my one good Handmade a basic 1\* bloodied cost 12k from a player vending machine. 
---
It's all I need. People who have god rolls of everything must find the game pretty boring.
---
What's the challenge. I'd much rather read a book or go for a walk.
---
Sorry mate. Don‚Äôt no why that isn‚Äôt working.  Maybe try a different item to put it inside or if you can try sinking it into the dresser.. when I go on fallout in a bit I will take a look and see how I can get it to work for you..
---
Legendaries should not exist.
---
Most likely they used the xp glitch.  I know several people that finished it the first week.
---
wait who said it was like going to jail
---
I was afraid of that,  looks like I'll be staying a Bush wookie and not a water wookie.
---
Thiccc
---
It moves to an ethereal plain hovering eternal between score and zero.
---
Although its not been officially stated to my knowledge, its a good bet that each season will start afresh and existing points will be wiped.
---
Quad double barrel are pretty fun. Boomboomboomboomboomboomboomboom!!!
---
i love your logic.
---
purified water and hard bargain perk (x3)
---
I shell 200 p.water/day = 1000 caps/day
---
Crashing servers. Vending Machines / Display Cases being taken down for long periods of time. New items being locked behind time gated currency.
---
Then u traded. If u find a top end legendary, certainly in the last few days in a vendor it‚Äôs a duplicate item 99% of the time. It wasn‚Äôt just fixers and legacy‚Äôs it was armour. Clothing. Melee and ranged weapons. And I‚Äôll also suggest that if you genuinely play the way your saying your in a very low percentage of the player base.
---
Regardless, thanks for sharing, gave me a good chuckle.

Counter point.
---
Sorry but this is bullsh**
---
I can see 4 people on my PS4 list that duped millions of stuff and I do mean millions. Ammo, presents, tokens and weapons//armor and guess what? They are STILL playing in game. 
---
Bethesda can‚Äôt even get banning people right, let alone fixing stuff.
---
Only thing they ruin for me is some public events.
---
It is possible with a lots of grind, little sleep, and plenty of xp boosts.
---
But there's also been known glitches that will get you there in hours with the first I heard of around day 3 which is obviously a Flag that something was amiss.
---
Still greyed out for me
---
Unpopular opinion, but bloodied builds seem so boring
---
I think I'm around 25... I work too much to play every day so I'm not even worried about finishing it.
---
Might be from server hopping a lot, with the new logging feature they added it‚Äôs not that much of a stretch
---
Try clearing cache and restarting console. sorted my connection issues last week.
---
Nice! I won my first one like that too, just hiding till the end.. it was down to 2 of us, the other person ran out into the final circle naked and made me chase them round with my combat shotgun.. it was quite surreal.
---
The only reason they banned this wave of dupes was that there was a dupe before this one that used the EXACTLY SAME strategy (but with using hacks). They found so they started to give some bans before. With this dupe, they already knew how to track it, not that they ran some super alien IQ9999 scan.
---
I did 3 levels last night in regular play on a level 251 (now) why would you need to ??

I was hoping to have a chub n tuck. Vajajay is just a bonus.
---
If you just store them they go back into stash. Displays or vendors are the same.
---
If you want to avoid this then before moving, place down a single foundation, separate from any other structure. Move any vendors/displays onto this foundation. If you run out of room simply build another single separate foundation and place rest on. 
---
Build a wall on one to place any weapon racks you may have as well.
---
Now you can move your camp. 
---
When you go to rebuild at your new location, all the individual foundations with displays/vendors are separate blueprints that can place down easily. Just place down and move the displays to where you want them. They will be fully stocked/items on display.
---
Crashing servers and Vending Machines / Display Cases being taken offline for long periods of time didn't affect you?
---
I just started playing, and I‚Äôve earned roughly 6 ranks already, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need to even buy ranks
---
Buying legendary wedding rings won't get you banned unless you purchased thousands of them from a vendor. Remember Bethesda can not track where items end up ( a mule duping God tier weapons/ straight up hacked gear to be then sold to other people is completely untraceable on their part  ) the only thing they can see is a full item inventory list of your character and how frequently you obtained them. The people who are getting banned are the people with over 100k of anything considered "rare" within a 30 day period of time. So all the people you know who buy hacked gear and only buy hacked gear most likely wont get touched since nothing is flagging their character, that is unless they get dozens of reports from other players then being banned is a possibility.
---
They convert every point into a gold bar and for every 100 bars u get a genuine one posted to your house. Keep on grinding
---
&gt;but not consoles
---
&gt;starting to loot before you can even see the world.
---
Just double checked my numbers
---
24k in a team
---
23k alone
---
You‚Äôve read the book lol
---
Probably not the items themselves but the presence of the duplicating players actively plying their trade on that server.
---
XB1, and not too sure it's virgin media which to my knowledge is the best in the UK
---
Yep same issue for the past two weeks .... frustrating!
---
That's very unlikely. Considering how i play every day since it came out and constantly grind xp. While using several buffs to increase earned xp i'm nowhere near rank 100. Only way to get to 100 is through cheating.
---
I was hoping for a bit more specific advice but thanks nevertheless.
---
tend to play solo in a private world so no.
---
Will remember this in future, thanks mate
---
I dont bother actually getting the ore or sorting out the miners.. I just sit by the entrance till the end, you get the rewards regardless of how well you. Easy 3 t-notes and a nice 6 minute break to refill my coffee, pet the dog and scratch my balls.
---
dc, omw, crazy guy, &amp; raven are the only ones worth 10k+ potentially
---
Good choice ;)
---
It‚Äôs XP grinding with game mechanic but it‚Äôs time consuming n I deemed not worth the efforts
---
Valid points my arse
---
Help me out here I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with the ammo converter? Makes ammo by replacing ammo? ü§î
---
Most of the "bans" going out now are only temporary suspensions.
---
But if you can hide them, who will Bethesda sell those fancy backpack skins to?
---
I don't get the referance. Oh s\*!t I said referance. I mean I totaly don't understand the anything about the picture (honest)
---
Did they really dupe with their main accounts?
---
game set and match, havent seen that.  
---
sorry and thanks.
---
Nope... I don't use display cases,  vending machines doesn't bother me cuz I only check them out when I'm at max caps and even then I'm only buying plans.  Server crashing is a norm now.  Name a single time when the servers haven't crashed
---
I can‚Äôt even trade anything when literally everyone is willing to buy and nobody is willing to sell, BECAUSE THE CURRENCY THAT HAS BEEN RUNNING THE ENTIRE FALLOUT SERIES FOR A DECADE HAS NO VALUE ANYMORE
---
Random question, do you have Spectrum as your internet provider?
---
you can simply craft some by yourself and scrap them.
---
I never duped because I'm paranoid... But the bans are bullshit and here's why:
---
This dupe was just too easy to do. Anything THAT easy is a real stretch as a ban worthy offense. The bans are just Bethesda's way of avoiding responsibility.
---
It's one thing if you have to go into God mode, capture a workshop, build 47 stacked punji traps, 61 stache boxes, 38 welcome mats, fast travel 29 times, and rocket jump 100 feet while shooting a gun with a fire rate of 250.
---
But this dupe? Guys, some people are confirmed to have done it by accident. Anything so stupid simple, Bethesda needs to take it on the chin, own up to it and fix it. If you get caught with 100 BE Gat Plasmas, okay, you might deserve your ban. But some people have claimed they were banned for simply owning duped items.
---
With so many newbs arriving because of game pass, how many of them even know what they have? How many people just showed up to a camp giving away goodies or bought a legacy from a vendor? Very dangerous for Bethesda to just wave a ban wand. I truly hope they only banned the biggest offenders, because this is mostly on them for letting this get past quality control.
---
Focus on the ones that have an exclamation point on their event icon and let you travel to them for free.
---
haha get fucked
---
Looks like he can choke hold a deathclaw!
---
&gt; super alien IQ9999 scan 
---
Can we get this in-game, sounds awesome.
---
To be honest I have no idea, Bethesda will do what they will, I'm not involved just want to bumble about the game and kill some Corona time.
---
At least 4 of my friends got banned. üôÅ
---
Well there are different types of events, I would just try them and see what you like.
---
Some are escort missions.
---
Some are defend a position.
---
Some are retrieve.
---
Some are hunt some creatures.
---
Some are just unique.
---
I would say just pay attention to the reccomended level so you don't end swarmed by joing an event meat for higher levels, or be ready to run if you're overwhelmed!
---
Some people love some events while others hate the same event.  It's a matter ok f just trying them to see what you like
---
Why do you think we ended up with a new expansion where all of the gear is character locked behind gold bullion?
---
Duping and RMT and cheating affects gameplay development.
---
Ban every mother fucking last one of them.
---
I thought so too until a found a (bloodied/10% dmg while aming/15% faster reload) Tesla Rifle. Now I wonder if I'll ever be able to play normally again.
---
I heard because of the dupes the value has gone up because people are getting banned from having it.
---
That's what I was thinking... thanks for making this post.
---
I think every time I've ever seen someone on here preface something with "honest question" or "genuine question" it's obviously fishing for a specific answer.
---
Fuck yeah, this is bad ass!
---
It's a visual bug introduced with Patch 21 the game doesn't actually take any caps upon fast traveling.
---
My 1\* Bloodied handmade was purchased about three months ago from a player vending machine, I didn't realise you included player vending machines in the 'trading' category.
---
And yes maybe I am an outlier. I'll back out of this convo then, I really have no idea what's going on, hope it doesn't break the game too much.
---
All the best üëç
---
Exactly, you either one shot everything or do very high dps, very boring
---
Nope, just genuinely looking for people‚Äôs opinions. Have seen a lot of good points on here regarding getting non-dupers banned, making it harder for people to get last hits, crashing servers, etc.
---
And to you. See u in the wastelands
---
It‚Äôs very possible to be at level 100 legit at this point. I‚Äôve been watching a Twitch streamer almost daily, and she is already at level 85 or so because her build and play style is meant to grind it out as fast as possible. She‚Äôs also skipped several days. 
---
Given that, like I said, being at 100 already is very possible. But sure, cheating is also a thing
---
I really like the instigating bow. With one perk into archer I can usually land 800 ish with a sneak headshot.
---
Get new friends. Ones that don't do stupid shit.
---
No im based in Egypt have a different ISP. My theory it‚Äôs BGS server side as I have done all trouble shooting from BGSs and Microsoft with no solution. I have even opened up all ports the router. My opinion - their servers are fatigued and/or not enough of them to handle the (was) increasing player base into the game. But I could be wrong. Just wished someone with some expert knowledge would come up with solution. Onwards and upwards as I have started playing other games againüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
craft them and scrap (craft level 5 for low cost)
---
You‚Äôre wrong. There‚Äôs a twitch streamer who is almost there. She‚Äôs skipped a few days of playing too
---
This is a very good point I didn‚Äôt think about, thanks for sharing!
---
Comparing yourself to a Vietnam War veteran is actually disgusting and you're delusional.
---
No one‚Äôa doubting that, it‚Äôs BGS‚Äô absurd pricing that is the issue. Game should have been half the price of a AAA game at launch and FO1st is too expensive for its benefits.
---
They used to be a fallout 76 players like you until they took a fixer to the knee.
---
I didn‚Äôt know they were not just cosmentic.
---
I play rifleman, as I prefer to sit on a rooftop and stealth snipe enemies. But I also put some points into Strength so I could a) have the carry weight. And b) switch to a heavy weapon to fight the SBQ in a more satisfying way. Moral of the story choose a perk that best suits your play style but don‚Äôt forget perks are pretty easy to exchange at a moments notice.
---
Your response is exactly the kind of response I was hoping to get. I've been absolutely frustrated for the past hour or so just trying to get the thing to work. My friend and I are huge fallout fans and we knew the game wasn't perfect but we were at least expecting it to let us leave the vault. 
---
Man, you can't have anything nice in a postapocalytpic world.
---
Yes, he should throw away potential years of friendship because they copied an item in a video game.
---
Nah, chances are they were just being nice. The higher level players are generally pretty cool and like to help out new players. They probably have so many legendaries that they just wanted to offload some weight and give you some scrip. As for the plans, if they know them, most of them are worthless to them so they just help out new players who probably don‚Äôt know them. You won‚Äôt get banned for picking them up. Unless it‚Äôs an insane amount maybe.
---
Edit: by insane amount I mean like 100+ of the same plan. Or if it‚Äôs scrap, anything in excess of 10,000+ I would be wary of.
---
I'd be amazed if they added pet commands, though I would assume they are talking about tamed creatures. I love my tamed Megasloth, and being able to give it commands would be awesome, even if the commands are very basic so you can't do anything too crazy. I'd love to have a way of stopping your creature from wandering around with a simple command. Doubt it'll ever happen though.
---
Yep. There's NO valid excuse for cheating. None. Nothing. Nada. Nichts. Nic...
---
Whatever you may think of the game and its systems, it's not valid reason for duping. If you feel that the game systems are so bad that you feel the need to dupe, then tell to yourself that you are not an asshole and step away from the game.
---
If you feel that the game is bad and you still need playing, then the game is actually not that bad or you are an asshole who just needs an excuse to cheat and dupe.
---
Please stop duping or you might get banned lol
---
Agreed across the board.
---
*waiting on agent*
---
2 months my ticket was on that, about atoms not being deposited. They even tried closing the ticket, due to it being "duplicate ticket", which it wasn't.
---
Oof, this reminds me of when I first played around launch time and found a golf bag with 5000 Nuka Cola inside. I drank them all for the caps and I was so irradiated. Felt really guilty after as well.
---
Screws and lead.
---
Lead and steel, there are people still too cheap to buy ammo for 1 cap and will buy your junk to make their own
---
Ballistic fiber must be up there
---
"impossible" items is a different story. If you are in possession of items that are not "possible" in the actual game world.. yup, a ban is def ok here. (Talking about Wedding Rings with AP, clean Mr. Fuzzy costume  and such). 
---
Different thing when it comes to weapons bought out of a vendor machine. Well you could guess: Yea that is a duped weapon, but in general, you don't know really, so why should they ban you. (Different story if there are 10 b2525 fixers in the vendor and you buy them all :D) ... 
---
Well, in case of doubt when you've bought something out of a vendor, tghe first thing i would do...remod the complete weapon, give it a paint, so the chances that there are similar weapons is lower ;) Not sure which mechanisms Beth uses to identify dupers, but the most effective way is to have item ids that are unique to that specific item.. et voila. ...
---
Yep That‚Äôs one of the rarest ones ü§£
---
My unyielding ss armor is legit and my BE fixer is a drop from the purveyor. Stop sniffing the smell of your own farts. You're not a war hero or robin hood. You are and always will be a cheater.
---
If you were rightfully banned, though, stop crying, eat your ban and go get fucked. People like you ruin MMOs.
---
Yes I‚Äôm on pc, thanks for the info!
---
Except the people who have them get to keep them.
---
To me that's cheating.
---
This is just evening the playing field.
---
I'm not here to change your mind, just saying there are legitimate uses of the dupe glitches.
---
It's still cheating that I can agree, but you need to understand that there is LITERALLY no other way to get these items.
---
So... when all other options are spent, rules have to be bent.... a little.
---
Not much, just enough to get an explosive flamer through the bars.
---
Not the case in this wave at all.
---
Good to know, thank you
---
Oh man I won't be able to sleep tonight thinking about your suffering
---
 *sobs*
---
10k sounds about right... I have it and the raven. I personally wouldn't go lower than 10, probably would list for 15k or trade for something I deem worth 15k. 
---
Old man winter is the rarest.
---
Yeah its not a great system.
---
Honestly I've had more success as a Bush wookie. The water that's deep enough to be useful is pretty limited. While it's nice to have 90% of the time you have to be on land
---
Even without exploiting and stacking xp buff and having the ability to mindlessly grind xp all day from your parents basement.  I can see it being possible.  I work and play a few hours a day until my dogs had enough and I‚Äôm 37 in the season.  Move points to intelligence and unyielding helps a lot
---
Ok edgelord
---
Gonna pull those from my vendor asap üòÇ
---
This üëÜ
---
bullshit post
---
So the extra dailies are only for a week? Damn, that sucks.
---
Bruh you couda got so much
---
Love the answers so far. üòÇ
---
Ps4 and xbox accounts too as the money go through microsoft and sony hands
---
he got banned.
---
I've no idea, I presume we'll know more in regards to everything going on Tomorrow in ITV
---
I‚Äôm not a gauss user, but A nice tip I have is just selling the gunpowder, lower lvls and .50 cal users will eat that stuff up
---
BULK PLASTIC, BULK LEAD, BULK STEEL, Ballistic Fibre
---
or if you endgame capable:
---
Stable VIOLET FLUX
---
Stable CRIMSON FLUX
---
are the most sought after.
---
Still to come across a vendor  who I will say is BOSS.
---
 High Radiation Fluids for sale. LEGEND!!!
---
False positives happen in every game banning the cheaters. It's the nature of things. If they toned done things as low to not have any false positives, they'd miss the overwhelming majority of cheaters. Anyone who studied computer science (and specifically artifical intelligence and methods of recognition) knows that there's always tradeoff between false positives and false negatives. You cannot lower one without increasing the other.
---
So false bans will happen. But they are not as frequent as some posts here will want us to believe. My experience from other online games is that when someone makes a drama post about their wrongfull ban, they are most likely the cheater. The people who have the audacity to cheat usually have the balls to pose as the innocent on reddit and make big drama posts.
---
I don't really keep up with any of this stuff so didn't know it was even a thing that people were doing. Will I get banned for buying mounted heads for my camp from a vendor like 10-30 caps each. He had loads of them of each type or is that normal. Just a man trying to make his camp wall not look empty dammit lol
---
It all gets transfered to Pete hines's account sine he prefers(preferred?)to play solo
---
Not just with the new player base but with everyone.
---
You are advocating for a 'Punish the many for the crimes of the few' solution which would do nothing but piss off the legitimate players - and yes there are many, including some that at first glance seem OP. 
---
You need to quit with the 'every legendary is duped, every player with a legendary a cheater' nonsense as its based on supposition and speculation. I've played 1000+ hours and have found or rolled every single weapon or armour piece and done no dupes or deliberate glitching. I can assure you I am not alone.
---
Crafting and scrapping is the best way to learn mods. If you just need a gun modded you are best off asking someone to do it for you. I can do it if you want
---
Or you can go to the sub that shall not be named and ask over there if you want a bit more security in the person modding it
---
I want to collect the bears but I always scrap them because in a doofus. A separate container or being able to flag them as unscrappable would definitely help.
---
I don't think people should buy Fallout 1st, since the state of this game does not warrant rewarding Bethesda with any more money, but making a claim about "disgusting obvious tricks" they use to sell Fallout 1st is laughable. They are pretty clear about what the package offers. There's nothing about the design of the game that forces people to buy it. I move a *lot* of things in and out of my stash box, and not once have I even considered paying for the optional subscription. I've even criticized a couple of my friends who did. The lack of mechanics that force you to buy 1st also extends to cheating. There's no excuse to do it. If you hate the game, stop playing it.
---
Flux of all types (but especially violet, crimson and cobalt), acid, lead, steel, possibly screws. A lot of them can be lucrative, if you price them cheap enough. I always buy when I see cheap adhesive, copper, oil and others that I might need to make serums in bulk. I don't buy stuff that's too easy to pick up, like wood or cloth.
---
At some point, you stop needing junk to make weapons or mod them, you have everything in the thousands. But you still need ammo, so unless you're melee, you probably farm or buy cheap acid, lead or steel when you see it.
---
For the ones where 1 cap each doesn't make sense, bulking them allows you to sell them cheaper (1 bulk steel has 30 steel in it, and you can sell it for 20 caps each, which makes it more likely to sell fast).
---
Thanks I'm going to do this. Might make a marker for 40% as well!
---
Hey I got [this](https://i.imgur.com/hzvyTvy.png) for you in recognition of your sacrifice.
---
Dude, I snatched up a paper bag with 30+ stealth boys and a couple other things. Probably ought to ditch those instead of using/selling them. Idk if they were duped (I'm not sure if they're hard to make, tbh. Maybe they're legit.) but I really dont feel like taking the risk.
---
I‚Äôve said neither. In fact from what I‚Äôm suggesting it would only punish the duper‚Äôs and not the people who used it since it publicly broke and it was also get rid of all the duplicate items. Unless u honestly believe the b2525 fixers and legacy‚Äôs of the last four days were all legit?
---
Are they silent when idle at least?
---
That's why I specifically stated that this trick is for console players. We can't use mods.
---
Like formula 1 and Nascar...
---
Get new friends.
---
Oh you logged on my account and duped a weapon I looted in the burrows yesterday. Cool.
---
No problem man. I love this game but seriously it's like one joke after another with this company and nobody is laughing.
---
High radiation fluid.  I‚Äôd buy for a stupid amount. I love going into nuke zone and end up with 50 hardened mass, 20 glowing mass, 1 high radiation fluid
---
To compare dupers to Vietnam Vets is offensive.
---
Dupers are no heroes, nor Robin Hood. They abused a game glitch, against the TOS, for personal gain. They flaunted their rule breaking. None of your points are valid.
---
FYI my build was complete without buying or duping a single thing.
---
There is no valid reason for duping in a game like this. Take your ban and enjoy it.
---
Try blueprinting your camp, do it in pieces if you have to.
---
Test your blueprints at a workshop with cheaper resources. Very often there are problems with the blueprint system and this is the only way to know if you‚Äôre blueprint can be truly placed again somewhere else.
---
Yeah, it's kinda baffling that after all these years, Bethesda still hasn't implemented a decent inventory system in it's games. It's especially bad when you're talking about an unpausable game like FO76, where you may end up scrolling through endless lists of items while a Deathclaw drags your ass around.  
---
Anyway, try out the BetterInventory mod with something like Kit's Killer Strings (also a mod) and it helps a lot.
---
Well... they can sell invisible "Chinese stealth backpack" skin.
---
Bethesda know how I got it. That's why I'm still logged in to the game.
---
But previously, yeah.
---
That‚Äôs a wall of text my friend. 
---
Break it up a bit to make it easier to read.
---
This. The WEEKS of no player vending or display cases is horrible.
---
I like shopping at vendors &amp; visiting cool camps. And also displaying cool stuff I find.
---
I would love it if they just add monthly challenge like kill 1500 scorched for 5000 score
---
You should know dupers killed my parents, but also brought them back to life, then killed them again. They then gave everyone in the game a single duped magazine and 99.9% of the playerbase was banned for life.
---
Sorry tou got banned and then rambled I guess?
---
thanks but the rmt market is still going good and it didnt crash one bit. the last time it crashed a bit for me was when the artillery dupe was gone and that was actually good because a weapon went up from 2$ to 40$. i still be out there selling handmades and legacies to idiots for 40$ a piece
---
Who cares if they did? They bought the game with their money, let them play it however they want.
---
I almost shat myself when my lvl 20 character tired to clear out that place. I was hiding in the hallway when I saw the wndigo for the first time. The organ music in the background really made it feel I was in a horror game.
---
‚úä
---
What did happen to the mutation? How did it break?
---
Yeah, instead you technically drop everything.
---
I somehow managed to read through all of that and I honestly have no idea what you are trying to say.
---
What about if I add the bean splitter. Will it make it better or should I not touch any mods for it?
---
Not going to lie. I really enjoy reading posts from people who got banned for duping. This is the easiest MMO anyone will ever play, I‚Äôve literally seen a person solo SBQ with a rolling pin. But you needed 28 god roll fixers to be good?
---
I think as a small stand alone its a great item but I wish they'd give us a clean version where the frame wasn't bending off the roof. That or either a bundle with the tools to make our own such as doors, windows, walls etc. Or a standalone recreation of the garage from 4 that we see in the menu. It seems smaller then standard red rockets, but its big enough to be a nice player home.
---
Small prefab buildings with customization be great.
---
I have found it depends on location. When I had a camp down south frequented by high level players I sold mostly ammo and repair related scrap - lead, steel, plastic etc. But Im currently west of Flatwoods with a more mixed crowd and I sell everything in good quantities at regular intervals and try to keep it topped up to at least 5x bulk of each plus circuits, screws, copper etc.
---
I lol'd üòÇ
---
Lmaooo this gave me a good chuckle. Yes I am aware that they bring good and bad to the game. This is my first dupe wave so if I‚Äôm being honest, the only thing I‚Äôve noticed is just the market being fucked but the playerbase being suddenly hyper-active out of nowhere.
---
Lifegiver maxed, radicool, nerd rage, class freak etc toxic goo and rad away sneak and stealth serendipity and blocker helps but I mostly one shot everything attacking me unless it‚Äôs a huge creature then it‚Äôs 3-10 shots,  5 unyielding armor I have two parts with 25% poison resistance and that really helps a lot or I get one punched by a ghoul and die it‚Äôs all a gamble as your pretty squishy bloodied
---
For me, it made my gameplay unsafe. I am in constant fear, and I do not know if I would be banned. I have 2 legacy weapons, I traded them long time ago for legit weapons (I got them from mama moleman). And I am not sure their origins, they could be duped. Even my other weapons could be duped, that I bought from player vendors...
---
After this new, massive dupewave, they banned a few players who just owned duped items (so they are not dupers themself, just got a duped item, from trades/paperbags/vendors/containers).
---
My english is beyond bad, but I hope you are understand what I tried to say.
---
Holy punctuation bat man!
---
*Name a single time the servers haven't crashed?* What an absolutely stupid thing to ask.
---
Bzzzzzzzzzzzz Bethesda never they shouldn't exist. They only said they shouldn't fire bullets. And the implication was the removal of that modifier was supposed to be a temporary solution only
---
Edit: Figured I'd save anyone the trouble of having to look it up themselves:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2J2ong0O2B6GAI1AeIdGcp/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-29-2019
---
"Weapons:¬†Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
Dev Note:¬†The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don‚Äôt fire bullets, so we‚Äôve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments."
---
I don't think they'll be DMing you....
---
When you pay for a year membership for a gym, then half year through you come and demolish the whole place, they'll also throw you out, close the door for you and won't totally pay you anything for the unsused time.
---
While this is BGS decision, it's based on player's decision to dupe. Bethesda only reacted to players breaking the TOS. Using a service is an agreement on both parts. Both parties need to uphold the contract to not lose money.
---
Let's hope it compensates people for this auto complete glitch
---
FYI doesn't help. I hadn't been hit with the completion bug to date but Tuesday I had a 8 (daily) 5 (weekly) auto complete on me. Always made sure I was off plenty of time before the reset and Tuesday I logged in an hour after the reset to do dailys only to find them done.
---
Those god roll duped gun that melt the SBQ in seconds are so annoying.
---
It use to be once a blue moon she died way to quick for me to get my 1000k of damage in, now its about 25% or higher of the time this is the case.
---
Agreed. While I feel bad for the few that were actually wrongly banned, I'm enjoying the tears of the banned. Especially those that admit it and try to make up excuses for why they were right to cheat...
---
Yup. The whole *Beth needs to learn to fix their broken game, we're doing them a favour*, is selfish as fuck.
---
I NEED the concrete tires to come back!!
---
Unbelievable you can muster this much disgust at players and have no issues with Bethesda's shoddy coding. Some odd logical conclusions you leap to there as well Karen.
---
...which makes me wonder - have caps ever been duped? Considering these are capped, too, they still have a potential to be one of the most stable currencies in the game - if only there were enough sensible cap sinks.
---
I have one. But got suspended. üòÇ
---
There's literally ghosts in the game now?
---
The best part about this fantasy is Pete Hines actually playing the game.
---
From the original post:
---
&gt; the dupers who 100% are the reason people can have nice things.
---
What?
---
&gt; learn to read.
---
*What?*
---
Why not vendor them?
---
In that case demolishing the gym is breaking the law.  Terms of service violations are not the same as breaking the law.  Your analogy doesn't work because of this difference.
---
Nope

You can craft ultracite cores using depleted fusions cores, thats as close as you can get

Likely a lot of those people are in a lot of debt now.
---
If you get gear that is duped without knowning you don‚Äôt deserve a ban.
---
Lol. Two shot lever action rifles are horrible. Bethesfa nerfed them a long time ago. It's so inaccurate it hurts your dps.
---
They risked a ban for a crap weapon. Haha.
---
You can think that way. However, others cheating could/will affect the game negatively for those who play the game legitimately. 
---
Yes, they bought the game but if you go out of your way to break the rules of the game, then you deserve the ban.
---
Who cares what someone else does what their money?  Why are we getting so many posts asking why someone else is playing the game how they want to play? If Bob wants to buy ranks now, then go for it, Bob.
---
Lmfao 6 hours he still hasn't replied you destroyed him üòÇ
---
Wait, you can buy levels?
---
I would say I'm surprised this post has so many upvotes but people really do love vengeance, especially if they followed the rules. A character wipe for the people that duped would be a better way to handle this problem. But people love whatever version of a chopping block they can get to.
---
What about: This?
---
im on pc so my sales are still going through the roofes. selling private dupes is most profit ppl are willing to pay up to 2000 per person if they are trying (and fail) to sell items themselves. im doing this since beta without getting one single account banned and i did that in impressive numbers, seems like most ppl are just 2 stupid. also you actually achieved nothing, so stop calling yourself robin hood
---
Oh well I guess that works I've been collecting ultracite and never found a use for it Thanks !

Yup

---
What if you didn't know it was impossible.  Lot of people don't wiki games up and down, and might see something and say oh that must be rare, and then get banned.    
---
I'm sure it's uncommon, but I bet it happens.
---
Yes, i was afraid... Even if i had another account
---
New login feature? Haven't noticed anything new
---
If you read this discussions through, you'll find them and their reasons. Of course they pose as non-cheaters and "devil advocates", but it's apparent it's them by how starkly they are defending the cheating.
---
Some of them want every season reward without even lifting a finger so they'll cheat SCORE points.
---
Some of them don't want to engage with the main game loop to gather materials/scrip/treasury notes. They feel entitled to the resources and don't to do the "boring gameplay" to gather them.
---
Some of them want the best equipment without accepting that best equipment is not needed to play the game and the end goal for any game with loot. 
---
Some of them even feel entitled to having legacy weapons that Bethesda removed from the loot pools for a reason. But they feel the need to have them.
---
TLDR - it's lazyness and entitlement.
---
Less emojis, more punctuation and overall coherence.
---
Not hiding, but one of the old-timey outfits includes a backpack that replaces the one you have equipped - and looks way nicer IMHO.
---
&gt; Yes, they bought the game but if you go out of your way to break the rules of the game, then you deserve the ban.
---
Well then they should get a full 60$ refund plus any money they spent in the atom shop or on Fallout First. 
---
&gt;However, others cheating could/will affect the game negatively for those who play the game legitimately. 
---
"Oh noes, this guy has a rare script or gun!"
---
I had a bug for one play session where I was able to put down every ally furniture thing. I had 5 allies at the same time, and it was great because they were way, way, way better than turrets.
---
Then when I logged in again, I was back down to Gramps with no way to put the others down. I'm sure there's an exploit involved in doing it, but I couldn't figure out how to trigger it.
---
Your name is on point üëç
---
Well, there you go then. Legacy items are a big no-no.
---
So should bethesda. I'm actually from the front page and randomly clicked on this thread. Big lover of single player fallout tho.
---
That's what i was thinking, why everybody wants 373930 legacy or 2525 if you only use 3-4... I really cant understand
---
I am sorry I can‚Äôt help get back to play.
---
Thats why idk if its present or past tense, 10 months ago he was still playing and some random nuked his camp but I haven't heard anything since
---
They are real friends, in real life... Im not talking about the game, its not the same thing to play with strangers

---
Thanks for the answer
---
Events like Fertile Soil or Leader Of The Pack are designed for low level players. I think the best way to start is by doing events in the Forest region (the western green area of the map), with the exception of Project Paradise. When those become easy, work your way north to the Toxic Valley and start doing those. If you're on PS4 I'm happy to lend a hand with some!
---
Nice, I got some legit flashbacks.
---
fyi all those items were probably duped, so your ont the radar now xd
---
just like everybody else has probably picked up a duped item
---
Or you know dont cheat.
---
Yeah sure. But I've logged over 1200 hours since beta. And believe it not a majority of them were legitimate as I used to farm legendaries a unhealthy amount. The ones I had traded for were ones I'd either lost in scams or are unobtainable because of greedy players.  BE gat / BEFixer / BE flamer shouldn't be equate to a ban IMO they were in the game in large amounts prior to this anyway.
---
Too many bulls spoil the broth.
---
If we're supposed to base game logic on what happens in the real world, then nothing that happened in the game would happen, I should be collapsoing under the weight of my 8000 caps, three guns, thousands of rounds of ammo and 200+ bottles of water.
---
Thats what im saying, real friends! I was enjoing the game with my real friends... Stupid glitches/players
---
There are no legitimate reasons for duping.
---
You will never be able to justify duping to me or knowingly accepting duped gear.
---
If they chose to break the rules, they should expect to get banned. They chose to buy the game, they chose to break the rules. Bethesda should not issue refunds. 
---
‚ÄúSorry you got banned, have $60.‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs not their job to make people feel better or ensure that they didn‚Äôt waste their money. If someone chooses to cheat, then they accept the risk of being banned.
---
Murdering the queen has been a thing since last year.  Most of the weapons doing it are far from God rolls too, if not just straight up garbage rolls.  I have a berserkers limb damage minigun that can just destroy things.
---
Berserkers.....does more damage with less armor and if I'm using it in, I'm using it in t65.  Does 1 damage per bullet (whopping 2 or 3 with headshots) to the queen but can magically drain her health bar in seconds.  Straight up ridiculous and should be fixed with the next patch.... hopefully anyways.
---
At some point you should be able to, yeah.
---
Nice üëè
---
Every one has said exactly what I was going to say, but leaving out a detail.
---
It depends on the enemy you are fighting too.
---
Lever gun is my go to, I rarely switch to my fixer. Unless I'm fighting a few select enemies. SBQ, imposter, sheepsquatch, sometimes mirelurk queens. All are pretty tanky, so ill start with my lever, then switch to the fixer for before I reload. This ends up with more damage in the long run, which for these tanky enemies, its going to be a reasonably long fight respectively.
---
Any other enemies I one shot, but for the ones I cant, the fixer comes out.
---
I‚Äòm not stopping Bob. But it‚Äôs simply smarter for Bob to wait.
---
No, I hate those that give me all the weapons I want! Bad duppers, bad!
---
Also, duping wouldn't be a problem, if RNG in this game is one of the worst I've ever encountered.
---
people with littalery thousands of hours and still not the desired gear piece. 
---
They created a huge problem and they created a glitch that's fixes that problem. Shouldn't be surprised when so many players use that glitch.
---
Nice :D
---

No one needs a legacy weapon. Bethesda put new Gauss weapons in that are, in a lot of cases, as good as any legacy. Duping that old stuff isn't going to help anyone.
---
If anything, these massive dupes will only make Bethesda lock more new items behind a grind wall and make them untradeable.
---
They should issue refunds for the money THEY spent on the game. And again, who gives a fuck if someone has more than one type of gun? On private servers they can do whatever they fucking want to. Imagine being this much of a bootlicker.
---
Even if it worked you would have two of the same exact untradable weapons. Not sure why you would want that.
---
limited timed items isnt something new in online games.
---
Get one with limb damage (some other secondary effects work, too) or use armor with -15% damage while blocking and use VATS.  There is a bug right now where any shotgun does massive damage in VATS if you have one of these effects.  I was lucky to get a bloodied pump action and a piece of unyielding with the blocking thing and I think downed the level 95 Behemoth at Solomon‚Äôs Pond in 4 hits.  Fun!  Much harder to kill scorchbeasts though, since you absolutely have to wait for them to land.
---
Edit: Watch Angry Turtle‚Äôs video on ‚Äúmagic shotguns‚Äù if you want the full list of effects that do this.

Do not try to justify cheating/duping/exploiting.
---
There is never a valid reason for any of that. You are scum if you cheat on videogames.
---
Idk mang I got it to work on the secret service chest piece so I assumed it would work on anything!
---
 Building these things relies so much on RNG so to remove the RNG chance of improving your chance at a better item is kinda doodoo-cheeks, Beth Esda
---
&gt;So because you personally benefitted from the cheat, which allowed you to circumvent your own incompetence around the game
---
You're saying that for a totally random RNG game? Get a grip üòÇ
---
I think the term you want is ‚Äúgatcha‚Äù games. They‚Äôre definitely soft-peddled gambling though. And people definitely do get addicted in the same way.
---
Aw, does this mean those players using the handmade rifles with laser rifle beam splitters attached won't be showing up at Scorched Earth events anymore?
---
Great job. I love running into CAMPS that blend in well to the universe. I hate floating bases so much.
---
*insert clown picture of myself *
---
Bingo
---
T65 is by far the best
---
i think its jsut a bug with the chest piece. nothing else works.
---
Better analogy: it's like building an amusement park, putting up signs with rules for visitors, and kicking out anyone who violates the rules.
---
Drop them in a pond somewhere lamo. It's fun to grab there crap when you see it and toss it in the trash.

---
Angry Turtle did a video showing how OP shotguns can be if they have specific perks and, I think, at least 1piece of blocking armour.
---
Damn, really takes away from that whole excitement of being able to craft these weapons after the grind
---
im sick of people telling everyone that they should be thanking exploiters. I've put almost 800 hours in this game and i earned every valuable piece i have, so you can fuck right off with this apologist bullshit.
---
Just check which of those two keeps the cap on his toothpaste. You know who does that? A SYNTH!
---
Got a bunch of 5.56?  I mean, it was basically currency for a long time and some of us build up a lot as a result.
---
It's not a point of cheating. It's a point of be relevant in a game. To be competitive (and in a pve environment I just mean that you don't have to spend your entire existence farming resources) you have to stick on a completely broken build or have the access to broken weapons. Who enters now into the game have only the first alternative since the second imply that you are accepting duping (ALL the legacy weapons on the market are duped, just like most of op non legacy weapons) or pray that a good items comes out due to RNG. Duping IS bad. But duping is what kept on the economy of the game. Not recognizing that means being blind.
---
I am constantly overflowing with scrip'able gear. So much so i sell all of them to npc's after my 150 daily limit.
---
I have 3 lvl 50 alts that I only use to scrip. They also are overflowing with gear from my main. I cannot scrip enough so i end up selling them for caps like the old days.
---
&gt; a lot of them were world hopping relentlessly to find duped items in vendors
---
What would happen if someone unknowingly bought such item? 
---
Asking because many years (decades? dinos were still roaming earth iirc) ago, I used to play that mmorpg called Knight Online and when such ban waved occured, duper got wiped out and duped items as well ... without any sort of compensation for those unknowingly buying those, of course. I'm fairly new on Fallout 76 so I have no idea on how Bethesda handle those things. ([aside from Internet Historian's video which I hope is out dated lol](https://youtu.be/kjyeCdd-dl8?t=383))
---
This. Was using that crafting bench there during the mole miner treasure hunters thing, and that syphilitic bastard hawked a loogie in my right ear. I to tried to murder him.
---
The vending and display bans. I have spent a good 60 hours of game purely looking for rare items to display. I have a museum in my camp with all the fuzzies and teddy's now amongst a host of loads of other rarer finds. To see this being taken away from fair players is rubbish. I always take time to look around at cool camps to see what other players collected when I am visiting vendors. On top of that why is it fair I save 9k caps to get my money to buy an item from a vendor and these idiots can just dupe and make easy money.  I dread to think I have also got myself a bargain when I regularly tour vendors and I now may be susceptible to a third party purchase ban if they start doing that.
---
Thanks just gotta start getting that G just finished up with the ss set except the helmet which does nothing üòÇ so gonna take me a sec to get enough back to get the set hahaha
---
I routinely have between 90-110K in 556 ammo on me and up to 30K in ultracite 556 as well.  I do this because I‚Äôve accumulated legacy handmades and the ammo is also good for trade currency as the idiots at Bugthesda still haven‚Äôt figured out proper cap limits.
---
Yeah, out of all the Ultracite veins there's usually like 1 which actually works. Imo the rewards for the tokens not really worth it.
---
It is disgusting obvious tricks, every other survival game has the same feature, you need to store more stuff then build more chests/box's but no, some sneaky little guy at bethesda suggested making the storage limited and then charging people to make their junk weightless and unlimited so eventually people become tired of bulking and selling and even just dropping stuff  so they pay for a membership. But even then after a while of picking up legendaries and not being able to trade them in because of a ridiculous 150 scrip limit, people will become full again and be forced to drop things on the floor... or as I know people do... buy a secondary just to store things. This is not a happy accident on Bethesdas part. They do this on purpose to get more money out of people hence 'Disgusting obvious tricks'
---
Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
---
like any ban wave, there are undoubtedly people lying their asses off, but lets not pretend Bethesda runs flawless code all of a sudden. if there are actually false positives, which there seems to be, that's a *huge* issue.
---
Yeah, I know that queen melters have been around for a while, just in my play sessions I've noticed she's died so much faster compared to earlier. Could just be me though, but most of the people had a lot more Gatling plasmas than I was used to seeing.
---
I may be wrong, but your LMG sounds like one of those "magic guns". They've been around for a while, I know shotguns and LMGs have them. I can't remember the specifics, but I think they do full damage per bullet even though they say otherwise, certain perks on the gun breaks them. I've read that PTS testers said they were patched during the Wendigo event, so we'll have to see.
---
Yeah dude idk how people are justifying this by saying rng is bad. The setting of the game is semi realistic wasteland, not tom and Jerry's weapon and toy store
---
It's not really about believing.  
---
It is about what im witnessing with my own eyes and experience.  
---
If the system you talk about works or not, i cant really say.  
---
Since i never encountered that system.  
---
All i can say is how it works for me.
---
Although i wish it worked the way you say it does, since this would make farming materials so much faster!!!!
---
"Good morning, here is the gun I purchased from you last month. I shot it a few times as practice and used it to rob a bank but I don't need it now. Now if you'd refund the money I used to buy it that'd be great! What about the robbery? Yeah it was illegal so what? Doesn't matter, I don't like the rules I have to follow by owning the gun just give me my refund and take the gun back"
---
T-65 has the best resistance but I'm still using the X-01 helmet because it's the only one that gets the Vats matrix overlay mod.
---
All they need to do is make the changes to legacy weapons they promised back in patch 5.
---
What happened last night?
---
No shit. If I can turn some nuked plants into a miniaturized fusion power source, surely I can figure out how to make high purity gold.
---
if only! no, just plastic. :(
---
It not the Dupers fault, its Bethesdas...such logic, why didn't I see it earlier?
---
Maybe because its stupid.
---
The game has many issues but people duping items for their own personal gain, in game and real world, is not because the Devs are lazy or incompetent, its because the Dupers are greedy, and the people who buy off them only slightly less so (talking multi-buy players who should know better, not 1 time 1 item noobs who don't read Reddit). 
---
Simplest solution all round - just stick to the commonsense rules or is that too simple and non-profitable?
---
No that‚Äôs not enough, I beleive it‚Äôs like 100k+ or something
---
so why‚Äôd ya get it lol
---
No need for them.  How about they actually fix all these weapons before adding more bugs.
---
You got banned maybe?
---
Dm Todd and call him a bitch, that might work
---
How can you prove that you never duped?
---
By showing items that are not there?  
---
Even more difficult when you are banned, and cannot do anything....
---
Please sit down and shut up, you know nothing about what people experience, and what is the truth.
---
I have been banned. And never duped anything
---
Why would you want to get banned?
---
No, I dont, and I dont need to provide one. Most information is passed through word of mouth and you know it, don‚Äôt try and come at me with that  bull crap
---
I can't even get the garage door to attach to my prefab, I'm not sure why.
---
I found a shit ton of extra plans in there as a new character, so I think you can add stuff and it not affect the quest instance.
---
Massive ban wave
---
Plenty of games have legacy features, ie shit you can‚Äôt obtain anymore. And you‚Äôre right, people cheat to get them. And then those people get banned. Such is the circle of life
---
LOL! That Bethesda boot taste good?
---
‚Üë this.
---
I'm not sure how they're deciding who to ban now but when the stackable dupe was around it was based on how many items went through your inventory in A short amount of time. So even picking up A bunch of stuff that someone dropped was sketchy.
---
I agree with a spawn point but I could see some dweebs putting them in compromised positions to kill players and steal loot. I.e high spawn, cliff spawns, spawning into traps etc. It is a pain when you build an astonishing looking base and they spawn at the back.
---
Fo76 is just work, no play(fun)
---
No content, no nothing.. Just endless work
---
But the weekly's auto complete.
---
It doesn't work but how is it so unbelievable that you wouldn't try. It worked on the secret service armor for me. It was at least worth a try
---
Exactly that‚Äôs how I think of it not that I dupe and if I did I would only do like 3 items
---
Actually the t-65 PA has the Vats matrix overlay mod
---
It is not best by far by any means. It offers a tiny bit more Dr the the sh does. Like serious a miniscule difference. I'd still recommend the sh over the t65. Better rr and it gives a tiny amount of damage, but it's still extra damage
---
I started playing 5 days ago and I have been throwing myself into all the low events like tea time, leader of the pack and I did the escort one where the robot goes around the banks. I‚Äôll be honest though, the servers I‚Äôm on though are always graveyards for events though. I would try more events but no one else seems to be doing them. I play on Xbox and I hope that the servers pick up for double xp weekend.
---
Also feed the people is good too watching the consoles but the level I am I‚Äôd need someone to help as you have to protect 3 consoles. You only need 1 to survive but I think you get a better reward if all 3 survive.
---
So just stop playing.
---
Not the weapon ...

Day 1 beta player.  Never been worried about ban wavs on my end.

Unless you rolled it from the purveyor or killed a legendary for it yourself you can‚Äôt guarantee shit.
---
I use vendor machines, put the item for sale for 10000 caps so no one will buy them
---
If you use all your vending machines then this won't work but I decided my need for clean junk far outweighed my need to sell plans
---
I really want different display cases if they could do the metal shelves as a display case then you could a couple of things on each shelf. Only having display case and the large ornate display shelf is annoying
---
Really? I didn't see it in Regs' inventory. I'll have to check again, thanks for letting me know.
---
I'm nearly Rank 50 and I have thousands and thousands of Atoms that have been piling up. I also don't enjoy doing Daily/Weekly challenges, as I prefer roleplaying and taking screenshots, so the last two weeks I've been playing in a way I don't particularly enjoy. My plan was to get as far as I can on double-xp with stacked lunchboxes in one final push at the grind, hopefully get into the mid-50s or to 60, and then buy out the rest of the board.
---
That way I get to go back to what I enjoy doing, I get my cosmetics/camp items, I get to use some of my piled Atoms from 1st, AND I get eight or so weeks before I'm tempted by something else and the FOMO kicks in again
---
You don't have to buy helmet mods
---
Yeah what if an update interests you? Then you can‚Äôt play it then, just stop playing.
---
I shall assume its a serious question and refer you to every 2nd thread on the sub in the last 12 hours - big ban wave.
---
If you jest...I don't know, I didn't receive the email, and was invited to the party.
---
Yea, for some reason weapons loose durability for each hit on enemy instead of each shot fired. So aoe hits on multiple enemies deplete it really fast. And TS  fires twice...
---
You buy the game as a means of entertainment. You should follow the rules of the game you chose to buy, the terms and conditions state you aren't allowed to cheat, if you cheat you break the rules. They have the right to ban you for breaking the rules. They don't have to refund unless there's a law allowing the citizens to get a refund after getting banned for cheating.
---
You don't like that? Don't buy the game, stop playing the game, stop playing games in general if the only way to enjoy them is for you to cheat. Don't be a snowflake.

He has safe space feature on. That wont't work..

I‚Äôd try and get an AA role for the queen it‚Äôs very effective. You can also try stacking some formula P and targeting her head.
---
The biggest joke to me is that they never removed duplicates from other waves. The people who understand how many layers of RNG there are in the game would easily know that the majority of god rolls aren't legitimate, but Bethesda let them be. Oh, but there is an even bigger joke; the hacked items with impossible modifications that have roamed the game since forever and are responsible for insanely fast queen kills, which actually ruins everyone else's experience. What they did about it? Nothing. What a joke of a company.
---
Yeah the mods come with the helmet I have that kind of mod on my helmet
---
Fallout is dead.
---
I carry no more than 7, and that‚Äôs probably too many.

It‚Äôs a bit like this: You‚Äôre a bank owner and you left your vault door unlocked and open. You watched people walk in and take shit all week, and only after a week you call the police. They might catch some of the worst offenders but your insurance company will laugh you out of their office. It‚Äôs all Bethesda‚Äôs fault.
---
8 weeks of playing how I used to, forgetting Score exists, in exchange for some piled up Atoms. If you are subbed but don't buy much of the store they can rack up.
---
I'd he already has one and that's his goal for use, why dupe it then?
---
He also goes to the garden outside the wall, sits at the table outside, and wanders across to play the instruments.
---
But I swore I read in patch notes he was meant to either be in bed or at his desk at all times to make him easy to find. That's not what I'm seeing.
---
Lol, butthurt much? Did you get banned little boy? Did your daddy Todd spank your behind?
---
A quick search would prove that you're wrong. I'm just trying to help you and provide you with the correct information. If you want to be ignorant then that's on you I suppose, enjoy continuing to live a lie bud. Peace!

---
Am I still doing it or is the other person already done it? Cause I am sending you a friend request if I still am
---
Yes, and most legacy features or items in other games are usually removed completely, not kept in the game for a select few players to enjoy whilst others miss out. Either allow everyone access to legacies in fo76 or remove them for everyone.
---
Seriously dude. They want me to throw a bit of interest in the nw direction and i get killed by naked invisible dudes punching me to death every other match i mean....bruh
---
They‚Äôre both around the same gold to get too I think the only difference in price as far as making is the vault steel am I correct?
---
So everyone gets thier time severely wasted because cheaters are cheating? Nothing fair about this at all.
---
Ban anyone willing to cheat. Period.
---
Queen is glitched magic weapons. Random perks like bashing damage can for some reason rip the queen up with the correct other perks
---
&gt; Don't be a snowflake.
---
Okay libtard. 
---
&gt;stop playing games in general if the only way to enjoy them is for you to cheat.
---
No, I won't stop playing a SP game that they let console commands be usable by people who paid for it. That Bethesda boot must be mighty tasty.
---
Yeah you need 162 vault steel to make the sh.m
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
It‚Äôs not that we are ‚Äòbootlickers‚Äô, it‚Äôs that I want to enjoy the game the way it was intended to be enjoyed. Once you can duplicate items there is no need to find other weapons. At the end of the day, Bethesda are not going to issue refunds to cheaters now or ever. Common sense would allow you see understand that cheaters don‚Äôt get things their way.
---
Fk haha the grind
---
LOL! Please keep trying. You're boring me, enjoy a corporation who doesn't care about their customers banning people who have a extra gun or item.
---
What's a libtard? What's the Bethesda boot you keep talking about? Boy get off your pills you're on.
---
The ability to manually stack Punji Boards was removed. However some Trap Camp builders already had the Punji Walls blueprinted and they could still be layed down. So it's more rare now but it's certainly not impossible.
---
They do.
---
Dunno what you mean, I‚Äôve gotten it to proc before
---
That's one of the reasons why I've insisted to trade at my camp when a few days ago I bought my Fixers and Handmades in Flux.
---
That we can't trust the patch notes is really sad tbh.
---
Hey its much easier now then when I did it haha. You know how many raids I had to run to get that steel lol
---
Awww I think he needs some crylinol for that headache.
---
Paragraphs!
---
I understand what you're trying to say, but that is tough to process on mobile.
---
I have some amazing Unyielding SS armor pieces, which are absolutely no use to the toon they're on. My Bloodied build would love them, but no..
---
What are you talking about? I don't even play the game. I just like making fun of delusional people.
---
Kinda as a curio, it exists and is special so I wanted one.
---
Plus they are useful for when a queen battle is at risk of failing or if I have to do an event by myself.
---
But mostly because they are the last tier of things to get, when you have everything the game loses a lot of value, but there's still this mythical level of unobtainable gear that only gets spread around when dupes are available.
---
Like super ultra legendary hunting except unlike gold bullion items they're actually worth the grind and effort.
---
Days and days worth I bet ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No just the duppers got banned if someone tells you they got banned but never duped is a liar.
---
its too extreme and veteran dupers have burner accounts anyway, the only thing thing they accomplished was getting rid of players who probably have and would in the future buy things off the atomic shop, and give the game some traffic for duping mostly inconsequential items like fluxes and probably some tse guns which most high level players have anyway. please dont @ me about duping "breaking" the economy either, the games economy is already a joke and most people would rather barter with items than caps which have a stupid limit of 30k per character anyway. ik they need the players and money too because they finally caved and put this on xbox game pass. between stuff like this and the bogus ammo converter the devs are really blowing this games potential comeback
---
edit: spelling mistakes
---
I used to bulk and sell scrap to make 1500 caps a day but I haven't done that in over a year.
---
 Now my player vending machine makes all the caps I will ever need.
---
Yeah, I have an lmg and a minigun version that I picked up back in January.  I'm not a jerk killing the queen with them and ruining events for other people though, just have them as a novelty.  Basically will only use them if I'm soloing free range to save some ammo against a tanky sheepsquatch.  
---
It's definitely something that needs to have been fixed a long time ago.  I can't say I've noticed an increase in plasmas at scorched earth though....... mainly because in the last 4 days I've only seen scorched Earth once.  Not sure what the deal is but nobody is launching at all on the servers I've been getting placed on.  All I can figure is that the influx of new low level players is the reason why.
---
I knew the most likely answer before I asked the question.
---
2 of the 3 weeks I could only get 6 steel a day. 1 of the 3 I could get 12 steel a day. And those were the days my team and I were on lol. It took well over a month
---
You can get those in game?
---
I wouldn't worry too much.
---
I'm level 140 and have so many extra plans ammo and random useless legendary items that anytime I come across a lower level I try and give the some things. You guys get a cool weapon you may have never tried and I get to clear space in my storage box.
---
Unless they drop like thousands of the same items that aren't junk or ammo I would be apprehensive but id probably still grab it
---
"Another settlement need someone with the guts to help"
---
...
---
Might help if you told people what part of the map it is.
---
You just stop playing at that point. Like every other grind/currency in this game, you're supposed to hit the limit and then wonder what to do next.
---
Bane of my existence on fo76, I always have so many of these and forget they are in my inventory. I drop them in boxes around flat woods or the wayward.
---
Get a reg lvl 50 combat shotgun and put a scope on it. It does some crazy good numbers for non legendary.
---
You know, I duped in Oblivion when I learned it was a thing. My friend also did this. There are 3 I remember that were amusing. Filling a house with beer bottles until the game crashed. Those orbs from Oblivion games took a lot of processing power for the 360, sending more than 10 rollingndown a hill is bad. Last time I turned that game on I had no idea where I was or what I was doing. I had duped the chameleon orb 25% and put it on everything so what, 125% invisible? It worked when I played the game regularly, not 6 years later.
---
Why would you complain about getting banned from FO76 though lmao.
---
No wonder they put them up for sale with regs then hahaha would had people leaving over the grind to get a damn set of pa hahaha
---
Lololol they can't even ban people properly. 
---
*Grabs the popcorn*
---
Personally I would say wait until after the double daily weekend. You might not like the grind of doing the dailies (they're not exactly a blast I'll admit), but they'll award about 4k score per day during that weekend so you'll be able to get a decent amount of ranks from that alone before buying.
---
EDIT: And then obviously after that you shouldn't need to worry about doing the dailies ever again.
---
Definitely do Leader of the pack, the Wastelanders quest line will take you up that way anyway. 3 guaranteed low level legendary enemies. Also (on Xbox at least) the diseased deathclaw on the little island there is bugged and will just stand there in a T-Pose while you kill it netting some nice XP early on.
---
Great news!
---
You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not their fault that their tech is outdated but it is your fault if you‚Äôre banned for breaking THEIR terms of service. Give it a read through. They state that breaking rules may result in account termination. The warning is right there, you chose to cheat so you deserve to be banned.
---
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that? You were banned because you broke our rules that were clearly stated? We‚Äôre sorry about that, here, have your money back, while we‚Äôre at it do you want us to unban you and allow you to ruin the game?‚Äù 
---
I don‚Äôt know about you but it sounds pretty entitled to me. Possible r/entitledpeople content?
---
Somebodies mad no one wanted their shit legendaries...
---
Meanwhile hacked items doing 30k damage on eBay exist. Going for 5$.
---
That's for understanding this basic concept. The did it with the best in class mask (in that case they removed the effect) they can do that with weapons.
---
Maybe lol
---
you can think as you will. i completed all dailies and weeklies yesterday was in a team for 10 sec as required.. the level up challenge is just making a new toon and doing the wayward run 3 times. 5 minutes each. has nothing to do with beign badass.  the kill 10 scorched. airport event. 10 mole men wels station plus using shotty vats for critical hit got both at same time.
---
Here is a tip:
---
Use Chemist, Super Duper cards when craft, and Green Thumbs when collecting. You will end up more then 30 formula Ps in a round ;)
---
A Fusion Core recycler has been requested many times but so far nothing. I would like to combine all those part used ones to make sellable higher percentage cores (with maybe a 10% tax rate). I use so few of them and no one buys low percentage cores at any price (I think the lowest I've sold is in the low 80s, but really 90 is the usual minimum). Id even take a flat 10% off each scrapped core regardless of charge and combine them to make fully charged ones. 
---
We finally got an ammo converter so who knows what the future may bring...
---
Still, you have the Brotherhood of Steel story coming soon. That‚Äôs worth playing.
---
Events are a good way to gain experience points, plans, purified water, caps..ect...
---
 If I were you as a low level I would do every event I saw in the forest. Once you hit your 20s you can start doing events outside of the forest.
---
 A lot of the non public events still give really good rewards and XP not sure why most people stick to the public events only.
---
 A few of them actually have guaranteed legendaries.
---
Spamming Stealth boys and the magazines that extend the timer
---
The chinese stealth suit does provide invisibility when moving but only if you're crouched.
---
Is it explosive, when yes than beam splitter is the best.
---
Chinese stealth suit.. its from the foundation quest line
---
Same. I thought I had a second ss chest armor but when I checked my inventory there was only one
---
Xo1 PA Quantum paint
---
T51b nuka cola paint
---
Nuka Cola clock
---
Nuka Cola Machine
---
Thats it rest in atom store from time to time.
---
There are some outfits though and several flavored nuka variants.
---
Chinese Stealth armor and speed demon will allow constant invisible near walking speed movement while crouched. But it‚Äôs only a 140/140 armor set, so not tough too kill when you do hit it. If they‚Äôre marsupial and also jumping and shooting, it‚Äôs that much harder.
---
I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker. Say ‚Äúwhat‚Äù one more goddamn time!
---
The RNG is fine, it's the attitude of players that is the issue. The correct approach is to build around a good weapon drop, not design a build that depends on one you don't have.
---
Many cheated items are not legacies at all. The recent prices of Fixers and Handmades makes it clear enough, which by extension also shows that the irrationality doesn't just stop at legacies, but it extends to the whole Legendary system.
---
I'm sure a lot of armor and rare cosmetic outfits were duped plenty of times as well, but with SS armor around the damage there is in a way more limited to the "economy".
---
Wait, I just got an Instigating FFR +1 Agility LMG tonight, is that one of these?
---
This is true, generally speaking, but my rationale is that 76 is pretty much a cursed project for them. It never sold as well as they hoped due to the disastrous launch, the media and fandom have basically made it a black mark on the company rep so it's likely not popular higher up for 'damaging the brand' (Pete Hines even admitted it had in an interview) which is a pretty severe sin in company speak, and for all the new blood things like Wastelanders, Steam, and Game Pass bring in it will only ever be the tiniest portion of the playerbase they expected and aimed for.
---
To put things in perspective, they wanted this to be their Fortnight. It was their foray into live-service/battle royale. Every title Bethesda released until 76 was selling more and more. Fallout 4 sold 14 million. So, why shouldn't they expect \*their\* live-service to be massive? Yet, 76 has tens of thousands to maybe at a push hundreds of thousands of players across all platforms. Fortnight has breached 250 million players.
---
Any money the hardcore players like us spend probably doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things. It's probably the only thing the managers can wave at suits to keep the lights on.
---
Lol, to bad its not possible without losing entire benefits of specific builds.
---
I love the raider bot! He's got so many lines and all of them great
---
Thank you! Looks like I‚Äôm gonna get myself a Chinese stealth armor and get a mutation of speed demon.
---
I try! I really do. It sucks to be wary of every gift that someone offers, though.
---
This was one of the longest run on sentences I have ever had the displeasure of reading. If English is not your first language I commend you for your effort, otherwise I pity your writing skills.
---
As a lvl 400 I can honestly say I got all of my gear legitimately through playing the game.  If I even think a weapon or armor was duped I would stay as far away from it as possible. I have never used trading sites and have never bought cheap godly legendary gear off player vendors.
---
While it doesn't affect me directly I still get annoyed and disappointed in humans that think they have to cheat on video games.  Cheating in any way shape or form would take every single bit of fun out of the video game for me.
---
Unfortunately I joined the server 1 hr 20 mins after the reset and I still got autocompleted challenges. So it can still happen, however the first time it happened I tried to join around the same time as the refresh, so I'm not sure  if because I've had the problem I'll now always have the problem or whether it will continue to be an issue for me going forward
---
I may well do so, we'll have to see how things go, they might not even offer the option til afterwards what with people losing Score.
---
I didn't say never. I just havent enjoyed it recently but that doesn't mean I dont want to like it
---
You clearly don't understand my point. Do you think that people would mind risking their account for steel or crappy guns? The point is just that there are legacy items that are broken. Remove them (and if you oppose to this you are saying duping is ok because most of these items are duped, just like most of the op non legacy items, and back tracking is impossible) or bring them back on the RNG. This would solve some of the problems (still agree that banning is to be applied).
---
R&amp;G Station lower end of the map.
---
You can make a railway station house, including garage for repair work and there is a bit of green and trees to place down a bungalow also.
---
Is it the Ammo Convertor possibly?
---
&gt;They should. They paid for the game like everyone else, it's not their fault they're using an outdated engine and anti-cheat system.
---
No they shouldn't. In any game ever cheaters should be banned. I don't care if you cheat, I don't have a problem with that, you do you, just don't expect compensation after you are willingly playing the game in a way that wasn't intended and got banned. In other words DON'T BE A SNOWFLAKE.
---
So with Chinese stealth armor you can walk with no penalty of losing invisibility in PVP?
---
so true.
---
imagine spawning in a dozen schorchbeasts, sheepsquatches, and behemoths.
---
maybe with private servers. one can dream.
---
May I ask how much gold is it? I'm nearing the 5k limit an have nothing I'm interested in buying but if I can get the whole set for 5k that'd be nice. Then I can grind for the mods.
---
Which food machine?
---
Do you get the accuracy bonus if not scoped in ?
---
You definitely wont get banned. That's been going on since the holiday event where those gifts were introduced.
---
Yes, while crouched
---
Good looks... hopefully it dont happen to many people
---
its too extreme and veteran dupers have burner accounts anyway, the only thing thing they accomplished was getting rid of players who probably have and would in the future buy things off the atomic shop and give the game some traffic for duping mostly inconsequential items like fluxes and probably some tse guns which most high level players have anyway. please dont @ me about duping "breaking" the economy either, the games economy is already a joke and most people would rather barter with items than caps which have a stupid limit of 30k per character anyway. ik they need the players and money too because they finally caved and put this on xbox game pass. between this and other things like the bogus ammo converter or completely unusable gun skins that they should be way more concerned with  the devs are really blowing this games potential comeback.
---
It won't though? Certainly not 25 of them
---
Dense?
---
How exactly
---
Better safe than sorry. üëç
---
There not banning people with one or 2 duped items there banning people with full inventory of them all theese people posting that they got banned and never duped are stupid as hell.  Everyone of them claiming to get banned for just having a duped item they got from trading is full of it cuz you look back at there post history on market place and it's nothing but them sell dupped gear
---
I'm pretty sure you could just keep checking train station vendors, they stock various mods and their inventory cycles whenever you enter a world.
---
I wish they'd just add some vertical half walls
---
Also open to suggestions on that too
---
*Shoots you in the shoulder
---
Okay cool thank you.
---
Yeah, doesn‚Äôt always come up with the workshop icon. It‚Äôs bugged atm

thanks:) I just managed to get a chair in it. I think it might be a size thing, so I can't understand how you can make it fit

What's the name of the streamer, if you don't mind me asking?

Is the red rocket garage a totally separate inventory for pa and stuff? I bought it havent had time to plop it down every time I logged a new server someone had my spot, and I refuse to give up watoga train station
---
I hope to have my friends back on fo76 lol at least as soon as possible
---
I'd recommend looking for servers with multiple full event teams. Ill server hop until I find a good one.
---
Jokes on you guys who even play this game, Jesus why was this post on my feed.
---
If Chinese stealth and not using energy weapons then almost all the mutations aside from the melees and plague Walker are a huge help. New team format has allowed some glitched mutations in your favor (herd mentality and empath), and class freak makes many of them almost purely positive with little to no side effect.
---
ThAnks. Found it
---
I could be wrong but from what I remember it‚Äôs almost identical cost to the SS body amour 750 for limbs and 1200 for Chest probs got that wrong but pretty sure it‚Äôs close to that
---
Sunshine Meadows Indrustrial farm workshop has a machine where you can craft some prewar food (Sugar Bombs, Salisbury Steaks, Instamash, etc).
---
Yea you gotta use vats I believe to get the full benefit.  When u out scope on should bring accu to like -6. CuZ it‚Äôs negative it messes with the accuracy so it‚Äôs higher the further back u are.
---
I don't remember exactly what it costs. But it will take more than the 5k limit
---
Came across one camp where he was constantly taken down by the basic machine gun turret.
---
I tend to play in the evenings/nights when it's dark, and I really struggle a lot when I'm going through the vendors and it hurts my eyes.  I haven't found a way around it yet.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Don't know why we can't just assign hidden UUIDs to each weapon, which itself would get duplicated too, then ensure there isn't any other weapon with the same ID and delete those with a more recent timestamp
---
100% agree

The only context I've heard it in, is girls saying that they found a cheap version of an expensive make up.
---
I have always been disgusted in players that think they have to cheat on a video game. What kind of loser can't play a video game normally?
---
There is no justification for cheating, exploiting or duping.
---
Only scum did it and scum deserved what they got.
---
dunno about that, that‚Äôs the exotic exclusivity of the legacy item. I can‚Äôt say enough that legacies should be deleted, but not simply because they‚Äôre legacy. They need removed because they offer no real counterplay in pvp situations
---
It‚Äôs hilarious to read people complaining about it ‚ÄúI willingly engaged in an activity that everyone finds annoying and that the devs have said is a ban-able offense and I got banned for it but it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs fault!!! They suck!!!‚Äù
---
This also affects shadows cast by dead bodies. With any setting below Ultra, those shadows disappear the moment you approach the body.
---
I had a camp in the mire and every time I fast traveled there that's where I would end up but fast traveling again would always fix it.

At least mine aren't lost forever.   My husband can log in on the old console, take screenshots, and share them.  I did really like seeing my lvl 1 ID card show up.
---
7500 score is what I lost. Similar to op weekly and daily's auto completed. I contacted bethesda and they told me "that sucks, maybe next week will be better."
---
They have been crashing for various reasons from day one.  It's not the doopers fault for it

Is it a legendary gun you're trying to mod or just a normal lever? I have all mods unlocked for the lever (lots of scrapping guns)

I sort by new and yours was the first post I saw.

By being good at the game and knowing how to efficiently grind exp for SCORE? I don't play for more than a few hours a day and I by no means farm as efficiently as I could (or as others do) and I'll be rank 50 by tomorrow. It's not impossible for someone with a lot of time, knowledge, and the right build to gain insane exp.
---
Yep, it's really annoying, and after an hr of play it really pisses me off :D I was so happy that i made it run with a smooth framerate but that font thing... well, destroys my happiness :(
---
Wonder if it has something to do with the new "funky" workshop icons that seem to show up now and then.
---
If they bring your Mom cookies and flowers she may unban them and let them back into her basement üòÉ
---
So your solution for the game is that anybody should play the same build. Fanstastic. Just to make you aware of the situation: most of the op gun in the game are duped as well. I farmed some items to arrive in the end to a good junkie rifle build. I don't know if items some of the items I bought are duped. I never did such a thing. The only item I'm sure it was duped in the past is JE laser rifle. That thing can 2 shot a SB or a sheepsquach or how it is called.
---
You post almost exclusively on Fallout subs but do nothing but complain.
---
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume youre very young, but if it fucks you up that bad just quit the game.
---
I had 2 shooting at him.  I removed one because I didn't really want to kill him, but he'd smashed the other one by the time I got to it.  I watched in awe for a while and then logged off.

PSA: Never accept gifts, never buy from robots, never accept trade invites, never pick up anything off the ground. There is no such thing as generosity, strangers are not friends you haven't met yet but sirens and temptresses looking to drag you down to hell. Trust no one. Not even this üò±
---
It doesn‚Äôt let you preview the item before having it. It does for some of the upcoming stuff like the wendingo colossus rug, but not the giant Sheepsquatch. I unlocked it yesterday though and can confirm it‚Äôs on the same line as the other plushies.
---
*laughs in 1000 fusion cores*
---
Yea me either, saw a video on it the other day and tried it myself. Not insane numbers but can 1-2 shot most enemies.
---
This point I disagree with. If you get a good weapon early, sure you can start to build around it. But after lvl 50-100 that isn‚Äôt super practical m, especially for a casual player like me. The respec system isn‚Äôt very friendly in that regard. 
---
Also, no one should be limited to how they play because of the weapons that drop for them. 
---
The real problem is people feel like they *have* to have god rolls for all their gear instead of making due with some decent stuff. Sure, I‚Äôd loved to have all shadowed powered armor but I can make sure with what I‚Äôve got (switched to SS armor so now I have to). I‚Äôm ok with not being able to one shot super mutants. You don‚Äôt need godly gear to be basically untouchable in the game

still no plan for the tenderrizer?

I currently have a Raider camp at the mining setup if you follow the tracks south from Sunnytop train station, I'm moving it soon so I haven't used the Red Rocket garage but I have the circus cage and the train car side by side next to the tracks, and if you climb to the top of the structure and drop in through the roof there is a secret room you can place your generator in so it will never get destroyed. It's a really fun place to build, there is a lot of existing structures you can build around and it has multiple levels. You want to climb to the big pipe connecting the 2 main structures and place the camp right on the corner to get maximum use of the space because if you drop it on the ground the camp sphere won't reach the top of the towers.
---
does this change with +25hp with being well fed?
---
i found if i line my hp up to the v in value of any aid item, seems to work nicely.
---
Not saying where my current camp is... but I have a beautiful scenic view, and other people really dont build in my location (never have to switch server/world like my old spot on a river) and I'm next to an acid site so I'm bringing in 10 valuable acid every time I return home from a few events/quests. 
---
Now my trick for getting dirty water quickly because who wants to use a slow ass water pump?
---
Once every few days when I'm near a body of water questing I'll quickly power mash the collect button for about 100 dirty water. 
---
Bring them home to camp and boil them up and store them for future cooking.
---
My 4 small water purifiers net me 8 purified water a vist, more than enough water as I'm always dropping off legendaries, scrap, fixing armor, etc.
---
23 go fetch missions and a new currency that needs 3 months of grinding to stay relevant?
---
Can't wait..
---
I believe the tenderrizer plan was data mined as a drop
---
Xbox one
---
cant buy em, gotta craft and scrap son.
---
Well that is your personal opinion, alot of player I know would disagree on. 
---
Everyone plays the game different. For some the RNG is so bad, that it drives them away from the game.
---
Same goes for stash space or camp budged. Some people are cool with it, for other it es a huge problem.
---
At the end, it's up to Bethesda to decided how you play the game right but they have to live with people moving on, if they aren't satisfied
---
bethesda ban wave = fake news
---
You‚Äôre right. A simple confirm trade option that both players have to hit before the trade goes through would fix it. Sorry you got scammed.
---
I'd say you were lucky.  I had a player kill me but not pick up my loot.  Every time I respawned and tried to retrieve the bag, he would one-shot me, claim caps, and then go back into stealth mode.  Went on to the tune of several hundred caps until I finally gave up and logged out losing all the loot.
---
I might have accidentally duped one time without realizing how ,i just found the full set of my power armour in the frame after i emptied it. I thought it was internet issue related at the time so who knows. Still not panned
---
I found out yesterday that if you turn off 'auto fill team' than you can play solo. Then your teammates won't PM you and tell you you're trash after you wiff a bunch of shots like your boy here.
---
Considering that some people had over a million on their accounts and nothing happened
---
Although people have been generous, no doubt, legit players give away what they can also, I know I sure do, even legendaries! It is a fact though that over powered players have ended events far too quick to allow lower levels a chance to get any good rewards. It is not like there is no knock on effect from this, there is, they have to grind even harder.
---
It's called Lead Lined yeah. Dense is for chest armor, protection against explosions.
---
This, yes so much this.  It seems to have been asked for since the beginning of time, lol.  But seriously they could even make it an atom item if they were worried for some reason.  They are way to heavy to carry multiple low charged ones around and your power armor never seems to grab an almost depleted one but rather the fullest you have.  I'm quite often dropping below 40% ones out of my inventory because of this.  And why did they remove the core from our power armors?  I hate having to go through the animation when I switch between sets.  I mean I just put a core in and I switch and have to go through it all over again.  I liked it better when a core stayed in the power armor.
---
I am not risking it nor do I want to cheat.
---
No I still use my level 400 to level up. I can usually level up once or twice a day with that character.  I usually log off at 3/4 full XP bar so the next day it's very easy to finish that challenge.
---
 With the amount of XP bonuses available out there it's really very easy.
---
Yup.
---
You make a amazing point any other game company could pull this off but Bethesda is well they just exist

The Wastelanders stuff has solved that issue. The Gauss weapons are the best, and once you have the plans you can roll a couple every day until you get one you like.

I also dilute all of my radX and Rad away and keep a small stack of those in case I pick up too many rads from enemies
---
Well my friend got banned for duping 5 things that he gave to me for some reason
---
Yeah I played today, didn't get banned, so that's a plus.
---
Wait what‚Äôs going on?
---
Welcome. We hand out cookies or spankings depending on our whims.
---
So simple yet genius
---
I've never seen you before. I NEED AN ADULT! STRANGER DANGER STRANGER DANGER. Mace, tasers and rape whistles out everyone!
---
Woo!
---
That's another problem, if they should ban people who got their hands on a duped items, the only people who were probably playing the game now would be those folks that are playing due to game pass. If you interacted with another player there is a possibility that you had a duped item, making you, while unaware, part of the problem.
---
Back in the day we duped the shit out of nuka colas and nowadays we dupe presents so yea caps were always duped
---
Feel you, I am still plugging away at both reputations but man, it is slow going! üòï
---
Is it going to cost 150 atoms to buy each rank?
---
Screws and ballistic fiber are probably the two best selling base components.
---
Not so much that I didn't look at the materials needed when making the ammo, but that I still continued to loot gunpowder due to habit and normally not having enough of it, and never thinking to check just how much it was accumulating now i wasn't using it.
---
Same with plastic - i'm over 5k on that now i no longer use it for shotgun shells, still pick up every plastic item i find, though this isn't so much an issue as it gets scrap boxed.
---
i mean when someone disconnects from the server their workshop stays as is and the icons are just bugged. i have to dashboard every time i server hop to get them to come up correctly
---
Can confirm same issue while the missile launcher (quad, homing) is out. Switching to another weapon resolves the issue.
---
I'm level 333 with all the Vault armor sets from actually earning them in the raids, and I have 4 mules full of god rolls I'm waiting to sell when my caps drop again. Tell me more about how it's just my opinion and not playing the game right.
---
Strange, that exists in my game.
---
You haven't played a lot of games have you? Let me introduce you to drops with a 1/1000th chance to drop
---
Actually killed one of those once. Used explosives.
---
True.  I'd still feel bad.
---
I dont see the package
---
The stretch after 30 definitely feels harder. It's a tough spot in the game
---
Maaaaan, I wasted so much time trying to figure out why those pet emotes weren't working.
---
Nope sorry not me, not a bloodied or melee build so would of had no reason to buy that.
---
Because you subscribe to this subreddit.
---
The Wastelanders Story wasn‚Äôt just fetch missions.. still why get yourself banned? You may later regret it
---
False
---
If hackers and exploiter are able to destroy a game, then the game needs to check itself
---
Yeah. It sucks. Especially, if you‚Äôre melee.
---
You do realize they can track trades right?
---
Nice! Mine was garbage as per usual haha
---
I made an alt and i found him at about level 10 near charleston station. I was bored and decided to follow him and take pictures. I followed him and kept luring enemies to him. I got bored after about 30 mins though
---
... OMG that nostalgia ... \*sniff\*
---
Not only that but at that level you're getting more SCORE from the weekly repeatable while grinding a single level for the daily and setting yourself up better for legendary perks in the future. I would rather spend 30 minutes grinding a level on my main and get all that extra SCORE than spend 15-20 minutes making a new character everyday and rushing to level 3.
---
30k cap limit is fine
---
Light weight. Here... Have a sniff of this pipe.
---
Wow. Didn't know about it!
---
I can't even begin to explain the pain caused by the amount of stupid coming out of the two of you.
---
And can you make a new character?
---
Don‚Äôt forget SBQ dying in 7 seconds instead of turning into a server unified event
---
It was a limited time bundle, it will recycle its way back eventually.
---
Or don't cheat
---
Probably most bought modules due to the cheap b2525s and be25s....
---
This is the first ive heard about the ban wave.. score kinda turned me off of the game and i dont play every day anymore. 
---
Was it a big bang wave? Any information on how many? Super excited, it sucked to have cheaters crashing the servers.
---
Seems this only happens in certain areas. Fort Defiance is one of the 'rubber band' zones, where Camp Adams seemed fine.
---
Valid in single player. Not valid in multi player
---
I‚Äôll probably end up doing that if there isn‚Äôt anything I can do
---
While button for selecting Ammo Factory is enabled, and terminal can control it separately from the one built into the console next to it, blueprinting doesn't work. No idea how to blueprint it.
---
I got a bloodied gauss minigun
---
Don't run a bloodied build. But got a junkies one too
---
Those quests dont require other people
---
The only plans you can buy from vendors for the Lever, are scopes. You can find prime receiver plans from player vending.
---
Everything else is from crafting/scrapping. Plan on 100-200 rifles before you unlock everything.
---
You can ask for high karma players on the market sub, if you just want something modded. I'm on there as well, and have all mods unlocked for most guns if you don't find anyone else on XB.
---
I think you are pretty much ignoring what im saying...
---
But oh well works for you.
---
Its not about being ignorant. Im just stating what is happening to me
---
Ok I am on if you would like to get on with me. I do not have a nuclear keycard though
---
though not at your level, I'm 145, I recently needed the Science perk for something or other I was making, and seen I didn't have it; luckily I had quite a few level ups saved...so ya, I can see it happening..
---
Servers can be like that sometimes
---
they went god mode, then popped 100 bobbleheads, ate food. and were getting 4k xp per kill. then you simply walk around invisible shooting everything. thers plenty of vidoes on the process if you wantto risk getting banned. me na i'll just get my cosmetic items in due time.
---
It just feels punishing, took me 10 missiles and 200 rounds of 5.56 to kill a legendary sentry bot that melted my health in seconds, every mission I do completely depletes my ammo, stims and breaks all my armour and weapons and I have to spend over an hour farming that stuff again.
---
It's really ruining what I thought could be a new favourite game of mine :(
---
Most of the time I play on my private server 
---
 So no
---
Rolled a bow worth up to 10.5k caps on the Fed. Sold it to my best friend for 10k on his offer. Can‚Äôt remember the perks tho. Ended up working out really well for his current build and I‚Äôm up on the caps!
---
Same.  I'm no cheating person.
---
The guy I saw was dropping his p.a on the scorchbeast event as if to brag.  Like "look at me. I have it all"
---
Hence why I think he cheated.
---
With a banwave currently underway? Nope.
---
And.. I'll say it again and again.. add vertical FUCKING HALF WALLS
---
In that level you really start to get punished for not having a build started. Also don't use missiles they 100% suck haha just stick with it. Eventually the game becomes super easy
---
And post removed because it was horse shit
---
This is actually a good analogy. The dupers are in the wrong, no question, but Bethesda have handled dupers and cheaters badly since day one. You have plenty of easily influenced or tempted players seeing people wielding duped Legacy or hacked weapons seemingly without reprisal or at level 900 because of re-occuring xp glitches, while they are level 100 after six months of low-INT foodbuild play and wielding a Mutant's Rolling Pin. It makes sense that a lot of people who normally wouldn't have duped felt there wasn't much danger in getting involved this time. Jealously or seeing people seemingly better off than them for less works makes people salty and salty people make stupid choices they can't take back.
---
You punish cheaters ASAP, rather than letting them linger to share their methods and tempt weak wills.
---
I'm just thankful I made a group of friends early on who were supportive and free with gifts and trades. With some exceptional luck over my year+ of playing and friends knowing I was doing certain builds I've got enough godrolls and decent equipment that I was never tempted personally, nor does my playstyle (RP and screenshots) gain any real advantage from that stuff. Hell, killing things too fast ruins battle screenshots, because everything is gibs before you can capture a shot.
---
That said I'm certainly not going to pass up a B2525 Fixer if the chance arises for my Commando. At this point we won't even be able to tell what is duped and what isn't.
---
There is half walls?
---
Bah! the only Fixer that's ever dropped for me is the one that fell off the workbench after I *made* it..
---
I'm not ignoring what you're saying, you're ignoring the facts presented to you. You're wrong, if you actually check, you'll prove it to yourself. Yes, you are being ignorant.
---
I'd recommend making a NW specific character. All rewards are account based, not by character.
---
You won't receive the bonus xp and caps on your main in Adv, but you'll have a leveled alt. 
---
I have two NW character that are both 100+ in Adv from NW xp only.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never used a dense mod... The name just came to me and I associated it with radiation resistance for some reason....not sure why. Could be that last bowl, who knows.  Haha
---
Nope, thats the problem.
---
It's not like you've lost 1000 hours of progress or anything
---
Elaborate
---
Yes, every day. I‚Äôve been working on the fastest route to level up once and can do it in under 10 minutes now. Just leave the vault without getting anything, discover the moon shiners shack, then the lumber mill, then the homestead on the way to the wayward. Fight a few ticks and scorched on the way. Go in the wayward and skip through all the dialog, then level 3 should pop.
---
Doing it this way when your main is at a high level makes it easy to complete the challenge super fast each day and then just go about your business with your main.
---
Not everyone has played since Day one. Pretty sure those people are happy to have tha chance to aquire those items.
---
I also want new stuff in the atom shop but i'd rather see bethesda focusing on bugs and new content than have new stuff in the atom shop every week.
---
almost all garbage but i did get my first legendary fixer roll, a stalkers explosive. i was pretty hyped even though stalkers isn't that popular.
---
No actual confirmation yet, but a lot of the bans appear to be temporary (under investigation) suspensions. 
---
You might get lucky, but again, its like the RNG - you roll the dice &amp; you take your chances.
---
I like this idea. consider it stolen.
---
Right? Like, damn, tell the congregation.
---
I couldnt agree more.
---
Im about 70 rolls into the Gauss Shotty, still havent rolled a bloodied one. I get why people dupe. Without it, most people wont have what they currently have anyways. And that would make the game an even worse grind fest than it already is. If the RNG was better, then duping would be much less of a problem. But then again, people wouldnt stick too long to the game because stuff is easier to get. Solving one problem creates another one.
---
Or well this is just how I see it.
---
From update 20 patch notes: 
---
&gt;**Perk Card Packs:** Fixed a bug preventing some Perk Cards from appearing in Perk Card Packs 
---
I don't remember how I got the card myself but maybe it was affected by this until the recent update
---
Sure. You said add Triangle foundations and ceilings. I was adding on, they need to add vertical half walls too.
---
What has that got to do with dupers?
---
I feel like the if they were to actually perma ban people they would have done it in the first place. There's probably thousands of accounts concerned and eventually they will lift.
---
I remember when I first started playing back in early April I seen the vault boy power armor skin but I had no power armor at the time. Now that I have almost every piece of PA they don‚Äôt bring it back. I really wish they‚Äôd bring that back along with the responders backpack
---
You're absolutely right, I knew I was missing one. Will edit it into the list.
---
You can tell he's obviously duped. He's duped and is incapable of realizing people can have wildly different experiences, and therefore every single person who plays just MUST have duped, right?
---
 The 3 things I know its used for are:
---
1. ultracite PA
---
2. ammo
---
3. crafting mutation serums.
---
serious question. wtf is duping? can it be done on console? (please dont explain how) i play legit, but im worried that ive accidentally bought stuff from dupers, especially mounts... there were a lot if those for cheap a few weeks back
---
Permanently banned or suspended, pending investigation? There's a huge difference.
---
It's on gamepass now. They've gained a lot of new players.
---
Permad he is pissed
---
*"It's a trap!!"*
---
yeah ik, thats how their bot keeps banning people who didnt even dupe for unknowingly buying and trading for duped things. until they find a way to get rid of hackers and dupers that doesn't come with collateral damage they should just hold the L on things like this and code better in the future
---
Bless you kind vault dweller. I totally forgot about using old level ups. I took a little time away from the game. Thank you again so much.
---
well if your husband randomly out of the blue figured out how to dupe. but was smart enough to know not to do it on his. this means he has been doing it on yours alot more than 4 times. typically they ban those who are big offenders. and seldom ever reverse. in most cases the effected say tehy only did it by mistake or only once. in hopes that they can get the ruling overturned. but once again tehy have no sympathy and since you or him arnt big streaming personalities. they arn't worried about the fallout so to speak. sorry your husband got you baned
---
Yeah at this point you need a built.  
---
and event tho they are still rare, at your level. you would need a legendary weapon.
---
When you get over this point, and actually have a good built, with a decent legendary. it will get better i promise
---
Hang in there!!
---
Nah lol I don‚Äôt use it
---
I believe he means the fairly limited and slow rotation of a very select group of items.
---
Don't use any Explosive Weapons at all!  Weapons with the Explosive Legendary  Effect used to be the Meta back in the day but Bethesda thought they were too strong so the effect got nerfed and since there's no distinction between the Effect and actual Weapons (coding oversight is my guess) Explosive Weapons got hit with the nerf too.
---
I strongly suggest that you decide what kinda of weapon/build your going to use and use this site to plan it out: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Very selfish reply from you there. Have a good day.
---
nah, gotta play the cheap lottery man. Got fucked as usual though.
---
Fingers crossed they just considered Tuesday the last day of week 2, getting real annoying that I can‚Äôt even put in a ticket since their support page is down
---
that's what the lategame is. Anyone using bloodied/junkies/instigating will one shot all the things
---
I got nothing all garbage
---
Thanks, most of my perks are geared towards damage resistance and rifle damage, is that a decent build?
---
Very selfish point to make there. Have a good day.
---
So your complaint about mules is irrelevant.
---
I absolutely agree with the bans but I think they should have been quicker and stricter.
---
 As a level 400 player who has acquired all of my godly gear through playing the game normally it saddens me to see people try to justify their cheating actions. 
---
 I have a stash absolutely packed full of almost every kind of godly or good rolled rifles and pistols that I have collected legitimately from just playing the game.  I even have two legacy weapons that I have never really used that I obtained through playing the game normally.
---
 I have never used a trading site. If I even thought a piece of gear was duped I would stay 100 miles away. If I thought a piece of gear on a player vendor was duped because it was a really good weapon at a cheap price I would stay away.
---
I see all these posts and comments of people trying to justify their cheating /duping /exploiting because RNG is shitty.  While I agree RNG is shitty that does not excuse cheating.
---
 My full stash of awesome weapons is proof you don't need to cheat in this game.  Hell you don't even need a trading site to obtain a large amount of good gear.
---
Those who cheat /dupe or exploit should be permanently banned.  That is my opinion and I will stand by that.
---
Its not really facts to me when what i experience for real is nothing like you say.
---
showing me words that says its one thing, does not mean thats what its really like.
---
That is like showing the bible to to a an atheist, and calling it facts just because the book said it is.
---
I know the raiders can get you a named plasma rifle if you were super nice to rara. Don't think the settlers have anything like that
---
Make sure you do all the quests with both sides leading up to the raid though
---
Nah im good. you convinced me, that you are the one who knows how things work and can define how much RNG is the right.
---
The dupers will all have had different motives. Some will have been doing it out of greed, and some such as myself were doing it to help out the same people who had nothing and as a result *still* couldn‚Äôt get anything good. I put in around a thousand hours and not once did I roll anything usuable. Everything I got was dumb luck. I started out trading good when I got a B5025 handmade out of a vendor for 3000 caps. I used that to get my first legacy, an AAE+A Ultracite laser rifle. From there I just kept trading and I managed to get a BE90 laser rifle and lost it to the glitch that put it in my vending machine. Someone bought it. I eventually got my hands on a 2* BE laser rifle but fuck me sideways I had to pay outta the nose for that. From there, the dupe came out and I saw a way to fuck the pooch that raped me. So my duping story is both revenge and wanting to help out the people in the same situation as I was.
---
Zorbo comes to your house to give it back.
---
just think for the next 7 weeks. he gets no score or little goals to keep him buzy. just more mindless xping for basically nothing.
---
The only vendor I‚Äôve come across that was fishy was someone selling one item - holiday gifts - for 10 caps each. But there were 21 MILLION of them in the slot. The title was ‚ÄúHoliday gift (21376551)‚Äù and I was thinking ‚ÄúIs that a serial number?‚Äù Then when I got to the slider I realized what was going on. There were like 7 other players at the camp buying gifts and dropping all their known plans and items in paper bags all over the place. I noped outta there.
---
Because this game doesn‚Äôt cater to completionists.  While you may have a fair amount of ‚Äúgood weapons‚Äù a lot of players aren‚Äôt content with that. Most have a few specific weapons that they want whether it‚Äôs a b2525 fixer, a bloodied swing speed meat hook, or a tse dragon.  Unfortunately seeking out these weapons is a battle with rng you‚Äôre not going to win. There are over 105,000 legendary combos for weapons and 300,000 combos for armor... Let‚Äôs be real nobody‚Äôs finding that fun unless they‚Äôre really fuckin bored. Ways to fix this system could include specific weapon drops from certain enemies (for example legendary deathclaws dropping legendary gauntlets) or making murmurgh drops more specific (ex having separate categories for pistols, rifles, and heavy weapons respectively).  Alternatively they could just remove the scrip limit or make it much higher than it is. At the rate you are able to buy 3 star weapons now, there‚Äôs an absolutely minute chance you‚Äôre ever gonna roll what you want unless you play this game every day for 50 years (I guess that‚Äôs probably what they‚Äôre going for huh).  Until the day they change the legendary system I won‚Äôt look down on a single duper because 95% of the god roll weapons out there are only there because of dupes. Sorry but the system is broken which is why exploits like the recent one are so popular.
---
(Source cited for number of possible weapon drops is bad_company_sarge)
---
Edit: original post claimed over 300,000 weapon combinations as I confused the weapons figure with the armor one.  This has been fixed to reflect the amount of possible rolls accurately.
---
The evidence seems to suggest I know a lot more than you. Downvote me all you like, bitches, I'm the one enjoying the game while you cry about it.
---
Definitely the secret service armor and jetpack. Roll for an armor piece with the chameleon perk for stealth. And the jetpack may seem trivial or expensive, but trust me it‚Äôs a game changer. Just need the SS chest to attach the jetpack to
---
No. Hacked guns are still in game afaik. Really hope they delete those next.
---
Not players injecting money into the game like the existing player base.
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
If you want gauss weapon, do it with foundation.  
---
I regret doing it with crater for this reason alone....
---
I got slops. I didnt think you could get so many harpoon guns in such a short time. I've only gotten 2 fixers as drops, a mutants and a nocturnal. 
---
Wish they would make it so you could craft all weapons with legendary modules. You may not get the drop you want all the time, but at least itd be a weapon you could use.
---
This is exactly the mentality he‚Äôs talking about though- ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not the absolute best it‚Äôs trash‚Äù. Why? Does literally everyone HAVE to drive a Ferrari? No, every gun in the game can get you there, a Ferrari may just get you there faster.
---
Furious stacks up to 45 or 50% (I‚Äôm still unclear on which) over 9 or 10 shots. On a fast weapon like a minigun that fires 20shots a second, that‚Äôs half a second of firing. And it has zero downsides, as opposed to Junkies where you‚Äôre taking a decent chunk of negative stats. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with the concept of rarity- every MMO has it. I think the problem is the pure RNG aspect of it. Look at Legendary weapons in the early years of World of Warcraft- incredibly rare, but that was due to the difficulty of crafting them more so than the impossible drop rates (they had very low drop rates as well, but not nearly as low as godrolls in ‚Äò76). Getting one was a sign of luck but also a sign of putting in hard work and being successful. ‚Äò76? Pure luck and grinding.
---
Completing feed the people gives canned meat stew, arguably the most important reward, in that it is a 5% XP bonus for 1 hr.
---
to that end, worth it even if only one of the consoles survives. 
---
Explore the building - there's a couple spots where you should be able to defend 2 of the consoles plus the hopper without too much difficulty.
---
Foundation. Stealth suit and gauss shotty are awesome.
---
No I still need help what time will you be on
---
Alas nobody is there to respond, all my tickets just get auto locked by a bot...
---
When you create bethesda account there is a little square with saying " I read the terms of services" , see yeah you didn't read that
---
It's when glitches are used to create duplicates, and yes they exist on all platforms.
---
No need to worry, having duped items that you aquired in good faith won't cause you any problems.
---
You can get stealth armor without siding with foundation
---
As all things should be
---
shes sitting in that cave saying her head hurts.
---
I raided with crater, then decided to keep all the gold for myself, 
---
Make sure you have Progressed all the way with both factions before you decide to raid
---
So do the dailies!
---
What? Creater has a gauss weapon and you can get the full rewards from both sides....
---
Of course man will add u
---
Personally, after doing them four times. (4 characters) Not much changes. A few NPCs might get killed off or survive. And the rewards are underwhelming. I split, or kept all the gold. Let's just say gold is easier to get than your reputation. Just like in real life...
---
I think half width walls would be great, maybe a place able doorway (for example that covers half of a foundation so you could use the doorway and a half wall together). 
---
To be completely honest they should give us the basic tools for building. Like why am I limited to 2 styles of fence when there are multiple different version both in the game and also in FO4.
---
be happy , u could be banned cuz those were duped weapons- random reddit user
---
Well you rely a lot on shotguns and semi auto rifles in the begining, since thats mostly what you get.
---
I wouldnt focus on damage resistance. since later you will most likely go for unyeilding legendary gear in the higher levels.
---
It can be really punishing to do one built early on, and then wanting to change as soon as you get your first good legendary, that mostly doesnt work with any early level builds
---
What is this score points / ranks anyway?
---
I'm really new to the game.
---
Thankfully I don't know first hand what exactly happens, I've been pretty lucky with my time on Fo76 so most of my weapons are lucky drops or script rolls. However from what I roughly can gather the ban hammer just kind of comes down seemingly on everyone, which is why there is an outcry when these things happen because unfortunately there is collateral damage. Although I think if you contacted support to open a ticket you could argue your case and I'm sure they would appreciate that you simply thought you had found an amazing deal from a vendor of a player who didn't understand what they were selling.
---
Again though, I don't have experience with it first hand so I can't say for certain this is what happens. Also I only saw that there had been another dupe exploit because I followed a market place subreddit and it had been the talk of the town for the last two weeks, needless to say any B2525 I saw I didn't buy just to be safe, so it's worth following these places because they often pick up on things very quickly.
---
Truth can upset if not exactly hurt, however you look at this, cheating so easily in games can transfer such attitude to real life.
---
And leave all the duplicate weapons in the game?
---
üëç
---
Some might have just picked up duped items.
---
One of the best rewards so far for sure. Kinda wish it was bigger though.
---
Trade you a rona infested hankie.
---
Have an upvote.
---
I actually haven‚Äôt done a queen fight with my shotgun dude yet.  If you have the levels, maybe swap for heavy perks during queen fights?  Even though my heavy character only dents her, at least the last time I did one which was a month or two ago.
---
Modules were not on sale for me, sadly.
---
Sounds like something a friend of a duper would say
---
Sounds like a weapon they were developing in the Whitesprings bunker
---
What if Bob doesn't have time to grind due to real life responsibilities, and can only play for a limited time a week or biweekly?  If they can afford it and not have to worry about earning points so they can go back to just playing for fun. Not everyone asking is a whale and shouldn't immediately be frowned upon.
---
Just a point I haven't seen brought up in these post.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured. Thanks.
---
Phew lol
---
they don't care. they broke the TOS and are paying the price.  you think yelling at a company for removing cheaters, is going to somehow bully a billion-dollar company to overturn its findings on a cheater? lol good luck with that one. the game is now free to play on xbox gamepass. they getting a piece of that subscription money now. your friends mean nothing to them.
---
Maybe don‚Äôt cheat?
---
I picked up a B25P Fixer. Haven't used it yet, but I'm looking forward to decking it all out
---
4 mules full of god rolls found by playing. Thats a good one. I would love to see what you call god roll...
---
Yeah fuel the fear ...
---
Adios, bon voyage, auf wiedersehn...
---
Good bye!
---
Nor I...Nor anyone...but still likely true. Though because of the bans nobody will openly admit it.
---
Yeah. I was disappointed with gauss. I‚Äôve rolled 6 of them and haven‚Äôt got anything useful.
---
I use a vanguard tank build with pump shotguns (mostly vampiric with 33% vats, but I also use a few others like the pleasant valley fancy shotgun)
---
They 1-2 shot most everything. 
---
With 90% weight reduction it‚Äôs a breeze to carry a Swiss Army knife of shotguns.
---
your just not creative at all if you really think tracking trades ends muling, i can think of atleast two ways to get around that just off the top of my head. idk you clearly think your super smart just think about it lol
---
I bet sunny's bullion is counterfeit
---
Ok I made a new character but is there suppose to be a hud? Sorry I haven‚Äôt played in awhile
---
Had 210 atoms after I bought everything on release there. So I slapped 1000 atoms in to get the astroturf as I always wanted it for ages and it was never appearing. If I didn't stay up till 6am I'd have went off and missed the flash sale üòÇ. Justified
---
Well damn someone‚Äôs gonna be sleeping on the couch for the next week
---
I doubt it‚Äôs that simple. I don‚Äôt have 100k steel but I do have 30k, plus a couple hundred of each type of flux and a ton of other junk. Built up over a year of playing (not trading; this is all self-gathered). I‚Äôm not banned.
---
Everyone rolling around with god roll weapons means queen dies faster? Better weapons means more damage?
---
I wish i could break some punji boards in Wards face üòÇü§ò

What a shit analogy. You're the one claiming what you believe is fact, with no evidence to back it up, except what you *experience*, which is wrong, has also been proven to be wrong. Data miners have confirmed it, it's in the game files. What else will it take for you to see your ignorance, stop being closed minded and actually check for yourself?!
---
Do you think your game is different from everyone elses? No, it's not. I have provided you with factual information, provided links for you to check and even advised you to search the sub to confirm it for yourself.
---
Yet you still refuse, don't believe it and continue to be ignorant. What a strange individual. Have a good day in your dream world.
---
Have you seen the frontpage?
---
 suspended, pending investigation = banned. they just let you think they are actually reviewing your case.  so if you got that . then you are banned.
---
You're probably right be honest, the char is my heavy gunner and shreds her variety is the spice of life though and wanted to try different weapons than my usual rifles/heavy guns/melee
---
If you side with one side you will get faster reputation, since the heist gives a lot to the one side you pick.
---
And crater will let you buy Gauss plan when you are full reputation with them
---
I see vids on YouTube all the time step by step how to cheat.  They need to go after these guys.
---
Yeah.. Ummm... the three star sale was excellent. Rolled three star weapons and what do ya know I got a b2525 fixer. Crazy stuff. Totally how it happened. Yeah.
---
I'm at work, jealous, i want a bowl. Hehe.
---
What is duping
---
Counterpoint - fuck cheaters.
---
I agree that people should be more calm and understand that there is an investigation process, but what about the people who are found innocent? it's pretty fucked up if people cant play for days, especially if they're paying for Fallout 1st.
---
why is it that every time Bethesda treats their players like absolute dog shit, people keep acting like them saying "oh nvm" fixes everything? They are constantly mistreating their players and offer absolutely *nothing* in return. as if it is compensation enough to be allowed to keep playing the game (that we fucking paid for). its just wrong.
---
Someone else duping has no effect on you just leave them be.
---
Seriously question: What happens if you unknowingly buy a duped weapon from a vendor bot or a player vendor? Can they tell? Is there some sort of digital fingerprint on duped items? I really hope my 3* AA Handmade I bought from a player for 2500 wasn't duped.
---
Well, dupes mean there was an original item that someone found. Duper‚Äôs just replicate it many many times. 
---
Hackers, only on PC afaik, HAVE made weapons and armor that are impossible, though.
---
AAA mobile game
---
Speed demon maxes movement and reload  speed, fixer does not increase it further. But strange in numbers and teamed with a mutant pushes it from +20 to +25.
---
Duping will always exist since the game runs on a very old and very well documented engine. FO76 is basically FO4 with netcode and game-specific updates/add-ons. 
---
And you don't banned if you dupe. You get banned if you blatantly dupe, as in you're carrying impossible amounts of hard-to-get items. Thousands of fluxes, hundreds of weapons, etc. etc. if you happen to pick up a duped item from a vendor (NPC or player) then you're fine. If they banned everyone who touched a dupe they'd probably ban 90% of their playerbase.
---
Got a b2525 combat rifle, ended up using it as part of a package deal for a be flamer
---
Foundation also lets you buy the Gauss plan when you‚Äôre full reputation.
---
They crash the servers
---
I dont know what it looks.like, but I really want that brahmin bbq.
---
Could you stop spamming please? You could just look at recent posts and you would know everything you need to know. What is the point of these questions lmao.
---
You mean on Reddit about all the "bans" ? Yeah sure I have. But picking up 25 Christmas presents doesn't do anything. If you try to pick up 25k of them... That's another thing. 
---
Also getting a duped weapon in a trade won't hurt you. 
---
If you do not do anything intentional against the TOS you are absolutely fine. And absolutely no one duped accidentally in the last weeks
---
the process was simple they simply  "suspended, pending investigation" then perma banned the offender. then nerfed all TSE weapons.
---
they view 1 dupe as bad as 5,000 dupes.
---
banned = banned forever
---
You must be new to the game. None of that is hacking or cheating
---
Unrelated: I love that the alligator critter looks like they are ready for a fun day of jetpacking.  Sort of like a dog with their head out the window of a car.
---
I think if memory serves and I didn‚Äôt play much then kinda dipped in and out. When the Tse dupe cane they outright banned people. Gone. Had to re make your GT, Xbox, and start over from scratch.  Took out about 1/3rd of the player base at the time
---
damn you got mad.
---
Im sorry, i did read it. And still sure it looks legit.
---
But does not change the fact that what i experience is not like this.
---
Im at work, and was not really prepared to provide proof of this lol.
---
ill try and figure out a way to show you
---
I mean....i think it's a reasonable assumption that most of the dudes getting banned for duping are toxic chads anyway. Good riddance.
---
thank you :)
---
Many dupers disagree lol
---
Exactly.
---
Can we stop spreading this false rumor? Seems pretty obvious from the reports here that being logged in has nothing to do with the auto complete bug. Plenty of folks are getting it while logged out well within that time frame. I've personally been logged in everyday during that time frame and never had it happen once before or after the legendary run started. Something else is at play here.
---
For anyone reading this, feel free to drop as many gifts as you want at my camp. Consider it the gift disposal site whenever I log on.
---
This would be nice like a grid system so foundations have like a quadrant style grid to place on
---
The thing is these bans even if temporary completely destroy any hope of finishing the season.  If someone is innocent then BGS is punishing them and they have no recourse.  Why play the season at all then?
---
Sugar Grove is good for fiber?

People spend thousands of dollars in a single event in mobile games, this is like buying bananas for the whales.

ah yes, nothing is real
---
Wait he collects chems? What kind of chems are we talking?
---
If that's the case then their loss. One less paying customer to keep their broken game afloat. Those legacies would've kept me playing for another solid month üòÇ
---
Good. Cheating is cheating.
---
Do all the quests until a side asks u to choose. The. Do all the other sides

Open up your Perk Card loadout and look at the bottom of the screen, you'll see a "Share" option next to the corresponding button you'll need to push (I think it's Y on XB1). 
---
For every 3 points in Charisma you can share 1 point in Perks. So for example, if you have 3 Charisma you can share a 1-point (level 1) Perk Card; 6 points on Charisma you can share 2-points (level 2 Perk Card, two level 1s)
---
Really loved reading this and it resonates with me on a number of fronts. I don‚Äôt think FO76 is for everyone, but those it is for, it is REALLY for.
---
I find it easy to overlook the gripes I hear regularly as it offers me a really compelling gameplay loop that ticks all my boxes. I have a job in the banking sector and have a family to be with and look after, and I only really have the focus and time to devote to one game. This is it, it has been since launch, and by the looks of it it will be for the foreseeable future. I may take a brief hiatus for cyberpunk though as I too love a blade runner reference.
---
I would never cheat an achievable system like S.C.O.R.E. because that‚Äôs taking away from the enjoyment I get from the grind.  However, I would argue the third point about wanting to have the best gear is valid.  If I put hundreds or even thousands of hours into the game I feel I should have the gear I want eventually.  That‚Äôs not the case with 76 unfortunately. You can expect to play this game religiously for literal years and still never get the drops you‚Äôre seeking.  I will say this was improved quite a bit with how wastelanders weapons work.  If you could craft base game weapons the same way I don‚Äôt think as many people would feel the need to dupe or to buy duped weapons/armor from others.
---
Laziness? Not in my case.  Entitlement? Well maybe I suppose but can you really blame me more than you blame the laughable rng system? A simple rework of this and you‚Äôd never see me dupe again. Until then I really don‚Äôt feel bad at all.  If anything I feel bad for the players that don‚Äôt participate in dupes and will never see the item they think is eventually coming :(
---
Be15 vasta fast fill fixer my best drop
---
It's not god roll weapons, but people's builds, buffs and magic/glitched weapons that are killing her so quickly. If you just have a god roll with no buffs, perks etc then you're not taking down the Queen quickly at all.
---
trace the trades and ban the account that is given a lot of items to hold.
---
I‚Äôm totally not sure what that even means
---
Explain it like I am 5 üòÇ
---
 suspended, pending investigation = your banned were just not gonna say that today. because we want it to appear were manually going through every case. this is the same thing they say and almost ever company says to avoid confrontation.
---
Exactly, when player vending started I got a bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet for 125 caps.  Was it a mistake or was it duped?  I can‚Äôt tell you.
---
You're not wrong.
---
Literally no one said that. No one needs an OP gun to solo this game.
---
So you think that all the new content being character locked behind a grind wall is in no way related to the massive duping and game exploits? Hahahaha.
---
Also, unless you launched the nuke yourself on your server, that's a dick move to kill the Queen before others can get in their shots.
---
Should be a Fanny pack lol
---
MedX , mentats for sure because I checked. I had more various brands of booze than chems. And he have like 10 slots.
---
I don't just find them, I buy underpriced ones in vendors and trade my friends for Junkie's stuff when I get other things they want. I'd love to see your gear.
---
Murmgggh gave me an Instigating Conbat shotgun and I haven't been back to her. It's almost nearly a one-hit KO on anything when I target their legs.
---
Only downside is that it's a level 40.
---
Well dupe band happened before, whenever there‚Äôs a huge dupe spree everyone got banned the last two times, than we get the ‚Äú I was banned but I didn‚Äôt dupe I swear! or acting like instead of fixed glitches Bethesda only bans! Not realizing it‚Äôs different people who bans / fix games, than the game is dead and TRADING IS DEAAAAD people come out, than a week or two everyone‚Äôs gonna go back to normal.
---
The problem is right at the front there.
---
Everyone seems to think that the only ‚Äúgood‚Äù handmade is the literal perfect godroll.
---
You have seen the videos of people doing solo Queen kills with nonlegendary weapons right? You don‚Äôt *have* to have a godroll. That‚Äôs what the RNG being tame in this game means- whether or not the RNG blesses you doesn‚Äôt lock you out of ANYTHING in the game. People are just entitled as fuck and feel like they all MUST have that perfect roll because... reasons.
---
I don't have any god tier stuff but I've bought some blooded or AA weapons from time to time, no idea whether those are legit or not.  But tbh, even if someone bought some kind of insta-kill minigun, the correct punishment is just to take the thing off them.  I don't care if it encourages dupers when people buy off them.  If the game wasn't a steaming pile of buggy shit with god-awfully abysmal drop system then this wouldn't be an issue in the first place, so I place most of the blame where it belongs: not the buyers, not even the dupers.
---
Even with the bad RNG, once you‚Äôre lvl 100+(even if you didn‚Äôt specialize your build) there are very few real pve challenges. Of all the games to feel like you need a god tier item, this isn‚Äôt the one. Almost any content you can‚Äôt solo normally is a team event and there are 100 ways to handle any of the in-game content alone. That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt really get. I assume the dupers are just using false accounts, but the people spending a full 30k caps for an item that beefs their bloody build from 2k damage to 2500!? Why risk getting banned for an item that is only useful against event bosses. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
You can make a good set of leather now yourself.
---
Dumb question, but did you actually own the tricentennial edition?  I think there was a bug that gave people who didn't own it access to that stuff and there was a fix that took them away from people who didn't own them.  If you did purchase the special edition and still don't have your stuff I think a support ticket is your only option.
---
the game is free on gamepass they are making money on it even if no one plays it now.
---
No you don‚Äôt want to enjoy the game the way it was intended to be enjoyed.  It was intended that we would also be the raiders, it was intended that we be able to destroy camps, it was intended that we were supposed to be a source of conflict for each other.  At the end of the day it‚Äôs just people bitching to get what they want And you are no different.
---
I can confirm this is 100% legit. My grandfather was generous once and he was dead the next day.
---
Why would your husband dupe things so u have nice things. U have to own what he‚Äôs duping in the first place. Doesn‚Äôt make sense
---
That's a lot of words to whine &amp; not make any real points.
---
Fuck the cheaters &amp; dupers, bon voyage to em.  Hopefully that includes you OP you crybaby.  Go play FO4 with the mindless NPC's that understand you.
---
It's quite clear at this point that they don't want any fun to be had in their game
---
Rare items not rare, no oh shit look at my drop! 
---
Server stability reduced because some prick has 200k of each item. 
---
My level 200 character isn‚Äôt as powerful as your lower level cus of your god guns your mate gave you. 
---
Taking actual features of the game down, vendors, displays for weeks upon weeks. (And therefore pulling away the already slim resources of the devs to fix issues instead of working to push out new content)
---
New content items become untradable and reduce the viability of trading in the long term as all new content will now follow suit.
---
End game content which is already sparse is breezed through if everyone has god tier guns and so what is the point? 
---
What is the point of playing if you‚Äôre not chasing something better. If everyone has the best shit they ruin the game economy then leave when they‚Äôre bored. And those that are left have what? Removed game features locked behind grind walls and a ruined economy. Thanks dupers üëç
---
I've seen things you wanderers wouldn't believe. Assaultrons on fire in the mainframe room of Site Charlie. I watched plasma beams glitter in the dark near Fissure Prime. All this XP will be lost in time, like 95% shots in VATS. Time to log off.
---
Me too. I only did the mystery pick once and I got my only fixer to ever drop, a Mutant's, and since I have 7 mutations, I literally screamed for joy lol. Although the bomber jacket from BOS tech drops is hideous, it was still an awesome feeling to get it the hard way a few days ago. I hate that you're forced to wear pajamas underneath the jacket.
---
Score Rank an XP goes up every level. By rank 20  its 1475...rank 21 1500 etc etc. By 50 its alot.  Imagine 100
---
Snowflakes bitched until almost all conflict was removed from the game, you fucking snowflake.
---
*But does not change the fact that what i experience is not like this*
---
What you're experiencing is **NOT** fact. You are mistaken with what you seem to be experiencing.
---
Again, have a good day!
---
I saw someone level 1300 the other day. I can only imagine they used the God mode exploit to get to that level. I'd rather believe they exploited than imagine someone has spent the entire last year playing fallout 76 24/7 to get to that level.
---
Oh damn. With a dupe wave as big as the one we just had I wonder if the game can hold out with something like that
---
At 286 u must have all the cards or a shed load of unused points
---
Are you on PC? Looking for some help getting a revive for the backpack.
---
A couple hundred hours and I still don‚Äôt have a single ‚Äúgod‚Äù or even what I would call good roll on a gunü§°
---
I don't remember all the legendary effects that are "magical" and I'm @ work atm -- check out Angryturtle from youtube, he has a comprehensive video about this glitch
---
It's Bethesda's fault because they fucking made the game. Exploits should definitely be addressed and fixed, but someone taking advantage of a developer's mistake should not be banned unless they are adversely affecting other players or using third party cheats, like the inventory steal hack a while back. 
---
Also, lol @ you wanting to ban players because they're doing something you find annoying.
---
They did say on their forums most are just temporary. At least we now know we can dupe as many holiday gifts and ammo as we like just not weapons and armour
---
What build is the most exciting?
---
how dense can you be?
---
there is. I've seen a few people saying they've not had one. Not sure what the fix was though i'm afraid
---
"I didn't dupe it was my husband" you gonna blame it on the dog next?
---
Depends what they do. Who they ban. How they deal with the duplicated stuff in game now. The obvious thing would be to roll back servers to last Wednesday and then ban everyone who did it before it became public.
---
I've noticed that Ward works perfect on private servers, but will move around on publics.
---
Whether it's something to do with private vs public specifically, or just the amount of time the server is running, idk.
---
(Why they didn't just remove the code for his previous schedule in the first place, I'll never understand.)
---
The answer is a very complicated, very hard to stress kind of answer that ultimately puts anyone's rightly concerned mind at rest: Oops
---
not players breaking the ToS like the existing player base
---
already too much trouble with them, exploits, duping, god mod, real money shop...new players or players playing after removing spawn never got them from drop. Call it what you like, fixing, removing, balancing game, nerfing,... legacy items doesnt have place in normal game.
---
I run full health.. so no?
---
Yes, builds can do this. However the queen dying within a minute is much more prevalent now than it was two weeks ago. You don‚Äôt honestly believe that everyone changed their builds to optimum the week a major duping glitched became widespread, do you? Magically a large portion of players ‚Äògot gud‚Äô when legacy weapons were going for 5k caps? 
---
I‚Äôm not the only one seeing this. Scroll further down the post and there are now multiple people mentioning it.
---
You just gotta know how to dupe smart! Use a burner account spread the items over multiple accounts and wait out the ban! After a few months you can sell your awesome items for mass profit on eBay and game flip ü§´
---
Are you online?-I still need serums
---
Nah mate, don‚Äôt have one
---
I do have a husband in the dog house though
---
I never knew you could dupe ammo. Now that I think of it, this player vendor I found had 10k of three different types. I bought 5k of one but took the 10k of 5mm because it was free. I hope it wasn't duped. Can they track that? I put it in my vendor and someone bought like 2k of it.
---
its there took me a while to find it as its picture doesnt resemble a door.
---
  Making lots of caps can be tough at lower levels - I think I was beyond L100 before I consistently had more than 6k or so at any given time.   
---
Loot everything.  Keep what you need, scrap, bulk, and sell the rest to bot vendors.  There are very few junk items which you need more than 50.
---
Don't forget those aid items - you don't need 300 stimpacks in inventory :)
---
We had a vendor on xb with 8 million gifts at 1c each.
---
Yeah I bought it and I do own it
---
You would have to be a proper idiot to spend 5 bucks of real money on in game items though
---
Keep him, no one is too rich to throw away a friend right?
---
Xbone unfortunately. 
---
just make a new post here. I am sure someone will help out. Also. May as well do the water revive as it's part of swimmer
---
Why should I care?
---
It should be in the walls section if i remember correctly
---
Ah ok.  I guess try putting in a ticket and see where that takes you.  Best of luck.
---
I was on XBOX as well when I found it.
---
I'm interested to see how this all plays out, especially with a new event coming soon. Some people that have the massively OP weapons didn't dupe and weren't investigated, or at least haven't been yet, so the damage is done
---
Awwww is someone mad they got banned
---
All I was getting was b2525 fixers for some reason...
---
She was always expected to fly around for a little bit, but before Wastelanders we could target her wings and cripple them, which would force her to land until they healed back up. 
---
Now she is invincible to crippled limbs, and will more often than not fly around out of reach for minutes at a time, land briefly and fly around again. Extremely aggravating for melee characters and your "Average Joe" who isn't packing the overpowered weapons.
---
I wish they would make an alternative way to get her to land if they don't want us crippling her wings like before. Maybe she could spawn additional enemies when she takes off, and after they are killed or a certain amount of waves are cleared she could land again, but as it is now it's all up to random chance that her AI decides to stay on the ground long enough to deal significant damage.
---
the garage door is under walls, like midway through the list
---
I just started playing again recently. How was it nerfed?
---
Seems like you have a lot more time to spend posting on reddit now, what's the next game you're going to be playing?
---
I put my unstoppable force in the vending too, now I want it so bad
---
The only thing I want is the level 99 reward so yeah will probably buy some levels
---
This boy saltier than Carthage.
---
The game becomes sentient and throws you in a shower, updates your resume, and forces you outdoors into sunlight.
---
It's a carhole!
---
You won't get banned for presents, there's people with billion in there stash and they've done nothing about them for months. Same people that duped millions of ammo to no consequence
---
Every time I go to The Whitespring my game crashes. Every damn time.
---
I don't know what it is about that place but my xbox hates it. I can go to the train station all I want but if I cross the road.... just put on a two minute timer and I'll be frozen before it goes off.
---
I don't even go to the enclave bunker for tech data anymore.
---
haaakaaiiü§ö
---
Yeah, RNG is shitty, waa waa. But it doesn't justify hacking, exploiting, or cheating.  
---
And there's gonna be people tryna blame Bethesda for not fixing all the hacks or cheats or exploits like there's a way to be completely exploit, cheat or bug-free.
---
+karma
---
you are asking to much for this people lmao I hope all of them will get banned
---
Much appreciated!
---
Asylum dress.  Red, blue, yellow.
---
Yeah, comes with a shovel and everything.... Except I still have to hunt down a shovel whenever I do the Buried with Honor daily.... Bethesda Logic‚Ñ¢.
---
Ahh i remember those days... Good times
---
A few photos or video would be fun to see.
---
nice, i tell you solution for problem and im shit. OK
---
1. Multiple shutdowns of player vending and display cases due to rampant duping. 
---
2. When dupes rely on laggy servers, dupers go to extreme lengths to create that lag, ruining events and making gameplay extra laggy. 
---
3. When dupes rely on crashing servers we all see an increase in server instability, much like the lag issue. 
---
4. New endgame items have been introduced into the game and they‚Äôre non-tradable. That‚Äôs not a coincidence, it‚Äôs to prevent them being duped. 
---
5. Earliest example of in-game co sequences is the infamous TSE nerf, which affected all explosive weapons. If those items hadn‚Äôt been duped to oblivion, the nerf would‚Äôve likely not happened. 
---
6. Max carry weight was introduced to combat duping. If not for dupers, you‚Äôd be able to have a single mule that can hold any damn thing you want. 
---
7. Not an issue anymore, but during the Strangler Heart PA duping spree it was near impossible to do a SBQ event without crashing. 
---
8. Heavy explosive energy weapons are the bane of my existence at big events. One or two, not a problem. When half a dozen people are all spamming the boss with them, lag city...and don‚Äôt even get me started on the earrape.
---
Edit: Almost forgot...9. Scrip was removed from Holiday Gifts after they were duped eleventybillion times. Likely impacting the quality of similar event rewards in the future.
---
Fixed just had to relog thanks for the help
---
? xD
---
It used to be a hive of high level legendary ghouls. You could make a sweep around the nuke zone and find 5-6. Then using a few tricks get them all to respawn really quick. It was nearly non stop ghoul slaying.
---
Huge packs of ghouls swarming out of some buildings. Truly amazing.
---
Sorry I misunderstood the question. The last thing I was doing was helping a friend build a new camp in adventure the night before. I don‚Äôt think I logged in until after reset
---
You call that crap people are trying to sell at vendors god rolls? I have been looking for some nice junkies 50cal for months now (even 2 star would do) and nothing. I myslef have some mediocre junkies stuff, its working but nothing special.
---
And you‚Äôre sure it was from murmrgh not another weapons dealer üòÇ
---
Another thing to, following along what you said, most high lvl or unique mmo weapons are actually unique. Either a different texture or the damage, ss, animations, etc. it was very easy to tell who had that item. And, speaking from my rs days, a lot of the best gear was from a specific grind or quest. I remember my poisoned dragon dagger was a couple months of killing ogres in some medieval fight club. Bethesda needs to find, other ways other than RNG or atomic items, to reward the right people with the right items. They have this idea that a lvl 20 and lvl 400 should be on the same playing feeling, which isn‚Äôt a bad goal, but there needs to be a line drawn where your gear should reflect the amount of time you‚Äôve played. That‚Äôs been a core mechanic of almost every rpg, even ESO with the One Tamriel update still made sure it was clear who was new and who had been playing since launch. 
---
I‚Äôm just hoping that Bethesda can figure that out, as it will make their lives easier when duping issues like this pop up(quest specific or incredibly difficult to recreate items), and we‚Äôd get another layer of enjoyment if we do have to grind.
---
Or, you can just eyeball it and drink dirty water until the nerd rage animation pops up, without sticking tape to your tv.
---
I don't dupe.
---
I just don't concern myself with what others decide to do in a video game, Karen. People duping have zero impact on how I choose to play the game, and I think it's scummy for developers to ban people for taking advantage of their oversight which made duping possible in the first place.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm in that catagory. Didn‚Äôt and never have duped but I have the weapons through trade.
---
I lost 3K the first week and it took me most of that week grinding to get back to "on track" which I think was level 21 or 22. 750,000 XP is going to be rough, brother.
---
Imagine all the broken duped 4-5*s
---
Congrats! Best I've done is making it to the final 2, by getting teamed up with 3 high level players who did 95% of the fighting and dying for me while I just tried to hide in my power armor and take potshots occasionally.
---
What is duping?
---
The Responder jumpsuits are rare because you only get them once early on and most players get rid of them to save space without knowing. Each region has a jumpsuit like the Forest camo one that is a very rare drop from any of the events in the region, and there is the Whitespring jumpsuit that was dropping during the Halloween event but not sure where that one originally comes from because the Savage Divide jumpsuit is a different one. There's probably more I can't remember right now but I'm sure somebody has the complete list.
---
I'm not sure those claims are legit tbh. I own a handmade and a legacy laser that I'm pretty sure were duped. I cant be sure of course but I've seen enough of them being traded that its more than likely.  I've had these in my inventory for about 6 months and have never once been touched with the ban hammer
---
Because bloody was to op i could do over 4000 dmg with my smg
---
But then they nerfed bloody and buffed junkies
---
So double weapons, rippers, dragons, explosive harpoon guns etc don't have a place in a "normal" game. And we're both talking about fallout right? A game where I can jump 10 feet in the air holding a 50 cal machine gun that becomes more powerful the more substances I'm addicted to. I see your point, lasers that explode? Absolutely absurd
---
They got caught up in the duping too so they lost a ton of value...forrest camo, tattered rags, leather coats, red, yellow or Forrest dresses.  Dont know if it's worth grind anymore.
---
I can do It now
---
This is a such a Karen post

Oh there's actually a whole list of rare outfit drops for each region you can chase. The jumpsuits you refer to are the bos, whitesprings caddy and white powder jumpsuits. They drop together as a rare savage divide event reward. However one of them (I think whitesprings) also was an uncommon reward from mischief night so some of us have that one on it's own.
---
I still have never seen any nerf to bloodied. It's still 80% at 20% hp. They also never really buffed junkies. It's always been 50% with 5 addictions. They only made it so addictions persisted on death
---
I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm being a Karen, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt dupe just that you should expect consequences for it. When you dupe it makes the game less fun for everyone else, grinding for an item is hard especially if you‚Äôre a bloodied build so when someone comes along and just dupes an item you worked hard to get it‚Äôs frustrating.
---
I like it.
---
Welcome to 76!
---
I assume you're new here? This has been an issue since they first added the outfit, 2 years ago.
---
I do agree with your earlier suggestion about actually balancing the game
---
Friends asked me if i could dupe them a weapon each (3 in total). Didnt want to be a selfish asshole so I did it. Received a temp. ban. They didn't get a ban. Worth it. Happy for my friends and im just gonna wait and see what happens :)
---
I could never be as stupid as you.
---
Answer me this: if myself and countless others know and understand this does that mean we're some sort of genuises on a higher plain than yourself? Or are we normal and you're just not as bright?
---
Your game is no different than anyone elses.
---
I thought the same thing too. Told myself i wasn't going to do a bloodied build cuz ZZzzzZZZ but...i guess the game had different plans for me as i got so much bloodied/unyielding/bolstering stuff right out the 50 gate. Honestly, it's actually really fun if you aren't running it in PA. You  have to pay attention to your health and take cover/runaway if you're taking to much damage, feels more like i'm actually fighting stuff instead of just shooting a bunch of bullets into a sponge. Now if you're in PA yea...it's a real snoozefest in that thing....you literally can't die w/ EP (sans poison of course)......
---
Looked like a sarcasm/fun post to me at first, because you said since yesterday. The time where the ban hammer hits hard :D
---
Okay idk buf for me it feels like they nerfed it
---
In any multiplayer of coop game it affects other people. Might not always be much or might not be obvious but it still does.
---
The dupes directly contribute to the amount of overpowered, super mutated and top tier weapon wielding players who wreck events, how is this not creating a problem?
---
You can have a dog! It's just a very rare spawn
---
Gorgeous!
---
I didn‚Äôt dupe, I was just asking
---
I honestly think the people that have made those post have like 5 of each legacy in their account and just came here to seek attention
---
Important to note that if has to have at least 1/100 left. Not totally depleted.
---
Ok thanks :)
---
The Field Scribe outfit does this as well. I really like the look of that backpack so it's what I've been wearing a lot lately.
---
Well he clearly knew he was abusing the TOS right?
---
I hate RMT and refuse to participate. The max I will sell anything for is 30k and I'm very rarely at zero caps, and many players sell valuable weapons without realising their worth. Not sure if I've got a Junkie's .50 currently but if you're on Xbox I can hook you up with a magic shotgun and minigun which will decimate pretty much everything in the game at the moment.
---
They nerfed explosives. But that was a long time ago. They have definitely not nerfed bloodied
---
Im not saying my game is different, what i am saying is that i dont think the system you are talking about is working.
---
Red is the rarest. Then Forest and yellow. Then pink. In 120 hours of looking i've only found 1 yellow. Blue isn't rare. I find a lot of them I currently have 4.
---
The guy in question was 749.
---
Games not THAT good to do such a grind..
---
Not yet anyway.
---
Right?  Where the hell are all these coming from. I had to double check to make sure I knew the plan
---
Bethesda fanboys are a dogmatic bunch. 
---
Never remind them about horse armor. Lmao.
---
Yeah I know.  I find this all to be hilarious to be honest with you.
---
 Keep that ban hammer coming Bethesda!
---
Day 1 Beta Player here aswell.
---
Never had problems with ban waves in the Past aswell.
---
Yeah i know that back then a tse pump was one of the beste wespons in the game because explosive was op on shotguns and ts was also broken on shotguns
---
I promise I don‚Äôt dupe, I was only asking because I bought some legacies that could‚Äôve been duped and I won‚Äôt be on until Friday so I want to know if I banned be then that‚Äôs all.
---
Nostalgia is great, but mostly this changed when everyone started one-shotting all the ghouls and then the respawn mechanic was altered for anti-fun regulations.
---
It is God mode. but I like it because I feel I cause real damage and enemies don't become bullet sponges.
---
I don't lock up any of my resources and I've had more than a few players who dropped in when I was around drop different gifts for me. One was looking through my camp and dropped 100 christmas presents - I had missed the event where these came from so had no idea what they were, I've opened one or two so far but is it possible those were duped? I assumed it was something you got a lot of in the event. Would having them cause them to look at banning me?
---
This is where I always become wary of the bans, how do you know if they pick up someone not doing anything wrong but maybe picking something up unknowingly.
---
Because someone did a cost/profit analysis and it wasn't fiscally responsible from a shareholders standpoint. Turns out there is no money in fixing things, adding "new content" however brings old and new players within billing range.
---
Im actually not sure but the ban wave this time may not only be because of Duping but maybe other glitches for example SCORE or ATOM based glitches.
---
Maybe they threw all of them in one bucket.
---
"Gamer community." Yikers.
---
The whitesprings drops with the mega bundle in savage divide you get white powder, whitesprings, and bos jumper all for the same event reward.  Alot of people get it in uranium fever.
---
You know that what you are buying might be duped?
---
I get it :) I think it would not even let me to log in the game if that was the case tho
---
With the atoms I have plus what I'll get on the board, I should be able to buy the last 14 ranks roughly. I'd be a complete moron to spend those atoms now on ranks that are easier to obtain. Save them for the grindy ranks at the end.
---
My 5.56 FLIES out of my machines. It's all I use but I'm a semi auto rifleman and prefer to explore and loot, and by the time I return to base to stash another 200 have appeared in my machine.
---
I make and sell about 10-15k a week casually, and supplement it with flux, calibrated shocks mods etc. I keep one vending machine only but if you stock DECENT kit you'll always be trying to spend your 30k so that you can turn your machine back on again as it turns over so well.
---
I agree 100%. But how can Bethesda track this in their current system, with items not having their own IDs. Going to Ebay you can see someone selling 14 Fixers with B-25-25. I doubt this person was that lucky to get 14 drop, it's duped, but then how can you track someone who didn't dupe and actually traded for a duped item on Discord or something?  You might be playing the game legit and are probably using weapon or armor that has been duped.
---
If they made each item have their own IDs, be easy to see when duped, they would see a duplicate pop up, and the person that made it happen is the cheater/hacker, and gets the ban hammer.
---
Seems too simple of a fix for Bethesda to do this. You know, like almost every other MMO does.
---
And can i just say how much of a waste of time their report a player system is? I reported a cheater in game and online, with pictures, time stamps, and still, this person is on my friends list and plays. He clearly using Dev Room items and hacked weapons. (Mr Fuzzy Clean Outfit). He still plays to this day, and it's been well over a month that I've reported them.  [https://imgur.com/a/Ph0Zphg](https://imgur.com/a/Ph0Zphg) Blacked out the names. What proof is missing, that they need to ban this cheating douche bag?
---
Not true. Only MSoft or Sony can console ban, and only do so for egregious violations of their TOS. All Beth can do is ban your beth.net ID. You can create another beth ID, and restart playing immediately.
---
I have several mule accounts from before FO1st.
---
If it's the emotes and such, simply go back into the atom shop and re-activate them. Mine disable constantly. And I feel like I literally have to reactivate my loot/drop bag skins every play session.  Check if you can put the lazer, hatchet, 10mm or power armor ski s know stuff before you log a ticket.
---
Yes! That would be sweet. 
---
To be honest the thing I miss most from FO4 was the mod ‚Äòplace anywhere‚Äô. Having played with that for years and having to now use the CAMP system is brutal lol.
---
What is up with Imgur, it's like I'm on an acoustic modem it's so damn slow.  Doing one line at a time.
---
I only ended up as a Junkie because I had a JE 90%RW Railway Rifle drop for me and I used that as my main for ages until I switched to a melee build and started using a Meat Hook and Power Fist instead, now I've changed to a Gauss-only build and have both Junkie's shotgun and minigun, plus a Quad pistol I use if I'm sneaking around. From my perspective the new bullion system was designed to address people's complaints about RNG as well as duping and they just need to balance the older weapons to match because there is no reason to use anything else now.
---
**If you were wrongfully banned** ... u have less chance to complete the marathon on time and u have all rights to be angry with cheaters who just dont want to play fair bcz of that... not with bethesda¬¥s broken mechanics.
---
Was the only reason I replied, just seemed like such a non issue .
---
You think they are going to do the grind that the people they just banned were willing to do? Why do you people love to defend the TOS here. How many dupe methods have been out? Wasn't there one a month ago that also involved vendors. First time sure shame on the players doing it. Second time could be seen as either. More than this you should be asking why they're not fixing their game.
---
RNG was not kind to me.  Over 2 accounts I probably turned in claims for &gt;50 *** weapons.  Not one bloodied weapon.
---
Two things:
---
More people have now heard about *magic* weapons. This is the main culprit to taking down the Queen in minutes, her health just vanishes! 
---
More people are teaming up to do Events so you're seeing more experienced players coming together. 
---
It's really not rocket science. Give me a god roll weapon, it's not gonna do much unless I'm specc'd for it. Give me a shit weapon, with buffs, bobbleheads, *magic* effects, its gonna take down the queen very quickly.
---
Yeah I'm 109 and I level easily two to four times when I'm on in an hour or two. Public events group is OP for it
---
Or maybe it feels like they nerfed it because adrenalin isnt working atm
---
for 4k gold
---
But what must say player which has really founded any good thing on ground near station, bought from vendor for some thousands caps? 
---
I havent ever seen Weapon like ‚ÄúDuped Bllodied... ‚Äú or ‚ÄúDuped Junkie‚Äôs....‚Äù
---
Ive seen posts in FB where players asked: WTF? I see BE weapon for 5-10 k? Where is the trick of such trade?
---
suspended, pending investigation = your banned were just not gonna say that today. because we want it to appear were manually going through every case. this is the same thing they say and almost every company says to avoid confrontation. the majority of people affect claim o i did nothing wrong pubically. as they want to keep the image of being innocent. but you know the truth, we know the truth. you got busted and we are laughing our asses off at you. no one has been banned for owning a duped item. they are banning the dupers and god moders only....the i didnt do it, officer. i just must of bought a duped item from a vendor.... yea right see ya Karan.
---
Highly doubt it. Most of the stuff I buy is from player vendors that are clearly guessing at prices.
---
Just look at your HP in the Pip-Boy the moment you trigger Nerd Rage, for me with was always around 56 hp. 
---
You don't have to tape up your TV, lol.
---
People can get banned unjustly, as other have said and proved here, but I do doubt that most of the people making these  "i never duped why was I banned" posts were unjustly banned.
---
Just now I saw a dude claiming he had been unjustly banned over on the Market subreddit and, when I decided to take a look at his post history, he had gone from offering to buy a BE Laser Rifle to trading one for rare plans in the span of a day.
---
The beauty of bloodied builds, you dont always have to use your bloodied weapon, it's just there when you need it. I'm a melee fighter who has severe disadvantages with guns but use them more then my gauntlet.
---
They arent even legendary or lvl 50 usually, just whatever I happen to find laying around.
---
If this works for me, then I know players with a build for a specific firearm are more then just fine, especially once they get that two shot explosive or some duped legacy, which easily exceeds a bloodied build in pvp.
---
Having to scrounge for ammo is boring, so was using the ammo converter. Its easier to sit in vats and pick off enemies with a ranged weapon rather then run around to each guy individually clearing out the entire camp.
---
Ever try to melee a supermutant suicider, solo swarms of enemies in line of the sand event with a knife, punch a scorch beast flying mid air, or just stand next to the scorch queen for a few moments sucking rads, all while sitting at next to no health? God forbid you take the slightest fall damage. 
---
As OP as your imagining bloodied builds, and they are strong, they come with serious set backs that serve to make the game more interesting, and you can always whip out those standard weapons.
---
I can‚Äôt
---
I understand their decision, it was anti-exploit. It just so happens that it was an exploit that was super fun and rewarding for everyone on the server.....
---
Ofc not. 
---
This is so incredibly frustrating, same with the rails from the contemporary pack only fitting the contemporary porch even though they are the same size as the "wood rails"... Give us some liberty ffs
---
I remember that
---
it's worth noting the amount of SCORE required for each level increases by 25 with each level.
---
[according to another post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/) if you want to reach rank 100 by the end of the season without paying for atoms or doing additional grinding, you would've had to reach level 33 by this past Monday. 45 by the end of this coming Monday.
---
Yeah we do but it's next to impossible to put roof on round buildings unfortunatly
---
I wonder if I should put up a sign to that effect.
---
Your third paragraph is a great life pro tip for dealing with any customer service. Be nice and you'll usually get what you want. Be a Karen and you'll be ignored.
---
Welp, this ban wave will mean nothing. Dupers mostly use burner accounts to do it before transfering to,, clean" account :)
---
Yeah that's a bug though, you're supposed to only get the White Powder one and I think the BoS one is from the loot table for turning in technical data.
---
Start with this site and see what cards you think you might want, you can then save it and ask for peoples opinions. I would focus on strength .. I can share some of my builds, I am not OP, just enough to do a decent amount of damage. I find people who are so OP can't possibly be having fun when it is too easy, but all to our own.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Also just google best builds in Fallout 76
---
https://screenrant.com/fallout-76-10-best-builds-ranked/
---
I think the biggest decision is, do you want to be a gunner or a melee build. Both are fun, gunners constantly have to be collecting lead and steel and making ammo, melee, less work and nothing more satisfying for me than a hammer in the face. I still carry a load of weapons, sometimes dealing with a sheepsquatch needs a gun or a shotgun to the face.
---
Guessing he means half width, rather than half height. I could also do with this being a thing
---
I love it.
---
It's just not fun. I'm not noble I just want to play.
---
Grahm is a nut. I've seen him take part in Line in the Sand a few times after a scorched attacked Chally. Never fails to put a smile on my face to see him.
---
Yea that's true. fair enough lol.
---
Forgot to mention you can plant crops in the coal cars too which is handy.
---
Yes.. vertical half walls..
---
i mean you super narrow minded. yes on one had its bad for the game market and for game stability. 2 things that have been utter garbage since day 1. I have never duped but i understand why some people do it. Some players play on private worlds and never share there questionable amounts of items with anyone for that "solo" experience. From my pov duping is a doubled sided object. its not black and white. its a grey area at best.
---
Also those camps with only turrets...killed the fun.
---
He did but he thought just a little dupe wouldn‚Äôt hurt now 90% of my friends are gone from the game
---
The regular door is under doors and the garage door is under walls lol
---
And that's where you are wrong. It doesn't matter what you *think* or what you *think* you are experiencing. The facts are there in front of you but you are choosing to ignore them. Once again, have a good day!
---
I think it is perhaps optimistic to think that Bethesda is incapable of making a mistake.
---
b r u h
---
Your character has arthritis, the radiation is really getting to thier bones.
---
I thought they were a great reason to use artillery back when you could rip apart someone's camp at the cost of a thousand caps in wanted levels.
---
Completely irrelevant to what OP is asking.
---
The game is super RNG. Found 3 star legendary? Good, here is your 1 star legendary garbage. Idk, nerfing locations (Whitespring) like this is exactly why people seek duping. They want to get better items, but there is no way you can grind it. Even if you decide to run all 3 silos yourself, you wont get 3\* items.
---
True
---
Underrated comment.
---
tlrd: "I duped, and now im worried about whether or not im going to be banned and for how long." -The OP.
---
That‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt trade with people I don‚Äôt know.  Unless it‚Äôs for caps
---
I started playing properly on 10/07/20 (I tried the free weekend trial and never again from that time) and so far i haven't encountered a hostile player. I met a friendly high level player and guess what? He gave me some supplies and plans, if i remember correctly. I am a solo player and was kinda afraid if i could solo this game without any other "prohibited"/ "needed" assistance from other players in terms of doing quests and surviving really, that is. 
---
I was also worried about me being disconnected frequently from F76. (I was disconnected frequently in gta online mainly because i don't have that great of an internet). So far, it didn't happen. That's good.
---
Because of the paid private servers, i think i will be stuck playing in a public server till i obtain all of the steam achievements or if continue having fun until then (maybe, hopefully) i'll continue playing and helping new players as well. This community is the most helpful one i've ever seen up until now, of course. 
---
As you can guess from my username, i was always playing gta online and once i got all of the steam achievements (finally, i'm looking at you masterminds achievement) i turned my eyes on F76, mainly because it has steam achievements (yep, i am an achievement hunter) and of course West Virginia, the song, the atmosphere, that calm before the storm, when you are scavenging for supplies and then you get jumped by ghouls, scorched etc and lastly, the ability to create your own C.A.M.P, your own house if you'd like, i'd like to build one myself but i am not the "creative type" sort of player. Maybe i'll try building an original one or copy-pase one from youtube. (i know, not very creative of me)
---
Hit level 20 today and despite having some difficulties, the F76 wiki, youtube and of course reddit have greatly helped me in continuing my fight, might and will to survive in west virginia!
---
Snowflakes bitched about PvP lol. Cry harder and I'll keep duping on a game I bought and paid for üòò And I can request a refund from my bank LOL
---
I'm at 2500 hours now. I'll get those paltry few Atoms one day.
---
When Bethesda Banned People, They gave reasons the past ban waves for the Ban.
---
If you got banned because of duping you may or may not because of Large Amount of Things in your Possession.
---
In the last 4 Months you did a Massive (multiple thousendes of 5.56) trade. Maybe that could have flagged you or the way you got them.
---
You can do open a Support Ticket. Its worth a shot.
---
I never got any problems regarding accessabilty of my account since the beta days.
---
My understanding (new player myself) is that especially with building teams, it doesnt really matter at all. I was in a few last night and only popped to see a team mate once who was low level and kept getting killed so fast travelled to help/stock him/her up but other than that it seems to just be a passive bonus and you can ignore other teammates in a building team
---
Have you got that grass setting turn to off? I'm on PC and until I edited my ini file to turn off grass Whitespring was a laggy slideshow.
---
Not sure if the in game grass distance setting or shadow distance would help.
---
Great idea!  It appears to be a camp cylinder, btw, versus sphere.
---
Now for the stage that was datamined a long ass time ago to be added in.
---
Choosing a sneak/rifleman build on my second play through made the grind between 30-50 so much easier. If you're on PS4 I can craft you a fixer for free
---
Me?
---
i‚Äôm looking forwards to logging on to see whether or not i‚Äôve been banned for opening the 800 large handmade gifts someone gave me that this sub told me i should open lmao
---
Its the dupers and the third party .. cant change my mind. I feel no pitty.
---
I dont think, I know.
---
you as well!
---
So in the past 4 days, Ive had 8k worth of score auto complete. If that continues there is no way I will finish getting rank 100. The sooner we can buy, the less we will have to buy at once. Buy a few ranks now, a few more next paycheck. So on and so forth
---
Your powers aren't on point today, I don't have an ounce of worry in me but thanks for the concern
---
On the one day that i remembered to actually visit Miss Moleminer, i got two magic +33% vats hit shotties. Both low level two stars unfortunately.
---
Exactly.  Doing dailies is the only thing giving the game a small ounce of replayability currently.
---
He basically just killed the game for himself.
---
200 bullions limit a day should be illegal.

&gt;anti-fun regulations

---
Private servers. Which you have  to pay for for some reason.
---
It definitely tapers at the top and bottom though, when you're higher up you can't build out from the center as far.
---
I hated those club house campsüò°
---
I've seen a lot of non-energy weapons with beam splitters on them lately.
---
This happened to me when I changed out my xbox. Just had to reactivate them in the atomic shop.
---
‚ÄúSpoilers ahead‚Äù but you already knew that. 
---
 As a person that did the raid with both factions. If you‚Äôre nice and friendly to Ra-Ra at crater. She can be asked to come and join you during the vault raid. And then you can ask her to sneak into the air vent and unlock the door for you. It will let you pick up a legendary plasma rifle. That you can‚Äôt get anywhere else. Unless the person that has one decides to sell it. 
---
If you side with Foundation, while getting ready to raid the vault, you‚Äôll do a mission that will reward you with the Chinese stealth armor. Which you will unlock the plan for free. 
---
Regardless on who you side with, you will be faced with another question. At the end when it comes to gold. Keep it all to yourself. Share it with one faction. Or share it with both. Regardless of your decision. Besides how much gold you have at the end of the raid, nothing bad happens. 
---
If you want to feel good and share the gold. Go for it. If you could care less about how NPCs will react. Then take it all for yourself. 
---
Sure they will act surprised or angry. BUT. They will not be hostile towards you. And regardless of which faction you decide to do it with, you can continue to do their daily quests. You can continue to rank up until you eventually become and ally for both of them. 
---
And after finishing the vault raid. Certain events you can do will reward you with treasury notes. Each day you can turn in 20 of those. For 200 gold. With that gold you buy the new weapons, armor, and camp items from both foundation and crater.
---
Oh sorry. because they play a lot they should be allowed to break the ToS. I get it now.
---
I got 1132 hours played does that give me diplomatic immunity? Can i go and dupe now? Can i do things that cause parts of the game to be disabled for weeks effecting everyone? SWEEEEEEEET.
---
By buying ranks now, Bob is essentially taking money out of his wallet and burning it. Bob could completely ignore score and play as normal, right before the end of the season he buys the remainder of the ranks. 
---
It's like if you were to buy a candy bar with a $20 bill but then throw away the change because you don't want to open tour wallet.
---
Unless I'm missing something, the argument isn't "just grind instead of spend money". The argument is "Why would you spend money now when you could literally just continue as normal until the last week of the season, thus saving $5-$30?"
---
Fun is a distraction to spending money in the Atom store.
---
i just stand by a radiation trap in my camp  till my nerd rage kicks in and go about my day.
---
logging not login.  They added additional log triggers to the client (and likely server) to try to fix the auto-completing dailies.  Its about time too.
---
Simple response: Most jobs are relatively simple to do.
---
Game development is not, this isn't the main Bethesda team, this is the smaller (more than likely less experienced) team. Most of these issues are due to the engine and I highly doubt the game will ever reach a point of pure stability due to the engine.
---
People need to stop shitting on the devs. They're given a job and a set amount of resources and told to get on with it.
---
Shit on the higher ups for the BS that has gone on with this game
---
Oh good. Now my PC is on fire.
---
I have been going heavy on lead farming, and mass producing 5.56 ammo. by the thousands?
---
But anyone using ammo selling as main caps income, does the exact same thing
---
Really? 1/3 banned yet the *bay sellers were never caught? This can‚Äôt be right.
---
I wish the build quota was increased to place all of this stuff.
---
bruh. I've had the small backpack since last year. I started a new character with Wastelanders, and finally just started doing the tadpole quests and hit possum yesterday. when i went to craft my new backpack, i realized for the first time that there are levels, like craftable weapons or armor. 
---
I've been running around for about 400 hours with a level 1 backpack that carries 5 lbs.... i had no idea it could go up to 30. i thought it was so pointless lmao.
---
i feel like a fool but at least i have an extra 60 lbs now!
---
I read yesterday that it can happen if you leave the game but don't force close it/turn the console off, do you know if that could be possible in your case?
---
I mean, you cheat they are going to ban you and it was your fault.  Yes they should fix the game, but you shouldn't dupe and then get mad people were banned.    
---
I personally could care less if people dupe, it has zero effect on me, but when people do it then act all indignant when they get banned, it's just stupid.
---
I have 2 signs in my camp, a menu board to show my weekly special, and a sign that says "masks required". Gotta add "deposit gifts here" now.
---
We can agree that you don't think. At all.
---
Next time you know you're logging off for +20 hours, pick something up, then log off. It won't be there next time.
---
Raiders have the gauss mini gun and settler have the gauss shotgun.
---
But can you be sure about that? I bought a JE1A hunting rifle at 9k caps, from a guy who had several legacies (he displayed them) . I asked him why that price and he answered that he needed caps. Have I bought a duped item or not? The market is FLOODED by duped item: ammo, fluxes, weapons, rare outfit, but also more common resources or plans. Imagine now Bethesda says that has found a method to ban all the players that put their hands on duped items and ban them, would you complain if they banned you? Or just imagine that they canceled all duped items, and you find that half of your inventory was duped. I'm fine with banning people who duped. But what I'm saying is that it is highly likely that you profited of duping somehow, even unintentionally.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug it‚Äôs a feature I always heard that during the first few months and the beta
---
If your account was 100% tied to the private servers you might have a point. But unlike all other games you are allowed to jump between private and public servers at will with the same account and all it's items.
---
Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all, nothing at all, nothing at all....

You would think that large MMOs (let's say GTAO) would have the most common anti cheat software, wouldn't you?
---
Been jonesen for the Halloween items so bad, I got a Silent Hill styled camp and really need them to decorate.
---
That's delightful.  Are you on PC.by any chance?
---
No reason to avoid the ones in the Forest region if you're a new player, with the exception of Project Paradise which is an endgame event. 
---
Events in general give you rewards (usually in the form of resources like stimpaks, purified water, some ammo) and potentially plans for crafting and camp building. 
---
Path of Enligtenment and Feed the People reward a temporary xp boost, Leader of the Pack gives you low level legendaries.
---
a bunch of accounts were banned/suspended pending investigation
---
people are salty.. and scrambling to justify their actions..
---
Keep duping and keep crying on reddit when daddy Todd bans you üòò until then don't you disappoint your daddy Todd, keep licking his boots.
---
You do realize that it's true right. If America just disappeared tomorrow the world is in a much worse place, than if any other country did instead.
---
Ahhhh
---
No, if you do the quests but don't side with them you get it free
---
"I just found it in a vendor"
---
but they are probably tracking it..
---
The tape on your tv sounds like a good idea. But as a person that‚Äôs been bloodied for the past year, I promise you that you get used to it. And won‚Äôt need it at all. Your sight is more than enough. But the tape thing might be useful to new players. Or people just staring to try bloodied.
---
Is the parametric jumpsuits one?
---
275 of them...
---
Am lost, there‚Äôs Bethesda news?
---
lol get stuffed salty bitch, most of the banned dupers were robin hood types giving out unicorn weapons to players who  otherwise could never have dreamed of owning them.
---
I see the comments here about magic shotguns. Bashing damage works best. Since you have to use vats for the magic effect, less vats cost is ideal. Most ideal first perk would be instigating. So instigating bashing damage less vats cost is the best magic shotgun out there imho.
---
Haha people should actually watch!!!
---
After spending what is probably unreasonable amount of time and money on this game, I wouldn't risk my account with silly shady stuff like this.
---
Murmrgh actually later also dropped me "Vampire's Fixer" for close combat. What a nice guy.
---
nope, it won't! A lot of players on public teams will do their own thing unless it's an event team, but if you're with a higher level, there's a chance they might be willing to help you out. Everyone gets the benefit of the boost/bond too
---
Good, fuck dupers
---
Guessing that was sarcasm, *but...* people who *want* to see their backpack, will buy backpacks, while people who don't care/don't want to see them, probably aren't likely to buy many *anyway*. Plus, there's some like me... I carry *waaay* too many outfits with me because I like changing my look around often (based on weather, time, location, mood, what I'm doing currently, or just "because"), and there are some outfits I like having a backpack displayed with, and others I don't. Heck, I started carrying one of the parachute backpacks solely to use with the Flyboy outfit - I use a Secret Service pack normally.
---
It just works!
---
One dude I ran across had it all figured out.  Set up camp in a nuked whitespring.  Not sure if he nuked himself or what.  Right next to the train station with tons of each material for sale (at a premium price) something like 120 per HRF and 75 per glowing mass.  I was three glowing masses short to craft all the flourescent I had picked and ended up buying what I needed.  Quite the business strategy right there lol.
---
I believe the Nuka-Cola factory is now an Instanced location and they need to keep it that way since a portion of the Wastelanders quest takes place within, so it would be difficult to have an event take place there.
---
If it's really from a giveaway, then the person who did the giveaway most probably duped said giveaway items, which got flagged as being duped items, which ended up flagging the accounts that got the items as duper accounts.
---
funny, because i did that this morning, and it was there.
---
last time i logged in was almost 2 days ago
---
I really love my junkie's weapons tank build, (prioritizing tankyness over damage output). I'm the medic/support for my team. I've found this build really fun and I think it's a good change from just maxing out damage with a bloodied build.
---
A big-city counterfeiter decided the best place to pass off his phony $18 bills would be in some small, out of the way, town. He found a tiny town with a single store in the Midwest. He entered the store and handed one of his brand new bills to the man behind the counter. ‚ÄúCan you change this for me, please?‚Äù he asked.
---
‚ÄòSure, Mister. You want 2 nines or 3 sixes?‚Äô
---
Wish they'd fix basic electrical functions, like the power counter, too. Hopefully there will be a major overhaul to camps when instanced interiors come out.
---
They aren‚Äôt able to be reactivated nor do they show up
---
Also works if you load Skyrim instead of F4.
---
I'm so happy. I've been playing since BETA, and I only just got my regular backpack for the first time last night. I thankfully heard about the small backpack so I've been rocking that for about six months now.
---
But holy shit were the scouts challenges were so difficult. Unlike so many of the challenges giving you atoms, you couldn't just do something random and suddenly achieve it. You had to actively track the quests. Take a photo of a radstag and then kill it was a crossbow? Wtf? I'm never just taking random photos of creatures, and then to know to kill it with a specific weapon.
---
So I finally went around last week collecting my merit badges, looking online to see where I could find radscorpions and honey beasts as rare as they are.
---
The hardest one though was reviving an ally. Until the most recent update making the formation of teams much easier, I always played solo. And even then, how often do these level 400 players die when you happen to be standing next to them? And I always felt bad asking someone to die for me.
---
Then last night I was on a team and saw two of the guys on the map in a blast zone, so I fast forward on down there and see they are fighting the Scorchbeast Queen. I throw a couple shots at her, but not much since my weapons right not aren't really optimized to take her down. Then I see one of my team mates freaking out. I look over and he's fallen! He appears to have been playing bloodied, so it didn't take him much to take him down by the Queen I suppose.
---
I RUN over to him and breakout my stimpack and revive him. I then get the notification the scouts quest was complete. I almost right them fast traveled out of there to get my backpack, but then I remembered we still had the Queen to deal with, so we took her down, I grabbed my loot, and got my backpack finally!
---
I'm a happy camper now.
---
Xmas gifts are pretty much useless you realize.  No one was duping them, there's really no point when the plans have completely saturated the market.  Dude probably just had a bunch in his stash and wanted to be nice.
---
That‚Äôs what a duper would say... üßê
---
This is the best answer.  The Institute figured out time travel and is pulling a Terminator to prevent the Overseer from actualizing her dream of rebuilding Appalachia.
---
This is just the first attempt, there will probably be like 15 more movies...er, attempts.
---
Some people like instant gratification and in this instance can afford it. That may not be how you or I go about this, but I don't believe condemning them is the way to go. If it's not adversely affecting you or anyone else, who cares. Let them be wallet warriors.
---
When chemistry starts bleeding into quantum physics.  While particular isotopes are inherently radioactive due to a difference in neutrons, you suggestion radiation can in reverse create isotopes of gold, that would add or remove a neutron to its structure leading to it's own radioactive decay into a different element?
---
Interesting. Could be plausible, now I want to do some research...
---
Nah, just one. The other 274 is from a suitcase, at Whitespring station. So they are legit.
---
Whet? You got serums?
---
Do both factions together, until the point of no return. Saves you from buying the stealth suit. And can use it in the Raiders ending.
---
I bet temp bans are no more than 3 days. (Just so you know, hackers in NW get banned for 3 days :'D)
---
The majority of both professional and academic research papers are published behind paywalls. Accessing the data does not require purchasing the paper. If you're in the states, you can use your local public library and/or library website. Where I live you can instant message a librarian and ask questions like "What is the gender split among console gamers?" and they will extensively research the topic for you. I would expect most other "wealthy" countries to have similar library resources. If that is not an option, you can use one of the many chrome extensions designed to get around paywalls. 
---
This thread was created for women who play fo76 to connect. It's really disappointing that you only seem motivated to utilize it for purposes of discouraging your female teammates / women in the industry / etc. 
---
I grew during a time where console games were marketed to everyone... they didn't start being portrayed by media as a "male activity" until the 90s. It feels quite strange to feel like some parts of society want to take a step backward into a time machine full of old-fashioned stereotypes. https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed
---
Even if you duped on a burner and transferred the stuff to your main account you probably aren't safe based on what I've been reading.
---
VATS has been broken in pvp since wastelanders lmao
---
And this is why legendary shovels with 90WR fetch top dollar :)
---
This was like a glimpse into the mind of a tweaker, or listening to a kids running on Adderall, pixie stixs and redbull. Formatting would probably be helpful if you want anyone other than incredibly bored people to read it.
---
See? New paragraph. Isn't that easier to look at?
---
And to address the content of your post lol, it's fantastic. I adore your ability to arbitrarily create statistics you then base decisions off of, support your ideas with circular arguments, and attack the logical consistency of the OP by drawing bad parallels to criminal justice. The mental gymnastics are simply stunning. 10/10
---
Find yourself a 90% reduced weight shovel and it'll change your life!
---
0% chance.
---
No not you.
---
Looks amazing!! Where abouts did you build it?
---
haven't nuked whitesprings or been in a nuke zone there since maybe this time last year.. what do you mean by nerfed? what's changed?
---
I found a 2 dupe stash‚Äôs and I learned them all the new plans I didn‚Äôt know yet and got a lot of ultracite weapon plans
---
How do I seem shady through comments? I‚Äôve never played with you and I don‚Äôt know you
---
Unless you have several of the same weapon, or are lying about duping you should be fine
---
many places. But obviously the popular ones are popular.
---
Do you want water? a view? extractors? some place to plant crops?
---
Don't sweat it man, we were all there once. Before you know it, you'll be one of those big tin cans, one shot-ing everything (if that's what you are going for)
---
Wow I don‚Äôt... I don‚Äôt even have words...
---
Not today Todd!
---
This logic works if you believe duping isn‚Äôt cheating, or if you believe 5 isn‚Äôt ‚Äúegregious‚Äù enough.
---
Ah so it's like using Kodi. You won't get in trouble for downloading the program and using it to watch pirated content but they'll go after the guy broadcasting the pirated content.
---
Oh thank god-
---
I don‚Äôt really have a situation where I desperately need power armor. Unless I‚Äôm hunting for flux, that‚Äôs pretty much it. 
---
But if you‚Äôre a power armor build, I suggest carrying 5. More than enough to last you a while (assuming it‚Äôs your build you should have the right perks for all your power armor needs)
---
Whenever you‚Äôre low, just go to a train station and take more out of your stash box. No matter where you are on the map, there‚Äôs always a train station, or somebody‚Äôs camp nearby. Just fast travel and get more. No point in carrying 20+ fusion cores on you.
---
I recommend you start looking for armor penetration to get through this stretch. Once you get into the 40s the difficulty curve smooths out again until you start hitting lategame mobs. Or, if youre... ethically flexible there is another path.
---
What you need to do is start looking for one of two things:
---
1. A single piece of legendary armor with the +15% weapon bash damage effect on it.
---
2. ANY two or three star shotgun with +33% vats hit chance on it. Literally any prefix will work. In a perfect world it would be Instigating, but it matters little.
---
One you have either of the things on this list, congratulations! You now have a m.a.g.i.c shotgun that will not deal the normal (weapon\_dmg) divided by (number\_of\_pellets) but now deals (weapon\_dmg) for **every** pellet.  It is exactly as OP as it sounds. The catch is that you must fire the hit from within vats and you must be close enough and or accurate enough for all of your pellets to hit the target or the boosted hit will not occur.
---
Not saying I did or didn't but right now I'm sitting pretty enjoying some Battefront 2, and downloading some sweet games I've been meaning to catch up on while all my mates are slaying w/ some pretty sweet weapons in FO76 currently
---
Basically A FO76 ‚ÄûBattlepass‚Äú. Complete challenges to earn SCORE. Earn enough score and you will rank up. Each rank gives a reward ranging from somewhat crappy to really really good.
---
Auto complete doesn't effect the atoms only the ones you get in the legendary run.
---
they changed this recently, with wastelanders i believe.
---
Yeah, I buy them up every time I see them in a vendor to resell later.
---
You look like John Wayne Gacy working at a soft serve ice cream parlor. lol
---
I have, and it seems the recent ban wave is completely random
---
Don't worry, they will be back in a month or two with the next massive dupe that will go on for a month before beth manages to fix it.
---
Wait...is THAT what the treasure maps are for? I thought it was like the Skyrim ones, some money and/or a moderately useful bit of armour or weapon. Do those things lead to rare items?
---
Ah. Thanks.
---
Not OP and am not answering original question but, does the main menu seem "blurry" or "grainy" to you guys? The game looks great in-game for the most part but game cinematics or pre rendered videos like what happens in the main menu always look horrible. Is this a case of compression issue ir what? Anytime I look at steam or whatever, the images of games or the videos in previews look "blurry" eveb puxelated at times. Cables, drivers, monitor, GPU are all fine .
---
I had about ~10k Ultracite 5.56 and .308 that was all crafted. 
---
There was really nothing sketchy, *maybe* 250~ Leader Bobble heads, but that‚Äôs not impossible to obtain. 
---
If people are truly getting banned while not duping at all, then I really don‚Äôt know. Based on my own accounts I‚Äôd assume it flagged the account that did the duping, not the one storing it. I have a third GT that has a few more dupes than my main, including doubles, *and* 3k~ Leader Bobbles, and that account didn‚Äôt get  touched either.
---
Exactly, you shit your pants when you die.
---
So technically you drop some fertilizer.
---
Only people getting banned that we know of for sure with proof, are the ones who did the actual vendor exploit. It‚Äôs just rumors that people with only the duped stuff are getting banned.
---
&gt; Bethesda Support is remarkably patient and kind
---
When [this has happened to me a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hrc9un/if_you_duped_you_deserve_the_ban_no_amounting_of/fy3yvxv/?context=3), I was never put in touch with a human being.
---
I first received the typical email that my account was flagged for using a third party device to duplicate (which I never did). A week later I received another email implying they had strong evidences and my suspension was now permanent, without appeal. By that time two weeks have passed by without access to my account. They never shared details, they never explained anything. I was left anxious, hopeless, frustrated.
---
I had to try to log in myself despite their claims to find out I was actually unbanned. They lifted it silently, without ever telling me about it.
---
This was probably the worst handling of a false positive I've ever seen, and it was painfully slow. With seasons being extremely tight on schedule, I don't imagine the frustration of being banned right now, potentially missing up of two weeks worth of S.C.O.R.E.
---
**So as a word of advice**: If you receive mention that your suspension is permanent, try to log in anyway.
---
I had this huge grand silent hill styled camp that I eventually had to abandon because it was such an immeasurable pain to get them to spawn anywhere close to the front of the camp and not in the middle of it all ruining the experience. 
---
Make the camp tool directional so it spawns us in the direction its facing.
---
Yeah, but even with the disappointment of getting crap drops, it was still great fun. 
---
One of my fondest memories of the game was finding three 3* ghouls "sleeping" in some bushes, tagging them and kiting them to a group of players. People were laughing and took turns tagging them while they chased me before putting them down.
---
Havent had anything close to that happening since.
---
Jez that is so CRINGE. I would actually pay you for not making any more of videos.
---
can confirm, solo ran all three silos last night, all I got was an instigating lead pipe (from the queen, nothing in the silos themselves)
---
What no it‚Äôs obvious that hat all gifts are duped that‚Äôs known, there legit on my end, but when I‚Äôm telling these guys we‚Äôre asses they were they were duping guns that cost $400 non stop and they wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else have them, they all spit it between accounts so if one got banned they had all the others they were just jerks
---
Hey don't you have to shill for Bugthesda some more? When are you getting your Toddbucks?
---
Well hopefully the accounts with most of the dupes will be perma banned, that will help the rarity of the items go back up
---
I respect thatüòÇ
---
Idk I mean Bethesda did so many things to slow down player progression to a crawl- everything costs more to craft and scrap provides less resources relative to Fallout 4. Add in other mechanics like tiny carry weight, equipment condition, weapon levels, and the mod discovery system, and it could take months or even years real time for an inexperienced player to finally reach the late game and run out of things to craft. Although it‚Äôs not fair that honest players had to grind for the resources the cheaters got instantly, I can‚Äôt really blame them. It‚Äôs like leaving the cell door open and expecting the prisoner not to walk out. Its been ages since I‚Äôve played 76 so maybe the problem has gotten worse but I don‚Äôt see how other players getting more resources negatively impacts honest players.
---
I'm curious, where do you think all of those plans that  have saturated the market came from? Fallout Fairies?
---
I'm new to this game (bought 2 months ago) and I'm worried about logging in after work today. I've never duped, wouldn't know how, but I bought a mr. Fuzzy outfit yesterday. Hope it was real. That made my night finding it yesterday. I would be pretty upset if that turned out to be a duped item that gets me in trouble.
---
  Aresenic is not alone - 
---
  You are also presuming the vast majority of players know beyond a doubt whatever the acquired was duped.
---
  As much as I play and participate here, I have not memorized every legacy weapon, every possible duped item, every rare item, etc.
---
  With a few exceptions, I wouldn't know if something was or was not a legit item.  
---
I've probably sold, given away, or scrapped more than one rare outfit for that very reason.
---
I would also venture a huge number of 'casual' players are in the same position.  They don't read this or the trader forum, don't follow gaming news...they just logon and play.
---
  To that end, I would be quite annoyed to be penalized for simple possession...or confiscation without compensation.
---
  Rolling back the servers, or even just player inventory....what about the (literally) 1000+ scrip I've spend since then, and the items I still have from same?  
---
Monday night, Mrgph granted me an AA DCG I didn't need...it sold in my vendor last night - should the player that bought it lose both the item and the caps?
---
Or the other non-weapon/armor items I've crafted or acquired since -  serums, ultracite, stable flux, etc?  
---
3 levels (at over L200, that's a lot of XP), plus completing the vault raid.  
---
How do you roll back and not negate all of that?
---
Yep. Ign is same name as here. I have a slocum joe diner built opposite wixon homestead. Spend a good part of my game time collecting ingredients to make food and sell for a few caps.
---
When the food is close to spoiling I run around the map dropping off doggy bags to people, last night was tasty squirrel stew, a pepperoni roll, and a glass of brahmin milk. 
---
If you see a guy sprinting and jumping around in a chef hat, a surgical mask, wearing a bloody chef outfit, carrying a cleaver, that's probably me making deliveries. 
---
Funny enough a lot of low levels run when they see me. I cant imagine why....
---
To be fair it's hard to tell exactly who got banned for what because everyone could be lying.  How many people who are saying "I got banned but I didn't dupe I just traded for it legit" are actually telling the truth?  Someone could post their ban email and it can be real but doesn't mean they are telling the truth about what they did.
---
I have found him twice, both in the last month or two. Both times on the road above Freak Show. Mildly fun. Wish he lasted a little longer.
---
I did say I highly doubt it, I never claimed to know. I wouldn't care if it disappeared, they're all on mules because I only use bullion gear now and the other rare stuff like outfits I do know isn't duped because I picked them up myself, and the Vault armor sets I spent a good 6 weeks grinding the raids for.
---
I‚Äôll dupe in fallout 4 or something all the time but In a multiplayer game there are consequences
---
Definitely not just you! Would be great to be able to replicate the looks of Mad Max and the original Vault Dweller without having to sacrifice our stats to do it! Of course, that'd be even easier with a full fledged transmog system\~...
---
(Hopefully including underarmors, too - I actually *have* started using Casual underarmors for now, to get extra XP for the Season, but normally I'd prefer Raider underarmors, for the PER and AGI boosts, but so far as I know, *every* one added by the Shop has been Casual...)
---
To save you from that big mistake lol
---
That looks like the scorchbeast concept??
---
did you use power armor?
---
Yeah I remember that, so there aren't as many anymore? Bummer.
---
Sorry for the late reply. No I managed to find it at a vendor for 500 caps and I snagged that baby up.
---
I‚Äôve seen 20+ cases of people with ban email proof who have been open that they did the actual duping. I haven‚Äôt seen that yet with someone who ‚Äúpicked duped guns off the ground‚Äù type situation. They can‚Äôt track the duped items once they leave the Dupers hands, and they‚Äôve made it clear that they don‚Äôt ban people who pick up or come about duped items.
---
I was aways under the impression the silos were just difficult for difficulty sake and not good for any kind of loot. Ive never even seen a legendary in there, and the exp you get from killing the bots is pathetic. Its pretty obvious they don't want people farming the infinite spawning robots.
---
I was spec‚Äôed into a stealth commando build at that time and used a plain fixer and the Chinese stealth armor from 30-50. I didn‚Äôt really have any issues. I kept the munitions workshop rolling to keep a steady flow of ammo when I played as well. Once you hit 50 you can begin to respec however you want as levels come pretty easy, it‚Äôs just a grind.
---
Not when a huge majority just got banned loo
---
No it‚Äôs a NW glitched laser
---
I've seen some still swearing they didnt dupe and only trade for it and got banned so dunno.  either way it's a moot point.  If you're not banned at this point you are most likely safe from this current investigation.
---
Its less their loss than it is the communities gain. Many of us wont miss you.
---
I've seen him regularly over by the instruments on the bench there, once in the middle of the 'square' between the front gate and Sunny. He's absolutely still moving around
---
Sad to hear that about the punji boards, though, honestly, I'm kinda glad Ward still walks around - the NPCs start seeming rather artificial pretty quick as it is, and having them locked into one spot would just make it that much more obvious.
---
You make a fair point I guess this makes events harder now
---
I want you to take a moment and think about the implications of the kind of game that encourages or requires that attitude at any point for any reason
---
Shill? Aren't you the one still playing this game? Who's on Todd's dick now? You're playing his game. LOL do you even think before typing your worthless insults? You're wasting your time, don't you have someone's boot to lick? Go play your little game, daddy Todd is waiting for you to boost his numbers. Go!
---
Your own fault for going into a pvp zone. And it tell you right at the beginning of claiming a workshop its open to pvp
---
I never understood the problem - since I could always find him. But I guess it had something to do with him getting stuck in his bed &amp; you couldn't interact with him.
---
Im not saying that it wasnt legit, Im just saying it could have been may or maybe not a reason for how you gpt flagged.
---
Im not saying everyone is guilty but Im saying there are more people guilty than innocent in that ban wave.
---
Hackers, Modders, Dupers and Glitchers have been saying in the last ban waves that they didnt do nothing and ended up being unbanned. Im pretty sure thats what is happening again.
---
I bought a marine armor helmet from a npc vendor like a year ago. Only learnt before the treasure hunter update that it was impossible to get. 
---
Did scrap 1 and got the plan, which cant be got anymore by scrapping
---
Were you logged in during reset? Or did you log off in NW before reset? Apparently those are the 2 main reasons.
---
Check again and make sure they aren't the old dailies/weeklies taking a little while to update because that happened to me a few days ago but they were fine when I checked 10 minutes later. Allegedly there is a bug like that, but I haven't seen any actual evidence and put it down to lazy players trying to scam a free boost from Bethesda until I do.
---
Yea I got most of them so it would be nice.  I actually dont blame people for wanting that Forrest camo jumper it is so damn nice! But seriously f the dupers.
---
The first time I ran one I got a TON of 3 stars, I'm not sure if they changed something since then but they aren't like that at all anymore.
---
You just expressed you wanted to see people banned because they were doing something you found annoying even though what they're doing doesn't impact you in the slightest. 
---
You're absolutely being a Karen.
---
&gt;When you dupe it makes the game less fun for everyone else, grinding for an item is hard
---
Uh what? Bloodied builds are the easiest in the game. Grinding isn't hard. It's tedious.
---
&gt;so when someone comes along and just dupes an item you worked hard to get it‚Äôs frustrating.
---
 Just cause someone offers you something doesn't mean you have to accept it. You can still have that feeling of accomplishment for grinding for that perfect piece of gear even though they took a shortcut. Grinding isn't fun, and some people would rather skip that aspect for whatever reason. Some people have busy schedules and don't want to spend their free time doing that same shit over and over and over again to get a slightly better weapon. It's completely understandable.
---
I will revise my original statement on bannings though. I said people shouldn't be banned if they're just taking advantage of a duping exploit. The one exception I would make is if people are then selling the stuff for real money.
---
So we can get a weapon with improved bash damage 4 times on it?
---
Welcome to the wasteland - if you didnt know from the previous parts there are raiders out there
---
Are there people that whine they got banned? Some people just have way too much nerve
---
I don't think you should be witch hunting someone for killing you in a PVP zone. You seem to be taking this a bit hard
---
I'll never forget the day I got my leaping lizard boots.
---
Report, block, change the server or get yourself Fallout First.
---
While our community is in general friendly and lovely there are still some members who are, let's say "special" in terms of: They belong into CoD rather than into F76.
---
It‚Äôs called upvote manipulation I can almost Guarantee beths marketing(or op) paid for upvotes, they paid for half I‚Äôm assuming  and the rest of the upvotes were natural. It‚Äôs not everyday on this subreddit to get over 1k upvotes. It‚Äôs rare. they‚Äôre trying to save their ass. You know for a fact EVERYTHING POSTED gets downvoted into oblivion Immediately for a reason on this subreddit. So how did this one not get down voted initially since a large % of the players on this subreddit got banned? It‚Äôs because They only pay for certain posts to be massively upvoted because it fits their own agenda. Don‚Äôt believe numbers on the internet EVER, It can always be fixed to fit a narrative. you can also pay for downvotes to make sure nothing is ever seen.
---
I won‚Äôt down vote the truth
---
Mostly they're junk - a gun, some ammo, a bit of junk etc.
---
However you could get rarer plans from them. Unlikley, but still possible.
---
IIRC you could also get the plans to build normal power armour, so you could build your own raider armour etc instead of scavenging it.
---
Hahaha. This is great. Im out too.
---
Did you change your Xbox? You can also check the Xbox store to see if you have additional dlc you may need to download the active them in the shop.
---
If you are a duper, it is not even worth to play the game imo, I prefer to explore, craft or trade my things, it is the best way, after all these years of playing 76, I still do this with the same pleasure
---
this \^\^\^
---
Sometimes the shovel is in odd/unexpected places a bit away from the gravesite.  
---
I've found it under the exterior staircase, near the statue, on the other side  of the graveyard, leaning against the tree.....
---
Last night, I found it on the counter inside the building.
---
Didnt you read the message which pops up when taking a workshop?
---
Ah, okay. Much as I thought. Thanks.
---
You can completely roll any monster or location in this game outside of SBQ, WC, or SI, with basically any weapon/build you want.  Legacy/god tier weapons are a luxury at best, dramatic overkill at worst.
---
Did you read my post?
---
ok.. but in order to preserve proper rarity of 3* drops.. the [spawn rate] of 3* mobs will be decreased accordingly...
---
-Edit is bracketed
---
great job!
---
I'm level 330 on my main I just find PA claustrophobic and way to goofy to be taken seriously. I do use excavator for mining lead but that's it.
---
I like normal armor.
---
It's not the one shot killing really its the blanket area of effect these heavy hitters have now, they spray the mobs and it dies instantly. On private worlds who cares but the word *public* should mean something in public events.
---
And apparently even if you tried the exploit without success, their automated scan detected you. That‚Äôs probably why they will do manual investigations before they ban. But in all honesty the fo76 devs are lazy scum. They will probably get through 5 investigations then say fuck it. Then they will either let the suspensions hang in limbo, or lift all suspensions and try to go after the biggest offenders. This ban was way more common than some think. 6 of the people I play with on Xbox got banned. Xbox servers have been dead the past day with very few lvls above 100.
---
Ah np. Thanks
---
Great idea didn't think I could test it
---
idk rockstar doesnt freak out and perma ban people for duping money or selling modded accounts wich is worth way more in gta online than caps and items are in this game and gta online is bigger now than it was 5+ years ago. bethesda could learn a thing or two
---
Workshops are PvP zones. That's on you. What are you going to do if they remove PvP and players/teams like that take every workshop on every world you go to? If you can't beat the person trying to take the workshop, move on. Personally, I just decapitated 2 fuckers with my Gauss shotgun when they tried to ambush me after I stole the ammo factory from them and it was the most fun I've had since the Vault 94 raids got removed since I'm just waiting for some actually challenging content to drop.
---
Makes the most sense to me.
---
I would've given you a B2525 Fixer for free because I'm nice like that, but thanks for the fake moral outrage, Karen. You sound like a horrible person.
---
Have you actually read the TOS? Seriously I mean all of it. They go so far out of their way to ensure they can terminate any account for any reason at any time it's almost funny. The only thing missing is thought crimes, but that's one cleverly worded paragraph away from being included I'm sure
---
It would be great if they waited until the very last week, give people who grinded their hearts out to rush and get the nice rewards, to enjoy it, over someone who just throws money at it.
---
Yeah i just had a route i'd go through to find him myself. Keeping his roaming limited is certainly handier. But he'd easily end up odd places, i had him on his back deck one time sitting in the chair there or in that lower section of foundation.
---
I only had him unresponsive in bed a couple of times but that was absolutely annoying.
---
There is a lerk card that extends stealtj boys significantly, and you can buy stealth boys from the enclave that have a higher base time. Plus magazines. You can get a solid 5 min out of one stealth boy use.
---
Lol and i just checked your posts. Asking for a b2526 fixer for 20k caps? Seems like your happy to profit from dupers but still like to bitch and moan?
---
If you're feeling lucky and have some Pleasant Valley Claim tickets, go to the Pleasant Valley resort's basement. There's a Protectron there that may give you the fancy pump action shotgun. 3*, anti-armor, +50% limb damage, +50 DR while aiming, reloads faster and has a slightly larger magazine size. I've used it since I got it and it's pretty damned good. It's now my "inside gun"  (since the splash damage on my Gauss shotgun has killed me more times than I would like to admit) and I still use that for the Queen since she's resistant to explosives. 
---
It's rare though, so failing that, any anti-armor, instigating or executioner shotgun is a good alternative imo, if you're not a  bloodied or Junkie. Bashing damage may seem like garbage but its a magic effect in VATs that will one shot most regular enemies.
---
Weird.  No one I play with got banned as far as I know yet but I don't think any of us cheat.  Servers seemed fine to me on xbox.
---
I gotta set your expectations straight, bud. At this point you either need to no-life it up just to catch up or get ready to spend a ton of atoms. That is, if you want to get to max rank before the deadline. If not, just enjoy the game, it's fun!
---
Yeah, I ran into the same problem once, but I was able to fast-travel away &amp; come back and it was fixed.
---
... and they will fall through the ground more often...
---
No, game pass works like music streaming. The dev makes money based on the number of players who play the game.
---
Right up there with the people rushing to judgement on other people they don't know.
---
Probably the same way watoga was nerfed, I used to find legendaries there constantly. Now its very rare.
---
Seconding this. Pump actions are great.
---
It was really strange. Really strange situation. Smack dab in the middle of West Tek 25 gifts?
---
What? Rockstar has for years banned hackers, and dupers and modders. If you‚Äôre mad that you‚Äôre banned for cheating. Good riddance. Just because Bethesda game bad does not justify you getting to cheat.
---
met it a few weeks ago, following the main quest line to abbys bunker. was friendly first, but turned hostile when i interacted a second time with it....
---
This one as they ban innocents. Dupers give them dupes then report them to troll. Voila your accounts toast.
---
It‚Äôs decent and will definitely do some damage. 
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a mid grade roll.
---
For me, I never play NW and I dont have private server. Never on in the time of the reset. Never had the auto complete bug. Other think In doing is close the game directly from the Server with alt + f4.
---
I just got one from Collison course event what kinda price we talkin
---
Not saying you are talking out of your ass, but the servers were dead from a high lvl stand point. I launched SBQ nukes on multiple servers and didn‚Äôt complete one kill. A few times I hopped I had to double check I didn‚Äôt go into a private server.
---
Good for you. Pvp has no place in adventure mode and is used primarily to grief and offers no real reward. I honestly think if you want fun pvp go play nuclear winter or better yet a pvp game
---
It's obviously desirable because of the bloodied prefix. The other 2 could be much better but it's still a 15K+ weapon.
---
You should fairly easy be able to convert the commando build into a bloodied, just put a automatic hardend receiver on the hm and get the right perks for the bloodied part...
---
This is different and far far larger than anything in the past. They usually didn‚Äôt ban unless you had 50 of every gun or armor (TSE) or you were messing with real money. They even deleted stacks and didn‚Äôt ban anyone. Didn‚Äôt ban anyone for Christmas presents. People had millions of those things. This is different. You don‚Äôt need stacks to get caught. Just a few guns and you‚Äôre done. Didn‚Äôt even need to dupe. Just had to have them in your possession. Trade groups are ghost towns right now. It‚Äôs like they banned 1/5 of the player base.
---
Idk what the max you'll get is, but I sell the Whitespring spares I have for 5k a pop even after they became a lot more common during Halloween.
---
‚ÄúWhat happens on a private world, stays on a private world‚Äù - unknown
---
Really I think the only thing that effects duping in a game is how easy it is to dupe, not drop rates.  People tend to dupe because they got into the game TO dupe  or otherwise break the game (and as we all know 76 is a game breakers paradise), OR someone saw one of the people who figured it out doing it on youtube and then decided to be greedy, and put their account at risk.   
---
I honestly don't even get the appeal for people who aren't just in it to break the game for sport.  The game is so painfully easy so it's not an issue of needing these guns to do any content, and there is nothing to chase but good legendary drops so when you get that god tier fixer you haven't got anything left to chase after.  To sell it?  For what?  Caps?  For what?  lol
---
It is only fair to others! What I like about this game is a slow progress, building every aspect of my personality and gameplay.. why the rush? In the words of Mary Schmich ‚Äúthe race is long and in the end it is only with yourself.‚Äù
---
I really want some better tattoos and more options
---
I decided to use one of my less loved expirements who was level 105 to do a bit of the scoreboard by rebuilding and slapping some unyielding on etc. They're 170 now.
---
Ok, let me try this a different way. Why do you think that it's OK for Bethesda to do that?
---
Well I'm not saying you are either.  I think the dust needs to settle for a bit before we go making declarations one way or another.  There are A LOT of servers populated by majority low-levels because of gamepass right now.  Perhaps this has diluted the player-base and spread out the stronger players.  Dunno but I think we need more time to tell either way.  We were almost insta-gibbing the queens on our servers yesterday in a minute after they land.
---
*PSA: Are you Bloodied on a console? Here's how to ruin your nice lcd/oled tv.*
---
I was about to get fallout and I am questioning myself now
---
Nah, been playing for 4 months now, lvl 352. First time i bought the costume though. It's all good, i'll live with it.
---
It's taken out exactly for this purpose. So they can say "hey, here's a free emote!" without any effort and call it a day.
---
Yea pretty sure the railway rifle is the only decent working pvp weapon in vats currently. Explosive lasers seem to work 50%
---
I've never been so glad to be on pc with the mod that has a line every 20%. Imagine actually putting tape on your screen!
---
It has a place in contested zones like workshops and offers the reward of the workshop. I see you ignored my question. If you need to rely on having workshops to play, it's a git gud problem.
---
No, and no.
---
By time I got back home from work it already reset, jumped online for 5 sec, quit and joined nw
---
It must only be new exploits that got banned, because i booted the game up for a few minutes to check my stash after not playing for over a month. I used the display case method to dupe scrap. I still have stacks of 100K steel, cloth, lead, acid, etc. and 10k stacks of flux. The account i actually did the duping on still exists too. No bans here whatsoever.
---
Not mad. Flabbergasted maybe... Someone brings it up in this sub every day.
---
People already know about it, I saw videos on social platforms. It‚Äôs a combination of blueprint button and select, &amp; u should be able to.
---
That‚Äôs pretty bad
---
Yeah man it looks to be that way. I wouldn't be bothered about an account wipe if I can at least keep my progression but we'll see
---
I remember the day I saw 10k of those in a bag.
---
suspension is bethesda-speak for perma ban
---
that is a drag that I cannot fault anyone for being angry about..
---
but when people demand shit without thinking of the possible implications it involves or the consequences of the "great" idea they have it is annoying AF...
---
Good riddance to garbage either way.
---
Lol before the first wipe i had 3.5milion nuka darks it was kind of funny
---
This is Bethesda. Their customer support is run by a senile drunk robobrain high on jet. Is ok for me personally? Hell no. But risk it and try to appeal to Bethesda with their rickety control over what goes on in this game? Nah.
---
Combat has better DR so if you already have that just use it while you roll SS pieces.
---
How about the man not cheat in our damn game?
---
There are other games to play if you are so upset with this one...?
---
It was for me last night on Xbox don't know about this morning
---
I dont like to bust people over the head for stuff so 2k for parametric would be fair price?
---
She explodes and ends up halfway down the fucking mountain most of the time.
---
Wrong üëã
---
the amount of rep your allowed to get per day is such bs, i dont feel bad about doing the rocksy glitch at all fuck that grind just for a subpar ammo maker that shouldve always been in the game
---
Yeah, you could literally be using a crafted non legendary weapon or a super easy to obtain one star legendary and easily kill anything in the game outside of event bosses with just decent perk builds.    
---
I really don't get the craze of god tier weapons outside of being an arbitrary thing to chase after to max yourself out for no good reason.    
---
I speced for rifle sniper like I do in every fallout, and I have the best gun I've ever had right now, witch is just a junkies + to critical 2 star level, and it's just marginally better than the 1 star anti armor level I had been using for months and months prior to that.
---
That event sucks, just buy the fixer plan and save yourself the trouble
---
If they aren‚Äôt stupid they will do that. They stand to lose a lot of money with a ban of this size.
---
Well that's fine if you're cancelling because you don't want to play.  Go enjoy something else.
---
The dupers salty after being banned, like OP, can just rightly go to hell.
---
When I saw the first one, I was impressed.  After losing count, I'm just mildly annoyed.  There are so many legit bugged weapons, why bother with those?
---
and right now its one of the top games played on gamepass
---
I agree. But in all honesty the game‚Äôs numbers are abysmal. I‚Äôd be surprised if they maintain public servers for it past Starfield release. Outrageous atom shop prices, fallout 1st, and FOMO are keeping the game on life support. Btw I did not dupe, and I‚Äôm not banned so there is no bitterness causing bias on my behalf in this.
---
I took the workshop for the challenge and invested in it so yes I was kinda annoyed I couldn‚Äôt even fight the guy for it. He wouldn‚Äôt take damage (I‚Äôm finding out now it‚Äôs because pvp vats is bugged) and was one shot me. 
---
Really dude? Telling me I should get good? I‚Äôm trying to play the game dude I really don‚Äôt need someone being toxic in game and on reddit too lol
---
Yeah i did and sure you ask regarding i dont mention anything about the not registered dmg you guys made because vats is broken currently. Everyone who would read the latest of the vault articles or patchnotes and buglists knows that already for quite a while and is basic knowledge imo for anyone who wants to engage in pvp... instead of just ranting about pvp in general i would recommend to get better at it or just dont engage in pvp mechanics
---
&gt;The problem is right at the front here
---
It still isn't the problem though. If you want an I/25/90 Handmade you'd still have to go through the same RNG
---
For having what items could you get banned?
---
HAHAHAHAHA ah yeah okay cos you could totally get a b2525 fixer for caps before the dupe. Get real.
---
&gt;s really frustrating when false positive happens because we have people like you encouraging mocking potentially innoncent players as if accidental bans couldn‚Äôt happen in one of the buggiest MMO out there... And that people are wrong to have good faith in those who claim their innocence. All of that make dealing with our false positives unsufferable and even more hopeless because the minute we ask for help here or feedbacks, we‚Äôre laughed at or accused of cheating and lying instantly.
---
THIS.
---
I find it funny how people think Bethesda devs can do no wrong.  The same people who write the buggy ass code which allows us to duplicate millions of godmode guns somehow can get it 100% right when writing code to detect a bannable offense?  Yeah, I'm gonna press X to doubt that......
---
I have no god tier items, but then again it doesn't even matter.  I still melt anything I come in contact with because everything in game is so painfully weak  that I don't even see why anyone cares about having elite guns.
---
Secret Service &gt; Scout &gt; BOS
---
With Bloodied and Serendipity and DR diminishing returns you don't really need to go to the highest tier, just enough to survive one or two hits, as that's all you'll get anyways.
---
Alright thanks for your input
---
You're right, that's a lot of cancelled subscriptions and potention atom shop pruchases lost
---
Secret Service Armor Set - Total 327DR 297ER 297RR (Best armor type in game right now)
---
Combat Armor - Set Total 226DR 266ER 0RR
---
Scout Armor - Set Total 265DR 175ER 0RR
---
All armor types have the same chance to roll with any given prefix (like unyielding). There is no "best armor type for bloodied". There are just armor types. Legendary effects are the thing that matters.

---
Don‚Äôt cheat?
---
He has a better gaming chair.
---
They made the game a chore by how boring doing the repeatable quests for bullion, caps, scrip, score, lunchboxes are. We are playing a mobile game attached to a last gen console. In game quest items are so few. Everything is through the atom shop or score system. It‚Äôs gamification of it all has completed gutted any immersion they could meaningfully implement but are pressed to add more money making tactics instead of investing in the games infrastructure for the long term by fixing it. The holes they ignore are losing them money. They are wasting time and money monetizing this to death and not having any real answer for why we can‚Äôt have any real dungeons or real quests or have any tangible influences on the game world.
---
Sure, report a guy for playing the game. OP learned a valuable lesson, doesn't mean the guy teaching that lesson needs to be reported...
---
On a separate note because I'm curious what do we even know about starfield?  Seems to have gone all quiet on that front.  I imagine current real world situation have delayed the development.
---
The next lifehack for f076 post will presumably be about quick and easy ways to remove transferred tape adhesives from expensive TV screens.
---
How is it harder to get scout than combat in unyielding? If anything it's easier since it only has 1 variant instead of the 3 combat armor has. Getting a fully heavy combat set is a pain
---
But to me it's just about looks. And heavy combat looks 100% better imo
---
I hit 39 yesterday, so I think I'm good, might buy the last few levels to just avoid the grind there but I think there will be plenty of wiggle room to complete it without.
---
That's been like that since beta, of course it didn't show numbers but it would make the noise and everything, just not register.
---
Yeah, I'd pay that without a second thought for one if I'd dumped mine, I got some of the unique named weapons early on so I've been buying max level versions when I see them and I don't mind paying a fair bit because I have the caps and it's easier than grinding a mule to 50 and getting them again.
---
BOS tends to have better durability (so you won't be repairing it as often).
---
Yeah raid needs to come back in a better version asap!!! üòú
---
It's in the walls section.
---
You dont need to change much from a commando build. If you dont have adrenal reaction mutation you'll want that. You'll want nerd rage. And then find yourself some unyielding and bolstering armor. You can do one or the other, or a mix of both.
---
Just to the West of Anchor Farm is a good spot to check as well.
---
Or you can do that with infinitesimal amount of resources by using appropriate weapons and build. This also allows you to participate actively to any activity of the game, and with actively I mean that you stay there looking other shooting things you tagged. A new player (level 50, with a semi constructed build) doing SBQ will struggle to get reward due to the 1000 damage limit because you might found servers that kill the queen in less than 30 seconds. This problem was partially solved with gauss shotgun and minigun. But by the time you get them legitimately you get them, 3 or 4 duping cycles are passed.
---
Obviously
---
And the award for most original comment of the day goes to... üò≤
---
If you knew you were trafficking in duped items, then you're just as bad as the dupers and I will support your ban.
---
Happy to help, add me: squeakybeak but wont be on till 4/5pm or so
---
The main priority is flatness. Don‚Äôt care about crops since I‚Äôm a carnivore and meat is pretty easily to find. Wouldn‚Äôt mind an extractor but that‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me. A view would be great tho...
---
What's duping?
---
The most frustrating time was getting ready to collect the body &amp; have multiple eye-bombs start exploding (then the ISS exploded).
---
I suspect she ended up as far away as White Springs...
---
I can see the Rolling Red Rocket Door in there, but it won't fit. Should there be another?
---
MIke
---
How the fuck do y‚Äôall STILL play this broken shitbag of a game? is it the sunk cost fallacy?
---
Hes just a crybaby
---
It‚Äôs Occam‚Äôs razor. If you don‚Äôt cheat, you won‚Äôt need to be worried.
---
Cool thanks will have a wander round there
---
It says it is downloaded and no I didn‚Äôt get a new Xbox
---
why the salt here? op just asked a question about this games history
---
The spot in along the road, behind the sign, just down from the Farm entrance.
---
You can't know where anything came from, doesn't mean duping was good just because someone incidentally benefited from it.  I personally give two shits about duping.  The difficulty level of the game is extremely low, and there is no element of competition for non pvpers, so it's pretty irrelevant to my experience, THAT SAID I wish people who duped and got banned and are now crying about it because of some notion that it was ok to dupe because the game isn't what they want, would can it.    
---
The game is what it is, if you wanna dupe you know full well you are putting your account at risk and if you get banned, nut up and just admit you got caught cheating and move on.
---
I‚Äôd imagine it was a launch title for the new gen, but COVID screwed with their marketing plans. They like to advertise the game at E3 prior to the fall it comes out. So in my best guess they either do a surprise announcement in august for a November, or they shelf it/do more refining for a 2021 fall release.
---
Charleston station is the one i used to use. Do you know how to trigger it?
---
I think we‚Äôll get a similar experience once they make a guaranteed Wendigo colossus spawn when nuked in Monongah mine next month
---
It was a godsend for settlement building. I was so used to it I forgot it‚Äôs not a vanilla component and was wondering why they‚Äôd nerfed CAMP building, it was the worst of time lol
---
That's the nature of workshops. VATS is fine in PvP, how do you think I took the other dudes' heads off with the shotgun? Sorry you wasted your time and effort, but you're obviously not ready to be taking workshops and holding them. I'm actually quite helpful to people when they ask advice rather than bitching that everything has to be nerfed or removed because they don't like it or don't understand the game. What platform are you on? I can help you out with some junk and stuff and give you tips on a build or whatever if you're on Xbox.
---
Have we heard if there are any new rewards?  I guess I could work on grinding them on my alts, but if no new rewards, especially no Tenderizer plan drop, then I don't know how excited I will be for it.
---
See in my original post I was using satire to point out that this environment is toxic. And that a company that creates and feeds that environment is not worth supporting. You actually are saying that you agree with it. Not here and now, and I'm sure you will try and explain why you don't. But every time you log back in, any time you buy atoms etc your saying that behavior is acceptable.
---
Also, why bother playing an online multiplayer game where fear mongering stifles or prevents player interaction.
---
All new games that hit game pass are the first few days they are out. That means nothing.
---
It can be both you know, though it's not.  You don't need those guns.  At all.  You may WANT them, but tough shit, that's what makes them rare.  You cheat you made a conscious choice to operate outside the TOS, doesn't matter if the game balance sucks, you took the risk and got got.  Own up, and move on.
---
Brill thanks
---
That some people are arseholes and hat you don't deserve the tag next to your name since you don't live up to their oaths to help others to survive.
---
I play the mode actively with a regular team and really enjoy it. I was into PUBG for a bit but found I like this better.
---
There‚Äôs the new npc trader I think the scavenger trader, anyway she has a few spawn places in the world and she also carries rare outfits at random
---
Been trying to tame creatures in this game for 9 months. Zero luck. Only recently I've noticed the option to pacify has vanished. Apparently you didn't read the entire posting.
---
Just use power armor. It shows your percentage of health and provides better protection that normal armor. Not only that but emergency protocols is like another stack of nerd rage
---
Yesterday at an event i kept hearing punching sounds and receiving damage with nothing nearby (adventure mode)
---
Dimishing returns start to affect you in \~300-350DR or so. Therefore getting the best (SS) armor type is beneficial. Especially since OP is talking about unyielding not vanguard. Also SS comes with high ER and RR too.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs because you get flagged if you have 100k of any material. You don‚Äôt. So you wouldn‚Äôt be flagged. I said that.
---
Thanks guys, I found it.  As you say, about half way down and above the other 'Garage/Workshop Rolling Door'
---
I can't though for the life of me , get it to snap in... keeps saying 'intersects with an existing object'.  Well do'h...
---
Make them untradeable so that there is no duping. Bethesda clearly cant be trusted to prevent this from happening over and over again.
---
I understand people who show up at the last second get one hit in and then rewarded I left you the hair the whole time fighting all the other Scourge you should get the loot. Thanks for the responses I appreciate them
---
If you recently bought  an explosive laser, then you have knowingly bought a duped item. I am sick of all these people saying  "I just traded for a legacy weapon I don't know if it's duped or not."  Bullshit. If you traded for a legacy weapon then you traded for a  duped weapon.
---
Every other player having a legacy weapon breaks the balance of the game. I was at Line in the Sand last night and there were TWO PLAYERS  at line in sand melting everything in sight instantly.  The weren't   even having to aim because those dam things had a huge spread. In so doing they were cheating others out of XP. This is a very big problem now that we are basically required to level up every single day to advance on the legendary board.
---
What was the ban about?
---
???? How often do you actually find 3* legendary? And scorchbeast queen? Basically the only endgame in this game? She should always drop a 3*.
---
But yeah, for random legendary, I wouldn‚Äôt mind lesser chance for 3* as long as I always get 3* item.
---
Would be nice if we had some ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù updates that sort these. The the button on the decontamination arch not working is another thing bothers me.
---
Your welcome, glad to be of service.
---
Literally someone just said in the thread vats is bugged. And then someone was condescending to me about not knowing they were bugged. Now you are telling me I am wrong and just bad at the game.
---
So which is it. Am I bad or is it bugged. Can you decide?
---
The perfect analogy quote üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
---
20 Months and still not banned.
---
You act like the game is unplayable without an elite roll gun, when we all know that's complete nonsense.  Non event boss mobs in this game are made of tissue paper and spit, and event boss mobs are always fought in groups, so who cares if you don't have the gun of your dreams.  Roll with that sub par 2 star like the rest of us, and still completely dominate everything you run across.
---
Yet it's only Ward that still goes AWOL. Rocksy and Wren don't move anymore. Maybe the Dev's hate Ward as much as we do haha
---
I learned about this a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve been running power armor forever. X-01 specifically. Calibrated shocks grant a bigger carry weight bonus than even a level 50 standard backpack and are much easier to get
---
I have thousands in treasury notes that I can't cash in since I keep earning more than 200 a day.
---
Definitely a good idea to figure out what kind of weapons you enjoy using the most and make your build around that.  If you prefer shotguns, heavy weapons, or melee weapons you‚Äôre gonna end up being a high strength build.  If you like rifles you‚Äôll be high in perception.  Few people choose to go the route of pistol builds as they‚Äôre generally the weakest in the game but that would be a high agility build I believe. Once you figure which weapons you have the most fun with, there‚Äôs plenty of good videos on YouTube about specific builds that you can kind of model yourself off of. 
---
Carry weight will be an issue soon if it isn‚Äôt already so generally want to have a few weight reduction perks in the beginning which are mainly found in strength. Also, at some point invest 2 points into the starched genes perk in luck so you‚Äôre able to manage mutations better.  The game is so much better when you‚Äôre playing with marsupial serum (the one that makes everyone jump higher than you).
---
A few things I wish I knew starting out are listed below.
---
- Scrapping weapons at any workbench unlocks mods for that weapon.
---
- Don‚Äôt hold weapons that are a lot higher level than you are.  When I started out I thought level 50 weapons were worth a lot so I filled up my stash space with them.  In reality the only rare weapons and the only ones you might want to keep are legendaries.
---
- Cook all the meat you find and sell extra to vendors. You can also sell extra water, chems, etc but especially food since it goes bad.  Vendors have a daily 1400 cap limit.
---
- There is a vendor and a scrip machine at every train station.  Use the scrip machine to sell legendary items that aren‚Äôt of use to you. Later in the game you‚Äôll use these to buy legendary weapons from the purveyor in the ash heap.  You don‚Äôt want to buy legendary weapons until you‚Äôre level 50 though as they‚Äôll be under leveled and you won‚Äôt be able to use them later in your play through due to them being under-leveled.
---
- Your SPECIAL stats each have a specific benefit they give you although it‚Äôs an unlisted effect.  Strength boosts your carry weight by 5 for each point and increases your melee damage.  Perception increases VATS accuracy.  Endurance increases your hit points and allows you to sprint for longer. Charisma allows you to share some of your perks with team members. Intelligence increases the amount of junk you get when you scrap shit, the durability of weapons/armor you craft, and the amount of experience you get from doing shit. Agility increases your AP and sneaking effectiveness.  Luck increases the condition of weapons that enemies drop.
---
- To go along with the above pointer, unyielding armor can give you 3 points to every stat except endurance when you‚Äôre low health.  So if you‚Äôre wearing all 5 pieces of unyielding you‚Äôll have +15 points to each SPECIAL (minus endurance) giving you a plethora of benefits listed above.
---
That‚Äôs all I can think of aside from letting you know the legendary effects that are most powerful.  I‚Äôll list what you want to watch for below.
---
WEAPONS
---
Anti-armor, bloodied, furious, instigating, junkie‚Äôs, quad, two-shot, vampires
---
Also watch for weapons with 25% faster fire rate, explosive effect, faster swing speed, and increased power attack damage as secondary effects.
---
ARMOR
---
While armor is a little bit more open to speculation as far as the best effects, look out for unyielding pieces and sentinel pieces especially (sentinel will be listed as the third effect and read ‚Äú75% chance to reduce damage by 15% while standing still‚Äù).
---
When in doubt use fed76.com to see if your piece is worth something or not.
---
I know this bitch has been long as fuck but I‚Äôm really glad that new players are trying the game out and figured I should do my due diligence as a veteran and toss as much helpful advice as I can muster.  I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions and thanks for reading!
---
You will hate me but i have my camp at the pond there lol. But do have a video of it appearing while my camp was there lol
---
Lol if you think the Bethesda support team is efficient or even of a decent quality. ‚ÄúIs what it is, we can‚Äôt do X Y Z‚Äù in a couple of months they will tell you here is your account back btw something something corruption, we deleted all of your characters.
---
soME oNE gAvE iT tO Me i SWEar!
---
the funny part now is all the dupers running around acting all innocent. i didnt do nuffin i sware i farmed all 45 of des weapons. you wanna buy one $14.95 on ebay o wait shit you gots me. but i only did it once for a friend who was dying of covid 27 bro.
---
i like the game, some aspects of it.  i still play it most every day with a friend (mostly because of the friend).  but maybe it needs to fail, maybe it needs to be shut down, if bethesda could finally learn that what theyve been doing for ~20 years is not acceptable.
---
the game started off as a travesty, but now its still only a half-polished turd.  there are bugs in the game that will never be fixed, because thats their MO.  from my own experience, theyve been doing this since morrowind.  and to me, the unofficial skyrim patch version history reads like a 300+ page list of things that bethesda has not, and will never, fix in skyrim.
---
maybe they needed to release a game that cannot be fixed by modders (and thus doomed to fail) to realize they need to change.  if it matters at all, ive sworn off buying anything more from them until they do.
---
Nah I‚Äôll miss them. Grinding a slot machine for a 1/1000000 chance at a gun I will probably never have even if I played the game 24/7 for 10 years.... no thanks. Thank you Dupers, you are appreciated by most of the game‚Äôs community outside of the thought bubble reddit.
---
Do you know anyone who duped? Didn't recognize anything.
---
You mean my Responders tag? Yeah I'm Responding to the treatment of my fellow wastelanders that people want to report for breaching the terms of service when they didn't. 
---
You keep acting like a joke, I'm going to treat you like a joke
---
You mean the devs that released the ammo converter? The ones that don‚Äôt play the game? Are they the same ones who ‚Äúfixed‚Äù 250 DR while reloading so that instead of breaking the tertiary effect, it broke all primary effects and all armor effects? They surely could do no wrong
---
Bonus Round: Are they the ones who fixed the wall mounted stash shelf? The one which snapped into floors and ceilings since BETA 20 updates ago? The one that now snaps onto the walls... backwards?
---
Even the market reddit for this game is still swamped with people trying to trade with duped guns. 
---
This company is complete joke,  maybe one day they might get something right?
---
Thanks will keep my eyes open ive come across some traders but never had apparel on them
---
I get tons of 3* during Uranium Fever...
---
I have cable internet.  A couple times it did seem to have a quick loss, and xbox live dropped.  Xbox live did not report issues.  I immediately checked speed on phone and it was running fine.
---
Aside from the weird internet thing, the game has had 3 times where all controls die except walking.  There were also 2 times it froze but after restart put me on the same team.
---
yeah, since it‚Äôs a different size it‚Äôs not lumped in with other garage doors
---
it‚Äôs located right under the contemporary walls if you have them, like midway down the list
---
idk email bethesda and ask them.
---
150 scrip a day makes me more angry than my BE lever-action disappearing from my inventory
---
3* drops are not supposed to be common
---
you want a guaranteed 3* drop.. go to mumbles...
---
Ammo always sells pretty well.  Thank goodness the ammo converter is still garbage.
---
Once I loaded into the game last night it allowed me to purchase the red rocket garage
---
I sometimes think about duping and such, but then I just think "Is it worth the effort to only get banned a little while later?"
---
I think that is the plan, and hopefully PvP events like faction battles or something. The focus on working together in teams to complete objectives at the moment plus Wastelanders allowing everyone to get endgame gear relatively quickly suggests to me they have plans ready to go and are slowly teaching the scrubs to git gud before they drop raids again to avoid another Vault 94 debacle. I think PvP is included because why else would we be earning ghillie skins for all of the armor sets and the backpack in the season pass? You can't use any of it in NW.
---
Was for vendor and scrip machine weapon/armour duping
---
Yeah must suck not being able to aimbot people and rely on that for kills huh
---
I bought the game at sale. I have never bought a single atom and will never pay for fallout 1st. I jumped on after wastelanders came, aware of what I went into. Its a buggy, broken mess. But fun at times. But there are pitfalls. No way for us newbies to know if the nice man with the free legacy item is a troll or not. And Bethesdas inept support cant and will never help. Therefore this psa.
---
not really, the duped weapons are gonna be cheap, the non duped ones are still worthy
---
Because combats been duped to death so it‚Äôs easier to find unyielding. Scouts gonna thru one dupe and most people duped weapons.
---
They need to add in a separate favourites thing. One is for the weapons wheel and one that will make stuff as do not scrap. I use the favorites against my rare apparel so I don't accidentally scrap it or scrip it (for the love of god let us apply combat paint jobs to fixers) so can't even use my weapons wheel most days.
---
yes, just cloth
---
When that is my build and works for 99% of the game and I had no reason to think it wouldn‚Äôt work YES. Lol please stop
---
Yep
---
That's what America wants you to think. They have caused chaos and dissorder with their politics in everywhere and even in their own country. 
---
And America will disapear, just like all the evil empires and people won't miss it. People will wonder how they let this evil empire exist and how so many people believed it's lies and propaganda. I mean who misses Rome, nazy germany or Mongol empire?
---
America is just as real as a religion. You can kill in it's name, but it won't make it right. 
---
Countries are just stories a bunch of people made up. Americas story is just so well written that it's a very dangerous story. And a lot of people believe in that story even if it's a lie, just like all the stories are.
---
This reminds me of learning to quick scope on MW2 way back in the day. We used to put a small dot of electrical tape in the centre of the screen.
---
It‚Äôs a server hop situation, once you find a spot she spawns, just server hop until you find her with outfits, if you‚Äôre on Xbox I have some spares of the outfits
---
it's great for gears, springs and screws. when i need ballistic fiber, i hit up fort defiance and camp mcclintock!
---
Double sided interior walls.  That's what I really want.
---
üòÅ
---
They did put a "fix" in for it in a distant patch, which is why it works *some* of the time now. When they first released it, it always looked like that.
---
Was a shame, for around a hundred levels, my main was modeled after Carl Brutananadilewski from Aqua Teens, and this was my go to outfit.
---
My suggestion is to just walk around the forested area till you find a clearing
---
just cloth, same with Burnt Books.
---
The strangler heart is the best imo bc it‚Äôs the only armor/PA in the entire game that directly adds damage. It may have been nerfed but still. It also looks really cool
---
Twin lakes is nice. Has some flattish sores to build on and then you can obviously build out on to the water if needed. 
---
Also the little ponds S and SE of pleasant valley station. If you put your module down right you could build on the road and still get some water in.
---
what your saying is demonstrably false, the game is absolutely littered with modded accounts and rockstar is never going to patch the act two glitch
---
edit: nobody gets banned for abusing act 2 either
---
Worthless - which is pretty much what is was pre-war too (because of the hyper-inflation).
---
It took a while to break the habit from previous games of always picking it up.  And can be frustrating when you open a safe or get a drop, and 80% of what‚Äôs in there is pre war money
---
Then regular players who had no idea lose their weapon? No
---
You guys really just don't understand this community
---
Being told what is happening behind the scenes, good or bad, is what we've always wanted rather then just
---
"I'll pass this on to the team ;)"
---
And believe me you adding your own note saying yes we know it's frustrating helps a million.
---
Only worthless if you intend to trade it. Otherwise, if you're going to use it, it's fine.
---
But still, dupers can burn.
---
Yea in-game economy is what keeps game alive for very long. Once it‚Äôs broken many people (especially the RPG aspect) will just quit soon afterwards because their efforts in-game becomes meaningless. If in real life people know the money they earn will soon worth less than toilet paper, how many will still work every day? Maybe only the real diehard workaholics who enjoys laboring not the fruit of labor. 
---
I had no idea what Turbo-fert grenade is until just now I looked it up lol, maybe it‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt deal damage so that the radius isn‚Äôt increased by Grenadier? Sounds really fun I‚Äôll have to give it a try.
---
Thanks, it has a man holding a rocket on it..
---
i wish it were for the assault rifle. they need a buff, but with the low recoil theyre honestly great.
---
They didn't nerf Bloodied... it just makes your build even less unique. I'm a Bloodied Sniper, dime a dozen of us, but I like how I play.
---
No :)
---
Ah okay gotcha. I guess it's the weapon dupes that really get their gooch, cause i still have 12K Gifts on my secondary account which is like 30K scrip at least
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a Brahmin costume and head and a Brahmin back pack ! The tenderiser is believed to be there aswell
---
Next to wayward
---
What I am  really sick of are all these people saying "I just traded for a legacy weapon I don't know if it's duped or not." Bullshit. If you traded for a legacy weapon then you traded for a duped weapon.
---
Every other player having a legacy weapon breaks the balance of the game. I was at Line in the Sand last night and there were TWO PLAYERS with explosive Gatling plasmas at line in sand melting everything in sight instantly. The weren't even having to aim because those dam things had a huge spread. In so doing they were cheating others out of XP. This is a very big problem now that we are basically required to level up every single day to advance on the legendary board.
---
Okay. And Bethesda has had three big ban waves on dupers, simultaneously trying to also get rid of the dupe via development so Bethesda is better?
---
Ive been "stuck" over 300 with Fasnacht and the number keeps going up
---
Flux or Wendigo Collosus spawn probably!
---
Or it's the truth. America is pretty much the would police rather you want to admit it or not.
---
actually no, they are not likely to be the same. there are different grades of gold and other rare elements. gold bullion is far more likely to be of a much higher purity than gold scrap that you would find in something like electronics or common jewelry.
---
It's bugged, but not in a bad way. Chances are the other player had a full set of Sentinel's/Vanguard's armor and all the damage reduction perks plus Serendipity. It doesn't matter how hard you hit if Serendipity procs and you do zero damage. You need to change your approach and ask players for help instead of immediately coming to Reddit to cry, chances are that guy was just bored and would have given you the workshop back if you asked nicely.
---
The majority of players who did it lightly will be back in the game in a week or two. Only the heavy dupers will have bans, everyone else is ‚Äútemporarily suspended‚Äù and will get their accounts released after they either remove the duped items (if any are found) or delete the effected characters
---
Well its simple then, release a offline version of FO76 and let people dupe all they want. Its not like we're getting a new Fallout game for the next 5 years anyway
---
There's also a second shovel location nearby. If you run straight west from the cemetery (downhill) for about half a minute you'll see a place that has a hole with some rad barrels and the shovel will be along the edge of the hole. It's rare that it's gone from both locations.
---
I participate in every activity in game, I have garbage mixed up armor, and a shitty 2 star junkies lever I found myself, I get looting rights on every queen I've ever fought, not that it matters because queen loot is trash.    
---
If I find a perfect weapon I'll just it, but the level of upgrade will be very small over what I have right now.  If you think you NEED these uber guns to do anything you are kidding yourself.
---
No extra , you would just stop earning
---
There‚Äôs another one if ur facing the tomb and go in that direction for lil  awhile and find some Mirlurks  next to an over turned truck with rad barrels. It‚Äôs next to a red tool box. I think it‚Äôs south but could be wrong, haven‚Äôt done this daily in forever lol
---
A little too complex but good idea!
---
Explain to me how this ruins the game for you, is it because someone might have the same weapon as you or yours has lost value, and why does that even matter?
---
Stash full, inventory full... well guess we are supposed to leave these ‚Äúrare‚Äù loots on the ground. Haha.
---
stop making sense.. SBQ is the only 3* mob..
---
how would you want to see it implemented? how would the game know which food item to automatically consume (maybe I want to sell that deathclaw steak and eat the noodle bowl)?  
---
without having a completely separate menu for setting food and drink priorities there is really no way to automate the system without it potentially consuming items you dont want consumed.
---
Whatever the reason, it's 10s of 000s accounts gone, it will effect us directly/indirectly, but it will have an effect, that a lot of lost revenue in 1st/atoms.... gone
---
this.   The same people who get mad at bethesda for writing code which allows dupes now all the sudden think bethesda is 100% perfect on something with a wide margin of error.   It's kind of silly.
---
Lmao git gud.
---
Yeah if you were to get banned it probably would have been when you did the level up glitch. You should be fine.
---
Just like GTAO
---
Most people temp banned right now didn‚Äôt dupe. You may not have those legacies anymore when it‚Äôs lifted though.
---
39 nice. I'm at 30 and I've played everyday but I've had some days autocomplete with no reward. Hopefully that doesn't screw me in the end.
---
Nope lol
---
Bruh calm down it‚Äôs a be50p fixer it‚Äôs good
---
Well we all know what kind of police America has so...
---
So can you only dupe on PC? I play Xbox and I‚Äôve never encountered any modded weapons or armor.
---
Ok, glad some new stuff to grind on my main character.  God let there be a Tenderizer PLAN though so I can scrap the ones I have.
---
The Steam version requires you to download another copy of the game.
---
Huh, what causes the items to drop? I always wondered why the mole miners over by whitesprings were always dead with piles of loot around them
---
It's not about skill it's a badly designed event. I still do it. Probably better than you. ü§£
---
Do game vendors sell it or just player venders?
---
Thousands of people opening tens if not hundreds of thousands of gifts the looted or crafted?  I got all the plans but like 2 myself and I didn't even craft any, just hunting scorched and it wasn't that hard.  I know many went far harder at it than I did.  Gifts were dropping left and right for a month.
---
While I fully agree with the bans and share your glee, bathing in the salt of their sadness... why is your gun now worthless?
---
Does it no longer work?
---
Is it broken?
---
Does it not do damage anymore?
---
If it's a gun you use often and it's now worthless, were you planning on selling it?
---
I've never understood this kind of comment. You have a gun, it works, you intend to keep it, surely it doesn't NEED value above that?
---
He was at 80% health was not running a bloodied build as I said. Even with a lot of DR I saw 100‚Äôs above his head so I was dealing damage but no health was being lost.
---
Hi i am on xbox what outfits do you have spare friend and what would their prices be?üòÅ
---
No it‚Äôs only used for a Gatling laser when you out the prime receiver in it
---
If haven‚Äôt by now I think ur straight
---
As if you know what Bethesda actually does. You work there? No? Then it‚Äôs only speculation. This is a company that can‚Äôt put a text chat in their PC game, failed a launch miserably, and the main menu of the game is still not functioning as it should since they broke it in a previous patch. I believe Bethesda is incompetent enough to screw anything up, especially creating a bot to auto-ban people.
---
Hopefully , I never got any tenderisers my luck was bad
---
It just works
---
How is it possible for you people to miss the point of steam chart comparisons literally every goddamn time?
---
The point is that the steam chart represents a *visible metric* of a cross section of the playerbase. If X number of people on steam were banned, it logically stands to reason that a similar percentage would have been banned on other platforms. Unless for some bizarre statistical reason steam client players are more likely to cheat - which is an absurd assumption.
---
When someone does a poll, they arent required to question every single human in existence, no, they question a sample group. 1000-2000-10000, etc. THAT is what the steam charts represent.
---
A sample group that can be inferred to represent the population as a whole.
---
\[edit\]
---
^(sry for yelling)
---
There is a spot in between summersville and helvetia, right next to the road on the west side of the river that is nice and flat. If you place your camp right, you can also get a bit of water. Never seen anyone using it. I was going to use it for my latest camp but chose a spot with more water.
---
My bet is it recorded how often you logged in and out of a server and how quickly. It‚Äôs probably the easiest metric for them to acquire
---
Since there are a lot of new players coming in, I will point out that using the cloth to make certain outfits can be a good way to grind caps at lower to mid levels. Civil war clothes, witch costume, etc.
---
You have to find the plans and typically add a resource besides cloth (plastic, crystal, rubber, etc), but it‚Äôs good coin until you have access to serums and other more expensive stuff to make your 1400 caps a day.
---
But make it a plan you have to learn and set it so it has about a 1% drop rate and doesn't start dropping until you've turned in at least 500 technical data.
---
Well no. I dont care about duping and I don't care if people are banned for doing so. OP is asking if people are actually being banned or being given suspensions since both are different from one another. 
---
Your brain dead response of " maybe dont cheat" belongs on a post that says they were banned for duping. Not a post asking if people were banned or suspended. 
---
OP probably knows not to cheat, as do most people with an inch of common sense. Its the people crying about it you should be commenting this on.
---
No more floating shadows bug!
---
This is the first time in a long time that large amounts of dupers have actually seen repercussions for breaking the rules. With this being the first widely circulated weapon dupe since wastelanders dropped, it makes me feel like maybe bethesda's actually going to stay on top of this stuff more, now that a lot of new players have started and there's a definitive roadmap for the next year. Makes me happy that even the Bethesda mods are taking the game more seriously now.
---
Also I wasn‚Äôt crying to reddit as much as I was wanting to start some discussion as to wether pvp should still exist in adventure mode. 
---
I do not need help and was not asking for it.
---
congrats?
---
I noticed this too
---
I've duped before but on accident and I didnt even know it existed, I was lagging bad and when I picked my partial T-51b set it went in my inventory but was still on front of me so I could grab it again.
---
...Wait, BUYING ranks was an option?  How do you do that?
---
Would be better if it was a building set instead.
---
I‚Äôll see what I have as spares when I get home from work and we‚Äôll talk about prices then
---
theres a difference between "realistic" and "Internally Consistent". realistic would be matching the current real world, so no mutant bat dragons and laser guns. Consistent would be if you have humans in your game, have them act like humans, or give a plausible in-game explanation about why they would differ. Just having humans magically never need food or water doesn't make any sense, even in the fallout universe.  
---
now if you want to hand wave it away for the sake of the game being "more fun" that's a different argument, but then it's moving away from the post apocalyptic survival game it's billed as,
---
The only thing I have in large quantity is faschnat masks which I have over 100 of. I grinded that event every day while it was up. If I got banned for selling them for 10 caps apiece then I am done with this game for good. Tired of legit players getting shafted.
---
Should have just added it in as a new gun.
---
Let's not M\_GA things anymore.
---
Never acted that the game is "Unplayable without a elite roll"
---
And no, I play the game to get as good as i can, and not to " roll with sub par 2 star " weapons. To me thats not fun. I want to be as good as i can be.  Calling people out for not following your regime and meta is dumb. let people enjoy things.
---
And again, im pointing out the RNG of the game, not how to play the game, cause people enjoy different things. If you like rolling with 2 star weapons, then good for you! Seriously, good for you. I have 2 star weapons that I use of course but would much rather have a 3rd star if it has one. Thats how I play. Thats how I enjoy the game. You enjoy 2 stars, I enjoy 3 stars.
---
Yes, remember during Gay Pride month when they gave us a Free Icon and Picture Frame that they said would be and already was free forever?
---
Yes I'm a junkies build and I was planning on trading for some junkies weapons, I tried the market multiple time and noone even bothers to respond, mind you I'm not asking for anything crazy just a junkies hand made of same value
---
I‚Äôve never heard that it was a bug
---
I can know exactly where my Vault armor came from, it was the most intense, challenging, and fun time I've had in the game so far earning it lol
---
All these players need to learn to git gud or shut up, because from the way things are going with the new events requiring teamwork and ghillie skins for all the armors and backpack as season rewards suggests to me Bethesda has plans to reintroduce raids with unique rewards and probably faction PvP in future.
---
I've only been playing a short while (Just hit Lvl 50 and what a grind that was) and I thought this was one of the best in my recent gaming experience with players helping other players by giving them items to help them along the way but how do I know the items a duplicate?
---
Really concerned now that I may face a suspension or even worse a ban....Are we now saying don't accept help from any players we may bump into? 
---
I prefer to work to get the meta items but until now there is no way I was turning down help, I have also past that help onto lower rank players I have met as I grew out of the items and gifted to them along with Aid, junk etc  so do I stop that as well?
---
Thank you much appreciated
---
I don't see why that's harder to believe than someone duping a fairly useless item just to give them to people in small amounts highly unlikely to get anyone's account flagged.
---
Are there numbers? How many bans? That‚Äôs great to hear!
---
Why do you have to be a jerk if your going to be one just leave no one cares
---
I think the issue is that people are mad at , like you said, getting a disease during a long fight. but there are perk cards and equipment pieces in the game specifically designed to prevent getting diseases. Just because you decided to use something else instead doesn't mean the mechanics are bad.
---
I'm on PC and need help with this one as well..haven't really dedicated much time to it, but if you want to give it a go...PM me and I can hop on.
---
Never duped, but I'm pretty sure I got my hand on a couple of duped items (TSE250 gauss and recently a JE laser rifle) by trading items that I got with scrips. Do I deserve ban? If yes, anyone who got its hands on duped items deserves the ban as well. Doesn't matter if this item were bought by trading player to player or by buying from camp machines. Otherwise you are agreeing with me. Dupers are a problem but they kept alive the game.
---
I use the carmea after she's dead, that will up your chances like 75 percent to find the body.
---
It's been happening for ages and Bethesda doesn't seem worried about changing it so it could possibly be on purpose to solve people whining about the low chance of each item dropping, but it was definitely originally only one of the items would drop.
---
There is some nuka themed junk items that are exclusive to the nuka-collector fratboy's room you enter durign the Nukashine questline. Lewis is his name irrc.
---
I'm not calling you out for not doing what I do.  You called these items fundamental.  They aren't.  If you want to have the uber tier god roll best of the best, that's awesome, do it, but it's not fundamental in anyway, certainly in no way does your desire to have that shit justify duping.    
---
If you want it, earn it.  If the RNG sucks too bad play a different game, or pester the devs to make changes.  Or if you dupe, suck it up and admit you got caught, and don't blame beth.
---
I could easily ask you the same question..
---
also FYI if you do not like my posts.. there is a block option you might find useful..
---
"You can lick my an√∫che" is going on my resume
---
Aw :&lt;
---
Apparently they appear at camp grounds. There's that one from the photo op daily north of sacrament. I found a trader there once.
---
some of the NPC randoms actually comment on finding $200 in cash and that it would make good kindling. And yes it is worthless,
---
Had to spin mine around to make it fit
---
It's in the Wall category, a ways down.  
---
I'm not on at the moment, but if memory serves the image kind of makes it look like the door is open.
---
I don't run a Bloodied build either and I still run Serendipity all the time because it's the most OP perk in the game. The damage numbers are borked in a bunch of different ways and don't show actual damage being dealt.
---
Why create an online multiplayer just to turn it into an offline single player? Why would you buy a multiplayer game and then want to play by yourself? That is like going to a music concert and being upset other people are there.
---
There are some spots in the very south of the map that I've seen that are gloriously flat, some right on a small stream/river that runs towards the Bog, and have some great views. I've been quite tempted there myself.
---
You looking to make a farm or just need a large, open area?
---
There‚Äôs also one by the safe on Deathclaw Island. Not close to this spot but it‚Äôs usually there and not far from other locations many of us visit often. 
---
But like other commenters I eventually just broke down and got a legendary one that I can‚Äôt scrap by accident.
---
Didn‚Äôt say it was bad, on the contrary I said it was a neat idea, just aggravating at specific times.
---
Seriously, if you believe that's true, you need help.
---
So the fact that they used to award scrip or that they still give caps doesn't sound like a possible reason someone just might have maybe.... Oh I dont know, made MILLIONS of them?
---
Well Bethesda, I can't speak for everyone but I'll go on record and say this man is innocent.
---
Thanks for the offer. Someone PM'd me and we traded revives. Gonna delete the thread now
---
Cool
---
do you mean on the Queen's corpse, or from the event? If you're talking about the corpse, sometimes the game lags so hard from everything that has been happening, it takes a while for the loot to be computed and displayed. so just hand around until things die down and check again.
---
But serendipity requires you to be below 30% health to have effect. He was at 80% at LEAST so it‚Äôs not possible that was the case.
---
We're having a discussion but you just don't want to listen to anyone that disagrees with you. If you can't hold a workshop against one player with other people helping you then you clearly need help, but you do you.
---
It's *Whitespring*, not *Whitesprings*.  We can't make it great again if we don't even call it by its name.
---
Hey don't speak for all of us!  I care about what /u/RF_huntr has to say!
---
than rockstar? funny. gta online is so much more complex code wise than fallout 76 its actually incredible, there could be a million things going on at once that wont cause any lag while this game goes down to like ten fps on console from five people shooting at the SBQ, bethesda wont even TRY functional ground vehicles. i love this game but comparing it to things like gta and red dead is a complete joke and the numbers prove it. wastelanders brought the average nuclear winter player number up to like 12k recently... there are more people still playing halo 3 matchmaking than that right now lol
---
edit: 12k per day
---
Wait is it a given those 3 star effects that's pretty good
---
Well, if you tried the market multiple times then that might go some way to explaining just how valuable it really is. Most players will already have their favourite weapons.
---
Just keep hold until some of the newer players get to the point of needing legendaries.
---
1. Well when you have so many glitches it's going to take quite a while to fix all of them.   Many have been fixed many have not been fixed.  Yes it would be great if things got fixed more quickly.
---
2. There is a distinct lack of end-game progression content for groups since they got rid of vault 94 I'll agree on that.
---
3. They have added a lot of community requested features but yes there are many more QOL features that could be added.  Conversely, I see a lot of stupid ass shit suggested by the community as well so, yeah.
---
4. That you are suggesting that an MORPG game should not police it's game or ban people for breaking the TOS is absurd.  Everyone who duped or cheated or did anything against the TOS should face their punishment.  All of these cheaters are why we got an entire Wastelanders expansion where all of the new gear is character locked.
---
5. I pay $8.33 per month before taxes and get the tent, my own bleeping server, the scrapbox which is worth the price of admission alone and the atoms alone are worth far more per month than the price of the sub.  Of all of your arguments this one is the most strange to me.
---
6. I've spent 10 times the amount of hours in 76 compared to a  game like Fallout 4.  It's so much better to play the game with friends as opposed to only brain-dead NPCs at your side who only repeat the same garbage.
---
7. I've never been scammed but I've never gone first in a trade with a stranger so idk there may be a connection there.....
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware, if you get suspended the email will say so. If you are perma-banned, they‚Äôll send you an email for that. I remember reading some guy‚Äôs perma-ban email on Reddit awhile back. 
---
In reality, though, nobody really knows how Bethesda handles this process so it‚Äôs best just to wait and be patient if you are suspended. My two cents, though.
---
Yup, if you go into vats you'll see an invisible enemy, with a 0% hit to chance that takes no damage.
---
The best endgame gear and a perfect build wouldnt help for these crybabies to complete one of the vault 94 raids on expert even if there would be 0 lag
---
the damage is not equal.. but it is still so far above mobs HP that you will 1shot everything regardless of that fact..
---
the market for trading was oversaturated with duped weapons, so if you found something cool, you no longer had a chance of people buying it legit. So if you're going to use the weapon, theres really no impact from dupers, but if you're looking to play the trade game, duping is really bad for the game.
---
It would be so much fun to run whitesprings with the old spawn mechanic with a few friends in a private server. :/ it's a shame the nerf happened before first dropped.
---
If he has all the damage reduction perks plus a full set of Van/Sent armor you wouldn't even do enough damage to even see his health bar move. PvP is about DPS because of the damage cap.
---
The recent patch significantly buffed the drop rate of three star items from three star creatures. No it‚Äôs still not 100%, but the chance seems to be at least twice as high. Before patch I get one three-star loot from the SBQ out of 3 or 4 battles, now it‚Äôs like 80% of the time. They are moving in the right direction, yea I agree that the endgame boss, if no other creatures, should guarantee a three star drop every time.
---
What can I say, I never heard anything about them getting duped,  and if they did give scrip it wasn't for much or for long.
---
I've been missing my gift emote for over a month and don't have any of my fo1st emotes even though I'm actively subscribed. I just want the gift one back :(
---
Well, that just ruins the economy no? If we can‚Äôt trade for good weapons because we need to assume everything is duped and if we trade for it we could get banned.
---
Yes! The fancy shotgun is a set item. Its a really good weapon to have if you're a shotgunner. But it's quite rare.
---
I usually use a spot in the mire
---
Im just saying they need to increase the zombie spawns and magic item drop rates at the Whitehouse.
---
Bloodied definitely does more damage.... But i enjoy my junkies build since it's high health and less micro managing.
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
I have a tiny sliver of a post it note at the bottom of my compass that shows me where the center is as well. Makes it easier when running towards something. I don't have to guess if I am running in the right direction or slightly off.
---
The ghouls at the golf club alone, would mostly be legendary... everyone would just wait outside while someone went in and brought them out.. 
---
There would be bags of legendaries littering the ground and you could occasionally even find a nugget of gold among them.. 
---
In the beginning the glowing ghouls would give over 600 xp.. that part was nerfed at least twice that I remember
---
No one is duping stims. Carry all you want.
---
It's been like that for me since yesterday. At some point I was able to buy the Red Rocket Garage, but then it would only let me see owned items.
---
I do remember them being able to drop  individually. But now u can only get them from the bundle I thought
---
Sad thing is many of these duping accounts aren't even the main account.
---
It's a great event. Let me know when you can solo it or melt the bitch with a plasma flamer before her stealth field activates. So many arrogant scrubs on Reddit. ü§£
---
Curious as to....why?
---
scraps for cloth, bulk cloth sells at bot vendors.
---
Or...
---
cloth + acid = gunpowder.
---
I‚Äôm happy I didn‚Äôt own anything worth duping . Temptation probably would have got the best of me .
---
No more than 2 at 100%.
---
Its just sad to see so many ppl here more like to rant or cry instead of changing something about their playstyle... when i offered expert runs for everyone to get the mask before wastelanders i had guys who  died the whole time and when i asked them for a ss of their build i got a mess where even super duper was on and other weird stuff. They more likely rant and demand from bethesda to make the raid so easy that you can do it solo because they dont like playing in a team...
---
I didnt dupe but got duped items and now I'm banned üòê
---
Why is there pvp if I can‚Äôt even rely on something as simple as my damage numbers being correct? Why is there so much mystery and ambiguity? It just feels like the system would be better off removed entirely. This game is already full of bugs I just don‚Äôt see the point.
---
Just go to Public Teams and join one with space. Or create your own Event Team, someone will join you and you'll get it.
---
You can just join a public team for the daily
---
Why? Because the ban wave going on and If I have too many it might become suspicious to bethesda? I don't duplicate anything but I don't want to even have the risk of getting my account suspended or banned
---
Yeah a friend and I were battling with a legendary sheepsquatch on low level alts over by that train station and his dumb ass is just strolling around whistling. Strolls right up to the sheepsquatch and right on by like nothings happening. Had the nerve to talk shit while we were getting our ass kicked. I will shoot him in the face every time I go there. I also shoot Bruiser in the face any time I'm at Ohio River Adventures.
---
I didnt hear about that, thats kinda exciting, ive dropped about 6 nukes trying to see one, got tired of doing silo runs and haven't seen one yet.
---
I have sold Treasury Bonds for 1k each. I listed them as a joke (I had 15), and someone bought them all. I actually felt bad, thinking that no one would actually buy them. 
---
They're worthless notes, for those who don't know.
---
Good.  I'm hoping for  a chilling effect on future exploits.  People may be reluctant to chest if there's a chance they will be punished.
---
I can agree that playing with friends is fun but I think overall fallout 4 is just better content and gameplay wise. And mostly everything I do agree with you on except the ban system it‚Äôs not consistent I know people that have been duping before the dupe became public and they have characters on top of characters filled with all these crazy weapons and there not banned yet, it makes 0 sense. With fallout 1st I know they said a lot of things but so far nothing really has changed that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve read and seen people complain about
---
No more scrip. Caps only.
---
You get banned for duping the score points
---
Yeah I'm looking forward to Reddit having a meltdown lmao
---
No no, why do you keep so many?
---
supposedly going into NW or the atom store when booting up, prior to entering adventure mode, can also trigger it. don't know the validity of those statements, but im trying to do everything i can to make sure it doesn't happen to me again. I didn't play during the update time, but that evening when i logged on for the first time, i went to the atom store first. im not convinced it's a cause, but i wont be testing my luck either.
---
also, make sure to completely close out the game and not leave it running in the background.
---
Dude give it a week and any bloodied fixer is going to be a sky high asking price again, just relax.
---
Bloodied does deal more dmg total. Now I have done both bloodied and junkies builds. Junkies biggest advantage is that they can use power armor significantly easier. As they don‚Äôt need legendary armor or serdipity. They are also less vulnerable to radiation that bloodied. Junkies definitely has some advantages over Bloodied but bloodied does deal more dmg.
---
lol i saw white + great again and immediately thought of trump and boris johnson
---
you need people who know what they're doing
---
sneaky bois in sneaky suits are the ones who should grab pylons as they never get aggro-ed by mobs
---
or those who are built to tank.
---
do not go anywhere near eyebots, pick them off from afar to set off chain reactions which will destroy most of them in the wave.
---
DPS builds should focus down the Imposter once it's vulnerable
---
Plus you then have to micro manage all your addictions. You can only have 5 addictions at a time, and if you dont constantly have those items on hand to keep taking them, you suffer all the debuffs. It's not a worthwhile build in my opinion unless you are really into micro management and inventory management. 
---
Meanwhile bloodied is easy mode. Having low health doesnt really matter if you do what you should be doing anyways and regular unload your junk. Dying has no consequences.
---
Oh they nerfed em? oh well
---
No more SCRIP from gifts; they removed it.
---
Don't let this deter you, I was a critic back at launch but I have to say the game is so much better than it was back then, it deserves a second look review in my opinion. This duping exploit, I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of the community found out that it had been happening recently due to these bans, it was handled pretty swiftly.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure I want to put tape on my tv screen. Actually, I'm sure that I don't want to do that. But to each their own!
---
I prefer the combat armor but if you can I‚Äôd to get secret service armor it‚Äôs worth it
---
They could be legit. I always end my non 76 games with like 20 stealth boys because I never use them.
---
Ohh. Idk tbh. I have maxed out travelling pharmacy. And my stash is near full. I often give away a fair bit of stims to noobs. Idk how I have so much. I grind a lot of events and west tek
---
They tend to have lots of stims
---
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""wrongfully banned""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
---
You will have to server hop more.Sometimes id soes not spawn and someonetimes, someone else loot it. Try private server, public, join your friends public server etc.
---
All else equal, Junkie does same dmg at around 50% HP. Below that, B &gt; J. Above that, J &gt; B. 
---
You lose a few special stats with addictions, but not really a big deal.
---
your safe, the auto flag (if they even have one for stims) is probably stupidly high, like 1 million + in a month (exaggeration to make point)
---
i constantly have 600+ on me, at about 1200 il pawn off like 300 to a friend and 300 to random low levels
---
I'm heavy shotgun build and I just trade any riffles I get for rare plans etc out fits, yes duping wrong but then on other hand, I spent two full weeks doing fasnact and I mean the full two weeks alarm set on the hour every hour and I didn't get the raven or crazy, week before that I spend hours killing mole miner's didn't get the croc back pack I know some rng is essential but if I kill over 300 miners I want that back pack if I do over 200 event and still don't get all the mask something is wrong üò†
---
I don't have quite that many, but I hover down to 60 during the week and up to 100 on the weekend. Haven't run out yet.
---
I got an AA2515 Handmade from her. Quite happy about it.
---
I am, especially after Fasnacth.  I missed meat week last time.  Think I had just started playing.  Looking forward to Halloween too.  Didn't really do that at the low level at the time.
---
Was anybody else reading this waiting for ‚Äúand now I‚Äôm banned‚Äù at the end? lol
---
Personally, I think the ban wave was handled strangely. I personally know a RMT duper who wasn‚Äôt banned, but know countless people (those who duped and some who only received guns during the ordeal) who have been banned or suspended.
---
I like to collect things ingame, myself. I‚Äôm quite sure others do, too. However, I don‚Äôt see someone else acquiring said item as well as a bad thing. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd be selfish if I said that. I will say, however, if they‚Äôre this serious about the dupe and would rather ban players than fix countless issues ingame, that they need to remove legacies from the game entirely instead of lazily removing from the drop pool.
---
I‚Äôd understand if they started taking action from previous dupes, as well, but this doesn‚Äôt seem like that. I personally view the present dupe as more detrimental to the game as caps are still used in almost every transaction in the game whether or not it‚Äôs with a player.
---
I suppose the TL;DR version of this is that I‚Äôm confused about what Bethesda‚Äôs priorities are. Are they always banning cheaters or are they banning only when convenient?
---
Are they wanting to ban dupers or exploiters? Are certain bugs, such as god mode, bugs that you can‚Äôt get banned for? The NW cheaters? Countless exploits and cheaters that get looked over while Jimmy and Flump over there got banned for getting some guns from a high level.
---
If they want to clean shop, clean all of it.
---
It's all a bunch of bullshit bethesda is fuckin up
---
In looking back, my response was meant to be under ‚Äúpermaban he is pissed.‚Äù However I see now that my reply didn‚Äôt actually go under that comment, my bad.
---
It's not a BE, there's no explosive on it.
---
My experience with junkies is just use drugs that you are okay with having the debuffs for most of the time. Like my build has max strength so I use drugs that give a debuff to strength.
---
There's no way they will think you dupe stims.  They fall from the sky basically!  SBQ alone gets you like 10 or more.  You find them everywhere.
---
Carry all you want.  300 stims is a lot of weight though. Might want to shave that down just so you have room for other things!
---
From what I understand, it‚Äôs intended for the gauss shotgun to fire fully charged in vats by just tapping, without actually charging it.
---
Just create a new one.. that counts
---
be sure to submit a ticket. we need to be as vocal as possible with this.
---
Yeah I don't know about this in particular, but I'm pretty sure Bethesda is balancing things behind the scenes constantly now, the "magic" shotguns effect got removed, then added back in the PTS doing slightly less damage, so my theory is they are starting with those and then we'll see other weapons increasing in damage too, possibly along with renaming and modifying/combining some of the legendary effects that were previously unpopular. The game is direly needing an endgame before all the veteran players get bored since they removed the Vault raids and I think they are just ramping up the difficulty very slowly to avoid all the crying those caused.
---
Im not saying its fundamental, im saying that if the RNG was better, then it would be easier to get them ( of course haha ). 
---
And yeah of course thats why alot of people play the game is to earn the best of the best. But they give up after months and months of rolling every day because its just to scarce to get those types of guns ( and that is understandable too. Not everyone should have the god tier weapons). So what do people do? they dupe. Problem solved. No more grinding. And thats the problem. They dupe cause they cant get the best, and trading for the best you either need to sell your soul or first born child for such weapon. And they solve that problem with duping again.
---
 This is a two way street. I understand that there has to be grind in it, otherwise people will play for a few weeks before getting the best of the best, and then leave. Like I said earlier, they can solve the problem, but that will just bring in another problem. They want people to stay. So they decided to make the grind really long.
---
Idk if im making sense but yeah hahah. Its just how i view it. They have to up the chances for better guns. For example something simple that would help already is to let 3\* enemies drop 3\* weapons. At the moment it just isnt worth hunting for 3 star weapons because the chance of getting a 1 star is just too big. The drop rates should be tweaked more.
---
Okokok ill stop now xD Its just all my opinion. Hope it makes a little sense at least  :)
---
I dont think this is true.
---
Bloodied far out damages a junkies build. The reason bloodied builds are so popular is because there are so many good things that stack with it. There‚Äôs the adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage that boost your damage significantly. Junkies is second to it but it does not beat Bloody builds damage at all.
---
Dupers don't keep the game alive.  I also don't think they are as big of a problem as people tend to make them out to be.  There is no competition in this game unless you pvp, which most people do not, so what difference does it make to me if someone wants to dupe a god tier gun?  Any ole gun melts any monster in this game, so I won't even know the difference.    
---
That all said duping IS cheating.  It's breaking the TOS.  If you wanna dupe getting banned is all part of the game.  When they come here crying they just HAD to dupe because it's too hard to get god tier items, that's when I call BS.  They didn't have to dupe, and rarity of the best items (that you in no way need to do anything) is not justification for a) cheating or b) complaining that you got banned.    
---
I don't care if you bought duped shit, I really don't.  I'm really just trying to disagree with this notion that duping was justified because the game is too hard, and that the dupers are the real heroes.  It's nonsense, it's not essential.  People just want the best stuff, and think it's too hard to earn it honestly.  That's it.
---
Fair enough, I used to keep 100 in my Stash "just in case" I was running low. Now I keep 15, sell the rest to vendors or drop em in my Vending Machine for 5c each
---
I‚Äôm on pc so I have not clue about that. I usually just exit to desktop through the menu and not a forced shut down or anything.
---
you should be proud of yourself, it looks fantastic! and even more so as a native appalachian it reminds me of the gas stations i encounter in rural virginia, right off the side of the road :-) love this a lot
---
I have 2 bloodied builds (one was a regular that i switched over yesterday thanks to a load of Uny SS armor, but thats another story) and 1 junkie build
---
The bloody builds do way more damage and with the full unyielding effect on SPECIAL are far more verstile.. plus the XP gain is way bigger than the junkie. 
---
In fact I wouldnt bother with a Junkie build knowing what I know now and will probably convert that toon to bloodied if/when i get all the armor and another decent bloodied weapon.
---
If you can't handle bugs, don't play Bethesda games. You clearly don't want to learn and just want to bitch and moan because you think games should be tailored to your preferences, so please don't bother replying.
---
Chances are you ran into someone in god mode. Yes, I know Bethesda said they fixed it. They didn‚Äôt.
---
I think the Whitespring is okay as it is
---
Because Fallout has always been a single-player game and I like exploring the world  by myself?
---
Oh interesting... I'll have to have a further play with it then. Thanks
---
Excellent work! I feel like a feral ghoul could pop out at any moment to punch me in the face while I'm accessing my stash!
---
True. I do have maxed travelling pharmacy. They don't take up too much but I'll give some out to the gamepass players
---
What if Bob only cares about 1 reward and buys to it, than ignores the SCORE altogether? He gets a guarentee of what he really wanted and gets to enjoy his game. He does not care about higher levels or reaching the end.
---
(Side note I'm not a Bob... I want that fireplace so back to grinding)
---
Like you bought them in a vendor, or... ?
---
I know a Chinese hacker that copied whole Watoga City for his camp. He put it north of Flatwoods. It was insane.
---
Well I apologise for calling it braindead. I agree with the whole don't cheat premise.
---
because. once you start duping you start selling and since we can have private servers they will just bring people to them to buy and sell and it doesn't stop the cheating. they did the crime now to do the time.
---
Wastlanders was a big chance to turn the Whitsprings from a boring zone full of ghouls and other Monsters to a ventre for all the players with  NPCs all over the zone, shops, C.A.M.P.s, minigames, in general, the ventre of the West Virginia, I'd love to see that in the future
---
Charging weapons behave oddly in general.  I've had exactly what your'e talking about happen to the gauss rifle.  I'm PS4 as well. The gauss rifle will also charge fully then when I release to fire it just powers down.  This happens 1 out of every 10 shots for me.
---
I haven't had as much experience with gauss shotgun issues but I've only used in NW. I have had it act like it fired twice in a row from one trigger pull but assumed it was server lag.
---
You can‚Äôt have a discussion that‚Äôs on you my dude. Anyway thanks for your input.
---
The body. I get the rewards from the event I just don't get any loot from the corpse like stabilized flux that's what I want I want stabilized flux and the ultracite plans and the repair kits that come with it
---
Took me a while to figure it out too hahah
---
That was exactly it!
---
üòÇ crybabies are downvoting
---
Youtubers probably banned as well. Juice head had that exploding flamer. Wonder if he caught one?
---
Fair point.
---
I did it.
---
Turn it around it shod snap
---
Np i also have around 200-300 stims so thats not a problem especially in the endgame where you have mutations that will regenerate health youre going to stack all those stims. So thats not a problem at all
---
Not when Mumbles gave you a Troubleshooter's Explosive Railway Rifle and a complete set of Troubleshooter's Armor.
---
Agree, but also to be fair, a persistent live service game like this can only generate new story content so quick, so seasons and events constitute a sizable portion of 76 end game content right now.
---
Yeah I've had the double shot on my combat shotgun occasionally which I assume was just lag. I just find the charging random, but maybe its a issue with my trigger.
---
Your friend needs to go to social-click your name-join! Have fun.
---
I hadn‚Äôt even thought about colossus. Is he on PS4 yet?  I‚Äôve never seen it spawn.
---
I have a bloody hybrid tank build. Since beta...I made a tank build that evolved into bloody. With proper legendary gear, backpack, certain perks points. I have in my opinion the best compromise. Start with high health, as more damage received. The more damage I put out. Like others said about bloody. Easy mode.
---
Speaking of worthless notes. Is it possible to rename notes? Like items and gear? I‚Äôve seen things in vendors I‚Äôve never seen in the wild. Idk if I just confused them for something else but what u just said reminded me of it. T-bonds are very easy to confuse with the T-notes if ur not a vet to the game.
---
If Bethesda bans the cheaters and no one is left, did anyone notice?
---
I have heard of god mode but haven‚Äôt seen it for certain. If he was a bloodied build I wouldn‚Äôt have been so annoyed by the whole exchange because I know serendipity is very strong. Was quite frustrating I‚Äôll definitely say.
---
Mistype it‚Äôs B50p it‚Äôs good
---
* When you‚Äôre buddy wants to join you, as long as you are friends you can go into the social tab, select the player, and then choose ‚Äújoin‚Äù. As long as the world isn‚Äôt full you can join each other.
---
* Each person has a separate CAMP, however (and I don‚Äôt know if this has changed) if you are teamed up, you can modify each other‚Äôs camps.  
---
* You can go through quests together for the most part, sometimes quests will send you to a different random location, but otherwise yes you are working on the quests together, and in fact, helping each other with quests will get you bonus Caps and XP
---
* No, there are no guilds/clans in this team, at least not officially.  This may change with future updates.
---
Well, technically, you said they were fundamental in your first comment, that's the whole thing I was responding to, lol.  
---
I know why people dupe.  I know the rng is rough, and I know that people are impatient and feel that they must min/max their builds.  I'm fine with all of that.  I fully support better drops, if nothing else legendary enemies should drop the corresponding level of legendary (3 star mob = 3 star drop 100%), because it's dumb that they don't.         
---
I'm just saying people don't NEED those items and people don't NEED to dupe.  There is no need here.  It may be that some discomfort in not being uber enough is being assuaged, but that's about it.  :P    
---
And I say if you (not you personally, the general you) wanna dupe, go for it but just accept that getting banned is part of that choice, and don't try to make up excuses to let yourself off the hook for breaking the TOS.
---
I think it‚Äôs a skin for the Assault Rifle, not the Handmade Rifle, but I‚Äôve been wrong before.
---
No they won‚Äôt be able to invite people who didn‚Äôt dupe it will be just them with other dupers
---
Your friend can join through the friends list in the main menu as long as you're PS4 friends. Camps are separate but if you're teamed up you can build at each other's places, just not atom shop items. Quests can be run together but you both have to do the steps to progress them. No clans.
---
I'm on PS4 too if you peeps want another to run around with. My psn is kit_cloud
---
Ik right, it's like nahh these people duped because of our incompotence so we ban them, and those who are using actual hacks lets keep them in the game. And all these people being salty about dupes 90% of ur weapons have probably been duped the ones u traded for atleast.
---
This, this , and this again. Idk how many ppl I kno that rushed one side or other cuz they thought they had to choose right away.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to it I want that costume for my collection
---
Safe to assume that if you get something in the game without using questionable methods you don't need to worry, regardless of the amount gained or amount in the stack. basically, if you have to question whether or not what you are doing is allowed, maybe... don't do it?
---
No worries, I know there‚Äôs a lot of noise going on around banning, so it makes discussing it increasingly difficult. In all honestly, I check this Reddit before anything else when I wake up, including drinking coffee. Lesson learned üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt mind duper‚Äôs as long as their not duping for days at a time getting hundreds of copies of rare guns even then it‚Äôs like a 50/50 if there toxic then yes they deserve the ban but if they dupe it then give it all away then they deserve a ban casual players like my self are using guns that without the dupe would of never seen and hoarders are mad because there stock is worthless
---
Awesome thanks for your help.
---
When should we expect accounts to be unbanned
---
Yep and sadly I was a hoarder myself once but I now just have a bunch of strange things
---
Thanks! I might take you up on that!
---
It‚Äôs a term used by Las Vegas casinos. It means that casinos really don‚Äôt care deeply about the typical customers, but there are some clients that drop large amounts of money, and these are the customers the casinos want to keep happy and coming back.
---
I thought there was a 3 hour cool down on encryptid?  Or are you guys server hopping en masse?
---
Cranberry Bog, at places like Quarry X3. Also in the Toxic Valley around Grafton. But these places are usually very remote.
---
It doesn't take longer than 30 min to get all the daily SCORE tbh, the level up using a new character and setting your camp, nuild an armor piece, and then build a weapon and go in and kill the dude inside the Wayward and you're done and get an easy 500.
---
Yeah there's several spots it has a 10% chance to spawn when the area has been Nuked.
---
Same for me.
---
I heard it‚Äôs above 100k
---
Heck I ran a silo two weeks ago.  Spawned into the nuke zone south of fissure site prime and by the time I ran the 200+ feet to the SBQ she was dead.
---
I thought you meant the one from the main menu, pleasantly surprised. Great job! Now if only we could get a building set like the Sanctuary houses.
---
Those are the real villians to me.  I don't really care about duping because adventure mode is glorified solo and if you wanna spoil your own experience, whatever, but cheating in a competitive mode should be nipped in the bud, hard.
---
I got 3. They fun but not too great cuz the weight. It‚Äôs like 14 lbs
---
It's not to often now, that someone talks about a gun and it not being a BE or B2525.
---
Tried it a couple of times now and gosh, is it a steel farming bonanza! And it's fun to see Scorched gibs flying around with each blast :)
---
Thanks you so much for the tip again.
---
You are in luck, buddy
---
I bought 6 from a vendor for 20 caps each.
---
I have 3 left. Do you need 1 or all 3?
---
GT: rammadeus
---
Camp is near top of the world. if you want them (free)
---
GT?
---
For him to you join you you can hit Option &gt; R1 &gt; Find his name, hit X, invite to team.  he'll get an invite
---
He can go through the social menu and port to the server you're on if you are already in a game.
---
You won't be able to share a camp.  In the sense that it's your camp and you give him the ability to build it together.  It's your camp, you have the control.  However, any workshop you take together you can both build in.
---
You will be able to go through the quests together.  I should warn you though, this isn't the most streamlined experience.  it's pretty good and better than it was a year ago.  In some cases you share the completion, in others you both have to do the quest objectives as though you aren't on a team.  Some buildings require you to enter separately (you'll see a prompt) while others want you to join in as a team.
---
To my knowledge you cannot create a permanent team/clan.  I haven't found where you would (can someone confirm?).  So you have to do your own thing there I believe.  For example, I play with a friend and we made a "clan" but it's more of an inside joke thing.  We both have a sign on our CAMPs with our team name.  Just a little thing to add some flavor.
---
Hope this helps. Cheers.
---
I swear to God I got the game right before they added it so when I went to the air port it wasn't there at all and when I came back after learning about it it was there
---
Yeah, having say weapon racks store 1 (one) item, or a armour dummy store one set of armour, without eating weight cap.
---
And if you duped, that was some ignorant, selfish üêÉüí©
---
I don't see the option at all. Where is it for You? Thanks!
---
Only those who duped. A fair bunch of players. Yes a lot of people are getting banned/ suspended. At least that's my take on it
---
Real nice, 50C is super under rated
---
Or ppl being 100 in score rank, lol. Nice season.
---
Yea, but at least you dont have to spend money on Fallous 1st to get your private server. ü§£
---
Stack Assaultron cards?? Doesn't the server have a cool down period? How does it work?
---
You can see all your friends in the social menu from the home page. Also can be pulled up in game by holding options button.
---
You can modify and build in each other‚Äôs camps in private teams. It‚Äôs currently disabled for public teams.
---
It is somewhat limited though. You can build and scrap things you build In your friends camp but not things he builds. 
---
You can go through quests together but both will need to talk to npcs for it to count. I believe it works in some cases such as events, but not in certain story based quests. (Someone please correct me)
---
No permanent teams or clans unless your joining the settlers or raiders or using an icon to show affiliation with another group. 
---
I see a lot of people having their ‚Äúclan‚Äù in their psn name. (Tsf, TTV) are a couple Ive run across.
---
If you are friends on PSN, he can join on your server. Social menu on the main game menu. Should give you the option to join your world. Vice versa for him if he‚Äôs on before you. I recommend still using PSN‚Äôs party chat function to avoid randoms unless you don‚Äôt mind. 
---
The owner of the camp can edit and delete items from a camp but not party members. They can only add. You do not share a camp. You each have your own. 
---
Most of the original quests can be done in tandem. Anything added after wastelanders you can do together but only one of you progresses. They added dialogue and speech checks that could vary the XP or rewards earned. Some also cut missions out. 
---
As of right now, there‚Äôs no official group organizations outside of the public teams they just added. After playing a while, I have built up a few sets of friends I group with consistently and we pool resources and what not if we know someone is oriented in acheiving a specific goal. I.E. they give me all their treasure maps in exchange for free access to any plans that they don‚Äôt know that I get from said treasure maps. The extras I vend for fast travel caps.
---
What's the best way to get leather? I ended up scrapping it I think... When I "scrap all junk" does that get rid of useful stuff? It looks like I have scrapped stuff like leather and wood at times. I'm only level 7 myself so I am still trying to figure everything out.
---
Don‚Äôt worry that‚Äôs nothing, i think i have more than 1k on my mule and I‚Äôm fine, all looted and crafted never duped.
---
That accent is brill.   Upvotes for you.
---
Lmao yea
---
It's a very rare occurrence, but I've seen it happen before. Epic fight.
---
On the LR game board, if you hover over an icon at the bottom of the screen you'll see "(X) Rank Up".
---
consequences yo.. 
---
hopefully it becomes a trend..
---
It's a small price to lose a duped weapon and remove this whole issue. Sorry you lost that duped Bloodied explosive fixer that you bought legitimately. There will be plenty more opportunities to get a legit weapon.
---
But I've been doing this since the day the season started and  never had issues until now
---
End game content for this game is cheating, lol
---
Spawning is HORRIBLE. Especially when you are bloodied build lol. That‚Äôs why i keep my tent above the nuke zone to get there safe! Try that out, might help, plus you save caps for porting.
---
Oh yeah man I agree with you :) I probably misunderstood you or something earlier. Im tired as hell hhaha
---
But yeah I agree! If you take the chance to dupe, you should know there is a risk. So dont be mad when you actually get banned at the end. Take it like a man. 
---
But the drops ooooof. They really need to work on that. it hella frustrating xD
---
D4RKESTW4RRIOR
---
Not the rarer chems then?
---
Perfect. I‚Äôm an unarmed build. With mutations that negatively affect my strength, even with class freak. So the withdrawals that could affect my strength is something I wanted to avoid.
---
white knight is broken right now.. if you use that card
---
if you paid for a year. and got banned. for committing a violation of the TOS. it states they aren't liable. so kids don't do bad things.
---
Alright psn ismewtwo45533 what‚Äôs yours
---
If you change Xbox accounts the emotes reset. You need to go into the atomic shop and equip them all back.
---
So by your definition, if I am a long time player, that means I don‚Äôt have standards and am abnormal? I‚Äôm trying to take your comments constructively, but ... not quite sure how I should be taking that.
---
&gt;a reliable place to farm legendaries isn't what bethesda wants.
---
I mean, whats up with this mentality, the drop RNG is already against the players, do they not want us to progress and have fun? This is why games die.
---
Well said üëçüëç
---
They really need to fix that I love it when you find the perfect flat spot for a camp, only to have massive tree branches clipping through walls lol.
---
They have those....
---
ü§£üëå I do, as the SS costs a fortune to repair in mats
---
That amount of stims can easily be earned the legit way, I swear they breed in my inventory
---
No problem! It's a great XP farm too!
---
69 - nice
---
I completely agree. I have this problem a LOT. If you are an energy build that focuses on doing endgame PVE that relies on fusion cores for ammo it‚Äôs really aggravating. Sure, if you‚Äôre close to my level and ask first and we agree to fight each other then that‚Äôs honorable pvp combat which I am all for it. No problem. However, its NOT fun camaraderie based pvp when you go through all the trouble of either Powering Up Poseidon or the expense of dropping a fusion generator only have a team of yahoo‚Äôs 3 times your level sneak steal the Workshop at Poseidon and then one shot obliterate you with legendaries out of the clear blue. It‚Äôs pure griefing, bullying, poor sportsmanship and general unadulterated  dickishness.  I always leave the processor unlocked and share as much as possible to diffuse this problem. I will even wall of off the workshop and leave a trail of cutouts pointing to the processor with a group of presents at the processors to try to get it across to people that I am sharing and don‚Äôt want to pvp and most people there for just cores get it but it‚Äôs that small group that just does it for ‚Äúlulz‚Äù that‚Äôs the problem. I‚Äôve gotten verbal with them and I get same old  ‚Äúit‚Äôs a game get over it‚Äù  or ‚ÄúI did it cuz bored‚Äù or ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù immature jerky asshats with shitty attitudes. The problem is there is no consequence for this.  And just hopping servers gives them exactly what they want, your hard work, your caps for ‚Äúlosing‚Äù, and the ‚Äúlulz‚Äù.  
---
Until there is some kind of balancing, restructuring, or abolishment of the pvp system it‚Äôs not going to change. The only way I found works at least with some of them is by standing my ground, confronting them and explain exactly how that attitude is what‚Äôs ruining the game and gaming in general nowadays, and how their actions affect others. Running away does nothing but exacerbate and perpetuate the problem and punish the good players. Until something changes the only answer s to educate them and not make it fun for them.
---
Have fun crafting legendaries for 8 years.
---
If you dont have tape you can just use a small piece of wood and nails!
---
Welcome to Fallout 76. Where a large percentage of people have to use exploits to actually enjoy the game xD
---
I'm in a building team if you want to join for free fats travel. 1 or 3?
---
Yeah. I mine probably do aswell. Happy cake day!
---
They just made it modable this last patch. Which is awesome for my husband, because he hasn't done any tadpole quests and really wanted to wear a raider backpack.
---
You weren't around for the last big ban wave (it has been a while)? I don't think the sub was moderated as much as it is now, so there were weeks of constant outrage posts by dupers who got their accounts banned.
---
Not Horizontal half walls... Vertical...
---
I wish they increase the ‚Äúplot‚Äù of the camp. I feel like I place two these prefabs and Iam getting out of space.
---
Hey I got a Legendary Run character too! Day Lee, Captain Cosmos superfan and probably axe murderer.
---
3 if you can spare it
---
if you actively used the exploit to dupe items, you know that there are potential consequences, and you are assuming that risk.
---
that said, in all fairness, i get how people were thinking they were invincible. how many times have we seen dupe exploits come up, and how many of those times had big ban waves? I think some people took their previous inaction as a green light to do whatever. not saying that's true, or that duping is okay at all, or anything like that. just saying i can understand why people thought they were safe.
---
Could be someone is on a team sharing the stranger in numbers perk. If everyone on a full team has mutations and is sharing the perk the effects stack and you can jump ridiculously high. I've been able to attack SBQ in the air with my unarmed build with just one other person on the team sharing the perk, not very effectively admittedly but I did measurable damage
---
Only Bethesda fix things and the result is zero changes lol. They are so bad at this.
---
Only reason that comes to mind is the durability of your SS armour is based on your intelligence and if you have equipped the Armourer perk, whereas other armour that is looted the durability is determined by your Luck or the Luck of the person who looted it
---
I like when it‚Äôs green, as if I can place the item, only to then tell me why I can‚Äôt.
---
I do agree, they can get rid of the revive a player part, but other then that its all soloable.
---
Do what I do, run SBQ and you get free improved repair kits that repair an item to 150%. Since I started running them I didnt have to spend a penny on repairs. (Just ammo, haha).
---
Yeah, this.
---
Let the dupers eat their deserved ban. 
---
To even come up with the idea that everyone should suffer because of a bunch of idiots is fucked up.
---
No probs
---
I have no, but one question.  
---
Have you played FO4 vanilla or modded version ?  
---
Because FO4 vanilla is so much boring and tedious to play than FO76.
---
How do you buy ranks
---
And yet this is a multi player game. And you can explore the world by yourself.
---
your trying to invent something that is already invented and used in other companies. and is bypassed by simply friending a non duper. and joining their game. or inviting customers to their server. this is why on games where items can be traded they no longer offer these servers. its easier to cut out the cancer then to let it fester.
---
With the whole Covid thing some of us previously hard-core players are now working 50-80 work weeks (this is my own experience) when I had 3 or 4 hours a day to play I would have agreed with you. Now, im lucky if I have 30min or an hour a day. It just isn't enough time for meaningful progress.
---
Best way to test is to turn on Damage Numbers
---
Have you looked into the Atomicshop yet? Some of my emotes were missing in the wheel but apparently were only unselected in the Atomicshop but I still had them and could reselect them as emotes for the wheel.
---
When I played I did one walk through with mods and another without mods
---
Yeah I‚Äôll D/C if I want to, I don‚Äôt owe anyone anything. If IRL calls or I want to leave then that‚Äôs my choice.
---
Would be hilarious if they added a salty message to you quoting whole people are at your camp though like the quit message in Halo.
---
By paying 13$  a month with a feature that most online games have as part of the initial purchase
---
What are you basing that "most of the player base" claim on? 
---
Reddit? Youtube comments?
---
Its not a button anymore, it's an indicator light. A button would be to easy.
---
Yeah, had armourer equipped when crafting and run full unyielding, so intelligence is high. I always repair to 200% as well, but i just find im repairing way more then previous armour
---
The only reason it would be a good idea to buy right now is if you really want some cosmetics right now or can't play till the season is over.
---
If you have trouble saving the money just buy the Atoms and sit on them. Buying in increments will only make it more expensive in the end.
---
Ik they were duped cos each weapon was 15 caps off a random trade...
---
Your game crashes and is down until the next legendary run.
---
Oh this dude said the bad word!!! Mods remove this comment!!
---
I don't use duped weapons
---
I'd be okay with this as long as it was something unlockable.
---
OP seems to be defending Bethesda, which is not uncommon on this subreddit, everyone else be damned.
---
Seriously though Bethesda wouldn‚Äôt have to ban so many people if they fixed their game. Both in general and in terms of timing, patches come to slow and there is still plenty broken even if most people can play and ignore the issues.
---
Somebody just traded revives with me. Happy to help you out. What kinda time will you be on?
---
Help from where? I'm fine thanks I appreciate the concern though.
---
Can confirm this, same happens with my missile launcher out...but, only in First Person, switch to Third and it stops.
---
Well that's awesome.  I'm genuinely never sure if voice chat doesn't work or if people just don't have mics in this game.
---
If you have standard earbuds for a phone(not iPhone) you can plug that into any newer controller.
---
Thanks, just tested on a super mutant . About 230 to 260 usually. Is that good number?
---
Yeah that's weird, can't say i've noticed it myself tbh
---
Or I could just glitch into your house or fast travel there and go to your private areas before the walls load.  Plenty of alternatives.
---
He does not sit outside or go to the garden. 3 spots, all guaranteed based on time of day. Bed at night, instruments in evening, trailer during the day.
---
I played ESO (another their game) and I know that Bethesda is biiig anti-alt. Unless you swipe your CC there lol. I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything like this. Especially when they plan to add scraping cards for coins.
---
You summed it up pretty well I think. To be honest I am not sure there is any reason for pvp in this game outside of the grief aspect. You get a very negligible amount of caps for kills and possession of an often destroyed workshop from all the fighting. Aside from that pvp is used to destroy people‚Äôs camps or pick on low levels to new to the game to understand the very ambiguous pvp system.
---
Well its not consistant like a rule, its just a higher chance that it can happen.
---
Yeah, as long as the fire rate is fast. My stealth commando (non-bloodied) does around 400 a shot. Still, your damage is enough to do all content easily.
---
Cloth
---
I already sent a friend request my name is like LOST_NXIIISAND
---
Workshops also need a good Wastelanders treatment imo. It makes no sense that the two biggest factions in the region wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole what supposedly are the biggest resource nodes in said region.
---
Each workshop needs an outpost of raiders and settlers, and a Capture the Flag style event where we capture the Workshop for a faction against creatures when the workshops is unclaimed, and against the other faction if claimed. This framework can easily ve extended the more factions enter appalachia. The BoS, the Enclave, etc. It would give reputation and a limited time buff based on the faction we helped.
---
I'm sure in a few months you'll have that option, for 1250 Atoms...
---
You could use that to your advantage!

How the hell do we know if we buy a duped item!!?!! I‚Äôm an old ass head whose first system was Atari. When it first hit shelves. (I was 7ish) I haven‚Äôt a clue, still, how it‚Äôs done

Oh forgot, it let me check out atom shop a lil while ago‚ÄîI check daily ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So...I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do that, right? Is there some kind of message on screen? 
---
Anyone know ? I buy a ton from player vendors-just wanna help out fellow Wastelanders
---
Thank you in advance
---
Apologies that i‚Äôm so cluelessüòî
---
I'm on xbox1-s and have never had this issue happen either.  I generally play evenings till/past midnight a few times a week.  When I quit for the night I exit to Main menu and then hit the xbox button and kill the game from the menu before I shutdown my xbox.  This is the same routine I used in FO4 to help with the issues I noticed after playing multiple sessions without killing the game. I haven't played NW since fall last year, and have been keeping up with the metrics for progression without doing those daily/weekly by supplementing my score with the 10K XP repeatable weekly.
---
üëçüèª
---
I have a ton of build variety on every weapon type! I suggest seeing what builds you enjoy, and then customizing it to your preference :)
---
\#3 sounds like a lot of fun.  I like it.
---
You wish üòâ
---
Each server does. You can hop to find a fresh one. If you rotate private servers, you can guarantee a fresh one.
---
Maybe the black death rider skin?
---
what counts as "finished the game"?
---
there are people who are over lvl 100 and have never launched their own nuke or completed all of the dalies and side missions..
---
what do you consider "finished".. what should bethesda consider "finished" in this scenario?
---
I've seen them pop up at a few of the defense events. The most memorable was the ammo factory due to there also being a scorch beast attack.
---
That sounds like Nigerian ducats or chuckie cheese tokens level of bs XD.
---
Even people that didn‚Äôt dupe are banned there just doing it off what you have in your inventory, I gave my buddy a be laser just because he wanted one and he hasn‚Äôt played in months and he is lvl 23 and he was banned and I know he didn‚Äôt try to dupe it because he is only on when I‚Äôm on so if you have a big innovatory still watch out
---
Server hopping.
---
I may be wrong, the easy going ability to cheat others without a second thought may actually be manifesting in games, because the protagonist has this character trait as a foundation in real life.
---
Still... it behoves one to choose friends carefully.
---
Go loot some stuff. The server keeps track off the last 255(?) items you looted to determine what should be in the world for you. Sometimes it's a bit dumb and works it out right in front of you, hence stuff disappearing. I've only had it happen with plants but I can imagine it's real confusing/annoying with PA.
---
Good they fucking deserve itü§òüòé
---
i think it's also a scare tactic. there hasn't been a ban wave like this in quite some time, yet there have been a handful of duping methods since then. i think that many people believed their inaction in the past was an open door complete with a welcome mat, and i think this is them trying to scare people into staying away from these the next time they surface.
---
So the trade forums are the majority of the playerbase? 
---
The trading forums. Fo76 forums. Players dropping legacy‚Äôs and putting them in vendors for caps. I‚Äôm not saying most did the dupe I‚Äôm saying a huge chunk of the player base obtained a weapon or armour or outfit caused by it. Hence why if the servers rolled back to last week before the duoe was public you eliminate the vast amount of those weapons from the game. Then go back another two weeks or more and anyone doing it you ban and delete they‚Äôre stash u eliminate almost all of them.
---
As a lifelong Catholic and with an over-bearing Italian Mother, I have all the guilt I can take without adding duping to my list if worries!
---
It‚Äôs more about the legendary effects, rather than the base armor type.
---
100% agreed. It ruins the game. Upvote.
---
Godammit....i hope I didn‚Äôt trade arguably my second best weapon (I only had two great weapons) for a dupe....I didn‚Äôt even know there was a dupe until after I traded.
---
Its like a day and night :)
---
My first was w/o mods. Next 500 were heavily modded :)and here is your answer : Modding community makes Bethesda games AAA :) FO76 is first bethesda game I play w/o active support of modders.
---
I was level 330 before I launched one a couple of weeks ago.
---
Bethesda won‚Äôt do jack, better off using an exp glitch to make up for lost score.
---
Talk about Deja Vu, I miss Dogmeat!!!!!
---
No. But it wasn‚Äôt just the trade forums. They were dropped and given away and in vendors for minimal amounts.
---
Ah this is perfect, thanks for this. I'm a new player as well and it's a little confusing at first. I have a few questions if you don't mind...
---
How do you add to your SPECIAL stats? I don't recall seeing an option to increase the points... I have just noticed that some of them are higher and can equip more perk cards. 
---
When I "scrap all junk" does it get rid of useful items? I feel like I got rid of leather and then didn't have enough to craft armor. Speaking of... how can I find leather?
---
How quickly do weapons degrade? I'm currently pretty much just using a pistol/machete because I don't have many better options/ammo, but the weight of the other weapons is taking its toll. I don't want to get rid of weapons I might need in a bad situation. 
---
I think that's all for now lol...
---
EDIT :
---
One more... what items can I for sure get rid of? I haven't really sold much, but my weight is almost always at capacity. I've been turning all my food and drink scraps into soups/water/whatever... I just am always close to overencumbered and its a pain.
---
I would consider all side missions main quest and wastlelanders finished I'm currently grinding every event and daily for bloody outfits and rare that won't drop lol, so I consider my self finished up to now anyway.
---
Ah I miss understood.  Happens.
---
This is a good and creative idea but I already know the fatass redditors of 76 are gonna be complaining about this in no time
---
I can not lie - the chorus of this song flashed into my mind reading your post.  
---
https://youtu.be/OtAMrPJg75o
---
Fo4 was great with mods
---
Lots of players,  "dick move" is their middle name.
---
Same issues spin it around and try it that way.  Took me about 5 minutes to put mine on
---
Supposedly with Atoms at some point.
---
You'd have to wear an orange jump suit to single you out from the unwashed masses.
---
Maps only have 24 people on them. Lobbies cannot be empty, that‚Äôs not the way server populating works. If 24 people are playing, they will all be in the same server. If 10,000 people are playing you‚Äôll have 417 servers  with 23 or 24 on each server. You should never see empty servers unless literally no one is playing, which isn‚Äôt the case.
---
I know you are talking about Xbox but 10,500 people are on steam alone right now.
---
I just don't have the game open from xx:45 to xx:05 during the reset rollover. Never had an issue.
---
You had me at hamsters weekly &lt;3
---
I have 2 backpacks. My Lead Lined backpack has a cornicopia skin on it. My Extra Capacity backpack has the Mothman baby skin on it. So I can tell which backpack I am using very easily.
---
Honestly, just grind for the SS armor. You can make the armor.
---
Dude, it‚Äôs enough to make a new character and exit the vault - that alone gives an instant level up.
---
Lobby? You mean NW, that's not the real Fallout 76, just a hack fest for Fornite dropouts.
---
Happened to me once. I was online when it happened. I just didn't notice the time. Hasn't happened since.
---
The nodes are on a timer (20hrs I think), so if you are doing it a lot you wont be able to keep looting them.  Same with Lucky Hole Mine prewastelanders.
---
I‚Äôm a collector of things others discard as bad or bad rolls so I see the good in every gun well except nocturnal because fuck nocturnal
---
Do we have a start time for Meat Week? This is my first one.
---
I mean 6 in a lobby is pretty empty in my book
---
Gamma gun is king now
---
Relax. You got 8 weeks left to go - and if push comes to shove you can still buy the last few levels. I really wouldn‚Äôt sweat it at this point.
---
Is that on Xbox or PS4?
---
I had it happen one time so far, and I wasn't logged in at all.
---
Well it would make it so you couldn‚Äôt join non duper‚Äôs or otherwise
---
thanks dude, this is really helpful. im a new player myself alwasy searching for any tips, tricks or in betweens. currently at level 19, i find that i look forward to logging in everyday to explore and gather new stuff
---
10,500 on steam alone right now...
---
They have stuff you get flagged for. If you get greedy you are at higher risk of getting noticed. Ive been doing most cheats and Im fine, they care more about the $ then making a game of quality.
---
No but for me it was a be plasma for 15 caps... seems duped.
---
Careful, this community does not like defectors like us.  Best to save these posts for over on Filthy Casuals where dissenting opinions are allowed and not nuked with down votes.
---
Stay filthy my friends!
---
You ever see an Ubisoft game? Watch dogs, assassins creed, far cry, and LoTR shadow of Mordor, Tom Clancy Wildlands all share a basic af secret sauce. Climb tower, unlock minimal points. Collect 100 of x random crap scattered throughout over-sized empty map.
---
Big worlds that feel like they lack depth.
---
Yea sometimes they the unique icon , other times it‚Äôs reg workshop icon. For me on PS4 anyway
---
It‚Äôs in a couple weeks colossal problem comes out first
---
I respecced from stealth sniper to heavy weapon PA user.   Did take a long time,  15 or 20 levels I guess. 
---
Because I found a two shot gatling. But I've never found the need for solid min/max weapons. Only thing I can't do alone is sbq.
---
The game can‚Äôt handle the hotness
---
that's awesome, thanks. :)
---
You 100% were in the right there and that without a doubt was justifiable. He was being an idiot stealing from his neighbor in the first place. I have my camp just SE of the WV Lumber Co right on the ridge and have had a few very close neighbors. Only one was a troll who decided to destroy my shit unprovoked.
---
Well. All legacy‚Äôs. Anything that‚Äôs bloodied or junkies handmade or fixer with 2525. Any melee that‚Äôs usually hard to find with SS S like a bear arm or dcg and any Uny/van/bolst-ap sent. And of course the red asylum dress. Outside of those not much was done I don‚Äôt think. But then you already would have a fair idea when it‚Äôs those items that were suddenly everywhere.
---
How many of the above have been banned for buying an obviously duped weapon I wonder?üòÇ
---
zorbo doesnt mean anything really.. youre not racing
---
Damn 180 lol. Highest I have seen is like 103. Is there a level cap?
---
Next to overseers camp
---
Yes, and its weird since pre-war currency could still be used 200-300 years later, but is considered worthless 25-26 years later. 
---
Maybe its a Appalachia thing??
---
What ever happened to the salute emote? I had it during Fasnacht then lost it. I even checked the Atomic Shop and it's not even available
---
And why would I lie about losing my ps4 account to like 3 guys on reddit
---
Got two trouble shooter fixers. One explosive and one faster fire rate.    From the mole miner.   Found my bloody one from a player I will use until I quit this game
---
Bob can do as he pleases. What I said still stands, "Bob is like someone who would rather throw away $10 change then take the time of day to open his wallet and put the $10 in his wallet"
---
Bob can literally go on with his life and not change a damn thing, all he has to do is wait till the season is over and he will have saved himself money for buying ranks at the end instead of right now.
---
Playing as though scores and ranks aren't there will still level up your rank, therefore, even if you don't care for rank levels or score you will gain more ranks naturally. The more ranks you have means the less ranks you have to buy, which means less money you have to spend so long as you are patient. Even waiting a week before you buy ranks could likely save you $5 depending what rank level you are at.
---
If you are buying ranks right now then you are *literally* throwing away money. That fact doesn't change if you "don't care about ranks or score". Literally just hopping on the game and *completely* ignoring this score system will still get you score. 
---
You survived your whole life without that fireplace, would you be devastated if you had to wait a week or 2 to get it? Probably not. Let's say if you were given the option to either pay $20 today for the fireplace or $10 next week?
---
It‚Äôs like the worst noise to hear mid fight lol
---
Buy atoms NOW. Buy ranks LATER. Seriously. It‚Äôs SO much more time effective to get the lower ranks hammered out.
---
Recently I started Looking chassis for t65 pieces.  
---
Struggling to find one when I‚Äôm actually looking.  When I‚Äôm not I see them everywhere.  Lol.
---
As others have said, just join on create a public team. Takes 2 seconds. Under social tab.
---
What bundle can some one explain, im currently grinding ever single event for the responders fireman , forest Jump suit etc are they still dropped from events
---
Neat your late to the party.
---
It's on the last tab, stand alone.
---
I loved the youtuber who 'reasoned' he was showing us a duping glitch and it was okay to do so because if he didn't someone else would anyway.  He's been quiet the last 36 hours.....  ha!
---
I assumed lost to the void.  The plan was a break between Seasons so I'd assume the score counter will be reset in between.
---
Hell yeah, this would be awesome
---
120? Caps?
---
Welcome to Fo76. . . you'll get use to it.
---
Got there eventually.  Basically had to remove everything from inside (even though nothing was near the doors), and then replace everything.
---
Thanks all for help.
---
Honestly rewards wise, crater. The raiders are the easiest to grind for, has more random encounters. 
---
Foundation has good stuff to but you can unlock the stealth armor by doing some of the quest for them and unless you are going after the fist weapon or G-shotty
---
Role play wise, pick who you want. You can get Ally rank with both of them. Kinda sucks given how Bethesda kinda biased on them trying to get more people to pick the raider faction.
---
30 mins is definitely enough for the dailies though. Except maybe the lvl up, but inthat case you can just make a new character an get an instant level up when you exit the vault.
---
Even so, all I‚Äôm suggesting is waiting until the last week to buy ranks.
---
I wish we had trailers, mobile homes and buses too.
---
Just go to your pip boy take your total hp and do 20% on you phone calculator. The result is the amount of hp you need to trigger those. You can also use a assaultron head to get to that exact point mostly everytime. You won't notice if there is 2 hp o 3 hp less really. Carry like 100 cells if you Dont use energy weapons. The head weights 8, but it's far more better than 50 goo fluids or 50 water, which would weight 12.5. Better than the gamma gun, since you can barely find any ammo for it. Overall I have always done way better this way.
---
How the hell is ESO anti-alt?
---
OH NO. I HAVE TO COLLECT THE THINGS I NEED TO BUILD UP A CHARACTER AGAIN. WTF.
---
That was before the TS nerf man :/
---
With atoms, supposedly. No idea how though.
---
Wasnt that a bug that was fixed recently?
---
&gt;have to use exploits
---
? I don't agree but you are entitled to your opinion.
---
Lmao looks like something straight outta jojos bizarre adventure awesome
---
I primarily use them as ‚Äúworkshops‚Äù. A place to go to try out new building method, teach others how to do building glitches (underground camps, advanced wiring, etc), make blueprints for NW, etc. If anything, I‚Äôd like to see less enemies there and no pvp
---
Good, more legacy shenanigans.
---
I've seen enough reviews and gameplays of how the game used to be and honestly I think you'd have to have low standards to enjoy the game in the state it was. Even today we have bugs that, to my knowledge, have plagued the game from the start, and up to one day ago, pretty gamebreaking ones.
---
I have 300 also, thats p normal for an endgame char
---
You definitely want Vanguards if you are gonna be at full health.
---
I made a post yesterday about the dupers being banned.
---
I received a message later on that day that I had the most controversial post on the entirety of Reddit for that hour.
---
Do you still have it?  I just realized that mine is missing.  It shows I own it in the Atom shop but it's not available in the crafting menu.
---
How were they not caught?  If u went and banned everyone who duped. The lot. Another dupe will appear and it will be exploited by the same players on different accounts. They just need to obtain one item and dupe it and back in business got a nice line to trade for others to dupe. On going problem until they sort out the code. EBay and other sites will have fo76 weapons an armour for sale again within the next month. We all know this
---
I'm not. And yet I still am able to explore the wasteland alone. The only time I ever see other players is events really.  maybe an odd hub location or if I visit a camp. Other then that I'm solo with not a soul around.
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry dude out of ideas. The only thing I can think of now is to reinstall the game. I think the only negative effect other that the time is losing your photos.
---
Can you improve relations with Ra-ra, because I kinda fucked that
---
I believe its 100,000 stacks of a single item. I made  60,000 5mm ammo during the fasnacht event thanks to that beeswax and didn't get banned. I wanted more but was afraid of the hammer coming down on me.
---
What makes you think it‚Äôs that many?
---
Bloodied just has so many ways of capitalizing on low health damage.  Unyielding and mutations in concert with bloodied build and health at \~20% is incredible damage.
---
Junkie max bonus is +50% damage.  Plus you get to use chems at will because you're already addicted.
---
Bloodied gets 1% dmg increase per 1hp life lost.  So that's 80% if you stick to the typical 20hp.  That does not include the effects of Nerd Rage (another 20%) and Adrenal Reaction mutation (I don't remember the %, sorry).
---
You can use adrenal reaction for junkie as well and reduce your hp a bit to try and close the gap between junkie and bloodied.
---
I ran Junkie for the last 4 months and loved it.  I'll go back to it in fact.  I found my best damage with Junkie when I ran: Adrenal Reaction, Radicool (with health at 50% or so) and I had psycho and whiskey on my quick menu (melee build).
---
Bloodied is higher, but for most things, with the numbers you see for both, you won't be upset with junkie...and you'll have so much more life!
---
Those premade buildings, like the red rocket garage, the bungalow, train car, circus cage, etc, are they low workshop budget items? Wondering if I should invest in one
---
For Uber Jason, probably the X-01 with the standard paint job.  
---
For Savini, probably the X-01 with Inferno Mk. 3.  
---
In either case, they've got the bulk you'd kind of expect from Jason. T-65 is too big and doesn't really have the right options and T-60 really doesn't have the right shape.
---
What did you do?
---
and were back to them being on server where they can dupe and dupe and dupe. then post on ebay they got &lt;x items for sale&gt; they friend you join their server and leave. so they are still profiting. so instead i know instead of a company having to pay the upkeep for a server for cheaters. they just ban them for being scum....
---
You can craft stims so easily they would be shooting themselves in the foot to ban for such a low number.
---
We lure the mole rats to the water for revive
---
Nah, you said ‚Äúa certain amount of goods.‚Äù
---
Then later you said ‚ÄúBut take a friend of mine for example, he has 100k+ steel.‚Äù
---
Your 100k was an example, not ‚Äúthe amount‚Äù. 
---
One anecdotal person does not evidence make. Got a source on 100k being the definitive number?
---
It‚Äôs an idea if you don‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs fine by me
---
So Bethesda's only options are to either open the flood gates or rule with an iron fist?  Well thank goodness the option that players should just follow the rules  isn't on the table.  Otherwise we'd have to deal with a nuanced approach of personal responsibility.
---
I just log out and close the launcher until 1215..
---
not that i ever had the problem of challenges auto completing prior to legendary run..
---
I just do it to be on the safe side I guess..
---
That's why i said large percentage of people, and not all people ;)
---
How do you figure game numbers are ‚Äúabysmal‚Äù? 10,500 on steam alone right now. It‚Äôs also a top 20 game atm on Xbox live.
---
Vanguards armor was much better for me. +35 and 35 is better on every type of armor. The only mutants piece I used when I was doing junkies was a mutants sentinel secret service piece. That‚Äôs only because the SS stats are so outrageous that the vanguard effect is much better. 10%!just isn‚Äôt enough lol. Even at half health +17 dmg res from vanguards is still better than any mutants piece.
---
I was mean to her at the beginning because it was funny, then felt bad around when you had to give her food &amp; gave her food, but Gaile says rara thinks i'm bad. To be clear, I was nice from the food point onwards.
---

---
For me I notice a huge drop in finding nuke drops and good player vendors last night
---
Wish power armor had legendary effects.
---
Jump is mutation or jetpack. There was no clip cheat with program but it would look more like lagg then anything els.
---
Damge can be several things, lots of end game players deal a lot of dmg. You could also stack buffs by cheating so for example use 50 or 500 big gun bobbleheads and get stacked damage from it.
---
There where also cheatprogram that could send damage with hotkey. (gg bgs)
---
One of the weeklies this whole time has been the 10k exp. one which is ongoing. People are farming exp to get that far ahead. You should still be able to complete the season without farming that too much as long as you do the dailies and weeklies. Plus there is at least one double xp event or weekend coming up sometime within the season
---
Fo4 had delays and cycling programming this allowed flashing lights/ lightbox messages/games etc. Then they added factory components in an expansion and spawn boxes. I created an automatic Brahmin processing/slaughter house, and you could also create MINI instances that allowed spawning enemies. ALL of these fo4 electronics should be easily doable.
---
Do you do that on pc? I‚Äôm on xbox and it‚Äôs never done that to me
---
Saw I guy with over 200k super stims at his vendor last night. So if he's safe you should be ok.
---
Yea I would love the eso equipment menu on the pip boy under apparel 
---
Right now for equipment atleast I started just renaming them..
---
With the slot name ‚ÄúAA Main head‚Äù etc etc Just so I wouldn‚Äôt sell or toss while wearing PA
---
Ill give that a try, thank you!
---
You can do the math. You‚Äôll make it if you do all daily and weeklies, not to mention the repeatable xp.
---
You can still play how you used to and just ignore it (minus the occasional popup when you DO rank up).
---
It‚Äôs just is a waste of atoms right now. Just get as many ranks as you can playing your way and buy the rest in 7-8 weeks. 
---
Throwing atoms into the void for no reason just seems (sorry...) stupid to me.
---
Every forum, reddit, discord is full of people banned and loads they know banned, that's just what I see on PC, times that by however many for those that haven't posted and quadruple for the numbers on console, telling you, it's a lot of accounts. Son on PS4 has lost loads on his list and is seeing deserted servers at times.
---
Send a ticket to Bethesda saying you didn‚Äôt get what you paid for
---
You‚Äôre being paranoid. It‚Äôs designed to be won. They even added an additional 500 score points each day, and are offering a double score weekend. 
---
Other players got past Zorbo by stacking XP bonuses and getting A LOT of the 100 points every 10,000 xp.
---
I‚Äôve certainly gotten that reward 1-3 times a session depending on how long I play.
---
Considering that Runescape 3 is a dead game, and it has 3-4x the player base as the game does on PC. That‚Äôs pretty abysmal. Euro Truck Simulator has more active players on steam.
---
I sell blocks of standard and super every week at the robot vendors, they are everywhere.
---
By the end of today‚Äôs daily u should be about level 37. There‚Äôs also dbl exp
---
This weekend and a score event coming up so I wouldn‚Äôt panic if your just off the pace a little
---
Well I don't know but this .....https://youtu.be/EC8P9YTvnlk
---
Hmm, I'm only level 7 and have been skipping them. Maybe I shouldn't. The only one I have done was the claim the workshop at the race track and then defend it. I would have been smoked, but for some reason all the mutants I had to defend it from just stood there and let me kill them all lol.
---
Yeah I don't know if it's the same problem on pc, but it's possible that caused it if you didn't turn the pc off in the meantime.
---
So I think if you go far along in the question you can save Ra-Ra and you get a look power armor helmet skin during a quest. Really just do both faction missions until the point of no return.
---
I was thinking this same thing. He usually comes out with 76 news vids asap when shit like this is happening.
---
Keep jumping off bridge till revive into water
---
I think lately they gave a slight nerf to all durability. I‚Äôve found myself repairing armor much more than I used to and I‚Äôm still running the same cards.
---
I've finished both sides up to the point of no return.
---
I have 3 pieces of unyielding SS and 2 bolstering SS. I run gauss shotty so am i usually in the mixer taking hits. 
---
Depends on what weapon you're gonna use tbh
---
Excuse me sir my anxiety does not know ‚Äúchill‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre right tho I didn‚Äôt get banned
---
r/expectedthanos
---
How do you join??
---
Yup, I finally got it to register and complete the score.  It was maddening for a while though.  Cheers!
---
The only reason you shouldn't be ban is if it was a mistake
---
There's still like 2 months left.  Everything is going to be ok
---
I didn't get hit with the ban wave but I did help a bunch of gamepass players with outfits and lvl 5 glitched lazers :p
---
I'm a heavy gunner and main 5mm Gatling &amp; .308 LMG, so I sell all the .45 and 5.56 I find.  The .45 always sells but hardly any 5.56 sells for me for some reason (both at 1C ofc)...
---
Join the sub-reddit-
---
Xb1 here, I have the worst time getting this weapon to be consistent. I thought I found the secret, but then it's back to slapping mobs with a wet towel.  Closest I found was to charge it fully, then VATS, and let VATS Lock fully to get that devastating attack, but it just doesn't seem to produce that result with regularity.
---
 It still kicks ass at Radiation Rumble, tho.
---
Sexist lol
---
id just prefer a nice plot of flat land which i could rent 24/7 365 for real currency.  whether i was online or not and it could sell my items while i was asleep, at work ect. and i could log on EVERY time and not have to wait 4 minutes to find out o no for the 4th time someone has a camp right where mine is ....how about checking that 1st. then auto finding a new place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah I am saving all atom I've saved up for the last week in case I'm close to getting it. I really just want the secret fireplace entrance at level 99 lol the rest means little to me. Either way I'm having fun playing the game so I guess that's all that matters.
---
According to all the hacked .50 cals ive seen the last couple of days at events like Radiation Rumble etc. nobody got banned.
---
Not to mention all the fckin legacy energy weapons. I hate these things!!!
---
The most recent dupe was on all platforms. Super easy to do too.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen that... I know a lot of people who traded honest guns for guns that were probably duped early on before it got out of hand (myself included, I traded a JE fixer and JFFr250 handmade for a Be radium). We haven‚Äôt been banned? I think that‚Äôs pretty reasonable I‚Äôd be pretty upset if I lost my guns and got banned for what I thought was an honest trade.
---
Ace!
---
You might want to learn the least possible equipment plans to reduce the range of legendary loot rewards. I have no idea how it works, just read that some legendaries like the fixer need you to know the plan so I was thinking, it might work the other way around for stuff you don't want
---
Sure. But nobody wants an I/25/90 handmade. If you‚Äôve got a 1 out of 5 million chance of getting a specific roll, and that‚Äôs the ONLY thing you‚Äôll accept, you‚Äôre killing yourself over the odds. If you accept that there‚Äôs 10 thousand gun variations that *will work*, the odds of you getting something go up astronomically.
---
People are entitled and only think they can play with one very specific roll? Well, good luck, you‚Äôre staring at long odds. The dude who finds a F50 assault rifle and rolls with it? He‚Äôs still going to be able to do every bit of content this game has to offer just fine.
---
There is no content gate based on the equipment you have. Any limitations people perceive are self-created. 
---
Look at the dudes posting solo queen kills with no legendary weapons. You don‚Äôt need a B2525 fixer for ANYTHING in this game. Hell they didn‚Äôt exist before a year ago, and the game hasn‚Äôt added anything harder than it had at launch.
---
*edit* I just realized that may not be what you were intending. Yes, the pure RNG for weapons can be frustrating... but remember the setting. We‚Äôre survivors scavenging a post apocalyptic wasteland- we‚Äôre having to use whatever we can find, we don‚Äôt get to go to GunMart and get shit made to order.
---
Since there really isn't more than a handful of people farming it when it gets nuked anymore, you can still hit it up for a couple of legendaries per sweep. Whenever it's just me and one or two others, I can get the golf club, go to the hotel rooms, and then come back and the golf club has respawned. My biggest issue is getting enough floors flora from all this.
---
White knight is broken now? Awwww.  That could explain why I've been having to repair more.....
---
[Vanguard's is good, but know that you don't get any DR bonus at 50% health and below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a31ayz/bolstering_vs_vanguard/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) impo bolstering is better, even if you aren't a bloody build, as it gives a DR bonus at 90% and increases every 10% all the way down to 10% health. you get a DR bonus for your entire health spectrum and you get more resistant as you drop lower, instead of suddenly getting wrecked after 50%. maybe using a combo of both would be your best bet, to get max DR throughout your health bar.
---
i also read a comment somewhere that suggested a piece each of mutant slayers, troubleshooters, zealots, hunters and exterminators is great for all-around coverage. that way you get -15% damage from basically every mob. As I understand it, after a certain point, damage mitigation is more important that damage resistance.
---
i'd say any of the above is better than mutant's alone.
---
I was playing nw with friends around the challenge reset and lost track of time and when I loaded into adventure FIVE of my weeklies autocompleted...FIVE
---
&gt;  Prefixes such as bloodied are way harder to get
---
I get bloodied drops all the time.. of course I dont run bloodied so IDGAF and scrip them.. but I feel like I get bloodied way more than Furious..
---
Bethesdas detection system sucks üòÇ
---
1/2 mules got hit with ban wave the empty one got hit
---
Bloodied has 150% damage increase with all the related perks and mutations at 19% hp
---
Junkies gives 50% extra damage at full hp (with 5 addictions)
---
Ok I subscribed
---
Just play the game normally you wouldn't have these problems
---
Dirty duper
---
and gunsmith.. and adrenaline...
---
That's not in the game yet
---
.....no clue then
---
Yea you can it‚Äôs random because there really isn‚Äôt a way to track things you get in a vender.... the bot pretty much just goes off what you have it‚Äôs stupid
---
Just make a small groove in TV with a knife. When the pixels die you'll have a nice mark where the health needs to be
---
Nice, stay tuned until more people join and it becomes active :)
---
One copy? Nah you wouldn‚Äôt be banned. Multiple copies? Now you‚Äôre entering their radar.
---
No in xbox. Maybe it does it after i use different xboxes in the house now that I think about it.
---
at half health Vanguard offers no bonus. it does not scale throughout the health bar like bolstering. only from 50-100%.
---
first step is waiting until its released on the main servers and not just the PTS
---
I'm good!
---
Guided Meditation is the next WS Golf Club. 
---
The event spawns enemies for days since patch 20. I freaking love it!
---
But they will nerf soon as always... sadly.
---
The forest outfits don‚Äôt drop as a bundle. All separately.
---
I‚Äôm with you on this. I actually forget VATS even exists in PvP. Guess it‚Äôs my brain already knowing that it‚Äôs a cheap mechanic outside of PvE or something.
---
For me 99% of the time he is glitched in his trailer, becoming one with the bottom of the bunk bed.
---
He always looks so uncomfortable. It's quite the extreme case of bed-head.
---
Secret service jetpack rubber bands you back to your point of origin quite often. Also just sits there mid air while you're applying thrust and doesn't boost upward at random. Haven't used any other jetpacks in game so I don't know if this is a regular occurrence.
---
Make sure you have enough camp budget space to support a tamed animal. They take up a good chunk. If I remember right it was the same amount as a turrent or so
---
And internal corner roofs.
---
Awesome
---
Isn‚Äôt 50 half health? Still great to know thanks.
---
depending on the legendary effects.. handmades all day long
---
also.. 2 shot accuracy is ass in this game and not really comparable to FO4
---
Good job! My last round of NW me and another guy picked the same spot to spawn. His pc loaded faster so he had the gun 1st and there wasn't really much I could do.
---
I don't think I like the game mode tho, my temperment + my bad rng luck doesn't = fun. Get switchblade and wood armor. Turn corner.. run into guy in the liberty prime power armor? who just melts me.
---
The absolute worst thing is the condition on them
---
Geez really? They‚Äôre listed under STAT - Collections, that‚Äôs a weird thing to do. Thanks.
---
Either you havent been hit yet or the things you duped werent being tracked
---
No, I dont, and I‚Äôm not going to continue this argument either. Anyone who actually thinks that people provide ‚Äúsources‚Äù in online arguments only does because they can think of any reason why the other person is wrong, but they still just refuse to beleive that.
---
None of that is any indication of the actual size of the "guilty" player base. 
---
I'm sorry but if this were a court case the case would be over and you'd be laughed out of the room because your evidence is based on nothing specific.
---
Your idea to punish everyone for the actions of an unspecified number of players is absurd and your dismissal of valid arguments with your "well it would suck for u" reply up there is not only ignorant, it's also insulting because punishing everyone implies that everyone is guilty.
---
Bethesda needs to develop the tools to adjust inventories individually, introduce log files to any action a player performs, implement flags that auto trigger on certain actions and investigate based on that information. 
---
That's how this should work. Does it work like this? We don't know. They claim that they can't check inventories individually but I sort of doubt that. At the very least, they have a system in place that flags individuals for suspicious behavior and anyone who claims to have been banned for no reason has every right to appeal the ban and have it investigated. They did undo bans in the past.
---
Aha haha weak number's
---
That might be it yea

I agree with more specific weapon categories being an option at the purveyor. Other than that, can't really say I agree with you. This whole the game is "broken" argument is old. It's how people justify every shitty thing they do in the game. And just being handed the weapon you want literally defeats the purpose of playing, especially when you've done the main mission. So you get the duped badass weapons you want and just melt every enemy. Okay. Now what? There is literally no reason to play any more. There isn't even a point. After a while, the grind and the hunt for cool gear are all there is.
---
Everybody always says "I dropped it in a lake" but I think that kind of opens people up to having an excuse in case they do get banned. "I only picked it up to get rid of it!" they'll say. 
---
But because of most people's camp locations, they could just as easily hop servers and no-one would ever see that bag before it despawns. 
---
So if that happens again OP, just hop servers and you'll be ensuring that no one ever finds it in most cases
---
Remember you can‚Äôt even make bottle caps
---
You cannot have a deserted server. That‚Äôs not how server population works. They scale to player count.
---
That mean i lose out on the plasma rifle? I'm holding out on the raid for a bit, because most of my armor is busted from the robobrain mission, &amp; I need to find a bunch of junk to fix it. I'm not going into a raid with busted shit.
---
I got a friend that duped 50 million nuka colas and never got banned.
---
I def bought a ton of modules and rolled a junkies gauss minigun very happy
---
Thanks-

White toothpaste removes adhesive and permanent marker from screens. 
---
Years back I bought an LCD monitor from Goodwill. I didn't realize until I plugged it in that it has marker all over the screen. Toothpaste removed it perfectly though.
---
Source? Is that game on steam? Because it‚Äôs not in the top 100 (fo76 is)
---
Dps = Fixer&gt;Handmade&gt;Combat rifle.
---
That said, dps difference between fixer/handmade is not too big. I personally have both on me for different situations. B2525 Fixer for bosses, and BE25 Handmade for everything else. Keeping both is also good because they use different ammo types. You can even setup your fixer to shoot .38 if you got huge piles of that ammo.

Found the problem. Don't scrap from the modify menu of the weapon crafting station. Scrap by using the standard scraping menu when approaching a station.
---
Scrapping junk turns it into useful parts. You scrapped stuff making it into raw leather, you use raw leather to make leather armor along with a few other components. You lose nothing but you can get more components out of your junk with the Scrapper perk.
---
You can get raw leather from various junk items, including animal hides you can get from killed animals like radstags or brahmin. Since you're level 7, there's several live Brahmin and a couple of hanging Radstag carcasses around Flatwoods you can get hides from.

The fact that the autocomplete bug means many will not finish the season without spending cash is a good enough reason to cancel
---
Lol it‚Äôs on steam ‚ÄúEuro Truck Simulator 3‚Äù had 18K players yesterday
---
I've recently found the Responderbot at Lady Janets, so yes. The only place I've seen the new trader with outfits is the random spawn across from Gorge Junkyard.
---
 If you're doing Rep for factions, run on up the street from there to the Garage, and check for a settler that you can give supplies to. 
---
There's npcs fighting over a resource node near that spawn point, but I could never get rep from them.
---
Wait, what ban wave now? (Sorry, been out of the loop lately I guess.)
---
So what drops as a bundle sorry I'm just confused and how do I get the bundle
---
I'm personally playing devils advocate and you just voiced all my thoughts. I'm at level 45 and going strong. I'll reach 100 within 8 weeks no problem.
---
 I guess what I'm saying is they are paying to not have to worry and getting natural progression above the rank they care about. To some people that may be more important than saving $20 or $30
---
Handmades are better than Combat Rifles, but worse than The Fixer. So until The Fixer came on the scene everyone was rocking 3* Handmades.
---
That being said, it's really more about the prefixes than the weapon type; a good 3* CR is going to outperform a 3* Handmade with non-ideal prefixes.
---
As an aside, I wouldn't recommend either as a sniper rifle. Neither of them do enough damage to be useful; you're better off with a Hunting Rifle or Lever Action Rifle for sniping. (Bonus of the LAR is that it shares an ammo type with CRs, which simplifies your ammo carrying requirements and lets you sell 5.56.)
---
As a second aside, your build for both weapons will be the same, so it's just a matter of whether you want to go Commando or Rifleman for a rifle build.
---
Fixers have a slightly higher base damage than handmades. Handmades are easier to keep on target than the fixer (outside of vats)
---
I use Xbox and just sent a ticket, I have one Xbox one ( the first version)
---
Of course you can, I've been on servers with only  2 or 3 folks many a time...
---
Sorry for the dumb questions, pretty much a brand new player... could you improve that weapon from a 1 star? Or is the star quality final? Also, what exactly were you farming to get it? Just random mobs and shit, hoping for a good drop?
---
I'm a duper (got my account banned not mad it is what it is) and hopefully people realise how wholesome I mean this as, that even in the duping community (that a lot of people on this forum seem to think they are the scum of the earth) were some of the nicest people I've met and will probably keep talking too outside of fo76. This community is great when they aren't being sheep to Bethesda. It's not Bethesdas fault for the duping but they should definitely do a better job. In real life if your town is being overun by crime yea it's definitely the criminals fault but in the end if the leaders aren't taking proper action then they are equally as bad.
---
What you don‚Äôt like pink with bats?
---
I think the thought process is spread as much as you can so it makes it hard for bethesda to take action on a large number of people. There was several altrusist people in this dupe wave but I'm sure the majority was trying to muddy the pool to cover there tracks.  Unfortunately some people who didnt use common sense got swept up by it
---
Still waiting for my bloodied Gauss mini
---
Runescape 3 has averaged 30K the past year. OSRS averages 102K.
---
I bought my TSE handmade 3 weeks after release and the guy had 40 more just like it in his inventory. But I swear it wasn't duped. People who didn't play back then have no clue. I paid 2500 caps for it and still have it today because it,was the first weapon I traded for.
---
The bundle they are talking about are referring to the savage divide outfits like white powder jumpsuit, white springs, BoS jumpsuit. Those are all acquired at once from doing savage divide events. You just have to pray that sweet RNGesus will bless you with it
---
Same here.
---
Everyone is starting to say that and it‚Äôs beginning to become concerning because I‚Äôm noticing it in the servers too
---
Right, after half health, the bonus is zero.

[Here is an old post that details the scaling between bostering and vanguard](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a31ayz/bolstering_vs_vanguard/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Damn son I thought I waited the longest at 306 haha
---
I believe the hardcore dupers use burner accounts.
---
Junkies is a magic effect, you don't need two on the same weapon. Explosive is handy if you need to get that fire rate up too!
---
I found a youtube where he alludes to needing both:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLlw9ypFgkk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLlw9ypFgkk) 
---
 This is a hidden perk that you can activate from adding the 2 charisma cards, "Wasteland Whisperer, and "Animal Friend". For some reason when combining these 2 cards you unlock a secret perk you can do which is tame creatures!
---
Yes you are, he is the countdown to the end of the season

have you seen the Gary prank call on youtube?

And you get an Orbital Strike!

Damn, I miss those days. :D
---
bahaha
---
I prefer the combat/fixer. While the handmade is nice. It‚Äôs popularity makes it hard to be a truly unique weapon in one‚Äôs arsenal. 
---
There‚Äôs always the ammo conversion in the combat. While .38 isn‚Äôt that effective it lets you use the gun in an SMG set up. And if we ever get the .308 receiver option there‚Äôs that going for the combat rifle. While the handmade likely isn‚Äôt getting the same treatment.
---
When you‚Äôre talking about ownership of an illicit item, Bethesda would more than likely just stealth-remove the item from the game via scans, just like they did my Laser Musket and Thirst Zapper. You don‚Äôt have to worry about being flagged for a ban unless you do stuff like hinder the gameplay experience (i.e. using the Two-Shot Tactical Mini-Nuke Minigun to cause intense load on a server and burn out the CPU on Bethesda‚Äôs server box, then they get pretty fucking pissed), however, most of these bans do come from player reports, so keep that in mind.
---
Ok I‚Äôll start hiding in bushes the whole match lol
---
does he just kick a random wall like the raider NPCs that show up at my camp?
---
Yea, that is always my first thought when I read stuff like this as well. I mechanically picked it up, because it's surely not the first time I collect stuff from the floor. My C.A.M.P. is actually right next to silo alpha, so a lot of people actually do go there. I am not worried of a ban, I have been playing only for some months and can safely say I have never jeopardized my account, but I don't blame you for your thought, would have been my first thought as well.
---
That said, I made the post mainly hoping someone could answer my questions and gave some back story to it. I really despise the idea that someone would put someone else's account in danfer in such a way. Such items are not a present, not a sign of generosity the way I see it, or could actually harm someone.
---
Meh. Whitespring is one of the most boring locations in the entire game. The only reason it was popular was because it was so farmable. 
---
I'd rather see other options for pulling down legendaries instead of running the same identical path over and over at the most boring location in the game.
---
They hit my empty dupe mule but not the mule with all the goods ü§î
---
*If* he got banned, it would be for duping, not an explosive flamer. Either that or me and one of my friends just got externally lucky since we both have those too. 
---
But, he also doesn‚Äôt normally do news on sudden, unplanned stuff until the day after. Yesterday when everyone was finding out they got banned he was working on and released a video on FO4 mods. The 76 news video will likely be today.
---
You‚Äôre increasing a special stat every time you choose a new perk after leveling up. It caps out at level 50 at which point you can still choose new perks when you level up but it won‚Äôt increase your special stats.  You can further increase these with legendary armor and certain underarmors as well as using food/chems for temporary buffs.
---
Scrapping all junk just means you‚Äôre converting your scrap items into their base materials.  For example you would get leather from scrapping a radstag or mole rat hide. You don‚Äôt lose anything when you scrap your junk it just cuts down on its weight.  Beforehand that animal hide might‚Äôve weighed 1.5 lbs but after you scrap it it‚Äôll be much less.
---
Some weapons deteriorate faster than others and there‚Äôs really nothing that‚Äôll tell you that it‚Äôs just something you kinda have to learn.  Typically weapons that are larger deteriorate faster than others.  A hunting rifle therefore wouldn‚Äôt deteriorate very fast because it doesn‚Äôt shoot quickly at all.  All weapons have a health bar or whatever it‚Äôs called and the longer that is the longer it‚Äôll last generally.  Be sure to collect scrap passively while wandering about so you‚Äôll be able to repair your weapons when you need to.  Melee weapons like that machete you have are a life saver early in the game when you run out of ammo.  They‚Äôre also pretty cheap to repair.
---
Quite a bit of things can have leather in them and I‚Äôm sure you could find a leather farming video on YouTube but my advice would be to ‚Äútag for search‚Äù when you run out of a resource.  Doing this makes it to where a little magnifying glass emblem shows up when you have your cursor on a junk item that breaks down into the materials you have tagged for search.  This way you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre picking up shit you need.
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid to get rid of weapons if you‚Äôre weighed down. You‚Äôll be able to find the same weapon again at some point with little effort.  The exception to this is legendary items which are unique and have value as scrip pieces at the very least.  You can scrap weapons or sell them to vendors for caps if you‚Äôre low.
---
Lastly, remember you have 800 lbs of space in your stash box as well.  You can scrap your junk and put it all in here as well as dump some other stuff if need be.  Check you inventory for mini nukes and missiles (which believe it or not aren‚Äôt worth anything so just drop them) as well as large amounts of aid items.  Those are typically the culprit when you‚Äôre trying to figure out what has you so weighed down.
---
For guidance, right  now on Steam over 10,000 people are playing, how many on Beth launcher, likely more,  at least 5 times that for both consoles combined, and 3/4 of my friends list is empty, normally 3/4 online
---
On PS4, the square button is the option to rank up, it's still greyed out for me.
---
yeah.. it moves 1 space a day
---
Are these "magic" by design or are they bugged? And is it only specific weapons? I have a Two Shot, 33 Auto 10mm Pistol that seems to do far more damage than it should with no perks at all.
---
worthless aside from the occasional gag of someone- usually a robot but i know of at leasy one human- who pays you in pre-war money, not knowint it's jist cloth now.
---
For me I either run a bit and it‚Äôll work, although I‚Äôve found it usually only happens when enemies are nearby but I‚Äôm in a hidden state. 
---
If I fire my weapon and the meter turns to ‚Äúcaution‚Äù then it‚Äôll let me fast travel. However, if I stay crouched and the meter goes back to hidden before the 14 second timer is up it‚Äôll cancel the fast travel.
---
I figured a way to stack them post patch but I never told anyone. I have not seen my design as well.
---
Its because they were due to be released patch 20, but were pulled after everyone complained about how crap they were
---
Sick thanks for
---
That link
---
Last night I was playing and got 4 bloodied from mama mermer alone and 2 of them were keepers bloodied explosive lever and one other that I can't remember right now
---
I was asking about runescape. 
---
I didn‚Äôt understand that a measure of success is games that are above euro truck simulator. 
---
The both are top 100 steam titles. 
---
How many users need to be on at a time for it not to be abysmal? If steam is 10.5k, how many more are on Xbox, PS4, Bethesda launcher, pc game pass?
---
I am so jelly dude.
---
It‚Äôs a top 100 title. Probably 50k across platforms conservatively at this minute. Daily users in the hundreds of thousands.
---
I'm worried it'll happen but I make sure to log out and fully close out the game. One time I forgot the time and kept playing but I didn't lose anything .
---
Empty dupe mule? You mean a burner or an account you just held duped shit on?
---
They still exist in game.
---
No Scout armor has higher DR with Polymer mod. But the mods can not be learned... u have to buy them from the enclave vendor.
---
What
---
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. That‚Äôs not how server population works. The number of servers isn‚Äôt a fixed amount. The scale.
---
My punji's work perfectly.
---
my camp is near that area (quick access to Crater) so i do this daily often, and this one daily quest is why i keep a shovel on me at all times. sometimes when im bored i'll beat rats to death with it.
---
You don‚Äôt need duped gear to nearly instakill the SBQ.  A bloodied 40% power attack deathclaw gauntlet with the right perks, drugs and food will have you hitting for 4000+ damage easy.  If she lands the right builds can drop her quick
---
All that says is you are friends with a bunch of dupers
---
I thought it was really cheap compared to other armor?
---
On what platform?
---
I'll give it a shot, and so that I am doing it right, server hoping is backing out to the main menu then going back into the world right?
---
Tested it the other night without someone and it wasn't working in Vats either.
---
Idk rly. I've seen people in the level 230 range.
---
I doubt that they exist for very long before it's current owner gets banned. I play on Xbox and I've never seen an impossible item in game, although I've heard of people seeing them, so idk really but I'm pretty sure that I'm correct
---
I used two burner accounts to both dupe the night before this happened I emptied one and filled the other with all the goodies and gave myself a couple of goodies then 
---
#BAM
---
Todd Howard killed my empty mule and called it victory
---
My favourite excuse is "Bethesda let these exploits happen, and I can play the game however I want. It's really their fault"
---
So, you lost score because of Bethesda's mistake (just like me btw) yet you still want to give them money to get it back? 
---
*Insert conspiration theories here*
---
Only thing i can think of is your overlooking it, bare in mind it'll be legendary so it'll have a prefix in it's name such as *Bloodied* Plasma Caster or something.
---
If it's 100% not there i dunno.
---
I often unload \*\*\* legendaries I win in event or from killing legendaries for cheap (250 caps and less) that are decent weapons, simply because they don't match my build (sniper so I look for mainly rifles) and the legendary merchant only seems to generate bug and mutant killer legendaries.  I have a \*\*\* wardrum that I'd love to see a melee character take advantage of.
---
He's prepping for Meat Week and is under a ton of stress right now.  Take it easy on the guy.
---
If you wanna do something solo that was meant to be a server wide event... you‚Äôre playing the game not the way it was meant to. Just because it‚Äôs hard doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not good.
---
If your numbers are below Euro Truck Simulator, an incredibly niche game, then that‚Äôs abysmal.
---
Like i give a shit what your opinion of me is. I don't even play this game anymore and I only ever duped for my own convenience. Never traded on the market after the dupes happened, never sold or given any away. If i ever pick up the game again I've got 5k Pemmican, and unlimited scrap to play with. Hardly an different than the exploits i use when I'm speedrunning Ratchet and Clank. If i get banned, fine, but you don't have some sort of moral high ground here, it's a video game
---
Finally found a server last night that had a nuked WS. Ran it nearly alone for a full 30 min before the zone dissipated. Felt... odd, not having someone else around to share legendaries with.
---
There is no micro managing.  U take ur chems when get into a big fight and ur good.  Something all of us do now anyway.  
---
If u do it right, u will hardly get any serious negatives to ur addictions.  
---
My commando is addicted to daddyo, day tripper, pshyco, overdrive, whiskey.  
---
Daddyo/day trip negatives are nothing.  
---
Whiskey is my water, and i take overdrive and psycho for big fight.  No damage boost needed for anything else.
---
Circle bases too
---
Runescape is PC and a mobile AP
---
It‚Äôs not your thing, but clearly he‚Äôs a dedicated player base
---
I've helped Graeme kill robots in Watoga so I could trade with him. Graeme is a killing machine.
---
This seems to have been dupers' argument all along, that 80-90% of the players in the game are duping and if Bethesda ban them there will be noone left.
---
Pretty sure tenderizer plan is confirmed! Event reward will also grant purveyor loot pool legendairies like fasnacht did
---
Yep! I use a revolver as my main and a 2 shot AGL as my back up.  I call it my "Messmaker"
---
I don't agree. I know a large group of people that were duping. It wasn't BE25 fixers, it was legacy weapons. Weapons that were removed due to the overpowered nature they had. Now there are tons more explosive Gatling plasmas and laser rifles out there. Yet some items are so rare it's like people have never seen them. Bloodied swing speed spear? A myth. (At least for me). Yet there are way more legacies floating around. The game is fun if you make it fun. Excuses for cheating are just that. Excuses. Don't like the game? Don't play it, simple as that.
---
That xp for glowing ones early on was bananas lmao
---
Some of the dupers' actions might come from a "good place", but they have the potential to actively harm people. Not everybody uses reddit, not everybody keeps track of all items and not everybody has been playing long enough to know what is a legit item and what is not. I don't know, this just left a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Ok? So there are more than 30k playing 76 right now. Just less through the steam specific launcher. So I don‚Äôt really get your point.
---
Do you need to have addictions for it to work? I rolled a Junkies 25FFR Gauss mini and i have never even bothered to use it as i play bloodied
---
5pm BST
---
That‚Äôs not my point. My point is that it‚Äôs a niche game that has more active players than a Triple A title like fo76.
---
An instigating FFR LMG is pretty good. But that‚Äôs the only one I have, so I dunno.
---
Yup it's obvious the dupers had all the good shit to play around with üòÇ
---
Me too! Always brightens up my day!
---
so now do you just do events to get the Treasury Notes?
---
Yup, highly depends on whether you use VATS or not. Handmade has MUCH better recoil, but that doesn't matter in VATS.
---
I did it for the first time wearing lvl 45 excavator and using my fast firing vamp Ultracite gat lazer and found I could tank 2 pylons and maintain full health with minimal stims unless I got yeeted by the face lazer.  The only confusing part was the very beginning when it shows but the pylons aren't up yet
---
Ahh ok, for some reason I thought I was just getting rid of items I didn't need anymore when I scrapped them. Good to know, thank you.
---
do both questlines all the way up to when you need to raid 79, and then just pick the one whose characters you like best. so long as you did everything beforehand for both groups, it doesn't matter. the one you screw over will still love you after doing a few dailies.
---
Once you place the bones in the ground. Go to the tree and behind it a shovel will spawn. Not a lot pc players told me about this. I‚Äôm on Xbox so I assume it will work on ps4 as well.
---
I agree with almost all you said, even though it‚Äôs been said it similar terms many times before, it‚Äôs refreshing considering the current debacle in here to read something well thought out and relatable. 
---
I never really thought about the excitement factor of drops but you‚Äôre right I guess. I like getting nice stuff but ultimately most of it just goes for sale of scrip. 
---
It‚Äôs also worth noting that by and large even if you get bloodied stuff, most of it is kinda bad or useless unless it fits your specific criteria, and then it‚Äôs reduced even further as to its usefulness by the rolls and the weapon itself- otherwise is fodder again. 
---
I have about 12 bloodied weapons on my main, and I use 2. The rest I save in case ‚ÄúI fancy a change‚Äù but I never will because it‚Äôs so cumbersome and restrictive to switch classes or builds, or even just gun/weapon setups that for me it‚Äôs just not worth the pissing about.
---
I also don‚Äôt think anything needs a nerf in builds. When you stop and think about it the complexity and synergy of weapons and legendary rolls for bloodied, as well as cards, armour and mutations is pretty fucking epic. 
---
It‚Äôs everything else that‚Äôs entirely lacklustre sadly. Junkies is ok but it‚Äôs still noticeably worse overall and not as engaging to me personally. 
---
Unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start in suggesting a fix. It would require a massive game overhaul on all levels and that‚Äôs just not gonna happen, though I still don‚Äôt believe nerfing is the answer. 
---
If people are honest with themselves this is a casual PvE game with shitty aspects of PVP kinda tacked on. Some like it but that‚Äôs never what it was about. It was just put there to maybe diversify the player attention somewhat with it being ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äù. As such you can‚Äôt balance it with both in mind, nor judge it from both either as it just can‚Äôt work. 
---
Should‚Äôve just stuck to the original fallout oeuvre and not tried to shoehorn PVP in, and made the actual fallout experience memorable/cooperative.  
---
But I digress, stream of consciousness reaction on my phone here, so I‚Äôm all over the place, apologies.
---
Edit- also fuck daily limits on stuff. I forgot to say that, but it‚Äôs always worth repeating, especially when they‚Äôre so imbalanced and low.
---
In 45 minutes from this comment
---
Or just hop into power armor to see the health gauge?
---
get fucked?
---
Oh, on PC they use external programs to hack items. Any equippable item is able to be given legendary effects. They could even give junk legendary effects I'm pretty sure
---
Was certainly disappointed to see there‚Äôs no .308 receiver for the Combat Rifle, that‚Äôs why I adopted it as my main in FO4 and was able to leave my Hunting Rifles in the garage.
---
You‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges. I can just counter that too because Euro Truck Simulator has about 18K too I think.
---
I hadn‚Äôt noticed that, Handmades lighter or something?
---
Curious, is it possible to nuke the event to get waves of glowing ones?
---
Ok? So you are saying if you aren‚Äôt a top 30 steam title, your numbers are ‚Äúabysmal‚Äù?
---
I mean, the hacks are due to their incompetence too. Engine is so easy to hack
---
The lack of content. That's your answer.
---
People can like this or not but the fact is that the game is seriously lacking in the content department, which is why everything is limited, capped and time gated so people don't end up with top tier gear too fast.
---
That sound exactly like something you would get from a fallout 4 mod.
---
you can get the same rifle with settlers, but you need to know it's there and actually try to get into the room. otherwise it's extremely easy to miss.
---
It‚Äôs a top 30 title lol. So anything below top 30 is abysmal? Red dead 2 also has a lower player count than that game.
---
No problem, happy hunting!
---
Personally I dont believe 95 percent of the robin hood dupers.  To easy an excuse to blame cheating on grind and rng in a game that does not shy away from telling you in it is grind/rng heavy.
---
If you play around with glitches sometimes it backfires lmao.
---
If it is hard enough to reproduce (meaning only players trying to glitch it reproduce it) they will probably never fix it as an eff-you to players that tried to glitch lmao
---
I'm tired of the Monument. Once had twenty radstags there hoofing me non-stop
---
Very nice, sounds like victory was yours in the end :)
---
People duped billions of presents in the days after wastelanders dropped with the display case dupe. They were giving scrip then and some people spend hundreds of thousands of scrip in a few days. None were banned. The people who still have the gifft have stash boxes at 20000/800 weight limit. None of those were banned. In the same dupe people did billions of ammo. None of those were banned. And then people were using the caps from the presents to do the dupe that got patched yesterday. They're not useless.
---
EDIT: Don't forget all the stims, super stims, alcohol you get from presents
---
Post it notes work better. 
---
The adhesive doesn't stick to your TV ever.
---
Just cut a tiny sliver of a super bright colour, just the adhesive bit, and bam, neon pink indicator that won't leave gunk on your tv
---
I think it‚Äôs great for sniping and the fire rate lets you crack of plenty enough rounds from a distance.  I was also carrying a maxed Gauss rifle for the big dawgs in FO4.  I‚Äôm Riflemayne all day
---
This just blows my mind. I understand this kind of stuff has been an ongoing issue from launch. One would think it has to be a company's main priority in an ONLINE game, which is not free and which also has a monthly subscription, even if it's optional.
---
Something wierd happens with the legendary spawns at Whitesprings. 98% of the time I got through now I might get 1 legendary, but every now and then I get like 10. Has anyone else noticed this?
---
It's kinda like the wierd issue where WhiteSprings Golf Club can get overrun by eyesbots.
---
is that the best reward he gives?
---
When I was on last night there was only one of my friends who wasnt online so I was kinda sceptical of all the banning I was reading about. Also for reference I only have about 25 friends on fo76 with most being traders I've met on reddit and level 150 and up.
---
Its a broken system. its like playing gta online with cheat codes. bloddied builds have a bad rep for 2 man teams of cunts. "lets use the same gear for 500 levels and pretend were good at a game"
---
I dont know if this is intentional but when your wanted/ in an event people can damage you which is annoying when your wanted because you want other players to hunt you and kill you and your teammate comes and does damages you but you cant damage them, its quite annoying because i cant damage them back.
---
I just suggested post it notes lol
---
The adhesive never leaves residue, and they are bright coloured and easily visable .
---
Give it a shot! Get addicted to 5 things, try running full health, and see what you think. The synergy between Power Armor, Heavy Weapons, and Stabilized is quite useful. 
---
You can always use Addictol to cure your addictions if you want to go back to strictly bloodied.
---
Bloodied swing speed, +STR or Power Attack - use Iron Fist, Martial Artist, incisor, barbarian &amp; just to be spongy and can take a hit, use Blocker.
---
FYI, if you get at least 3 or 4 pieces of Uny/Sentinel Armor, because of the way percentages work in this game, you‚Äôll be avoiding so much damage that you can stand &amp; swing away through mobs. And you‚Äôll survive.
---
I was a Bloodied Uny rifle build.  Wastelanders dropped and I decided I wanted to switch to a Junkies heavy weapon PA tank build, which I did.  Farmed the gold and bought my shiny T-65, complete with Junkies Gauss Minigun.  It was glorious fun.  I could still annihilate anything and fear of death was only a memory, I was a juggernaut.
---
Then the Season dropped.  There's something other than the damage you'll miss, and that's the extra 15 INT.  That's a lot of extra XP and that 100 SCORE really starts adding up.
---
I've since blown all my bullion on all the SS plans and built a full Uny SS set and gone back to Bloodied, but still Heavy Weapons.  I still have my addictions because I'm still using some Junkies weapons but it doesn't really matter as the reductions in SPECIAL are negated by Herd Mentality (which is a no-brainer now that you can always be in a group even solo).
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs odd but I would love to hear a reason as to it‚Äôs return to 76. As of now all we have as end game .308 guns is the LMG and I‚Äôm not about about burn 5k rounds on a queen in under 30 seconds. The hunting rifle is nice all game. But it falls short after a while. And the bolt pipe is well... early game for the most part. 
---
Back when beta ended I looked forward to that moment that .308 combat would available and then boom nothing. No reason just gone.
---
I personally give away all the pennies I get, the odd penny is worthless to me. Some people value $20 differently then others I suppose
---
The banned people are saying that everyone where banned just to look better in the picture like they are the majority of the players. Its a lie. They are the minority and they dont deserve all that atention. Just let this ban wave away and move on. Stop talking about it guys.
---
Isn‚Äôt this game struggling for players? Duping or not I really don‚Äôt think mass bans is going to help them
---
Apparently with all completed as in EVERY SINGLE ONE you still need to conplete the repeatable more than 10 times per week.
---
Any missed challenges will have their weights added to repeatable, as in another 2.5 for a missed 250 daily and 10 times for a missed 1000 weekly
---
You can buy levels with atoms later but for people who are avoiding that it is good to know
---
I wish I had notifications about comments on comments, thank you. I don't understand the saltyness either. The whole "you must be..." line is getting old
---
Agreed. I grab random locations in hopes of getting a top RNG roll on a camp plan or the 3 scorchbeasts attack which seem to RNG 3 top level camp plans. This seems like something fun to do since I usually just leave without using the resources.
---
Ok then important NOT change the scope. The rest is not important.
---
I hope I'm not the only one, but please excuse my ignorance but I'm curious to know what the B2525 is? I have heard others mention it too.  I'm new to MMOs and not much into programming or anything (if that is code talk) so I don't even know what it is or how to recognize it to prevent myself from accidentally falling victim to the bans.  The Wiki doesn't have any info when I typed in B2525.  Any info would be very helpful.  Thanks!
---
I mean I‚Äôm not banned but 6 in a lobby is pretty empty...
---
Yea I won't be touchinh my mule for a week or two just to be safe
---
Hey I had that happens at one of the workshops! The problem is that the turrets consider his cow as an enemy and, obviously, Grahm doesn't like that very much. He wasn't even agressive towards me at all, only at the turrets that shot his cow.
---
Yep,anyway I‚Äôm glad I only tried this on one of my accounts but not all of them.
---
Yep. Spot on.
---
Inspect the next level was supposed to have a purchase option.
---
It's good that this was delayed, allowing people to purchase things in a system that's broken for a lot of people (see all the auto complete posts) would have been in incredible poor taste and, most likely, legally problematic.
---
Oh boy, I'm jealous. Yes, that will work well. I use Ricochet which messes up my Instigating weapon effect sometimes.
---
Fallout 76 is single player?
---
That's weird, everyone told me Outer Worlds would kill this game forever ü§î
---
Punish everyone?  Ok. Come up with a realistic way of punishing the duper‚Äôs. And getting rid of all duped weapons. Or do u just let everyone get away with it and have a crippled in game economy. Resetting the server back a week u lose no items that were traded for duped. U get rid of all the duped stuff and then by going from that point back, before it was public u get rid of all the guilty players.
---
Half walls and windows, circular/oval walls, floors and ceilings, powered lifts to reach higher floors, water tiles of various shapes to allow us to create pools and ponds, an option to make more than one camp and then choose which one you want to place in the world when you login, etc... 
---
This game would have all my money if only it would go balls out on the Camp aspect.
---
Lol top 30... so what? Skyrim and Fallout 4 have way more players than fo76. Lol 10K steam player count is abysmal. That‚Äôs an objective fact. Left 4 dead 2 has more players lmao
---
The gauss weapons are great in theory, but they‚Äôve been pretty bugged for a while now.
---
Thanks! Should I put extra points in STR?
---
I visited the lake north of Abbie's bunker and around the sunflower near there and eventually found one at the latter (after a few days of visiting/server-hopping). I had temporarily put my charisma up to 6 and had both Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer maxed... only because I had read mixed reports on if WW needed to be max. I was around level 115 I think. Also, the deathclaw arrived to my camp level 21 but pretty sure he was much higher when I tamed him.
---
He can give you the 105mm lens (the reward from the quest that gives you the camera) and the 200mm lens, so I‚Äôd say yes.
---
He also gives water, stims, radaway and grenades, and three treasury notes.
---
FO76 isn't a hard game to play, with a little bit of effort you can build a character to do what you want with or without legendary effects boosting your stats.  
---
Where dupers have an opening is in the completely random spawning of legendary effect weapons.  My own case in point it took me well over 3000 legendary script to eventually get an 3\* Zealot, Gatling Plasma (I wanted a Gatling laser but gave up after getting the plasma), from the Purveyor..  That meant every single legendary that dropped for me up until that point was useless to my specific character type and was just scrapped.  
---
If I wasn't the type of person who didn't mind running round Appalachia for a few hours each day, hunting and farming legendary creatures, then the appeal of buying what I wanted from a duper would be an easy option, Bethesda created that randomness which created a scarcity, which in turn created a market that players can exploit.  
---
If you Dupe you deserve to be banned, but if there's a market for product, then someone will risk a ban because the rewards are worth it to them.
---
They're just people you trade with on trading sub, I dont know them lol. I'm not banned :-)
---
Scorchbeasts do count. But you have to do one scorchbeast, one behemoth and one collossus for the 3. You can't do 3 scorchbeasts. 
---
It tells you what counts just to the right when you select the challenge.
---
I think they‚Äôre trying to fix being able to buy levels in the legendary run. I thought it was supposed to be enabled yesterday but don‚Äôt see it working
---
If you are talking about the challenge.  If you highlight it I believe it tells you what you are hunting.  I killed a Behemoth, Death Claw and the Grafton Monster I believe.
---
Its not. There is the time, there is the normal amount of players that play every day, there is the amount of players of the game pass that was just trying it out and now just wont play anymore, lot of stuff
---
I love the smell of people complaining about free in the morning.
---
I was thinking a similar idea, just if you complete the daily or weekly ones, you unlock the extreme challenges, something like kill 200 scorched a week, or buy 200 bullets in a day from a player in a day
---
Oh did everyone tell you that Rick? That‚Äôs super interesting Rick.
---
Either those or you could try the mutant behemoth, yao guai
---
No addictions needed!
---
for the weekly? the beasts count, i did deathclaw, scorchbeast, grafton monster
---
if you select the challenge it will list everything out and check off which monsters you killed
---
No, I'm testing the limits of my build and weapons within the confines of the game environment. When you pay for the keycard you can complain about how the event is done. This bitching and moaning by scrubs that are too lazy to learn how to better their build and strategy is the reason the game is dying from lack of endgame content.
---
Totally agree and believe it or not I haven‚Äôt sought out a duped version of my ideal weapon but it‚Äôs super annoying knowing it‚Äôll be next to impossible to get my BFFR fixer... If it get to a point where in a year from now I‚Äôm still looking for one I‚Äôll totally just grab a duped one because it‚Äôs just not worth it at that point.  A year of killing the golf club ghouls is gonna get awfully boring.
---
I‚Äôve considered just biting the bullet and grabbing one from someone in discord but I haven‚Äôt due to the excitement I can imagine if I were to get that drop.  Tbh though would probably be just as fun for me to not grind legit for it and go around hunting rare plans instead.
---
Maybe one day they‚Äôll make it to where specific public events drop specific weapon types for example you get legendary rifles from the encrypted event and legendary heavy guns from SBQ. That would be a way more enjoyable and reasonable grind AND would encourage people to participate in pub events.
---
Adding to your list.. Deathclaw, Mirelurk Queen, Super Mutant Behemoth and i think Fog Crawler.. from the top of my head..
---
I find it hard to believe as well. I hope Bethesda chooses, in the near future, to focus on solving all these issues, in the end a longevity of an online game depends on things like this as well, and I do enjoy the game very much and hope it just doesn't implode.
---
15 Points in STR is probably best, if you want max damage &amp; tankiness.
---
This has been the way since launch. Why do you think there's so many be15 gat plasmas about. If you've ever traded, you likely have duped items.
---
They're limited to 16 players, they cant make players up when a new one spins up for number 17 and if not many are playing, that new server never fills up, makes perfect sense.
---
Actually, it took a while before hacking programs were widely available to use. I mean sure maybe a few people had the ability but I want to say late 2019 is when it got really bad. 
---
A group of exploiters began sharing the program which they used, and many "raiders" used it to steal people's entire inventory. 
---
Personally I don't think it happened to the extent which they made it seem, but Bethesda confirmed that less than 5% of players were affected which I think still might be a large amount. Not sure tbh, but the hacking wasn't ALWAYS available
---
If you were to just do all the dailies and weeklies, you‚Äôd be fine, especially with the extra dailies they‚Äôve added and the double XP/double daily score weekends coming up. 
---
As for people being far ahead, they‚Äôre grinding XP or have builds that generate a lot more XP. There is a repeatable challenge to earn 10k XP for 100 SCORE. For some reason a lot of people just overlook that or think it‚Äôs some unattainable or useless task. It‚Äôs not. You‚Äôll hit that repeatable a lot of times before the end of the season. It‚Äôll add up in a big way even if you‚Äôre not focusing on it.
---
Thanks, gonna have to check to see how many points I have saved up for all this new stuff.. lol
---
simple fix, makes all those legacy do 0 damage
---
Ah awesome thank you, a lot of this I didn't know.
---
Because its pc only. For a short time ppl could make their own legendaries using third party software. Harpoon gun shooting orbital strikes was funny.
---
It's hands down the best way to build. It just helps a camp, in most cases, fit into the setting so much more. 
---
I've build bars under Beaver dams, raider compounds off of a small truck/hut, a camp with a secret tunnel entrance through a sewer....
---
And have never once built from scratch and liked the result nearly as much.
---
Lol! the cabal of dupers owns this otherwise PeRfEct EcOnOmy 
---
Blame the players playing the game, but don‚Äôt fault the devs for creating the game and putting it out in the state it‚Äôs been in, because bethesda Austin definitely knows what they are doing üòÇ
---
You have to unlock atomic shop items for them to show up
---
Interesting... this week was the first time I am sure my challenges auto-completed, and it was also the first time I was online around time of the weekly reset.
---
Eso isn't anti-alt
---
Only way I know of is to disable enlighten in your fallout76.ini file. Problem is, most places in the game will be much darker without it and water textures may be glitchy as well.
---
I really think it's funny when people say that dupers are robin hood as if every duper is the wasteland Santa Claus running around dropping free legacies for everyone.  Most people duped to sell on RMT sites  because it's much easier to sell a $10 weapon 12 times than it is to sell a $120 dollar weapon 1 time.  They "crashed" the prices, sure, but all it did was make the RMT more accessible to your average Joe thus creating more business overall for RMT people.
---
But... the astroturf... I neeeed it.
---
Cheers
---
Oh my bad lol that does sound pretty funny. Makes me want to get a harpoon gun in Fallout 4 that shoots those missile strikes from the Yangtze lmao
---
Whenever I'm on, my public team is up for grabs.
---
I usually do a Building +INT team, and MOST of the time, I have pretty good success with users jumping on and sticking to it. 
---
Yesterday was the first time I started it and people weren't joining; idk if it was all the Banninating or whatever, but it was a little slow last night.
---
Yup. If you are commando am assuming u already got a lot of AGI, keep AGI as it helps especially once they fix adrenaline perk, you‚Äôll want Ninja Perk Card &amp; Sneak if you gonna do Queen. For regular mobs I replace sneak with Dodgy and run around punching away.
---
Haven't played since this was nerfed, might come back if they did this
---
Just because someone leaves their wallet out on a table in public doesn't mean you should swipe the money inside when no one is looking.  Just like you shouldn't abuse an exploit just because it is there.
---
the best way to earn coins is by jumping underneath floating brick blocks.
---
I am new on the game to ps4 i have the game since beta and never played until now... for some reason free ü§ó so i can join you to?
---
Same here. I find tonnes of them. I don't think any prefix is that rare, it's the decent 2nd and 3rd effects together that are.
---
dupers own the meta whore market..
---
The system for PvP is poorly designed in a lot of ways. That said there a plenty of douchey people on fallout that deserve to be shot in PvP. PvP can be quite fun but it's rarely a level playing field. I contest workshops occasionally to see if people will fight. If they are good sports about it then I often drop items more valuable than the caps I took from them. More often than not people just fly off the handle and say all sorts of pleasant things while telling me I'm an asshole for doing something they don't like. A lot of people just do it to get a rise out of people. I personally enjoy the challenge of something smarter than a Super Mutant trying to kill me. Not everyone likes PvP but if you take a workshop it is a risk you agree to.
---
Doomsayers are everywhere in every part of life.  Eventually one will be right but I dont think today is the day fo fo76.  There is always a silent majority and as we hear the dying cries of the wicked slowly there mark will fade and others will replace them.
---
You are welcome
---
Yeah currently:
---
S4
---
P15
---
E5
---
C5
---
I5
---
A14
---
L8
---
I‚Äôve got 38 ranks saved up
---
‚ÄòThis issue has never happened to me, therefore you‚Äôre the ones that are fucking up.‚Äô 
---
You act like this is the first time a bug has ever effected some people but not others. If bugs were that clear cut then even FO76‚Äôs devs could tear right through them.
---
Honestly, if it's a good piece and you didn't roll it yourself, assume it's duped.
---
I guess you haven't played long or you'd know this was already the case no more than a few months after launch.
---
I have a _slight_ preference for the handmade over the CR or the Fixer but that's based on a now outdated glitch with the handmade (the largest clip for the handmade used to hold 60 rounds vs. 25(?) for the CR but then got nerfed to 30) but I fell in love with my handmade anyway. I like the look. I like the sound. It just _feels_ better to me. I love the 'I made this' aesthetic versus the CRs fairly clean look and especially the Fixer's fresh-out-of-the-box look. Maybe I could save a few rounds here and there switching my main but I honestly don't care. I just like it better, and that's ok.
---
Also as an aside when I was beefing up my handmade, I found that they're pretty few and far between so I just learned the plans and crafted/scrapped my way to glory. I bought my handmade plans from Harpers Ferry back in the day but I'm sure they're available from the Whitespring vendors. But nowadays you can find them pretty regularly from  Human NPCs, so there's that.
---
About freaking time.
---
So you are saying you just happened to be on a new server? Lol. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs dead. You could have 2000 full servers and you are on a newly spun up server. You have no way of knowing. Unless you think there are less than 20 people playing the game lol.
---
you are doing something wrong there or stand taking to much damage, I'm a pure melee and since I got ss I repair once each 5-8 days with the enhanced repair kit  from the Sqb run
---
So a lot of traders are supera. Shocking.
---
yeah I cut a small triangle about the size of the other HUD elements. It is small enough that it doesn't effect my playing other games, but if I wanted could easily be removed with no adverse effects.
---
VATS has been buggy since release c'mon, Bethesda takes forever to fix things, its annoying.
---
I will no longer buy anything from Bethesda if they didn‚Äôt want it to happen they would‚Äôve made it that way their becoming money hungry pigs and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting
---
I feel you man. When I became a stealth sniper I had an IE lever action, and boy did those 4K caps feel good when I found an I FFR lever at a vendor.
---
Euro truck simulator is a top 30 game on steam...
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
&gt; You can still play how you used to and just ignore it (minus the occasional popup when you DO rank up).
---
Except people both 1) want the Legendary Run rewards and 2) don't want to waste their time.
---
If you don't optimize how you do things then you waste a lot of time with the SCORE system.  And the way the system works, it optimizes just playing to get your daily SCORE and then quitting if you are at all near leveling up again. Unless you want to waste far more time the next day grinding an entire level rather than just a small sliver of a level.
---
Saw a group of around 7 ish level 1 accounts over at whitespring Station. Thought it suspicious so I traveled over, they were all in area  chat for some reason. They were lamenting their lost homes or the gear they had in other accounts. I audibly laughed then they went into their "service to the community" spill.
---
They normally fill up relatively quickly though, just saying, not today...
---
If u think this is toxic then i understand why u r depressed, mental midget
---
Time exclusive and or being added to the SCORE 
---
I the atom shop being slim down for the score system and time exclusive (I think fortnite made this popular right?) 
---
Trust me this system is 10000x better then loot boxes
---
Nope just wait
---
Oh I have a junkies gauss minigun
---
Whatever you say. It‚Äôs a fact tens of thousands of players are playing right now.
---
Is it possible that server wasnt accepting anymore players as it's about to be taken down
---
I love the idea that I must stop playing a game I enjoy so that I can enjoy the game later.
---
no because then i miss out on getting an extra score from doing the "repeatable: earn XP" challenge.
---
These are the easiest because of their known spawns. It was a cake walk.
---
I agree, fuck dupers
---
Dupers always owned the market, it's just now they can't real money trade as easily, plus maybe now the trade subs will stop having fake posts made just so the duper can say "no" to every offer and artificially inflate the value of their dupe. Dupers were like the diamond industry... Gonna have to start calling them De Peers
---
I have people on my friends list whom have millions of anmo (from previous dupe wavesüôÑ) millions of tokens (from previous dupe wavesüôÑ) millions of holiday gifts (yes you guessed it from previous dupe wavesüôÑ) have a crap ton of duped legacy‚Äôs and b2525 etc guns and are STILL PLAYING. 
---
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs irking me,  not that they banned but yet they are so damn inconsistent and do everything half arsed.
---
Well too bad, cause if farming legendary enemies was more reliable I'd have something to do, and instead  of canceling my fo1st sub and playing warframe I'd be giving them money and playing their game.
---
*weeks
---
I havent talked to ward yet and i think i should be glad for that
---
I believe there is an inventory management mod that people dont get banned for..
---
I'm new to the game... if my camp get destroyed, is it gone for good and I have to rebuild? How does that work?
---
I use all forms of bows. I find furious, anti armour, instigating, bloodied and berserkers to be the most useful picks. I generally see them going for 3-5k here on Xbox.
---
I always try to be helpful but I just got banned lol, anyone that looks at my account will very quickly realize I have basically nothing.....how does this happen?
---
I'm just trying to help out :(
---
Should I not report bugs?
---
I'd buy that. Just been so long
---
Check out the r/fo76filthycasuals reddit
---
Thanks for the info. I may not have been playing for very long, but I do like to research and keep informed on the things I enjoy. This is very unfortunate and even if it was a minority of players thah has been affected, I do hope those players were refunded in some way.
---
I'd love to be able to raid other camps. Increase the amount of damage objects can take, and make it so I can break into other players' containers and steal their stuff. The problem here though is the insanely unbalanced pvp on the game (at least it was before pvp practically disappeared).
---
Still, I'll advocate for pvp weapon balancing in Adventure like it is in Nuclear Winter. Buffs, perks, effects, etc should only affect damage output/resistance in pve
---
You are dupping your post ?
---
So you know you posted two identical posts couple of minutes apart
---
They are fun. I use one as my default bow mostly to save arrows per kill. And have a berserkers one for everything else.
---
You just repair the damage. It takes resources, just like if you were building.
---
One of the wildest things i seen at my camp is an old man try to convince a kid to join his discord
---
I have friends that did the same. They still have multiples and no ban. Then some of my friends who I gave items to were banned with no multiples. I have a little remorse there. I‚Äôm not salty of a ban either, that was the best end game content since it‚Äôs release and I would do it all over again knowing I would be banned. Glad I finally got to try all those items I would have never ever been able to get. Other than fallout 1st, I haven‚Äôt spent a dime on the game so in all fairness, thank you Bethesda for the 2500hrs of playtime.
---
This game is nearing the ridiculous with all the dupes and bugs. Lame
---
Throwback when speedrunners of Fo3 and FNV were debating whether or not a glitchless speedrun is even possible
---
That is sort of interesting that they added it there, but it was something planned, then pulled, yes.
---
I see it's going in one ear and out the other with you.
---
Forget the maths and percentages...
---
Why have they suspended folks and not just perma banned all dupers.....dollars my friend
---
Well, let's hope we can enjoy Fo76 for a long time :).
---
Never taken.  Only things I ever received directly from another player through trade were serums, and only plans (and friggin' stimpack diffusers) from player vendors.  Every piece of gear I have is either crafted, rewarded, or dropped.
---
Yes.  Given that you now always have access to the benefit of being on a team by using the public team option (even if you are the only one in the team) herd mentality is a must (IMO).
---
AngryTurtle did a great video on empath serum: https://youtu.be/OqwoKVJQ46A
---
Personally I use both on my bloodied unarmed melee build.
---
yay you changed to your burner to pray on kids in the waste !!
---
I have not had that but I have had where trying to build walls and it say nope no supports.. 
---
Looks at the floor.. but game.. it's right there...
---
NOPE You lie! 
---
/me cries
---
When the dupes are private I agree, this is what people are like. The second it goes public however everyone is suddenly selling b2525 fixers for caps or giving them away. This dupe has been about for a long time and the majority have finally benefitted
---
If you cant find anything thats says you can or cannot mod dont risk it
---
I have been playing since the game was released, I am well aware that duping has been an ongoing issue. And, as far as I can tell, you agree with my post.
---
Yes it is safe. Atleast the ones from Nexus. People have been using mods since day one, including myself. Bughesda do not support mods for fallout 76, but do not restrict the use of them. If they wanted to restrict them, they would do what they did in Nuclear Winter (you can't start the gamemode with mods on).
---
You love you a good turf war and a good kiddy creep
---
Yup should be enough for I think; mainly you‚Äôll need 15 STR &amp; 11 END. This to make powerful and tanky. END will have; LIFE GIVER, FIREPROOF, ADAMENTUM SKELETON.
---
CHR, PER &amp; INT; not used much you can have as low as 3, you will NERD RAGE &amp; LONE WANDERER for extra damage and tankiness. 
---
Otherwise, LCK; you‚Äôll have class freak, started genes and bloody mess as well as serendipity {really helps with low health}. You should get adrenaline reaction, talons and twisted muscles mutation, also speed demon because it works with LIFE GIVER Perk
---
This might be obvious but have you tried server hopping or closing the game and re-opening it
---
You call it ‚ÄûWasting Time‚Äú when it‚Äôs actually ‚ÄûPlaying the game‚Äú. If I am close to levelling up, I just switch to my other characters. 
---
As a matter of fact, if you really are so concerned about the level up challenge, just make a new character. You get a free level up every time you bring a new guy out of the vault. And since there are no longer certain stipulations for leveling up, it counts. And it only takes like 5 minutes.
---
Just delete that character afterwards.
---
Deathclaw at Deathclaw Island
---
Megasloth at Treetops
---
Behemoth at Bog workshop
---
Grafton monster near Charleston station
---
Those worked for me.
---
I hope so, like I said trying to find stuff in Aid is a nightmare..
---
Hahaha this logic is totally insanity. No one stole a thing, nor did they use third party software to break the game, it is broken all on its own. 
---
I hope you are as  passionate about the problems happening in our society, as you are about people enjoying a video game differently than you.
---
Not sure what that means.
---
Pc gamers.... smh
---
Down vote all y‚Äôall want. When it‚Äôs an online game, why‚Äôre you incapable of playing the game as is? Are you that incompetent at playing the thing?
---
If anything they can RMT much easier now.  Which do you think is easier?  Selling a $120 gun to 1 person or selling a $12 dollar gun to 10 people?  I bet it's much easier to move a product that's 10x cheaper 10x more.  The prices may have crashed but they can sell way more items at the lower prices.
---
Yes, punish everyone. That's what you literally suggest with your idea resetting everyone. Not sure why you even ask when it's obvious that this is exactly what a reset would do. Punish everyone.
---
As for coming up with ideas, quite frankly, it is NOT my job to punish the dupers. That's solely on Bethesda but if I had anything to say it would not be to reset everyone. That would literally be the last idea I would come up with because a reset of a week invalidates everything people have done. They will have wasted all their time playing a game for nothing and while some might argue that playing a game is already a waste of time it's a strawman argument not worthy of a genuine reply.
---
As for the economy, that was already broken, what are you even talking about?
---
Gifts were duped to hell and back. Caps are literally a currency with no value at this point because people still have mules with tons of gifts on them to refill their caps. The vast majority, the casual players and those who don't care about having the best gear, still use caps but the trading economy has long gone off site for real money. 
---
Did you ask for a week long rollback when that happened? Or when the Mole Miner pails got duped? For that matter, where were you when the first dupe happened? The genuine big bang of dupes that made it painfully obvious that the engine has way too many holes?
---
Unless your answer is that you started playing just this month it's a bit hypocritical to cry for a server farm wide reset.
---
And once again, since you don't seem to understand it. Resetting the servers back a week means you lose any and all progress for that entire week. A WEEK.
---
I could accept a day, with a lot of bitching, but if I were to suddenly lose a week worth of progress I would seriously lose my shit.
---
Laziness.
---
So on the wall to the west theres two openings where the wall has broken. If you put your tent in the opening to the north it will force them to spawn on the transmitter. If you have more than 2 people you need to put another tent in the south one. Ive only done it solo or with 2 people.
---
I usually sort by spoil or weight
---
Why buy anything when you can have it given to you?
---
That looks great!!
---
What roll have you got on the bear arm?
---
Definitely not the first time this has happened. Kind of concerned why you think they stole it. I now have more leverage than they do as I had listers wanting things I hav making stupid offers.
---
if I had to guess I'd say the rad zone would damage the speakers and make the event kinda suck to keep going.  This is going off of doing nuked Surface-to-air, where the turret you have to protect constantly dies of rads
---
They have had at least two ban waves on pc due to QOL mods. Use at your own risk
---
Yeah, I got some really decent heavy weapons rolls from the Purveyor sale...on my stealth commando. I have an alt that is going to go heavy weapon, so I stashed a couple on him and I'm playing around with a magic minigun that she dropped for me, but it is basically a bunch of dead weight in my stash until they move from my vendor or I scrip them.
---
He means his Ghoul Slayer's Bashing Damage +1 Agi Gatling Gun is legit
---
High capacity mod works on the small backpack and brings it up to 90lbs.
---
Or to you know... make sure they don‚Äôt ban the wrong people. Be cautious with extreme measures. Always. People who duped should be suspended at minimum.
---
Either way, servers aren‚Äôt deserted according to player count.
---
the only part of the market dupers are having an effect on is meta weapons and gear..
---
nobody is duping Instigating hunting rifles.. only gear for meta builds
---
Global legendary rates have been nerfed once or twice since then, and that hit the whitespring especially hard
---
I love seeing people selling ammo for more than a cap and expecting people to buy it
---
There's just no consistency to it whatsoever.
---
What I tend to do is charge it up, enter VATS, release it, and then charge it each time while I'm still in VATS.
---
This goes on until I get fed up and switch to the Combat Shotgun, because in the time it takes to charge up the Gauss, I could have emptied half of the Combat Shotgun's magazine.
---
Yeah i don‚Äôt get it, what ima do is wait till the last day or so so that way I can max out the amount of tiers I can get, than buy whatever ones I may not have earned, or meybe I‚Äôll get tier 100 before the end of the season and not have to spend a single atom
---
\#1. place your camp away from the wayward area. as everyone tries to place a camp there. place it close to water . look on the far left side of the map large body of water travels the whole side. pick a spot make it home. then google the water purifier plan locations. and get them. once gotten farm the materials to make as many as you want. sell the water they produce daily to vendors.... you are now self-sustaining and probably below level 10.
---
\#2. all of them
---
\#3 see tip #1.
---
Do you not consider people's OCD and want to have a look around a cool base. I've seen some monstrosities and I have been so offended I've just left the base before checking vendors üòÇüòÇ. (Half joking of course, only half)
---
Level 2 doesn't count as  a 'level up' for the challenge purposes.
---
You need to hit level 3. Granted, it is just an extra 10-15 minutes, but still.
---
Word üëè
---
They're bugged. Only on weapons with a fire rate of around 200,with certain effects
---
I have a lot of Junkie weapons but I think my favorite Magic weapons is my Junkie pump shotgun. 1 hit everything except for boss types. Even without any perks. Each pellet does damage in the hundreds.
---
does liking boys dressed at girl not feel gay to u
---
How is it insanity?  Just because you are presented with the opportunity to do something wrong that benefits yourself does not mean you should go through with it.  The premise is the same in both situations.
---
This is not a single-player game.  It is an MORPG game.  People are allowed to play the game however they want as long as it is within the ToS.  This is clearly not allowed within the rules of the ToS.  If you want to have cheats and stuff go play one of the many other single player fallout games where you can be Gods of your own little worlds.  There are other players here and you need to think about how your actions affect the rest of the player-base.
---
Before you say it affects no one, did you ever wonder why we got a whole Wastelanders expansion where all of the new gear was character locked?  Because of dupers and RMT.  People breaking the ToS and cheating affects game-play development choices and hurts everyone.
---

Have you tried to hard restart your Xbox? Or is it Gamepass for PC?
---
I've been playing it on Xbox with no issues, but I haven't tried logging on today yet.
---
exactly! lol I was looking forward to having this until i realized it wasn't 90% reduced like, say, my heavy weapons from beararms.
---
Don't smack it too hard you will turn into a console gamer.  All joking aside if you don't like PC that's fine just find your comment odd.
---
Edit to the Edit,
---
I am saying that while the game at it's core is fun there are tons of QOL issues that can be ironed out with the use of mods. I am not sure if you are just not used to fixing problem because it's not an option you normally have but people on PC games if there is a problem.. they try to fix it rather than just suffer.
---
Complete rubbish. No one has ever been banned for using them. I have used them from day 1, and know dozens of people who have done the same. Not a single ban. They have said that mods are not supported but not restricted. They have even said in some old interview that they closely follow popular mods so they know what types of additions people like to see in the game. If they wanted to, they could disable the use of them very easily like they did in NW.
---
Def get heard mentality. Works even if u by urself in public team.
---
Dupers have small pp
---
Thank you for the heads up.
---
Are you suggesting penning Ward up with Punji boards? ü§î
---
Is this turkey company
---
I'm sure "everyone" wasn't giving away b2525 fixers.  Yes I'm sure some were duped and given away to friends.
---
What mods do you recommend?
---
It depends on the situation.
---
I found a guy a short hop from the vault for the final Wastelanders quest.
---
He was selling bullets at 2 caps a pop. Snapped up about 2,000 x 5mm bullets as I had run out (the Legendary Sentry kept resetting) and it saved me a shit ton of time having to farm mats to make more.
---
In certain situations, more than 1 cap is justifiable.
---
i play without armour and if there's shitload of radiation i use my yellow hazmat suit, im very vulnerable then but i have more carry weight without PA
---
I suppose it‚Äôs a matter of prefixes and preferences. The advantage of a LAR or Hunting Rifle is higher per-shot damage, which synergizes better with the Instigating prefix, and perks that increase damage from stealth.
---
That being said, if you‚Äôre not using VATs (or Instigating weapons), improved fire rate definitely helps with getting kills.
---
This guy sees it half full
---
A max level IE lever action (in stealth) is a thing of beauty.
---
I was scared of the robots, by reputation and it wasn't bad at all. Silly me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No
---
Been playing since the release and a big gap after the first dupe. And in an ideal
---
World Bethesda should have shit the servers on Thursday night and rolled them back 24 hours. But it‚Äôs not an ideal world. And yes I‚Äôd have done exactly the same wth the stackables dupe and the Tse dupe. The second they become public. Shut the servers. Roll back 24 hours and then ban everyone who duped before that point. If they do this. Which I doubt. Then I‚Äôd be pissed at the loss of levels but happy the events weren‚Äôt swamped with every man and his dog with an exploding plasma gat and one shotting everything in seconds with a B2525 fixer.
---
You was bad at trading already before the dupe happend üòÇ dont blame others for that
---
Not sure about empath, but herd mentality is totally worth it to me. 
---
I play quite a bit in my private world and it still works as long as you form a team(you can still be the only one on your ‚Äúteam‚Äù) I use building for the intelligence bonus.
---
Behind the church in flat woods you can find one too
---
CSA yo.. get some
---
also.. what events require you to be out of PA in a position where mobs can kill you? serious question.. 
---
one violent night?.. I know you need to use the PC for Fertile Soil but you can do it at the end when the mobs are dead.. what else?
---
'-'
---
That's a good idea. Lock the room and save your items. I've only got 2 machines going right now, I'm going to do this when I log on later today
---
Myself, I was just lazy lol figured at 300 I should get around to it. Havnt done it since haha
---
I've noticed lately that people are choosing to stay in event teams even though most events are empty, I wonder why.
---
Of course. Why would this too no be at the mercy of the RNG gods
---
It's some sort of secret code for the market/trading crowd. At some point they lost me too and I've been playing since beta, lol. Probably some Bloodied gear for the cookie cutter crowd.
---
too much shit is a common problem.. could be
---
Thanks, I mainly use it for tagging mobs in Uranium Fever but still have to be careful not to kill them with it.
---
Italian, sounds nice is all üòò
---
Several times, still not working
---
why take everything?
---
well it's free and an endgamer can still use them ammo, u shouldn't have put it out in the open for anyone to take 
---
is like keeping ur bike unlocked in the middle of the streets, it's just fated to disappear then
---
No. I don‚Äôt believe them. But also believe in investigations before banning a customer. I wouldn‚Äôt ban a customer or take radical action against an employee without some sort of investigation. Make the wrong decision and you are setting yourself up for lawsuits. The need to ensure TOS were indeed violated.
---
I have no problem with the duppers, and cheers to those who took their ban and laughed it off. They knew they were violating the TOS. But I keep seeing so many post on Facebook crying about being banned, and the fxxk Bethesda, and whine whine whine... Like damn, you got caught, move on
---
that was yesterday.. people have moved on to straight up fury today.. lol
---
A fool and his money are soon parted yada yada
---
Dupers
---
I like him too. He‚Äôs has good info.
---
Yes.
---
&gt; I need to try some Nukashine, I hear it's a real trip. 
---
Omg it does dad jokes, that is awesome.
---
No it definately isnt lmao. Selling ammo for more than a cap is like selling non legendary equipment at your camp. It literally screams, i dont trade and I overvalue everything. Like think like this spending 2 caps on the 2000 could have gotten you 4000 rounds and given the money to someoe who would have spent it better. Its not worth, like i see people sell fusion cells for 3 caps and 2mm ecm for 8? Like ok you will never sell anything
---
Ah
---
That's only true for the limbs and they have lower ER. OP is better off using what he has and gradually putting together a Secret Service set.
---
LoL yeah I know. Which is why I originally asked someone that had it unlocked already
---
Prob not then
---
and the enablers who defend them?
---
That‚Äôs me.  I run an auto rifle build including several primed handmades.  At one point I had 120K in 556 ammo and over 25K in ultracite 556 ammo.  My daily driver is an AAE auto handmade and my backup is a B25 FFR primed handmade.  Plus I use the ammo as currency.
---
A bike left unlocked isn't just free and open to anybody to take.
---
Please stop stealing unlocked bikes.
---
There were a ridiculous amount given away or sold for caps. You just have to look at the trading pages here or on Facebook to see that. Santa came early this year, trust me
---
...I'm curious-
---
What do you mean "Turkey company"?
---
Some of us survived for now you never know how long they will be doing this
---
I have well over 700 and it kills me when a friend says he is short two. Let me drop them!
---
Ofc
---
True enough, reading today here about all this kerfuffle I didn't realise just how many people were into this duping thing.
---
Surely not all games are like this? I've only ever played Eve Online and the fallout series from 3, NV, 4 and 76.
---
Unless there is a vending machine that accepts Mr. Fuzzy tokens then yes, caps.
---
Do you comprehend that the number of 'innocent' people banned 'by accident' is a LOT smaller than the number of dupers, NW cheaters and other people scamming the system?
---
IF a person is actually innocent I have no problems with them protesting and obviously there should be a mechanism for this to be reviewed. And I'm certainly not saying Bethseda can 'do no wrong', but I absolutely refuse to be told *people who are being banned are* ***always*** *innocent and should be given the benefit of the doubt.*
---
Because I'm sorry, but most of the bans are 100% valid, and to 'assume good faith' in people claiming innocence when I've seen the same people bragging about duped items further lets me know this is not as cut and dry as you try to make it.
---
I appreciate the blade runner reference nice
---
For a while I was using a Paddle Ball for that :-|
---
Its an old ps4 rp pvp group
---
Me.  I love Fallout 76, but I don't have a ton of time to dedicate to it and there are other games I want to play (Escape from Tarkov, Rust), but I also don't want to miss out.
---
Suffer? Just deal with it.
---
To be fair, I heard this recent dupe was very widespread so it could be a fair portion of the playerbase. Idk though. Its nice to see consequences like you said
---
Now now did bethesda Austin day that they are changing that system because of dupers? No. Did they emulate many successful games by adding account locked end game items? Yes. Is that common with these types of ‚ÄúMMO‚Äôs‚Äù? very much so. 
---
If we want to speculate, let‚Äôs speculate. If we want to spew facts at eachother, let‚Äôs make sure they are facts. Just like people saying 80% of people got banned, you are just spewing opinion and rumor as if it were true. 
---
Be a justice warrior all you‚Äôd like, it‚Äôs your right to play and post how you feel, I challenge you to really think critically about who‚Äôs fault it is that the servers are unstable enough that simply hopping servers creates a ‚Äúgame breaking exploit‚Äù
---
Ah cool, I'm going to check out Ohio river adventures. And somehow it never occurred to me that I can now talk to raiders now that they're not hostile anymore, so I'll remember that as well :)
---
its a tale as old as time itself..
---
I think the point about build diversity is entirely correct. It's ridiculous that there's basically only two properly meta builds in the game almost two years after release (Bloodied and Junkie's), and less than half of the prefixes are useful. It's difficult enough getting the right gun on loot tables as well as the right major and minor effects, so I think rebalancing some of the legendary effects or including more synergies with unused ones would help a lot and make getting different weapons more interesting.
---
Limits need to go. The cap limit is the worst one. An online game where one of your concerns late game is keeping an eye on your caps so you don't go over an incredulously low amount is, in my eyes, a failure. The cheapest tradeable item in the game (probably 5mm ammo) is not 1/30,000th of a B2525 Fixer or a BE Ultracite Gatling Laser - it's probably closer to 1/100,000th even with the market being flooded by duplicates. This is the main area where you can tell nobody at Bethesda plays this game or online games in general. It doesn't work, it ruins gameplay and any economy and I don't see any reason for it to stay.
---
The main thing I don't understand is why people feel a need to absolutely min max their equipment. This game isn't difficult once you get to the late game. I run a melee full health build that's far from optimal and I never really get into any difficulty doing anything in the game, unless I decided to solo a SBQ or Encryptid. My Super Sledge is decent with swing speed. I try and get Unyielding on my armour (currently at three SS armour pieces on Unyielding), and whilst I'd like something like Cavalier's or +1 Strength, it's not going to make or break my character.
---
New enemies are required as a matter of course anyway, following on from my point above that the game is too easy. Naturally, players get better at the game, over time players will eventually move towards an optimal build and enemies that seemed hard when they came out gradually become easier and easier as you learn how to do them. The lack of endgame content included in the base game and released since is another serious failing. I understand they needed to revamp the base game because it didn't work either, but at this point I don't know how many people would start playing the game for the base game. Player retention is probably far more important and the players need more to do than fire the same nukes at the same hole in the ground that they've been firing them at for the last 20 months.
---
Do you have any source that the legendary prefix RNG is skewed based on prefix? Just from playing I haven't noticed getting some more or less from drops.
---
I personally use: Better Inventory, Perk Loadout Manager, SFE, Improved Healthbars (great for bloodied build), Save Everything and Event Notifications. I consider them must have.
---
Thanks for this! My friend has jumped headfirst into the raider aesthetic and he was thinking about getting this but neither of us have used a collectron before so weren't sure it was worth the atoms. I'll pass this post along to him.
---
They may not be duping those items, but they do trade duped wears for those types of items. Check out the RMT (who, btw, duped everything they could) sites and you can see all the "new" tags on various types of items. Those people don't just want to sell meta items only, they want a stock that appeals to all types of players and sells to as many people as they can.
---
Also, dupers are using their duped items in trade, for various things, this is not contained to meta items. When you trade something that you duped for something that another player earned you are losing nothing, while they are losing something they actually earned.
---
If you think this is just contained to meta items, then you are not paying close enough attention to what is happening.
---
What about general spawns? Does it still pump out the same amount of ghouls, more or less?
---
1200 hours in and every weapon I have I've had to trade for. But yeah I haven't " earned" anything. That guy is a fucking clown.
---
Oh, them.
---
Can confirm. Equip your camera and look around. Top right it will display the things in view. Move around until you locate
---
I lost out on that already myself lol
---
You shouldn‚Äôt worry about a handful of dropped items.  You should worry about a loot bag full of 5000 bobble heads or nuka colas or large presents.  That‚Äôs dupe city right there. 
---
Back in the day I stumbled across a loot bag at WS with almost 100K worth of stims and cola and no way was I going to take the bait.
---
I'd say the Wastelanders  PA Raider Helmet skin. That alone was worth the money of the bundle. Plus the backpack skin is BA.
---
I had a spate of running lots but have slowed down a bit. Still collecting the nuclear key cards for future use.
---
dupe = cheating and item duplacating glitiching the game which resluts in being banned. 
---
perk selection depends on what weapon you wantot use, if your melle or ranged then 2 handed or rifle , pistol, shotty . ect.
---
Man the legendaries you'd come across just in the inventory of the crafting shop vendor LOL I didn't appreciate it enough back then.
---
its not a popular opinion.. you may lose fake internet points for expressing it.. be careful if that kind of thing means something to you
---
I didnt say me buy personally. I just know how people work.
---
Oh yeah that makes total sense. Good on you to pass the info!
---
No worries!  I never judge people on how they choose to spend their money. I might not agree with it but I‚Äôd never try to tell someone that they can‚Äôt spend their money how they see fit. 
---
I‚Äôll offer a suggestion that might save them some money, but that‚Äôs all it is; just a suggestion.
---
It also has 100% less Enclave stink on it.
---
facts, but people
---
Just go to marketplace 76 and rejoice as we have a victory against the hackers in Duper‚Äôs
---
Personally I just want a silent collectron... already have one annoying person at my house who doesn‚Äôt shut up. 
---
Although I could go for a Red Rocket one that says stuff about engines, the vehicles they had, and fuel etc.
---
To elaborate- log into adventure and then log out. 
---
And then log into adventure before checking atom shop or going into NW
---
I just assume that‚Äôs everyone online
---
It clearly is justifiable, if people are willing to pay for the convenience. Running outside, it took me 2 minutes to pick up all of the ammo I needed, whereas I would have maybe spent 20-minutes or so hopping from camp to camp in the hope they had some 5mm (lots of camps don't carry that)
---
You charge based on convenience. One of my favourite games of all time is FFXI, where you had a 'traveling store'. Wherever you went, your store went with you. You had the ability to charge more for certain items in areas where resources were scarce. I love that idea. I actively promote that idea. Just like setting up a 'shovel store' near the daily quest. Shovels can be quite scarce...so, sell them around there!
---
if you need more ingame help pm me your gt and ill contact you via xbl if you want
---
Your gaming platform has a report function, doesn‚Äôt it?
---
This guy has been spamming every post. He is angry about the dupe and is just yelling at everyone. Google it, this did happen.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to stir the pot, just answering your question honestly. One of them was regarding a texture mod, and I believe the other was some sort of pip boy inventory mod
---
I‚Äôm not saying this is still happening, but it has in the past, and bethesda does have a rep for banning first asking later
---
Also the pumpkin skin is bad ass and looks awesome with the ghillie backpack
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm gonna give that a try.
---
This is such an absurd argument though.  Obviously they are at fault for creating a game with holes and exploits and not fixing them quickly enough.
---
That.  Still.  Does.  Not.  Mean.  You.  Need.  To.  Abuse.  It.
---
I can look at this game and say "wow hey that's a lot of exploits and cheats, it sucks they are in the game but I'm still not going to abuse them."  It's really easy.
---
You want people who cant save money to save atoms? You and I both know they wont be able to, theyll buy random shop stuff
---
Me too.  It's a hard one to love but a hard one to let go. Have a great day and stay safe 7-6.
---
Not everyone is someone that can kill the ISS in two hits dude. Chill. Some people are just in to have fun in a different way, it doesn‚Äôt mean that because they are ‚Äúscrubs‚Äù because they don‚Äôt like being god.
---
Really?? It doesn't need ballistic fiber like everything else
---
Yeah it goes by server, and there's a secret to knowing what servers have a hot whitesprings on them. I was sworn to secrecy by the people who told me, but it's not difficult to figure it out on your own. It's sort of like the well know ramp trick at AWOL armaments.
---
Been getting them off of Blood Eagles and Cultists but yeah def rarer than others so far.  I dunno man the ‚Äúshuckaduka‚Äù sound a silenced combat rifle makes on a hit is pretty satisfying ha
---
Armored backpack is 90DR not 15 I believe
---
Maybe tame a mongrel? I know, it is not Dogmeat but as close as it can get.
---
I mean i guess value is based on owners discretion, it is not worth that to me
---
The only egg you can find is frog egg.
---
But it could give chicken meat, that is already a food item.
---
I believe I‚Äôve seen a similar post before where including absolutely everything you can get to 900-odd. I forget how but it was on here. Good exercise for science but ultimately pointless in practise sadly. 
---
Like most things in this game regarding builds and abilities, once you figure it out it‚Äôs all a waste of time past a certain point. Stuff you can tank at 900 you can tank at 350. Stuff that destroys you regardless, or at least goes through your armour enough to hurt anyway, like assaultrons, gutsies and swarms of super mutants or acid attacks, still does exactly the same at 900 as at 350. 
---
Good concept and system in theory, but it‚Äôs utterly meaningless ultimately, and the points and massive spec into doing it is a waste of time when the best resistance is not getting hit. 
---
Stuff like serendipity, dodgy etc make it all superfluous üòÅ get a full set of one star unyielding with bloodied and you‚Äôre done unless you wanna create your own content and make busy work by trying to roll specific 3 star stuff. 
---
Shame really.
---
The chicken coop only has roosters in it.
---
I know! The train station was always popping too. 
---
If only I would have known, I would have grabbed up the junkies weapons I could. They were considered garbage back then. 
---
Its also how I found a couple armor pieces I still wear today.
---
Thank you, you too!
---
Absolutely not true a majority of players were banned. If you look at Bethesda support and ticket numbers there‚Äôs a lot. A server is usually full every time when I join it and now it has a lot less players.
---
They need to fix the bug with them, but I have no issue destroying everything with my shotgun, if the first shot misses it just takes out whatever is next to what I was shooting at anyway lmao
---
Now you‚Äôve got me wondering if you can blueprint the fast travel mats from workshops...
---
Too bad DR has dimishing returns after around 300-350.. Going beyond that is pointless and only restricts you from better perks and effects.
---
My favorite is these towers. You can easily make it look like your camp is suspended on them.
---
My gf is stationed in and on a train car along a stretch of railroad tracks, and I'm currently stationed in a train yard surrounded by other train cars, right next to a station/vendor.
---
From where I am sitting you sound like the salty one.
---
Jetpack?? I think every time you fall it gets damaged. Even with fall damage pieces
---
I used to farm it so much but unfortunately only ever saw maybe one or two other players there.
---
You know I‚Äôve thought about that too but even that can be flawed and give a lot of false positives. I built my camp right next to a train station and when i don‚Äôt feel like farming lead or I‚Äôm out of acid to break it down, i just go to the vendor right there and buy it. I server hop, buy it, and repeat. To me it‚Äôs easier than fast traveling because after i buy it, i just pull up the social menu and click the next persons name instead of keeping track of which one I‚Äôve been to and which one i haven‚Äôt.
---
Thank you for the list, I will see if I can find safe places to download.
---
Yeah pa has been severely left in the dust in this game. Its a shame since I love it, and still use it on my main. But my alt bloodied commando can sprint for days, carry a ton, gains xp like a mad man, and is just dumb the amount of buffs you get from normal armour
---
They are both worth it. Since you count as a team member, there are no downsides to either mutation so long as you are on a team.
---
Yeah I know I pre-ordered lol just sad it doesn't change
---
Fair enough.
---
Again, smh
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
&gt; There is a dude on here 
---
On reddit or in game? Either way just report the guy, all you can do really.
---
I always ask the question with regards child online safety...
---
'Where are the parents'?
---
I remember thinking anybody who would intentionally get addicted or intentionally have low health must be insane. WHY WOULD YOU when you could just use a two shot LOL 
---
Man they really have done a lot to un-fun the game since launch
---
Maybe. The grill doesn‚Äôt look bad, but the chally costume is an unholy abomination. All I know is I‚Äôm not doing Fasnacht levels of grinding. I can‚Äôt do that again.
---
I like the train idea
---
Awesome, thanks for the input
---
i'll look into it, thanks
---
I was in this morning and no ban for me 
---
I have 15-20 top tier legacy weapons but no duplicates and they were all acquired through drops or trades in my almost 18 months of gameplay. 
---
Are a few of them duped?  Perhaps.  But I‚Äôm not sitting on 50K stimpaks or 15K presents.  I mean, shit like that is a dead giveaway.
---
That‚Äôs really good to know! I figured since you created a ‚Äúteam‚Äù it should count.  But I figured you might need people in the team. But thank you for that.
---
That made me chuckle ü§£
---
Is that the one that just came out?
---
More research needs to be done it seem.
---
No, I'm level 250 and was the highest level on every server I joined.
---
You right I was looking at the level 1 version lols.. seemed a bit low
---
I think most people understand that you're talking about the walker herds at the Greenbrier.
---
I think you need to read the thread again, I'm only replying to the dude with a 2 month Reddit history of asking for shit like someone to put shielded lining on his underamor trying to flex and claim he's better at the event.
---
Not really, most of us know how to play without cheating
---
Leaving your bike unlock doesn't stop criminal's you know :p
---
DOUBLE XP WEEKEND! That ought to catch us up
---
Every spot listed here is popular.
---
i actually do like that skin a lot, but im not always feelin spooky haha.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm just fuckin‚Äô with you for posting the same comment 1200 times.
---
Yep it does lol I want mods like fall out 4 even if they have to sanctioned lol
---
"SMH"
---
It came back a couple of weeks ago I think
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs since issues with vending machines the last few months.  I mean, duping thousands of presents or rare plans it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous.
---
I could have sworn they were made untamable recently.
---
Yes. Why restart? You can have four alts. .., or was it five?
---
Just letting you know that most of the dupers were giving godroll weapons away or selling them in a vendor for like one or two thousand so that they could keep giving back to the community. Not to mention the fact that now BE Gat Plasmas aren't on ebay for 500 dollars.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt her headaches have stopped by now?
---
Im having servers with less players in the last week or two. The ban wave is not the problem. The problem is people getting tired of the legendary run and people being annoying about "Im not the only one, see, now the servers are empty because everyone was duping."
---
Those weekly challenge I had done in a one session I think if you complete them all they should refresh automatically
---
yes im a clown for not being a being what is essentially a cheater. you know its cause of bloodied builds that we dont have survival mode. you guys ruined it for the rest of us.
---
I have a BFFR25 Fixer, a BFFR25 Handmade, a BE90 Gatling Plasma, a BE90 Flamer and a BE15 Dragon. I never duped a thing and thus I was not banned, clearly they haven't targeted people just because of their weapons.
---
I might have it, I've got a few but never use PA so I'm not sure.
---
Maybe they are mutated chicken frogs...
---
me.. not them..
---
and I havent posted that since prior to midnight yesterday.. because thats when the currently active "today" ended
---
But it doesn't mean the bike is free to take!
---
This is correct. If you're going to buy levels do it as late as possible, not as soon as possible.
---
Let me quickly go add that to the list of games that were surely going to kill 76 when they released.
---
Ok. So im gling to sound like a dick.
---
All ammo is now useful because of ammo converter.
---
All ammo is useful (on xbox) because lots of new players don't know their value so they will happily buy 10mm ammo for 1 cap each.
---
All plans are useful (on xbox) because people can now sell them to new players even if its for 1 cap each.
---
they are trolling me about something I said multiple times yesterday.. I guess you could say.. they were a little salty about it.. lol
---
I have 1... bloodied too....
---
Best roll... weight 0.60
---
Golden rule  of the internet.
---
If you meet a girl online add 10 year, 10 Kgs and a Penis.
---
Yea I can understand that, Sometimes it feel like Fallout 4 is so hard to play with out a few mods..
---
Wah wah wah. *plays worlds smallest violin*
---
Not doubting the influx of duped one shotters but I've yet to actually experience this. 6 Queen runs yesterday, all fights done within \~10 minutes with the exception of the one with a lot of fence sitters. That took ages because these dolts don't understand how to fight her.
---
Or find Legacies in vendors, for that matter. And it certainly wasn't for a lack of trying. I'm constantly going to player camps to look for rare plans and while I'm there I look at everything that's on the menu. I'm beginning to wonder if this is something that only happens during certain times of the day.
---
It's a pain, but I made a spiral staircase out of the lowest coffee table. It looks pretty good imo. Just threw the stairs out back to hold the floor up
---
I'm a 15 yo primordial soup, can confirm.
---
Oh...thank you.  That explains it well.  I haven't gone into the market/trading stuff...well other then just porting to player vendor camps that is...which I understand is not the same thing at all.  Appreciate the response and info!
---
Right, this is all about what you find more useful for your build, really.  If you're a Heavy, it makes sense to side with the Raiders because they've got the heavy gear.
---
The Settlers have the Shotgun... and that's pretty much the only worthwhile thing, unless you count throwing poop grenades at people.
---
I‚Äôm more pissed it took them like 2 months to fix the vending machines.  The duping problem has been around since the game was introduced.  It will be back soon enough.
---
Yeah it is
---
People have conscience. They are just trying to make themselves feel better for getting caught and banned after months in game. Basic psychology, denial.
---
I like new car scent.. and vanilla
---
Power armor feels so clunky to me. I used to always carry a set of PA but now carry a set of chinese stealth armor for rad zones. So many benefits to a non-PA way of life. Weight reduction is huge - eg weapon weight reduction, backpacks, pockets! Nimbleness too-  unyielding boosts everything from agility to charisma and intelligence and secret service armor rivals some power armor for DR!
---
"officer I do not know where this duffel-bag of unmarked 20s came from but I swear I am on my way to donate it to underprivileged gamers."
---
So, you would gladly take something labelled as 'Free for Newbies' because you want to profit from it? (from said newbies)
---
Spiral stairs are pretty annoying. I had some for years. Especially bad when drunk.
---
Tbh you probably arent going to make good long term friendships or relationships built on a video game so I wouldn't worry.
---
i check the reddit everyday.  i have seen no posts of people clamoring to spend more money on this game to up their C.H.O.R.E.S.
---
i have seen, every other post, about auto-completing and not being awarded points, however.
---
well-said.
---
You're welcome. Always glad to help.
---
It comes with 2 options - one for chems and alcohol and the other for guns and ammo. It's not super annoying like the fasnacht one, it just says some raidery things.
---
Seems to be common theme people who play NW are effected
---
Supply 3 energy units to the prefab. The power couple ia in top left side looking from outside.
---
While I have many top tier weapons and armor combos, I do enjoy seeking out harder to find items.
---
This! Please share some examples!
---
They should just have a model for them.. I have my base on a cliff side would like to use both the upper and lower half.
---
I agree with OP. I‚Äôve paid a few caps for ammo for a few reasons. 1. Convenience. 2. Have too many caps. 3. Am a friendly player that likes to stimulate the economy. Caps are easy enough to come by, why not help others out from time to time?
---
Something like this?

Exactly, they cant have us playing forever with zero content and the few things we have to do being non rewarding activities.

It's On 76. Tried reporting several times to Xbox and Bethesda, nothing done. No one cares, till it's them or someone they care about that has to deal with it.

Behemoth at abandoned bog town.. I don't think night crawlers do though.
---
Doesn't matter, even if you can rename them, the custom name only shows up for you not for others.
---
Agree and disagree...on one hand I think these people are inherently ruining the experience for themselves one way or another whether they acknowledge it or not but I have never seen a company in all my years of gaming and keeping in mind I ran a channel on YouTube dedicated to glitching for years be so inadequate in their ability to code a game and not have seen these glitches in advance, the methods they come up with should have been seen from a mile away. I‚Äôve also never seen people be banned as much on a game that isn‚Äôt inherently pvp....I think Bethesda needs to take more of the responsibility here instead of just banning everyone
---
Do you have any idea how little that narrows it down
---
Oki but what about the raiders daily quest? Where you quick cancel the quest but still get rep.
---
Go to one of the Possum/Tarpole vending machines to see the various mods. Then take a moment to fix a strong drink, take a deap breath, and look at what it takes to get those badges in world challanges. 
---
They also sell some mods for gold now.
---
Bloodied 25% Fire Rate 25% AP Cost, it's the legendary prefix but typically when people refer to it they mean Handmade or The Fixer varients as they are the most desirable.

Yep, they should‚Äôve, but she still complains about them on occasion.
---
Shhhh... let them forget and keep paying!
---
Thank you! I can share a 1 point card. Trying to figure not which is best for genetic public building teams.

If your targets are all separated, sure. But if they‚Äôre in a group, you‚Äôre just fucking yourself with the AoE.

You and your son are driving at night and find a dead guy in a truck full of cash . What lesson do you teach your son ?

Totally am, meant to fuck with the other guy.  Sorry bout that.  :)
---
For me, it is the best one yet. Other ones have been kinda meh. The amount of ammo/chems it finds is quite nice. But random types ofc.
---
For the same reason half of society is buried in high interest debt.
---
They can't wait and need it NOW.
---
Nice job! The nostalgia! 
---
...We need cash registers in the CAMP build menu!
---
I don‚Äôt favor taking things away from people who legitimately acquired them. For example, I don‚Äôt have any legacy weapons but I have several weapons earned from the old Survival mode reward pool: Resolute Veteran, Sole Survivor, Action Hero, Mechanic‚Äôs Friend, etc. Not godlike, but good legendaries. They‚Äôre collector pieces now. Someone could argue these should be taken away as well for fairness‚Äô sake, since they aren‚Äôt in the current loot pool, but if Bethesda felt that action be taken, I would much rather they be made untradeable like gold bullion items or reintroduced as bullion or event rewards for others to earn. If a legacy weapon has an en effect people deem too OP, then just nerf the effect during events or something. Fairness is a two way street.
---
4 things.
---
\- Daily quest. Kill the raider and select appalchia has a new corpse./ Vacum tubes pro bono.
---
\- Photo quest at overseers house. Give photos to raiders.
---
\- [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ohio\_River\_Adventures](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ohio_River_Adventures) \- A small defence quest. (Dialogue is somewhat bugged so keep trying.) Give Blackeye there 10 mirelurk meats every day. 1 Queen meat piece if you can handle a queen.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs solid. If you gonna be unarmed I‚Äôd use iron fist over gladiator. Ironclad is good perk, you have to waste 5 perk spots to get only 50 DMG resist, I‚Äôd personally like damage avoidance perk because percentages in this game are weirdly calculated. Almost anything that says 75% of something means around 90 to 99 percent of the time.
---
Do you have the healing factor mutation? I got rid of mine this morning (after 8 attempts when I had 9 mutations, yuck!) but since removing I haven't had the FT bug once and it's been SO much less frustrating
---
Some glitches are simply too useful to report. Or even to list here because some twat will go out of their way to report them. Or even worse, some 200-sub clown will post a vid on youtube or twitch so they can make an extra 20 cents in ad revenue or w/e and ruin things for everyone. If you know of one that is handy but not in common circulation, then *keep it to yourself.*
---
On the other hand, while i have not personally encountered anything gamebreaking. I would happily report them if there was a convenient way to do so.
---
Oh, true that!
---
The low health was the hardest part for me.  Hearing my heartbeat was always a panic mode followed by spamming stims.  Now I have to remind myself that it's just the build doing its job. I have to let serendipity and nerd rage do their job.
---
I got it last night and I enjoy it just for the comments he says lol.
---
Haha thats a good one xD
---
Not trying to make friends, trying to get rid of the freaks but no one seems to care. There should be groups on the game dedicated to weeding these sickos out. If it's becoming seen as normal then that's messed up
---
This is a reddit argument, it‚Äôs low effort. I‚Äôm not going to strain myself to get you to beleive me. If I wanted to argue with sources and evidence and shit ide become a lawyer.
---
I got it last night and I enjoy it just for the comments it makes.
---
I was a power armor user since the game launched. Several months ago I finally got a full set of combat armor with unyielding. 
---
I got a few bloodied weapons and rarely use PA anymore. It seems I only use excavator with lucky hole mine.
---
For me that's too 'clean' sounding for Fallout. For me, things in Fallout-world should be dirty and rusty and held together with chewing gum and bailing wire and they should sound like it too. Maybe the other thing is more satisfying to you, and that's fine. Don't worry too much about which thing is best but which thing gets the job done and 'sparks joy' while doing it.
---
Exactly. It hard to know unless you have done enough research. 
---
And no, PA doesn't have Legendary stats yet. The modules allow you to craft the Strangler heart and T65 PA, along with Solar Armor and Thirns requiring it too.
---
The new bullion items that are weapons or armor also require Legendary Modules. Armor takes one and weapons take two.
---
Don‚Äôt they have to refund you the full amount if you don‚Äôt get to use all of your subscription...which would make banning 80% of the community really bad for them
---
I‚Äôve only gotten the Ohio defense to trigger once.  Not sure why but it won‚Äôt instance again.  No issue turning in mirelurk meat so idk
---
Just an opinion - maybe we should title the daily reminder posts in a way that constantly prompts Bethesda to fix their shit?  Like, instead of "daily reminder to log out before reset!", maybe we should say "Day 25: reminder to log out to AVOID THE HIDEOUS GAME BREAKING BUG STILL IN SCORE SYSTEM"?
---
Maybe it might make a point?  I dunno.
---
From the auto cache quest...
---
I have some... mmm 1k each....
---
I'd be ok with any addition to encourage alts. Shared container that doesn't depend on server stability. Fast track experience up to level 50. Shared plans or anything really. At least the double experience weekends seem relatively common. Just looking at the reputation and gold grind is discouraging, having to go through all that again.
---
yeah.. if a (former)player is banned.. and they know its not going to be overturned because theyre a fucking cheater.. that bethesda couldnt legally charge for next months subscription anyway.. they should definitely turn off their FO1st sub...
---
I think the player base is diluted from game pass. Less vendors and high level players makes it seem empty.
---
I bet more than 50 pct of FO76 players had no idea about the duping going down. Maybe more if you don't watch YouTube or browse reddit.
---
It‚Äôs not guaranteed to spawn in their inventory. It‚Äôs actually kinda rare.
---
I have about 230k steel.  (It's a sickness.)  Not banned.
---
And also join public teams!
---
Me personally wouldn't take any unless I needed something like a fusion core.
---
But due to the fact I've got 70 fusion cores I would just look at the stuff than move along to where I'm travelling to.
---
Big bonus now for the handmade is how damn fast the Armco machine currently produces 5.56.  Ended up stashing my fixer because of this.  If you are just doing dailies and stuff you can use your handmade for everything and watch your ammo count go up instead of down as long as you stop back to empty the machine once in a while.  I haven't had to craft any rifle ammo in nearly a week because of this.
---
Don't forget packing the registers and ice coolers with thousands of pounds of legendaries hoping someone would find one they would use. I remember selling legendaries to the vendor just for daily caps. The good old days, I miss them. I've got a few friends I've been playing with since the beginning because of Whitespring nukes and area chat.
---
Wierd it has a line about Jet when its not even in the game for lore reasons but not dealbreaker ig.
---
I totally approve !!! üò†
---
Good job man! Looks like something you could actually Come across in game. Wich is challenging to do
---
I thought I was going to get mine last night. Made it all the way to #3 and got caught in the storm.
---
For completeness, don't forget Strange in Numbers Perk which boosts the mutations 25% while in a group with another mutant.  Very easy to achieve now with public groups.
---
Not good, Sorry.
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong. However, if I locked the processor and posted up inviting a pvp match that one thing.  OR I‚Äôd just go play Nuclear Winter. That‚Äôs the intended pvp experience and I would expect no less. But that‚Äôs NOT what‚Äôs happening. Like I said, when you go EXCEEDINGLY out of your way to broadcast that you aren‚Äôt looking for pvp because you just want a steady supply of cores(gat lazer ammo ain‚Äôt cheap to just make yo!) and they do it  INTENTIONALLY just for spite and act like spoiled brat douches at you when you confront them about it, THATS the problem here. The pvp system breeds and encourages bullying and poor sportsmanship  and needs to be recalibrated to let people that just need ammo opt out make it a fair fight and not so outlandishly lopsided at the very least.  OR even just make cores not so stupidly expensive to make at home. ‚ÄúGit gud‚Äù is no  excuse for what‚Äôs happening now. It‚Äôs just bullshit justification for cowardly playstyles, poor sportsmen, and shitty attitudes.
---
I bought them last week, my friend bought them yesterday
---
You can have 5 total. I wish it was more.
---
So you shouldnt ever buy or accept free items ever? This sounds like bethesdas fault not people just playing the game.

I get the sentiment but in my experience with Gamebryo, bugs usually have cascading effects in this engine and are hence, in my opinion worth trying to iron out even if they can be beneficial.
---
Might patch an xp exploit and magically reduce load times by a second and fix 7 other bugs unintentionally, you never know with Gamebryo üòÇ
---
Glad I grabbed the astroturf before it closed then
---
They made it so you can't easily stack them like you could before, but there's still about six other ways to do it that they didn't patch because they didn't know about them (most people don't so lets keep it that way).
---
They dont have to. But I guess its what country you live in. I live in Australia and if I get banned I can get a refund for my game and anything else including all the fo1st subscriptions I've done.
---
A guy dropped a nuke into the circle so i ate some RadX and killed the last 2 guys
---
Exactly. I'm actually really glad it didn't end this way
---
Lmao, whine about people sacrificing 90% of their health because they want more damage. Guess what dipshit, the reason survival mode died was because you foodbuild crybabies couldn't take on PvPers. We stayed in the PvP mode, you guys knew for a goddamn fact that we'd all be there and you still went on for PvP.
---
Oh and about the Bloodied Builds, I as a Bloodied Build am sacrificing like 85 to 90% of my health, while a junkies build who does reasonably the same damage output usually has full health and is popping buffouts among other chems, as well as spamming duped Nuka-Cola Quantums for PvP.
---
Also, about halfway through Survival modes lifespan, a 110 PvP max damage cap was but in place, only to be nerfed even farther down to like 75 damage. So all that damage us Bloodied Builds were putting out, was nerfed to only 10% of what our weapons were doing PvE wise.
---
Finally, I bet a numbskull like you has no idea that in PvP even before the Sentinel nerf, Bloodied were still hella squishy.
---
But yeah, call someone playing smart a cheater cause you can't handle that people are somehow better than you in a game that takes no skill. Not to mention you obviously have no fucking clue about the past PvP and PvE metas and patches that fixed certain things and made certain things worse.
---
I don't believe they have to, as the ToS were broken. The monthly subscribers should probably have the payments stopped, but the difficulty is the subscription is paid to Sony/Microsoft rather than direct to Bethesda.
---
Scrap bot still produces the components for making ammo.  Not sure how this is better to get some ammo in return.  I‚Äôd imagine for low level player getting the weapons to scrap for mods would be useful. I think I‚Äôll pass as having all the other collections and I keep going back to scrap every time
---
I've found mine on Graham
---
Thank you! if you need a revive for the swimming badge..happy to help you with it!
---
Yeah, I was saving them from all of my runs. Decided to throw them on the vendor as a joke. Didn't expect anyone to actually buy them.
---
I've done the dailies every day since the start and I barely got the blood eagles icon. I keep seeing people talking about the big sheepaquatch plushie....am I just not grinding hard enough?

It's too bad nuking that place puts them in Hazmat suits instead of under ground...

Depends on what's in your that you use. I share Inspirational 1, everyone gets an XP boost. Weight reduction Perks are good too, Thru-Hiker, Bandolier, Traveling Pharmacy. Hell, if you keep Hacking and Lockpicking cards in your loadout all the time, share one. Sharing anything is great.
---
I was making a joke about the fact that lots and lots of people have subscriptions they've forgotten about and no longer use. Big problem in this country, bogles my mind every time I hear about it because it's not something I would forget about.
---
Holy shit lol.  Wow.   So discouraging the trade of duped gear is bad for the economy huh? Yeah. Okay.

How is this not basically lootboxs?
---
I was hoping it would land me a job too... I've got the resume and shower.
---
As someone with two legacys i can tell you that i am in fact incapable of insta killing the queen you have to be using a really strong loadout to be pulling that much damage so the average joe build having a high powered legacy will make a significant difference just not that big of a difference.
---
Yeah, what he did wasn‚Äôt good, but It doesn‚Äôt mean you need to pay back. I didn‚Äôt have shielded lining underarmor until 2 weeks ago. Not everyone moves at the same pace.

How much ammo does it usually pull in? Just a few rounds or like 20+?

I chased them for a good week before I was finally able to acquire them.
---
I suspect you're in quite a small minority there then, not to mention the fact that Beth clearly encourages trading since they introduced vending machines after all.
---
that's a pretty sweet list..
---
i do love my commie bot tho..
---
It depends on how they track inventories. If its just a variable in an array, then yes, theres no way to tell original from dupe. If however, item inventories are stored in some other database type formats, it is possible to check the date on which an item was added to an inventory.
---
I found the exact same thing but it was at sutton station in a trash bin and a cooler
---
And honestly all they have to do is add another star lol
---
tbh, i don't get why this isn't a setting. they could just stick the option in the terminal.
---
Yeah, not enough that you can reliably farm just any one type. I used to leave my collectron unlocked collecting scrap but I'll probably leave it on guns and ammo now for people who visit to restock.
---
What‚Äôs the absurd argument? I haven‚Äôt even mentioned my opinion of the dupers, just the fact that it is not their fault that the game has exploits. Don‚Äôt demonize people who both paid for the game, and enjoyed it. Everyone here shares something in common, that gets lost in the heat of people being angry over something that may or may not affect them. 
---
It‚Äôs easy to cast blame but the reality is the game has been unstable since launch, they have taken advice from other gaming companies and emulated things that work, and none of those have to do with the actions of the minority. 
---
Shoot everyone got banned yesterday, I‚Äôm playing right now and the servers suck as much as they did any other day.
---
I haven't even seen the option to buy ranks and I think that is what people are mostly talking about. I agree with you in terms of waiting until the last week.
---
Hey if these impatient people can allow Bethesda to hire one competent developer to actually fix some base underlying issues, I am all for it. I will happily cheer these people on, while I just  plod along. I don't need to be the first kid on the block with a specific skin.

The most duped weapons are Fixers and Handmades.

Have a bear arm and grognaks so not going unarmed. Thanks will try it out tonight and see!
---
I'll leave it running for a while today collecting chems and see if any turn up.
---
I saw a level 450 a few minutes ago
---
Bloodied sneak commando imo
---
If you buy the raider you can have the commie collect raider items.
---
From my experiences, public team members can not build in your base or workshop. Even if they are on your friends list, if it is a public team it wont work.
---
I use Better Inventory. Easy to instal and remove.  Really clean. Everything broken down. I also use re-textures by Rigell on Fallout 76 Nexus. I would like to use the perk manager yet I always have no luck with programs that may need updating.
---
Thanks so much for the details!  That was awesome! I have never gone on to see what things should be listed at.  I have only been marking my legendary weapons or armors for what I feel the traits are worth (at least in my mind) and I also don't want to hold onto items forever.  So it is usually only marked up double or triple what the suggested prices are (so usually between 800 to 2000 caps).  
---
However most of plans on the other hand, are often discounted lower then the recommended price, unless it seems very rare and desirable.  But even then it is usually on par with the prices I saw at other random vendors or even a bit less.  I like giving discounts and have also been known to drop items for new or low level players too.
---
Sorry for the long response.  Thanks again.  I will look into that market link.
---
Why am I not at all surprised that Bethesda can't fix a bug.
---
Hell no
---
If they wiped everything that would be me done with this game, and any future multiplayer games that bethesda directly have a hand in
---
Dupers need to punished, but wiping away the hard work of all legit players is just too far
---
This isnt rust where it makes sense to wipe servers, theres wayyy too much rng and grinding in this game to ever justify wipes
---
Really? Why only use rank 1 commando perks? This is the first time I hear this.
---
i understand how that would fix things, but i would be so sad to lose all my progress... i'm only around level 53 but i feel like it took a lot of time and effort and i'm not sure i'd have the patience to do it again, if i lost it all.
---
Do you by any chance have a guide for that ? Im not that far into perc crafting etc. Just yesterday realized that you can buy serum recipes and serums.
---
Because Beth is well known for handling all things FO76 perfectly..
---
The whole thing works so well it would be impossible that unwarranted bans are happening too
---
I would stop playing the game if all my progress got wiped out. I've never duped anything or exploited glitches. I've got 4 characters, only 1 of them has gone all the way through the Rep grind, another one is barely doing any rep, one of the other characters has never even met the two people at the Vault.  
---
I have zero interest in going through that rep grind ever again. People who play the game and aren't duping or exploiting it regularly, shouldn't be forced to pay such a cost because of those who do these things. The mere proposition of this is abhorrent, I'd put this game down and never pick it up again.
---
How many people are left now anyway. I feel like bethesda will reverse bans on consistant buyers giving them money like they have in other games so they dont lose the cash flow.
---
Haven‚Äôt thought about it that way tbh ü§î
---
I've had one additional phrase on mine! If you walk in front of it/block it's path, it will rather bluntly tell you to move out of the way. I can't remember the exact phrasing, but it makes me crack up everytime!
---
I‚Äôve been running junkies, but I don‚Äôt like wearing armour as I like being squishy, and I‚Äôve hit the logic point now that whilst I currently rock full health, everything kills me quick anyway when my stealth is broken so I‚Äôm looking for a good bloodied weapon so I can make the leap to bloodied.
---

---
Yes multiple stuff to replace ironclad with, take a look at mine. Armor is so important but it‚Äôs so hard to get your hands on a complete set like that, if you get then you‚Äôve basically become god. And, the BEAR ARM weapon does count as unarmed.
---
That's a better plan just add another star and make top tier gear level 55 and 60 and boom all the stuff is worthless now.
---
Im so disappointed in the way PA has been handled ive been seriously thinking of switching. Some legendary power armor parts wld make up for this though.
---
"It wasn't me, it was my little brother"
---
I bought them a few days ago. I had to server hope a few times before finding them.
---
This has nothing to do with legacies.  You can still get bloodied power attack DCG in game.  You just need the right build and to know which foods/drugs you need.
---
There isn't a " best build in the game" really it's all personal preference but if you're looking for highest possible damage bloodied is your go to (if that's your thing, I've been running bloodied for about 2 months now and absolutely love it) but all your damage comes from what perks you pick and how you stack them.
---
Next week, new dupe, the cycle repeats.
---
Now that's pretty dope, thanks for the info!
---
I'd honestly stop playing. Not to sound whiny or anything, but I've sunk too many hours in that if they wiped it they'd some VERY worthwhile content added to bring me back. I only just started a second toon after about 600 hours, one reason being to side with Raiders for the one achievement I'm missing. Most of the time I play to get my dailies in, do my SCORE, and then I get sidetracked and play longer than usual. If they wiped my character, I wouldn't put the effort in to start over and would move on to another game.
---
I have been trying to explain this to two of my friends that are begging the buy option to go live. I‚Äôm like ‚Äú bros, if you buy now all the score you‚Äôre still going to get from now till the end will be useless. Save till the last couple of days and then if it looks like you‚Äôre not going to make it buy what you need ‚Äú. You‚Äôd think I was speaking Ancient Greek or something.
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks for the info though, I wish the atom had a lot more details on what you were buying.
---
Same. I use a couple of accounts to kinda get around this but then there's the issue of ATX etc. I wouldn't  even mind if they took the ESO approach and let you buy character slots.
---
No, it'd be pointless. There will always be another dup glitch. This game is a broken mess made out of dollar store glue and popsicle sticks.
---
Same. A level 100 something came to my house and dropped off nearly 50 each of most of the mounted head plans. I kept a few of them and have since sold some extras in my vendors
---
Edit: am able to log in, thank goodness
---
You can still stack them using a couple other tricks, so it hasn't really stopped them
---
You darn well should be IMO. 
---
You knew perfectly well what you were doing.  Dont try and play dumb.
---
You still get Milk...Chicken Milk mmmm
---
NW inferno power armor. or xo death rider power armor.
---
Agree.  I have exactly 1 major alt (and a few minor ones) and I refuse to do all that crap again just for a slightly better backpack that just gets unequipped in power armor anyways.
---
I just use the small backpack with its skins, and live with it.
---
People have a choice, and those who participated in duping made the wrong one.  If they hadn‚Äôt been caught they‚Äôd never be complaining.  What‚Äôs funny, is people seemed very complacent about duping ‚Äúif Fred does it, why not me‚Äù.   It was way obvious how out of control it was when you go to the marketplace and every single listing on PS4 was for a b2525.  Not sure if this dupe was as prevalent on PC?  Either way.  Point is, people made a choice, and now those people need to own up and pay the consequences of their actions.  Regardless of Bethesda‚Äôs inability to fix their coding issues, people knowingly decided to go against the ToS and dupe.  
---
GTAV online is a good example of another game where people glitch/cheat online all the time in public sessions.  There isn‚Äôt anything preventing you from doing so, but it still isn‚Äôt a legitimate practice.  Rockstar attempts to combat it, but it‚Äôs still a major issue.  Do I blame them for the exploits?   Well, I can blame them for shoddy coding, but I blame the user base for exploiting it when they have a choice.
---
Yes you can cure them
---
Shit man, you should start the Gun Runners. Thanks for the counter-evidence too!
---
You wake up in the morning, your paint's peeling, your curtains are gone, and the water is boiling. Which problem do you deal with first?  
---
**None! Your house is on fire!**
---
Addressing a symptom won't fix the root cause:  
---
Crappy development is *still* crappy development.
---
There is a small subset of people who bought duped items who didn't know and got banned, a small subset.
---
See Trasimer‚Äôs reply to my previous comment.
---
Yeah there's a few more lines like that when you actually interact with it but most are pretty generic. That's a good one though lol.
---
I built one of these last week and had a hard time even figuring out how to use it effectively.   Mine seemed to miss VATS shots 100% of the time, but I found that I could do a decent amount of damage just by tapping the trigger.  The only trouble with that was that maybe 10-20% of the damage that it was generating was affecting me.  Between that and the fact that I ran through 100 rounds in mere minutes prompted me to scrip it.  I had high hopes for it, too, but i guess it's jut not for me.
---
Same thing happens with rocket launcher with tracking mod
---
Ok, all guides that ive been reading are pretty hard to get for a newcomer. Is there a way to reroll legendary stats ? If so, how does it work ?
---
I know that you can get mutation serums via MODUS but im at a complete loss how to recreate the builds
---
Yep, had this happen at a workshop and my camp at one point. He destroyed the resource centres, generators, and turrets at the workshop and then moved on to destroying my camp which was across from the workshop. My camp turrets didn't even shoot at him or chally!
---
This is so dumb. Just because others have weapons, presents, and stim packs? Yeah, let‚Äôs reset every single players progress completely so some kids aren‚Äôt so jealous anymore.
---
Sorry i didnt mean to reply to your comment im kinda new to reddit so im still figuring it out
---
What's formula P?
---
We won‚Äôt be taking him up on that
---
I'm sure most people who've been around since the beginning (and haven't quit already) would most certainly quit if they did a wipe.
---
The main story has no replay value because you can't make choices. The wastelanders questline is maaaybe replayable once, but that's a stretch.
---
Imagining collecting all those plans, gear, the junk stockpile I've built up...no, just no.
---
I would quit and never look back.
---
Feels like actual Scorched Earth, dragging everyone down with you. 
---
You could just remove all 3 star weapons, armor and treasure pails from the game. Even then, that'd still be something I disagree with more than I agree with.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with this. I level 2 to 3 times a day naturally with the public team system giving so much extra Xp. I‚Äôm 2700 hours in rank 554 and I don‚Äôt go out of my way except the nuclear winter score. So it can be don‚Äôt fine just playing naturally.
---
Usually server hopping is the fastest way to find them.
---
Bethesda could offer new-player-only servers that you can join and progress only with a brand new character
---
There‚Äôs things to work out so that you couldn‚Äôt mull stuff from your old character to your new character.  But this way you can play the existing game with existing character and try it fresh again with a new character (and be with new players).
---
a wipe would be bad news..
---
I would be in favor of making legacy items untradeable.. like they should have done when they originally removed them from the loot pool
---
also MOAR bans.. frequent bans.. perma bans..
---
they should take a page out of the duper book.. like when they "release" a dupe right before a big event.. and drop another huge ban wave on a friday or the day before new content drops just to troll cheaters in that same way..
---
Grahm*
---
Ah didn‚Äôt know that, thought it was melee. Do I need fireproof? Usually have dense mod on my Chest piece
---
Which sucks cause they already nerfed it, the enemies used to be all super mutants
---
Even if they don‚Äôt have to refund everyone that‚Äôs still money they‚Äôre losing by banning people, especially so many
---
A wipe is an ensure way to hit any kind of dupe goodies left but what about the legit players? Either way dupers will find a way to dupe
---
I normally close the entire game and wait at least 5 minutes after reset to go back and play. I haven't had any auto-complete using this method yet. Sorry that this happened to you it's pretty sucky that Bethesda hasn't fixed this yet.
---
As someone who plays 4 accounts and pays for 2 FO1st, a wipe feels like I would absolutely leave this game and never look back.
---
No stims? Darn. 
---
Just curious, anyone know if the weapons scale?
---
they haven't and won't ban those who pickup/buy any duped item. since they can claim they found it. and anyone who says they were baned just for doing so is a lier. they only ban the dupers, not the person who has the item. those claiming they were baned just for picking up one is just trying to save face. ive been playing since day 1. and they have never banned anyone for picking up anything.
---
Rubberbanding is basically the FO76 version of Morrowinds Mark and Recall. 
---
Give me the CK, I'll take a look. ;)
---
The first levle up doesnt count it seems.
---
but i didn't dupe i just knowingly had 50 duped weapons that my friends gave me to hold T\_T
---
&gt;*Why are anti dupers crying about dupers crying*
---
Well I never duped nor did I get anything from a Duper, and I was not banned so there is that.
---
I don‚Äôt appreciate getting melted from someone‚Äôs 50 cal or shotgun after I light them up and hit direct shots about 20 times but besides that it‚Äôs all right as long as you got a decent team
---
Why are you crying? Go on about your day. How are words on an Internet forum causing you to be so upset? 
---
I hope you are as  passionate about the problems happening in our society, as you are about people enjoying a video game differently than you, and using a forum to speak.
---
It wouldn't fix anything. Whenever Bethesda updates the game, they fuck up and either introduce a new exploit people find pretty quick or they reintroduce an old one that they "fixed".
---
This problem will keep happening over and over, because the team working on it is too small. If they work on content they can't fix bugs. If they fix bugs, they can't work on content.
---
i know a guy that is 957 and a few that is  734
---
I have seen so many people that were banned say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my fault the game was broken‚Äù 
---
But it is your fault that you agreed to the TOS and then broke that agreement by cheating. They made their beds. Those of us who didn‚Äôt dupe or use the exploit get to keep playing and hear how much the banned people ‚Äúhate the game‚Äù or were ‚Äústarting to get sick of it anyways‚Äù.
---
ok but i dont play games to do chore lists like creating a new character everyday and leveling up to level 3, yes its fast, but its also not fun. Not fun doesnt go well with video games.
---
I don't care, I'm not here to make friends but I'm nice to people that aren't being wankers or just crying because they don't understand how to play. You try and flex when you're not on my level and I'm going to shit on you.
---
I was going to use ramen and super glue
---
It‚Äôs totally up to you, Fireproof at max basically means you can stand still and have 2 scorchbeast flame attack u and u don‚Äôt take any damage [it only works if you wear armor]. I do Queen fights so I like that about fireproof, you can test how good does Dense Mod do against Flame Attacks, I know dense mod works really good on explosions.
---
claim a worskshop
---
complete an event
---
complete 5 daily challenges
---
kill a legendary enemy
---
level up
---
NW: kill a player
---
pick a lock
---
plant 10 crops
---
use photomode
---
I‚Äôd quit the game.
---
Yeah I'm not seeing many dupers posting complaints here...
---
I'll get almost none, honestly, as I can go hours without killing much, am INT 1 on my main, and can go days to a week or so without even logging on. I'm not sure advancing 600 Score in eight-nine weeks makes much difference in the long run. People really underestimate how little you can engage with the gameplay loop if you are largely a roleplayer with interest that take you away from the games for days or a week at a time.
---
I feel the same way too. I absolutely love power armor, one of the best things about Fallout imo. I love collecting them but well I am a bloodied commando and PA just don‚Äôt offer what an unyielding commando can do in terms of damage and efficiency
---
Did you play NW before
---
The reset? Did you access the atomic shop before logging into adventure?
---
Dense works fine for me on my other toons so will go with that probably. Thank!
---
Good move ü§£
---
Ok thanks
---
There isn't a way to "reroll legendaries" it's just  luck/grinding for the perfect "God roll" for your weapon. Build wise is there anything you are looking to go for? Commando perks are for Assault rifles, 10mm SMG and .45 SMG rifleman perks are non-automatics like hunting rifle lever action Shotgun perks are self explanatory.
---
No thanks.
---
I saw it this morning when I was at Whitesprings being the person I complain about buying all the steel and lead for a change, muwahaha.
---
Classy reply... do your knuckles bleed when you walk? 
---
Bloodied isn‚Äôt as easy as you think, clearly you haven‚Äôt experienced it first hand. Whilst that doesn‚Äôt make your opinion invalid, it is ill informed. 
---
Bloodied commando builds tend to be lazy but melee is in the thick of the action and the game increases strength with radiation, so it is ideal for Bloodied... but I also carry a 10mm to use at events so I don‚Äôt kill mobs with one shot / hit. 
---
Not everyone running this build is as bad as you think and sneak is more op than Bloodied as it can be utilised with no health penalty...
---
My weapons were max level, maybe someone under 50 can chime in. It's all pretty common stuff though so a low level could just use them for mods and find one they can equip pretty easily.
---
Np hope that helps! Cheers
---
Power armor wasnt fallout for me. For me it is the mixed of post-apocalyptic 1950s, retro futurism. PA is waste carry weight in chastity, parts and cores. Even, now, i get better damage and rad resistance without PA.
---
First stash all unlocked plans from all characters into account-bound list. Then wipe, but keeping all the unlocked plans. That would be great.
---
Yeah but then you‚Äôre stuck with the massive disadvantage of going against full teams of four, which is why we need a solo mode already
---
you spelled "laughing at" wrong..
---
Played since beta. Would 100% quit with a full wipe. They should just handle legacy weapons and remove presents/pails.
---
Haha omg that‚Äôs so funny lol
---
Also you you look in player vendors you can usually find serums cheap (75caps up to 500caps)
---
Is the garage door included with the Prefab Building?
---
Oh? I wasn't aware they nerfed it. As it was crappy from the start in my experience.
---
Ok gotcha.
---
Id like to use an automated weapon, so aussault rifles. Any perc tips for that ?
---
That's what I was thinking about. The communist one (from what I've heard) collects weapons slowly, so it would be nice to get some leveling weapons from the collectron.
---
Except unless they already glitched out their score and are maxed rank
---
Only saw them for 2000-3000 caps, guess ill grind money to get the recipes or buy them from MODUS
---
&gt;it just works
---
*~Todd Howard*
---
For notes I would put them on as cheap as 30% of the quoted value, as long as you already know them you generally just want to shift them as they start to add up in weight. Some of the notes are still worth a lot, things like Jet Packs and such, can still get a decent portion of the quoted price but most notes never make the full quoted value.
---
You are welcome, I hope it comes in helpful for you, happy hunting!
---
If you have a vending machine and thus visible anyone with the resources can repair the damage. My friends and I do repairs on others camps if they have damage. We do tend to utilise others camps and their turrets to our advantage so it is only polite to repair.
---
While this would be a bit extreme I think people would be surprised on what exactly is in those ToS that they agreed too when they first booted up the game.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter which you go with. So whatever you prefer, but I highly recommend keeping all the gold
---
According to [the TOS](https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service) modding is allowed but not supported, i.e. you're on your own for any problems that crop up. And they of course reserve their right to disable mods in the future, as they currently do for Nuclear Winter.
---
[Better Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) is the inventory mod I use.
---
[Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) is a game changer and the bar that Bethesda will have to clear when they come out with their own version of that functionality.
---
[Improved Health Bars](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368) is a minor UI modification but extremely useful for bloodied builds.
---
[TZMap](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/419) is a map replacer that some might find spoilery, but I love knowing where the nearest workbench is for scrapping and where the Treasure Map spots are without having to look them up on Dulfy's site. And their map marker packages have much better visibility than the default set.
---
And selling a non finished product as a finished one is line with the law? Ppl should have sued Zenimax in the beginning and force them to give half of the money back to ppl whom they ripped off
---
The commie only collects broken Chinese officer swords for some reason. This one actually gives you usable stuff.
---
I think it would be more appropriate to do a server reset to last Wednesday and patch everything before going live again. 
---
It would be even more appropriate to take the game down for 48 hours and truly squash bugs
---
I can relate, but honestly the Atom Shop usually has very little that interests me. I can't imagine where I would use Astroturf and event if I could think of a use for the Red Rocket prefab it's too small. I'll admit slight temptation with the turret skins, and I may yet grab them, but honestly I just want my chicken coop and secret fireplace door.
---
not lore reasons, its just not in the game bc its literally impossible to use in a multiplayer setting
---
If this was literally any other mmo from ESO to WoW to even Minecraft Servers they‚Äôd have been banned and now that 76 has banned them they want to cry about it like it would‚Äôve been different on another game
---
üòÇ ok dude
---
Everything used to be all super mutants.
---
The cat one? I wear it everyday.
---
The sound they make bothers me too much. I play the drums so i think maybe I only like ballistic weapons that fire when I click once (one click - one crisp noise \[also am mouse/keys player\]). This basically means no electric or big guns for me. Exception here is archery, as timing the shots is a favorite of mine, but being online makes it worthless (framerates/lag). I never use VATS, ew.
---
With the ban hammer they're aiming blind I've seen randoms ban for no reason and other dupers that haven't been hit
---
Me personally an empty mule was hit not the one filled with goodies so it's seems like they're aiming blind with this ban hammer
---
Bethesda's games are RIDDLED with glitches and bugs. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone's been banned now or in the past by something they didn't even try to do. Didn't they ban a guy simply because he had a lot of ammo?
---
You simplify it too much, or don't work.  5 bucks is half an hour of most any job.  If you're not enjoying the hours of gameplay it may take to get a fun item, spending half an hour of real work to get that item is the smart move, the smarter move would be to stop playing.  The time you spend playing video games has value and if you don't enjoy that time it is work without pay.  Even spending half an hour going back and forth with someone on discord negotiating a deal, sending them pictures of your inventory, may be less efficient than taking out your wallet.  
---
I've never bought a game item with cash, but can understand why someone would.
---
Then sue them cry baby
---
When it's clear they are duped items, no, you shouldn't.  Stop trying to excuse garbage's actions, we're better off without them.
---
I personally charged back nearly ever purchase I ever made, I still have another account. I‚Äôll play on it, but I won‚Äôt get sucked back into buying non functioning atom shop items. 
---
Theyve already faced a lawsuit and lost for deceptive marketing, and not delivering on their word at launch. 
---
Predatory marketing... predatory marketing never changes...
---
Paint always used oil until modern synthetic paints... that require oil to manufacture.
---
you sound like you live in Switzerland or some other almost crimeless paradise where values are still pure lol. If people have the greediness to steal in real life, in videogames is x10 worse sadly. Thats why I selectively choose the newbies to gift plans and ammo.
---
Cursed world we live in ((
---
Agree it would be extreme.  But if you were running a business and someone was messing with it I bet the first call is to a lawyer.  I mean I am sure they have some on retainer or even in house.  Most big companies do.
---
If you make a shitty game and release it unfinished and filled with bugs, it deservers to be broken, not a single word, comment or sentence will change that
---
Hopefully they are next.   I suspect BGS will need to close some holes in NW code first tho.
---
Inventory is the big one I want to use.
---
it would be overkill. no corporation should be able to sue an individual. Ban is fair and good enough. and that comes from someone who have no empathie for the dupers.
---
I only started playing when Wastelanders released, so I've got a narrow perspective on this.
---
Bethesda has goofed dozens to hundreds of times since the game was pitched to now. I've never duped an item (I don't know hoe and I don't care to check), neither do I think any of my weapons are duped. One friend in-game has a legacy weapon (which I'm guessing was duped at some point), and ... well, I guess I'm slightly envious.
---
I don't think there are any solutions that will keep everyone happy, let alone most people. The lukewarm idea I have is to just nerf anything that has been notoriously duped, and maybe reduce the max number of treasure pails to 50 or something.
---
Sorry to hear you're banned though, F for respects.
---
I have no idea if there is duping in the game but whenever I join a private server some weapons bug and hold like 10 times the amount of ammo in their magazines.
---
I have nearly 2100 hours in and I would 100% stop playing. No question. Same goes for if they wiped the legacies or nerf bloodied.
---
I have yeah, hahaha garyyyyy
---
So you got a ban when you knowingly bought duped items and somehow you aren't responsible for your actions...
---
Max out all commando, ground pounder cards and concentrated fire if you wanna target limbs in VATS
---
Yeah, that sounds like duping to me, since they had so many, but I couldn't really tell ya, since I'm not familiar with it.
---
It's scary not knowing who to trust in the game. I'm afraid now with the bans, someone is going to go, "I'll just drop these duped items on a low level player and let them take the fall for me, so I can continue running my ebay 'business'." ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Within the past week, I've met three high level players who run those so called Ebay "businesses." And brag about them, too. üôÑ
---
I also wouldn‚Äôt worry as much on console, I‚Äôve heard of it much more frequently on pc
---
It‚Äôs weird but since I got the farmable tiles I can never complete any plant crops challenges.. had to stop doing the gardener possum badge
---
That event is both fun and a pain in the arse. Somedays you don't get enough hits to loot the body (due to being a conductor or a meat shield) and other days you get enough hits in only to have it disappear on you or explode back to the dark ages. And then other times it works.
---
Gaming companies have probably more to fear from justice than gamers.
---
Ahahaha this is so funny to read :D Excuses and denial :D Try to cover your duping by buying from "a random persons vendor" does not work now does it? :D I guarantee they won't "go bankrupt" by banning handful of scumbag duper/exploiters like you :D
---
You knew it was wrong and you still did it. You chose to do it. Deal with it like a man and don't try to make excuses and deny the wrongdoings.
---
Only pro is adhesive is a tad easier to find in 76

Wait, really? All I missed was one day, how are you so far? I haven‚Äôt really grinded the repeatables.
---
So your argument is if you own a business and I as an individual bring harm upon you then I should not be liable. 
---
Wow that is some serious mental gymnastics.   Gold Medal style.
---
If you want this is my "Bloodied" Commando build, if you don't want Bloodied replace Nerd Rage for other perks

Also has the weapons and gear I run and at the bottom it tells what perks to get at which level
---
yeah obviously it isn't 
---
but people ain't gon' comply
---
Do Wastelanders quests, save bullion, get SS armor and Gauss weapons. I've been using a Gauss-only loadout and build and it does everything well. I'm a Junkie so I get a 50% damage increase without all the hassle of running a Bloodied build. My current setup is not as powerful as my old unarmed build, but it doesn't need to be until they introduce more difficult content like the Vault raids again. If you don't want to go Junkie then Anti-Armor or Instigating prefixes on your weapons, or Furious for the minigun would work almost as well. I can send you a screenshot of my perks and SPECIAL stats if you want something to work off.
---
They always were money hungry pugs, but it‚Äôs not getting any better
---
It‚Äôs only a feature until we benefit from it of course.
---
Make sure you're nuking assault zones, WC only spawns in nuked assault random events which is equally annoying as it is cool and secretive.
---
Take legal action upon countless numbers of dupers or ban hammer them 
---
Which seems easier too you? ü§î
---
Terrible. Lots of pipe pistols and other crap. Got 1 piece of unyielding that I already kinda had anyway üò≠
---
I see it many times in watoga shopping plaza (an abusive price, by the way)
---
And because of too many experiences with weirdos like that I won't use my headset and I prefer to game alone. Why can't people just treat people like people in games? (Well I suppose most can't do that IRL so I know I'm asking a lot üòÖ) I've gamed with a few cool guys, not all guys are like that but the number of strange guys is simply overwhelming. My thing is, even if it is a girl at the other end of the headset, the chances of a romantic relationship (or whatever the creep is imagining) happening is pretty freaking abysmal.
---
Know a few of them dupers, none of them got hit so guessing its the people without vpn/v-boxes that got hit
---
True can‚Äôt have fun
---
Yup. I guess it can‚Äôt be pay to win
---
Actually, when I first got the backpack, I started carrying around a shovel. For a short period, I had a camp near that meditation palace place, so I‚Äôd do Buried with Honor frequently. I ended up keeping a shovel with me to match the backpack and quest!
---
I mean, you're not wrong but I don't think it's worth it for them financially to do something like that.  It would be a massive headache as well.
---
A friend and I recently nuked guided meditation and did the event there while nuked.  It was ok but I dont think it was overwhelming.
---
You‚Äôll always remember your first.
---
You've got to keep talking to him until you get back to the option to 'ask about something else'.  I could only get this to trigger once on a server, then when I server hopped, I could talk to him again, "Call me Bones." and get back to the option to "Let me ask you about something else." to get that to trigger again.
---
üòèüòÇüòÇ
---
I should clarify, I bought the original shovel backpack when it came out
---
Who cares. 
---
These people were not even playing the game.   Duping god rolls and spanking the queen is NOT playing the game its ruining the experience for others.
---
how many players are on steam right now?
---
Last night felt dead no good player vendors(bulk ammo) or nuke drops
---
How do you get the garage door? Maybe I'm an idiot but I tried for 2 hours to figure it out yesterday.
---
Where do you get that 20-35k figure from? There are over 10K online at this second on steam alone. 
---
Pretty sure daily users are in the hundreds of thousands.
---
Its kinda nuts really. Aside from scorchbeasts staying in the air and being hard for me to kill as such, I've actually been having a lot more fun lately playing as my unarmed character. Not running a bloodied build with him at all, I'm just running an instigating power fist and a furious power fist, with all the melee boosting mutations and a lot of strength. I do notice my survivability is a bit less than my PA character right now, but I also don't have a full kit of legendary armor, let alone armor I want. I even have more carry weight on my unarmed character because I don't have to worry about hauling ammo or weapons beyond what I'm scrapping, and my power fists are really light anyways. Hell, I don't even have the backpack unlocked yet, just the small backpack, and I can still get up around 400 carry weight currently. Its been really fun jumping around as a murder hobo boxer basically. Still, I do wish that PA could get to the point that I enjoy it just as much as I do the murder hobo.
---
I'm no expert but i imagine it will go down
---
No. You‚Äôre nuts. But maybe if they added survival mode again but forced you to make a new character like what was originally planned then that could work.
---
I've lost 10.5k score due to auto completed weekly and daily requests over the past two days.  I logged in after the daily/weekly reset and they were still auto completed.  I made sure I didn't end my session in NW as well.  Very frustrated legit player since beta.  I think I am putting the game on pause for another 6 months in hopes that they fix this buggy a$$ game.
---
I will narrow it down more.
---
Use the Bethesda support website to log a ticket and say that the account no longer has the tricentennial extras that were paid for.
---
Wow, that was totally hard to fill in the blanks on how to log the ticket and how to describe the problem.
---
Though, considering we are in a forum for fallout 76, and there is only 1 Bethesda company that would have a ticketing system for these sorts of issues and we are in a thread where someone lost access to their tricentennial addon, i do see where the confusion lay on who to contact and what to say.
---
So how do you know when its clear for sure. If i buy guns from someones vendor should i be banned if they were duped? How would i even know.
---
If you look on your map and see the big green "V" that's a players CAMP that has a Vendor you can "usually" find sermus (not recipes) for cheap but you should wait until you hit level 32 I believe for Starched Genes so you wont lose mutations when you pop Radaway
---
Only garbage and 1 mediocre fixer i sold later
---
I did notice a distinct lack of worthwhile vendors on PC..
---
never did find the eagle eyes serum I was looking for..
---
The commie bot breaks the swords while fighting capitalist pig-dogs.  
---
How do you think he gets the blood packs?
---
This is perfect and your right I should have looked at the TOS.
---
i just did a quick search and said 24k active rn, idk if thats across all platforms or what, im not gonna bs and say i did full research as i did not
---
That might not be so accurate now that there are 9 dailies
---
I looked at the atom shop before I logged off. Then logged in to adventure mode at 9:05
---
Agreed. I got this game at BETA, played for a while, and then quit. I came back when Wastelanders dropped and my friends came back. If they wiped all progress, we would all definitely quit. I enjoy the game, but I enjoy my time with my friends online in game more. We would simply move on to something else.
---
I had mine on the second floor. When wastelanders dropped it auto blueprinted it. Haven't been able to put it up in the air since.
---
Same here. I traded 2 legacies for a BE gatling plas (check my post history) but we did the drop trade thing so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
You know that taking somebody‚Äôs ideas to the ultimate extreme isn‚Äôt a good criticism? That‚Äôs like if I said ‚ÄúBy your logic, everything should be for sale for max caps and fast travel is disabled hm?‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Yeah, so I‚Äôve been told. Apologies for misleading you.
---
have you been saving levels since prior to lvl 40..
---
the final lockpick card unlocks at level 40
---
I think it's a combination of there being a ton of them, them typically getting away with it, and the people who were told by dupers that it would be safe to do
---
They would not nor would they ever nor could they sue for people duping and it would be an immense waste of resources and money. And time.
---
Steams average and peak counts barely changed, each was only a few hundred different.  Most players did not get banned.
---
So how does this work? Do only have one collectron and you just designate what skin/voice lines it has and also designate what it collects?
---
10,460 on steam at this second. Saying only 24k players daily seems like a grossly inaccurate.
---
true, i personally dont care what one person does, if they bought the game with their own money and want to risk it go ahead, as long as im not getting spanked in pvp by ppl with god roll heavy weapons
---
there's a damn difference between a mom and pop shop and a corporation with endless money and a drawer full of lawyers. can't you see this ? there's a user agreement and dupers blow it. they got banned, end of the story.
---
that medal is yours. keep it.
---
Understating how to play doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a god. I understood how to play the game way back when but only now I‚Äôm doing over 500 damage per hit. The internet has its problems and being a douche unfortunately is all over it. Trying to be nice to people betters the internet, and everyone should do it, even when the other person is a dick.
---
he was more likely just trying to scam you
---
Went through countless servers barely found enough ammo to buy I actually had to make my own for once üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs why I need
---
You know...I've noticed a steep decrease in high lvl (100+) players.
---
agreed..
---
the banned logic..
---
i did what everyone else was doing. Are you gonna ban everyone?
---
yes..
---
I was bummed that you don't get a special unlock able when you become overseer
---
Deathclaw eggs.
---
I'll have to go back I server hoped 3 times and couldn't find them so I was beginning to wonder.   I didn't realize they were that rare
---
The perk cards appear in a fixed order, you have access to all of them at level 50. Do you have perk points unused? You have to actually apply all the points up to level X-1 to get access to the perks that unlock at level X. 
---
You are looking for Picklock, Expert Picklock, and Master Picklock. You have to have them all selected to get level 3. They only have 1 Star each, no leveling up of the individual perks.
---
yup, some of these same people cheering are trying to buy b2525 items on the market
---
There are three Lockpick cards. Expert, Master and Picklock.  You have to get the individual perk Cards.  There are ways to get to three without one ; a Bobblehead or an issue of Tumblers Today.
---
The shotgun and pistol are both single-shot weapons. I only pull out my minigun for the Queen. VATS is a defining part of what makes Fallout Fallout so these are all your personal issues anyway.
---
Yeah you should get a lil thropy or something
---
You can only build one, but the terminal lets you choose items from all of the collectrons you have unlocked.
---
Lock pick is under perception, you need all 3 lock pick perks to do level 3 doors.
---
At the same time, if this ban holds. It‚Äôll act as a deterrent from mass duping and buying duped weapons. ‚ÄúHalf‚Äù of the playerbase just gone in a day after no forewarning from the devs. This should honestly be scaring some people because a move like this is financially risky which means they didn‚Äôt think it through (which isn‚Äôt likely cause someone important would‚Äôve had to agree with this) or they are done just allowing it to happen and are going to adopt a stern policy. On a different note, I think this all roots back to the the fact that Bethesda refuses to create or new engine or actually put forth the effort but the duper‚Äôs and buyers of dupes are just as guilty as Bethesda for abusing a broken system
---
Now I made a clown from myself... :)

*uR nOt SuPpOsEd To SpEnD yOuR mOnEy On RaNkS*

i always make my own.. 2 good upsides..
---
using cloth &amp; acid(gunpowder) + using steel and lead(the bullets) keeps my stash weight down.. and you also get the (admittedly minimal) XPs...
---
iirc that number stems from the dude that saw the hammer in 2018 who had over 100k of 5.56 ultracite. And at that time, this number was more than incredible.
---
Thank you so much, thats basically all info i need. Any tips on which serums ill need ?
---
The joke went completely over your head didnt it
---
The fasnacht one is a little much, but luckily I can get my regular one to scavenge for treats! I get like 3 royal jelly daily and after making it into taffy I rarely have to hunt. So will the raider one still collect treats for me or only weapons/ammo? I would get him just for the commentary.
---
They said yesterday they are postponing it to a later date.
---
Zenimax should be glad there isn‚Äôt a class action for the predatory marketing practices. Selling non functional items in their in game shop. Not delivering promises on fallout 1st, on the game development, shoot even on the tote that came with the tricentennial at launch.
---
Ever heard of an unconscionable contract? Well a TOS locked behind a pay wall, that you accept automatically and never read, that says they own your soul... That is certainly one sided and meant to scare people, not sue people. Look at precedent with subscription based games, they lose when litigation arrives.
---
Radscorpion eggs.
---
That could be it. Always do adventure before and after resets.
---
A community manager said they‚Äôre pushing that feature back a few days. No word on exactly when it‚Äôll be implemented
---
the reason pvp is nonexistent. is because it was removed after the Nuclear winter PVP was added. people got upset when you killed them as they were walking down the street.  seing as people had difficulty turning on pacifist mode. they also removed survival servers as it just wasnt as fun for players to die in the apocalypse. but they left all the shadows of pvp . we still have a entire weapon and gear set up designed just for that reason. that is 100% useless now. i keep mine for memories.
---
On that link I sent it shows all the mutations I currently run, should be around the middle or a bit further down
---
really? I don't carry a single one, just about 10 diluted .)

Unyielding sneak here.

Ha Ha.

T 65 can only be crafted after purchasing the plans with gold bullion.
---
They always gota justify it, lmao
---
there has been **speculation** they dont want people to pay for ranks because they are trying to figure out how/if they should compensate players for the score glitch..
---
advancing all players a set number of spaces on the board is the popular frontrunner.. but **its all just guesswork at this time**
---
The move to make cores to get and removing the ability to use ultracite cores in PA screwed a lot of people. The sad but true reality is that most of the wannabe bullies go after people they know aren't interested in fighting because they don't want a real fight. I hope survival comes back. I enjoy hunting all the wannabe griefers but it's hard to get people to fight after a certain level. If I were farming cores, I would take all three plants and just do minimal builds in the workshop. My buddy will often take them and just leave the fusion core machines unlocked and he rarely has any trouble.
---
If you open the mutation page In link it'll show all mutations in the game and what they do.
---
Hell I barely just made it to the orange section yesterday. I cant even fathom anyone being rank 100 without any form of cheating.
---
With the OP gone I'm just assuming that this was yet another "punish everyone" post by someone who duped and wants to bring the rest down with them.
---
Get lost.
---
If this was about wiping with emery paper: Not very smooth, I'd guess.
---
Didn't even think it was possible in online only environment with trigger happy ban hammer mods. Will defo be looking into this. Not done one treasure map as I can't be bothered looking back and fourth to see where to go.
---
the prison
---
Oh yeah, found them! Thanks so much
---
I save scum so much because I get attached to my soldiers and can‚Äôt stand to see them die.
---
 So how big should a corporation be before we can abuse them without any worry of consequence?
---
That is most definitely a mistake on Bethesda‚Äôs part considering the pre war traces of jet are in 4 primarily and they directly contradict everything we know about Jet considering it is Brahmin Dung which didn‚Äôt exist before the war
---
Honestly spend your money the way you want honestly I'll be waiting till near the end of season to buy ranks cause their score system is glitchy and I lost about an rank or two
---
There‚Äôs still a lot of people left. This sub represents a very small portion of players overall.
---
Whatever dude, have fun crying about a game
---
That's awesome! How did you snap the garage door to the garage? I have the bundle and I can't snap mine
---
Thats problem with the gameplay cycle. Hitting 30k caps is just to easy that I actually shut down my vendors maybe half way through my play through most nights. Then on top of that there really isn't anything worth buying since noone is interested in selling anything half decent anyway. So the cycle continues.
---
Honestly dupes aren't helping but the ban wave isn't gonna stop the game from feeling dead, it's a lack of content/cap sinks. Gold bullion and non tradeable plans didn't help either.
---
I feel like Grahm.
---
I do this. My collection of musical instruments is expensive!
---
 Mama Dolce's Food Processing floor safe in the office.
---
HA! Nice.
---
The other night a level 5 joined me while i was farming a horde event. So i started knee capping the ghouls (enforcer + limb damage FTW) and waiting until he got a few hits in before i killed them. He only went up one level though. I tried to get them to follow me down to abandoned bog town for some super mutant murdering but they left
---
You keep saying this. Where's the harm? The worst thing duping has done is damage the bottom line of actual scammers who seek real world monetary gain. Bethesda haven't lost a penny through duping. They will however lose a ton of revenue thanks to these restrictions. GG, Bethy. Big brain energy!
---
You destroy me. :D
---
Agreed 100%. Sometimes you gotta take that Nocturnal Bashing more vats cost fixer you just got from the purveyor.
---
You see anyone crying? I couldn‚Äôt care less about it, just pointed out the hypocrisy on the demand of the guy who made that post
---
Can‚Äôt go wrong with that one
---
2 different garage doors one is a wall other is for the building and it will only go on one way rotate it 180 degrees
---
This times 1000 lol
---
just wait for the flood of ‚Äúdid they buff the queen‚Äù posts when people start to realize most of the players with dupes weapons were the ones actually killing her
---
Nice thanks!
---
You don‚Äôt need to wait to get the card in a pack... when you level up you can select any card. Just select the master picklock card next level up.
---
FYI, dragons have the longest range in the game.  
---
your item is -slightly- less good than a junkies/bloodied explosive but it's still top tier.
---
there is a locked box inside one of the containers at the morgantown railyard near the shed with the weapons workbench.. and some in the airport area also
---
I always figured it was just normal cow dung pre war.
---
why are people downvoting you ?
---
I have this same issue with the garage doors in the base game. In that case, I always have to stand at weird angles to get it to snap in correctly. That might be the case here?
---
That‚Äôs steam. You have 3 other platforms like bethesda launcher, PS4 and Xbox.
---
No problem, sorry if I missed anything I've never had to explain this game to anyone before. Trying to remember everything on the fly because it's so common to me now.
---
I have had both happen. A hit that does no damage, but most of the time it‚Äôs just straight up miss and I will miss every shot until I back out of vats and then go back in.
---
Yeah I have an scrap box and more then enough gunpowder to make my own ammo but it just seems more easier buying ammo üòÇ
---
And yet, Brahmin Dung is just Fertilizer, which also exists in pre-war bags of Fertilizer.
---
I do have a vending machine open so maybe that helped make it possible. Still good to know some folks out there do this even if they weren't responsible for the damage.  Very cool.  I'll be sure to return the favor if I ever wander up on a "fixer-upper" out in the wastes.
---
Great idea
---
Why are you friends with a duper?
---
Thanks for the clarification. I feel so dumb :)
---
I guess you mean legacy weapons. They're very strong, but the hacked guns with nuclear winter mods on them are on a whole other level.
---
Or at least know people that do. Let me tell you, I have not had as much fun in this game as I have while running with dupers. I‚Äôve never duped myself, but they are usually good people, wanting to hand out free shit because the grind is so annoying for so little reward. A lot of them love this game and keep a lot of their exploits to themselves. This last exploit ban is far from the only one, there are at least 5 other duping glitches out there. This last one was just easy and became public too fast.
---
The building one doesn't snap, I've been trying for a while now
---
Ye your bring up old news so must be hurting somewhere
---
Yeah, I don't know. I've also seen a lot of events not happening lately. I didn't see Heart of the Swamp once yesterday in four hours.
---
It's not even worth the time for the Event one if there aren't any events or if nobody is doing them.
---
Had her appear behind me in Ward's trailer
---
Not unless engaged in pvp, or other sneaky acts unleas they've been patched. Meaning orbital strikes nuke grenades rad damage ect. If they really want they can try to pull high level enemies over to your camp to kill it
---
Had to tell this to a dude yesterday who was trying to make the same dumbass argument. The very bottom line is that the dup3rs made all of this happen. They knew it was against the rules, they broke them, &amp; got punished. It's that simple. Now they, along with everyone they tainted with their dup3d shit is paying the price. Nothing you say will change that. If you're looking for anyone to blame, it's the dup3rs.
---
They WILFULLY violated the rules, but it's still someone else's fault right? OMG I was able to do it so I did it and now I'm sad I'm banned even though I made a choice of my own volition because I'm too stoopid to resist any kind of temptation. That argument has absolutely no merit.
---
ok wait your lvl 70 and dont know how to pick a perk card when you level?
---
Ahhh so now you're backpedaling to most console players lol.  Keep grasping at straws, doesnt change the fact that most players didnt get banned ;)
---
They were sued and lost. In January of ‚Äò19 they paid out many tricentennial pre order holders
---
This is Fantastic! I love Grahm!  I am always looking to buy a disco ball plan from him, but alas he hasn't had it each time I have found him. Great video! I have only fought the wendigo colossus by myself in the blast zone in the forest so I have never had a good look at the creepy thing. It looks like you had a great time during the fight! Thanks for the video.
---
Because he‚Äôs a fun guy and I enjoy playing with him. Believe it or not, duplicating a weapon in a video game  isn‚Äôt that big of a deal in the real world.
---
yeah well.. if you got the caps to burn.. you might as well, to keep yourself under the cap..
---
my stash weight isnt really a problem.. so Im doing more for that trickle of XP..
---
I dont run a min/maxed build.. or a meta one.. but I try to min/max my time in the game to whatever extent I am able
---
I went through countless server hops waiting for an nuke and I even had people asking me if I had more ammo hidden away for trade but no
---
Seems obvious dupers had an huge play into the economy
---
My game's still working fine without log-offs. All challenges rotated correctly with no autocompletes while I was in game Staying in game is definitely not the only thing, that triggers that bug (if it even does)
---
You on Xbox
---
Edit never mind, I need to really read whole post before commenting
---
I‚Äôve only lost about 2000 so far. I‚Äôm just trying to add to the info that‚Äôs already out there about this glitch. I hate the feeling of logging in and wondering if any/all of the challenges were auto completed. Its also frustrating that Beth hasn‚Äôt made a comment about this issue (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).
---
You can put it on the ground, destroy it with a flamethrower trap, then build foundations underneath it and a whole house around it, then just repair it. I‚Äôm sure you can put it on the 2nd story but it would take some trial and error to figure out the best way how (rug glitch, float it, place on PA, etc.)
---
Bethesda is not a local business. Did you really just compare a multi billion dollar company with a local business? They don‚Äôt call lawyers, they own lawyers. To help defend them when they get sued.
---
Again, initially it was a mistake on Bethesda‚Äôs part but then I guess they‚Äôve just decided to make it canon
---
I know, but this guy is butt hurt so I'm pulling his cords.
---
Thanks for making this my most downvoted comment, Karens! Like moths to a flame üòé
---
I do not want to do events with you.. no offense...
---
Same I love that thing
---
I have a full set of bolstering and vanguard SS armor. Full Vanguard is better for tanking the enemies that matter such as yao guai, gutsies and assaultrons because if they do hit you you're going to lose a chunk of health regardless of DR. If you're bloodied that means you're dead if serendipity doesn't kick in.
---
They said it will be single player
---
yeah, joke.
---
Riiight.
---
when the parody is spot on to what people actually have issues with... it is probably not a parody.
---
But. whatever floats your boat.
---
I haven't been on today but I've noticed servers being pretty lonely places these last few weeks. I guess I got spoiled by the influx of new and returning players WL brought in, but of course we couldn't even shop at each other's camps for like a month anyway.
---
I think you expect too much from people in an online video game.
---
wrong sub
---
no its not its single player they've stated as much
---
Too bad they cant be bothered to update the official page.  
---
It still clearly says as of the 14th.
---
At the very least... please let us drop Nukes on Whitespring in Private World.  I swapped to nuking burrows because I was tired of swapping characters, doing 10 jumping jacks, and spinning in a circle just to get the glowing lumps to revive at Whitespring.
---
I made my own underground vault. I thought it was pretty cool.
---
I have them all and raider bot is the way to go
---
i think that is both the reason for the ban wave and the reason people were so liberal about it this time around. there have been several dupe exploits but, to my knowledge, there has not been a major ban wave since like early last year. I think people got comfy and figured they could do whatever they want without retaliation, and i think Bethesda wanted to make it a point to say "naw" in the hopes of scaring future exploiters away.
---
I think this is why the issue is difficult for them to figure out. Hasn‚Äôt happened to me either. Hopefully the log tracking they just added will help them resolve.
---
Nope singleplayer, and that is such an amazing thing.
---
As always, Angry Turtle made a video on this forthcoming... thing.

Pets no longer take up camp budget
---
It's possible in the violent night one that someone killed it as soon as it spawned. I have done that a few times because I forget that my Gauss Shotgun auto kills in vats pretty much.
---
Glad we both could improve our game experience then!
---
I sell all plans I get for 1 cap regardless what they are for.
---
The hero we need out there in the wastes!

Make Whitespring and Watoga great again!

What else am I gunna spend 10k atoms on?   I usually just buy PA skins so to me buying the cosmos pa skin is nothing new.

&gt;  **Will The Elder Scrolls 6 be an online, FO76 like experience? Is so, is this a good thing?**

your topic says differently

You just need to send in a ticket, and they'll refund you.

I wouldn't mind "Clear X events" as that might give me a reason to try ones I'd otherwise ignore.
---
oh, umm, how?

The same thing effects shot guns as well I have a few junkie shot guns that are beasts.  The most dangerous is the Je combat.  That will one shot you and anything in front of you :)
---
whatever duper you got banned GTFO
---
If you bought a bunch of stuff from 76 than they just won't ban you if you are giving them money...
---
Let's be honest, here.
---
Buying a duped item, that you know is duped.... On the cheap... during a mass dupe wave....
---
Is taking advantage of an exploit. 
---
You thought you would be safe taking advantage of it as long as you didn't dupe. You were wrong.
---
Got no sympathy for yah.
---
So if you see multiple copies of the same god tier level weapon, you should have your answer right there.
---
Pick your nose 3 times
---
... No but i mean they are all so dumb it might as well be.    
---
Who is actually building 20 light sources in camp and NOT immediatly scrapping them.  So dumb these challenges were made by a 6yr old I swear.
---
Have you tried planting at a workshop? I don't know if that would change anything, just a thought
---
Heres the thing every other server always had an nuke drop last night I never found any which is different from the norm
---
It's a colision issue with the floor. I can't do the same with red rocket station and cabin. Something about the foundation or floor pieces it doesn't like
---
i found out, nvm, thank you
---
Show me on the doll where the dupers hurt you. If people want to get themselves banned then why would Bethesda care? If anything it increases the likelihood of selling that person another copy.

Fallout 76 &gt; Purchase &gt; Your platform &gt; I need help with the Atomic Shop &gt; I want a refund. Fill the form and send.
---
Have you seen Captain Noob's recent video on sniping with the combat shotgun? Basically, you get 95% accurate headshots all the time with the right mods.
---
Idk why this is downvoted it‚Äôs pretty accurate
---
Could be worse, at least you might save some atoms by completing more ranks before they release the option to pay. Unless you were just going to pay the whole board, to each their own.
---
You are just a dumb troll üòÇ
---
you got wrongfully banned?
---
You can play it solo but it is a multiplayer game so your actions have affects that can go beyond just you.
---
You also get 100 score per 10.000xp.
---
People optimize their xp gain with INT incresing food and chems. Especially the unyielding bloodied guys are getting mad xp with the massive INT increase. Couple that with the flat extra xp gain from canned meat stew (especially with the Carnivore mutation!) and you get extra ranks just by killing scorched etc.
---
I watched a confused level 20 shoot my megasloth a few times last night and the sloth took no damage, which surprised me because I thought players could kill your pet.
---
That is my thought. Since I know I will naturally complete at least 10 events in a week, I never go out of my way to complete them. I just stick with Public Events (for the bullion, for when they hopefully add new things to buy), and super easy ones like Manhunt because it literally takes 30 seconds to complete, or Wolf Horde because of the easy three legendaries.
---
I heard people say it takes months just to get an reply it's better to start a new account
---
I was just wondering if the atomic shop purchases remained on only one account
---
its not that confusing seeing as how after every level after 50 you got 2 options. he never tried the other for 20 levels?
---
`That's my plan, I'll do that tomorrow as it will tick off a weekly as well`
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it just for the different collecting options for the bot. I know there is only 3 options for skins but I like the role play it brings so far. They should def add like a logger, or medic style in the future with similar programs. Even an eyebot or mr handy would be cool.
---
Go to bethesda.net and look for the support link. Then from there just go through the steps and say it was for an accidental atom shop purchase. They‚Äôll refund your atoms and let you keep the items. They‚Äôll say it‚Äôs a one time thing, but spoiler alert, they‚Äôll do it just about every single time. Great way to get all the bundles, there‚Äôs usually always at least one screwed up item in them to complain about. And don‚Äôt listen to the people telling you not to do this, they‚Äôll fear monger all day that ‚Äúbethesda is going to take refunds away from us all!‚Äù. No they won‚Äôt. They legally can‚Äôt.
---
Ha, me too! It may as well flash ‚Äúgame over‚Äù if someone dies...
---
Mods please remove
---
FU√óK YEAH!
---
why dont you run around punching people in the face..? 
---
that seems to be loby meta for many games with wait times between rounds.. and it feels good too
---
You failed a repeatable event that is at the end of the questline. Need to buy another recall card from a train vendor to try it again.
---
Edit: i should add it‚Äôs a public event and a high level one at that. Don‚Äôt worry about doing it again until you are a higher level. 
---
As for stash space, there are a ton of post on here about how to best optimize your space. 800 lb really is a lot if you know how to manage
---
Agree with this but a lot of these duped items were gifted and sold all over the place. 
---
Do BGS track item ids and is there a chance of the innocent being banned? That‚Äôs my only concern I suppose.
---
Especially as a lot of the people affected would be newbies who knew no better than to accept a gracious gift
---
How exactly can you team up? I'd help cause I'm also super bad at it
---
some people just have that luck..even with all the duping, and all my visits to various camps, I've never seen a legendary Fixer that I could grab..
---
..that's ok, perks are for sissies, I equip *skill* ;)
---
Place your camp somewhere near a good source of water and where you can plant plenty of crops for now. Do the Wayward quests and then continue main story for a while. Save your caps for now until you can find a reliable way to get more. As for essential perks, at your level not many are that important but it is a good idea to figure out what kind of build you're going for. Duping is using glitches and exploits to create duplicates of items you own, usually used to create copies of rare guns and items for trading.
---
I still bring a PA for SBQ since I‚Äôm a Heavy Gunner, but for the easier areas I love messing around with my SS jetpack when off the suit.
---
If you believe dupes are wants makes the game active and not recurring content to engage daily play then okay bud.
---
LOL
---
Mama Dolce's Food Processing office. Floor safe - level 1 lock and also level 0 terminal in the same room.
---
Free item is even in quotes, as if it's some sort of new scandal. Oh the horror, we were cheated of a an item we didn't have to pay for.
---
seems like a weak number but it is multiple spots above Borderlands 3, which is a newer release and was given way more love by reviewers than fallout.
---

Yeah!! 
---
And give me the option to take myself off the whitelist in watoga so the robots fight me again!!!
---
Im over doing these challenges. 
---
Nothing challenging about them.
---
Join a team from social menu in the main menu and then join a NW game.
---
I was a handmade guy for over a year.  By far my preferred weapon. Until I got my hands on JE25 &amp;  B2525 fixers ...you'll never go back to handmade ever again.
---
Fixers more damage, plus it's somewhat of a 5* legendary as you get the stealth increase and faster moving while sneaking.
---
Also, with bandolier 2, 45 ammo weighs 0.
---
The only time I had to refund a mistaken purchase they didn't let me keep it
---
Lol fantastic
---
&gt; its not that confusing 
---
not for you and I, no.. but this and other perk card related issues come up often enough that I feel confident in my earlier assessment of the situation..
---
You have to make a new assaultron recall keycard at a tinkers bench using a recall keycard circuit board purchased at a robot vendor as well as Stable fluorescent flux (1) Copper (3) Steel (1) Rubber (1).
---
The shooting range has a 0 lock pick. Its one of the ammo boxes inside the building
---
Good for you. My response wasn't to you and only you. When I say 'you', think of it more like the plural pronoun 'you all' as in anybody who does dupe weapons. Good on you for not duping though. Thanks for sharing your input.
---
Naughty naughty
---
There were supposed to be a bunch of ways to play the game. I thought the inclusion of VATS was one of many options. I just really like timing (obviously) and the online experience makes that less likely. Every issue is personal, because frustration only exists in minds.
---
The money was just resting in their account.
---
Alright, I'm up for it. Give me a few minutes, and I should be ready
---
No, I was outside both times. No notification. A bunch of confused then angry emotes.
---
Like before you play? Try a discord server probably
---
Coming later.
---
It was not true but OP should have added "humor" somewhere in the title. Filthy click baiters!
---
definitely single player. but I wouldn't be surprised if Beth sneaks in a co-op..
---
Alright add me, Sallyuchi. I'm in the game until you're ready.
---
&gt; However, others cheating could/will affect the game negatively for those who play the game legitimately.
---
How?  I don't really have a dog in this fight because I don't use exploits, but on the other hand I don't really care if other people do.  To me it kinda ruins the fun of the game, but only for the person doing it, but I don't really see how it effects me.
---
If it impacted the game for the other players then I would definitely be against it, but as it stands right now I don't really condone or condemn it.
---
I mean they're just shooting the ban hammer blinding again
---
There is a level 0 locked red toolbox near the Power Armor station at Grafton Dam
---
I'd rather do them than pay money. They don't take too long to complete. Most days I am done in 30 minutes or less.
---
all of them can give a quest to find a legendary. If you don't get one delete their camp item and place it again until you do.
---
duping costs bethesda money and people make money selling duped items for actual cash. i think this is the reason people get booted, they are not banning camp budget glitches or god mode. If bethesda actually fixed the game most of the glitches wouldn't exist. they are completely just as much at fault. Exploits are only patched when they are used, people report and place tickets for things never get patched. god mode was like a day one exploit...2 years later after almost half the community took advantage was fixed and only because it was affecting their bottom line as people used it to finnish their legendary run in a few days. Bethesda fix the game properly and people will be less inclined to take advantage. personally i have begun using exploits only because i realize its the only way for anything to be fixed. duping screws up the economy so not a huge fan but at the same time people are evening playing field when they give out unattainable plans or weapons. bethesda needs to fix rng and drop rates. look at what they are doing with legendary perks...who is not going to look for an exploit when it takes 115 levels to get 1 perk card. shameful, they bring it on themselves. convince me otherwise.
---
just holding forty 2525s for a friend.. ?

with canivore some of the foods will give you crazy resists like 80+ ER
---
*I am asking.
---
you have to link your bethesda account to your psn account on bethesda site. if its already linked you have to unlink it and re do the process. WARNING. you can lose toons and items by doing so if the account is already leveled
---
You have to spin it and then it will attach. For some reason when you select it, its turned backwards by default
---
Just found this(not mine)
---
Info (I hope useful) for all those who have the First service and are banned. At the outset some clarity. The First service is provided by the Ps network (and therefore not by ZeniMax or Bethesda). Requests for any complaints about the inability to use the service it is necessary to contact the Ps. The number of PS (free) to call in Italy where I live is 02 36009081. Obviously you have to find the number based on the country where you are. It is necessary to ask the operator for the kindness of the rate to be reported to Bethesda explaining that for the suspension of the account it is no longer possible to use the First service (of which, as already mentioned, they are guaranteed). It is also advisable to make another report on the Bethesda website, resolved the problem of the inability to use the First service. If a lot of phone calls arrive, and as a result, there will be many reports to Bethesda's belief that users still have some more chance of reactivating the service. Circulated perhaps on the forums and on Feisbuk. Thanks to all friends
---
Eh.  Maybe.  It's supposed to alter your perception to make it seem like time slowed down, right?  Make it a Haste drug then.  Speeds up all your actions (running, shooting, reloading) by a percentage.
---
Remember when Watoga spawned legendary protectrons? I member....
---
Looked at those challenges and gave up one them, good thing Campfire Tales and Operation Tidy are super easy quests that sometimes award tokens, finally got my fridge mod last week.
---
Did you even bother reading the e-mail? It says it could take days or weeks, and with the amount of people that got tagged, weeks is more likely.
---
Sounds like you would be willing to spend some atoms to have the ability to level restrict items in your vendor?
---
Junkies. With the pvp damage cap bloodied is wasted and just makes you easier to kill
---
Very nice. thats looks clean!
---
&gt; Do you comprehend that the number of 'innocent' people banned 'by accident' is a LOT smaller than the number of dupers, NW cheaters and other people scamming the system?
---
Which one of the following is more harmful:
---
A- Being a self-proclaimed gatekeeper on /r/fo76 and encouraging witchhunting and mockeries toward a group of individuals, risking to wrongfully include into this innocent players truly in need of help even if they are a minority
---
B- Just letting things be
---
At worst, A prevents victim of false positive to seek real help and assistance while B just create some noise on this subreddit.
---
Maybe I'm being naive here but I never understood the point of thread like this one pointlessly attacking others, calling them "dumbs", spreading the narrative that people who claim their innocence are always guilty. It doesn't help anyone but people's pettiness, the pleasure of feeling superior to others.
---
You're not part of Bethesda, you're not a moderator on this subreddit, so what's your goal here exactly if not to gatekeep? **This doesn't concern you**.
---
did you guys make enough music/noise for it to spawn in before the timer ran out..?
---
Can we add to that the people that are cheating the SCORE system.
---
I have not seen that video but will look it up, thanx.  I hope this does not get Nerfed because when a scorch beast lands I can pretty much end it in two, sometimes one shot.  But for me I got to be up close and personal so I tend to take a bit of a beating.  That Je shotty has killed me a bunch of time, but man is it fun :)
---
PSN: mrgruenwald. I can help. Go ahead and add me
---
Its not a moral issue. Bethesda is selling Access to an online service. They have made a decision that if you do X, they will no longer allow you to use that service. They have the right to do that, and whatever X is on any given day is entirely up to Bethesda.
---
There's no legality or morality involved.
---
Planting in a workshop? Two birds with one stone.
---
They do. If you are say switching platforms or making a new Xbox account, you have to purchase everything again
---
Blindly in the direction of dupers. Weird that people that have fuck all to do with that sort of thing aren't affected.
---
This is Bethesda we‚Äôre talking about.
---
They‚Äôll be sure to unban before the legendary run is done, so they can get money from people.
---
I mean, you either did or you didn‚Äôt cheat.  If you‚Äôre innocent, you‚Äôre going to get your score reimbursed I‚Äôm sure!
---
It‚Äôs final.
---
If you want something better, you need to do all the farming over and hope for the .00002% chance you get what you want.
---
Me? I would probably go Junkies just for the chance that the full health might keep me alive longer if I came up against someone else who was properly prepared for PVP...
---
my opinions are quite often far from popular tho.. YMMV
---
Correct.
---
They wouldn't calling it Elder Scrolls 6 if it was a multiplayer game, just like Fallout 76 isn't called Fallout 5.
---
However I do expect to see settlement building, which I'm looking forward to, and a corresponding resource management for settlement building, which I'm not quite looking forward to.
---
Flatwoods, at the bar across from the church. Level 1 lock beside the level 0 locked fridge; canned food in the lvl 1, dead Responder in the lvl 0.
---
This happened to me last night on ps4. I just backed out, played for a bit, then tried again. When I tried the second time, it looked like it was the same of only owned items, but after I let it load for a min, it popped up back to normal.
---
Stay off me bridge
---
I love ideas like this
---
That and 5.56 crafts in larger volumes. 36 vs 21 with ammosmith. Easier to build up stores of 5.56 ammo.
---
And add an AP Regen boost
---
Hey no problem.  Where do you work.  
---
I will show up and let your boss know you said its ok to fuck with his business. 
---
Lets see how that goes over.
---
I saw a lad selling 80 missiles for 25 caps each.
---
oh fuck, well, yea, but i cant verify anything, plus i got a exploding quad lever action, welp, i guess some level 1 if getting real fucking lucky today lol
---
1) no
---
2) what plans are you looking for? Most camp plans you get from completing events. Weapon mod plans are primarily from scrapping weapons. 
---
3) PvP requires either both players to shoot at each other, or you to be in a workshop. Workshops are PvP zones. There are also 2 PvP events. Turn on pacifist mode in settings if you don‚Äôt want to accidentally enter PVP outside of workshops or the 2 PvP events (hunter hunted and monster mash)
---
Hey did you end up getting that fixer?? I guess there is an inner circle after all lmao.
---
Like my empty dupe mule was hit but my goodie filled dupe mile hasn't been hit ü§î
---
I'd rightfully say people are possibly getting an random ban cause their dupe detection sucks üòÇ
---
So many game crashes...
---
1. No they can not
---
2. Any of the robots at the train stations have plans under the ‚Äúnotes‚Äù tab
---
3. It‚Äôs a handshake system. If you attack someone, they have to attack back before any damage can be delt. You can‚Äôt just be walking around and be killed by another player unprovoked.
---
Welcome to the wasteland!
---
Did a few challenges in the same place. Bog workshop.
---
You claim it, defend for the event there is a safe in one of the blasted houses second floor on the main street with a super mutant right next to it or the jail if you dont have the key. A little up north the crops in the General Steakhouse if you need "seeds".
---
i level every card to max then to the next tier until i have one of all varitries of the cards i use in case of build playing. after that i stopped opening pack. i have roughly 60 levels worth of stuff to do waiting on the legendary  perk system. so i can turn and burn all those dupes very fast
---
No. Would ruin new and lower level players experience. I would not want for someone to start the game just to step outside into a nuke zone and die a few moments later.
---
Borderlands 3 flopped it had good reviews but not from the players.
---
It went month's without any new raids or content they tried throwing 2 week events to keep people playing until the next big raid.
---
Fallout 76 has been out almost 2 year's had multiple updates and some new content so, yeah it's going to be above BL3 which hasn't even been out for a year yet.
---
That's a scary thought. How would I know if something I bought off a player is duped or not? Well it's going to be a long day at work waiting to see if I can log in tonight.
---
make sure you have pacifist enabled in the options if you do not want to PVP..
---
all vendors carry some kind of plans generally more and more desirable plans in higher level areas
---
That's absolutely nuts, thanks for the info though!
---
I've been playing a long time and even I don't know how to tell.  I've been told I'm just dumb because "it's so easy to tell" and then told if it has perfect stats it's a dupe.  Well, I've gotten perfect rolls on items from the purveyor a decent amount of times.  So it happens and therefore to me, that's no way to tell.
---
I built in a workshop yesterday to satisfy the weekly but not change my camp, plus you get to use workshop resources for most of it.
---
No. When you hover over the box it says MY STASH BOX (STASH). As long as it says that then it's only you who can add or take out.
---
All (i think) NPC vendors have blueprints. Some are level locked though. Like the Lever action plans wont appear until you're 25. Player vendors usually have lots of plans. At a lower level you probably wont know 99.9% of them but as you level up you'll notice most of them are the same ones.
---
If you turn on pacifist mode you are safe. BUT if you go into a workshop area then it's game on. Anyone can attack you. And you can attack anyone.
---
Aaaa I just managed to kill one. I died to a car explosion shortly after, but who cares! I'm adding you now
---
I barely pay attention to the time when playing this game, what time exactly is the daily reset, my timezone is GMT
---
yeah it sucks... I come into a camp with free stuff and I can will use it, I grab it up,  I see a give a penny take a penny bag, I see if I have something I can stuff in it  
---
As to the problem, perhaps a sign "Newbies, need anything from this machine for free? just ask" then list everything at 30k
---
Pay money?  Who said pay money?
---
I already have the 10k atoms and aint doing squat with them. 
---
I think you grossly misunderstood.
---
Ha ha ha, yes there was, and no I sadly didn't get one.
---
I try to do as many things as I can. Pop all the balloons, kick a ball, ride a bike. Nothing reminds me of the existential woe I am desperately trying to escape more than that fucking vault with its unchanging gloss. So now I ring the bell. Matchmaking takes too long for a mode with 1 life and probably about 2-3 instances of combat. Most of the combat is ambush and doesn't allow for dynamic strategy (my favorite part of online fps).
---
I have seen them twice at different vendors in the last week
---
Cool thanks üëç
---
What exactly does the star quality mean? Better damage, better condition?
---
Thats what I'm talking about, them good ole days lol.
---
Things aren't bad now in terms of legendaries spawning, but thinking back to the "hot spots" that existed and how much fun it was to spend a hour or more killing ghouls and robots non stop.
---
Or his sister leckett
---
No no no, that's wasn't it.
---
For me everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
---
Think the recommended minimum level for attempting the Encrypted event is 50. You're going to get shredded attempting it at level 19.  There's some good ' tube tutorials on it
---
Ah well, probably safer now that the ban hammer is swinging. Mama murmrgh will hook you up one day üëçüèª
---
I do miss when Nuke zones were fun and kept respawning a shed load of glowing ones.
---
I feel like once the first group clears out WS or fissure prime it‚Äôs just an empty pointless rad bath. 
---
I‚Äôve given up farming flux now because there‚Äôs never enough enemies for the flux ingredients.
---
Either un-nerf the zones in general or make it so you could pick up HR fluids, glowing and hardened mass without a hit market again like back in the 400 stash days
---
Turrets for me lately have been attacking regular traders as well
---
Cheers üëç
---
Weird. I‚Äôve put in at least 8 tickets for items not working as intended and explicitly said each time that I have no problem with them removing the items, I just want my atoms back. But every time they let me keep everything.
---
Someones mad about not being able to keep selling their weapons on ebay...
---
so jet is just jenkem?
---
1. Nope your stash is your own storage, unless you drop it in front of everybody.
---
2. Pretty much every NCP robot vendor (Flatwood church/ train station) look in the notes section.
---
3. I haven‚Äôt tried so I can‚Äôt give you any details.
---
This is literally the first thing I did when I bought it üòá
---
I did mine in a workshop though so I couldn‚Äôt use displays. Can‚Äôt bring myself to scrap my camp yet for it
---
I stopped needing ballistic fiber when I started getting improved repair kits, but screws... You need them whatever your level, whatever your build. Mod learning means crafting, crafting means screws. 
---
Fluxes always sell well too.
---
I didn't. You're paying for first and thus your getting atoms. You're still paying something to get those atoms. I'm not hating on your choice, only saying what I would do instead. I also pay for 1st but would rather use the atoms on atom shop cosmetics is all.
---
Hahaha! You heard the man. üòÅ
---
I roll with a J fixer and a J handmade as a back up (back up is wrong my second main).  Both are beasts!  I like having two different ammo types that way if run low on one I can easily switch.  So I would recommend both.
---
So what exactly is a workshop.  Like a camp?
---
What maniac decided the only thing you can do with chicken meat is make chicken noodle soup? What happened to fried chicken!?
---
Thank u all for the very fast responses
---
Its broken as long as exp is tied to INT.
---
You are literally gimping yourself not rolling 15 int and full uny. With all int buffs on top of exp buffs. 
---
Not that I am about to use 15int.
---
Great ideas
---
Isn't that the meta tho? just hide in a bush till top 10-15? That's what i do cuz my comp is trash : (
---
.50 cal here, you on pc?
---
just hold r2 she will rotate then fit in the entrance
---
The best Red Rocket I have seen todate!  Bravo Zulu!

Fallout started off as a turn-based game, VATS is a way of translating that to a shooter. It's iconic to the series, you don't have to use it, but it's part of Fallout. The game was always announced and planned as an online title, so if you don't like that you can wait a few years for Fallout 5, it was never going to come before ES6 regardless of the existence of 76 which a lot of people can't get through their thick skulls. (Not saying you are one of them) I suspect from numerous things that the other weapons and legendary prefixes are going to be rebalanced like the "magic weapons" and we will see more challenging content being introduced along with new more powerful weapons over time. The Wastelanders gear seems designed so that anyone can get to a relatively powerful level relatively quickly in preparation for that, and the public teams and new events are teaching people how to coordinate to achieve an objective which is needed to complete a raid, which most of the playerbase didn't understand the first time around and just cried because they couldn't solo it. From my perspective Bethesda learned from that and are moving at a much slower pace so people can improve over time instead of walking into an instance and getting gangraped to death by Mirelurk Kings or Chad feral ghouls that are much higher level than anything else you've ever encountered before.
---
76's problem is that there's no actual drop weighing at all going on and the sheer number of prefixes combined with how godly a couple are above everything else (lol bloodied) means that actually trying to get what you want is a total pain in the ass that has you doing the same old endlessly. Also not helping the matters is that loot in general is idiotic (why in the hell are we still doing this tagging crap that games have solved for years now). It all comes together to the point where the best builds arent done via good perk combos and smart modding, but praying to RNG for that godly drop that smashes all. And others will want that when they see that power being showcased.
---
Compare it to other loot based games like Borderlands or Grim Dawn. GD alone has a lot of work done to make itemization feel worth it and able to do targeted farming so you arent just wandering aimlessly.
---
I tried to recreate the garage from the F04 load screen. All the assets are there it just needs something like the place anywhere mod and the OCDecorator mod from F04 to make it look right.
---
Too complex for this game. They can't even fix the friends list synch issues let alone identify and separate dupers and hackers into their own servers.
---
I didn't know this was a thing, but it happened to me today. I hadn't signed on at all today, but played nuclear winter and then looked at the Atom Shop last night before going to bed. Apparently what I'm gleaning from this is after you NW or shop, you need to log into adventure mode and quit from there?
---
Eat a D dude. If a player hasn't hacked or modded the coding, then so be it. Bethesda created a poor poor product from the start. All is fair when it comes to shitty programing.
---
LOL Sometimes I want to shoot my brother too. Sorry, poor grammar. I always shoot Dylan hen I go there.
---
nothing transfers between xbox and PC
---
You can add psychotats to the list i got some out of it yesterday
---
My apologies. Life got in the way. I should be on this evening though. I‚Äôll send you a friend request when I do.
---
Bring back the theremin!
---
This^
---
Any serious offenders are safe on their main accounts while the alt took the fall. The only people upset are the ones who didn‚Äôt know better. They also aren‚Äôt banned, it‚Äôs a temporary suspension
---
I'd probably start a new character. And then you can experience all the wastelanders stuff from the start.
---
How does duping hurt Bethesda? People get banned then turn around and buy another copy. If anything people getting themselves banned makes them more money. The hardcore dupers go through tons of accounts because they are usually selling items for real money. Why get so worked up over gear in a video game? People have done that sort of thing for decades in games.
---
 I used to hang out in artisans corner for hours crafting ammo and checking the vendors like a vulture as soon as someone would finish dumping unwanted legendaries after a WS run.
---
 The things people would ditch was crazy. Still my best finds to this day...explosive laser gatling etc.
---
 The player hub aspect was great. I met so many people (my old ign: ninjasrfake) and witnessed such craziness like massive pvp brawls and bizarre role playing lol.
---
 Sadly, there is nothing that comes close to the o.g. WS now.
---
If time slows down for you, it doesn't mean you're going faster for other's. You ain't Quicksilver. Jet is supposed to slow down time FOR YOU to give you more time to aim and dodge things. (though I'm pretty sure you do shoot quicker in FO4 while using it compared to the slowing down effect the enemies get to simulate the whole time thing)
---
Fair enough figured I would ask.
---
Can I ask you how you leveled up so quickly? I‚Äôve been playing since beta and am only 153.
---
i had an issue apparently 10 years ago my son decided to link my bethesda account to his email. and i never noticed until twitch started doing fallout 76  rewards. so i started looking for them and low and behold i had nothing . so after a hour i saw in the setting it wasnt going to my email address. it was going to his. so i had them unlink it. then i relinked it to my xbl account. now all my stuff shows up. except the fallout 76 account toons. they are linked to that email address. so i created a new xlb account attached that email address to it. and now i have 1 xlb account that is just for fallout 76 and another for everything else. if its items you want ot keep . let a friend hold them and you do all the linking and hell give them back.
---
Thanks for the reply and another way to tell is nobody would have the crap weapons I have if they were duplicated ü§ì. Holding out for bloodied fixer with vats and faster fire rate all I seem to get is pipe pistols and heavy weapons
---
There‚Äôs actually a crossbow plan at the shooting range at the camp iirc. I haven‚Äôt been there in forever so I don‚Äôt remember.
---
I know and the nuclear winter challenge suck
---
I think explosive bait can do unless it was patched.
---
I just hopped 5 public servers and I haven‚Äôt been on a full one yet.
---
100% agree. I played at launch and beat the game then and ran out of stuff to do. Came back after wastelanders released and fully restarted. Really enjoyed the second play through.
---
The key word in this is ‚Äúcan‚Äù, and I get them often, but not all the time, some are save a person and you just get XP, maybe a little Scrip too I can‚Äôt recall, like 3-5.  So the actual answer I believe is ‚Äúno‚Äù, as none guarantee a legendary every time to my knowledge
---
Your camp is your portable base that you set up. When you leave the game and comeback it is still there. 
---
A workshop Is a location on the map with a red bench type thing (similar looking to settlement thing in FO4 that you take over). If you close out of the game you relinquish control. They warn you when you take one over that you consent to PvP. You pay caps to take them over. Note: while they may look like settlements, they are **not** settlements. They do give rewards for taking them over and defending them though. They also have resources you can plant an extractor down on.
---
Yup. And on an aesthetic level.....i think BOS combat armor looks awesome. so rock that junk while your working on your SS set and ur gucci. Just a warning tho....that shit takes fuggin forever, atleast for me it did : /
---
And otherwise you will go crying under your blanket butthurt baby?
---
Not surprising, it's a subreddit of fans of the game. But it is a little weird because I assumed even fans of this game would agree with most of my points
---
Ah ok o dont think I've encountered that yet.  Thank u for the help
---
I miss the .308 receiver :(
---
Hold off on 1st till you have a lot of junk.
---
I would 100% be down for this but....we all know it's never gonna happen : /
---
You wont get banned Bethesda's can track whose using such exploits
---
But once that item is traded away they dont see where it goes
---
I was in a FB trade group up until yesterday. This guy posts about someone else being a scammer and how he lost a legacy gun and didn‚Äôt even get what he wanted. It was his only one. Now mind you the guy complaining has stated and shown proof of owning almost ALL the legacy weapons but a few and trades them all the time. Someone else replied he should have duped it first and used a courier. He replied that he still has the original. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. They got pissed when  I called them out on it. Shortly there after... got the boot.
---
I'll make sure to do that, thank you :)
---
Any idea what to sell it for? I can't make the ammo myself to sell, I'd do nothing but collect acid.
---
I actually got decent RNG for my rolls, only took me a couple of weeks to get a Junkie's minigun and shotgun, plus a Quad pistol and a full Vanguard's armor set. All my Bloodied friends would have been pissed if they saw how much Bloodied and Unyielding stuff went straight back into the scrip grinder lmao
---
Good. No solicitations!
---
No problem. Good luck out there!
---
[here is a map of workshop locations. ](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-workshop-locations/)
---
Based on current steam numbers, player count is down by less than 5%. Yet the dupers are crying that 60-80% of the playerbase got banned. Sadly they're not as significant as they think
---
*cries in 100 b2525 hm*
---
You can overdose on salt, you know.
---
So Bethesda are trying to ban their way to a balance and stable game, and chasing their tails ultimately.
---
I'm guessing the people who get banned will just move on and play something else or those who really like the game will knuckle down and start afresh with new accounts and characters.
---
That makes me feel better. I used to play with dudes that duped and I never took anything from them but in 1.5 years of gameplay there's just no way to know what has been duped.
---
I had a problem like this so I'm guessing is this collectron at a workshop? If so you can only change the mode at collectrons at your camp.
---
Alright, thanks for the advice :) I was also going to get 1st because I'm unsure how the community is online right now in reference to how new characters are treated. Do you know If it's good for that right now?
---
I agree. I‚Äôm on Xbox so not many cheaters. I didn‚Äôt think I would like it, but it is fun.
---
this video explain the mission https://youtu.be/ugSEe34nJ-4
---
ya they said 2 weeks...should be any.. moment..
---
..I even saved up some atoms so I can catch up to where I should be (currently level 16)
---
No not mirelurks. But I thought they made Deathclaws and a few other large enemies untamable.
---
Store it then replace it. If not server hop. If not scrap it and rebuild it.
---
It was nice when you got to spawn your own mobs upon entering an area instead of everything always being dead. u.u
---
No clue, I've never bothered with trading.
---
I‚Äôll give it another go.  Thanks
---
One of the best excuses I saw/argued with today was that since Bethesda made the game and there‚Äôs an exploit in it people shouldn‚Äôt be banned for it.
---
They delayed that. You should wait anyway until the end. Later ranks require more score so your atoms/score ratio is much better in later levels.
---
I made a post just like this. The syringer has the potential to be a great support weapons if we had the options. 
---

---
So each star has a legendary effect. 
---
There‚Äôs three slots (1*, 2*, 3*) and the effects you can get in each one are specific. 
---
The first slot is one of the most important. In the OPs example, Bloodied increases damage when your health decreases, and is by far the most OP effect damage wise. 
---
You can also have Junkie‚Äôs which increases damage when addicted to chems/alcohol, Two-Shot which shoots an additonal projectile, and then there are less useful ones like Hunter‚Äôs 30% damage to animals, Exterminators 30% damage to bugs and mirelurks, Nocturnal which increases damage at night, decreases during the day. 
---
The second slot is also important. 25% faster fire rate and explosive are the two best modifiers. You can also have things like 50% limb damage, 50% crit damage, 40% bash damage (bad) and some other bad stuff. 
---
Third slot is the least important, but there are a few good perks that greatly increase the weapons potential and value, like 25% less VATS cost, and 15% faster reload. 
---
You can get a three star (and you often will) that has bad rolls on all three, and pretty much makes the weapon/armor useless, or as its known now, scrip. 
---
Here‚Äôs some [Weapon](https://www.kevduit.com/fallout-76-legendary-weapon-effects/) and [Armor](https://www.kevduit.com/fallout-76-legendary-armor-effects/) guides on Legendary Effects.
---
I saw it for sale today at Whitespring.
---
Yea I'm on xbox too. Unfortunately it's a grind to raise my overseer rank cus I'm bad lol
---
Like 75% of people i know who duped lost an account. Which is impressive because i know a ton of people who duped this time because of how easy it was. Even with them gone everybody and their brother have been handed guns/armor . Side accounts loaded to the teeth. Curious if those accounts got banned too.
---
I'm only crying cause I can't find a duped Fixer to grab..
---
The idea is that flooding the market with them, makes the legacies even more valuable. They are also quite meta so they find very easily a buyer. That's however a problem of balancing. There are no other weapons in the game which have that firepower and are low cost to be maintained. In some comments I already stated that they are a problem, not because of the rarity, but because the build you can have around them. But in this case a balance pass is needed for most weapons/enemies. Again, op items needs a closer look.
---
I'm have 1,600 hours in game, I have played campfire tails countless times and only had 1 badge drop. I ended up getting all but 3 badges done now, but I let a lot of them just happen naturally. I always keep free stimpack defusers in my vending machine for those in need.
---
Good thing you can buy them at any time before it ends! 
---
Seriously, save your atoms until right before the season ends so you can squeeze the most levels out. Levels requires 25 more score per level.
---
Why did you get banned, sport?
---
I feel you! That's happened to me before and I HATE it. Putting free/very cheap stuff in my vending machines, leaving my water purifiers and steal extractors unlocked ‚Äî just to find some lvl 400 guy take everything. Labelling it "Free for Newbies" doesn't bother those people at all...
---
well.. as the old saying goes..
---
there is no fixing stupid.. lol
---
If it wasn¬¥t for the long time between matches and the low adventure xp it gives i would play a lot more NW. It is fun i agree. PS4 here.
---
Yeah. And i explained how to get the guaranteed legendary quest.
---
Thats weird. I put some of those robot models on display, and they havent gotten scrapped.
---
Where
---
This exactly.  She‚Äôs done multiple 12+ hour streams of basically straight XP grind.
---
you heathen.....
---
Are mods actually allowed on PC?
---
Yes! THIS! I use too much budget having to double stack my interior walls.
---
The real dupers were not affected since they know better to dupe on their main accounts, just the poor soles who enjoyed the best weekend of the game to date. Not even remotely sorry. I loved trying out all those weapons I would have never been able to attain. It was a magical weekend.
---
I haven't been. Still going strong.
---
Nice! Need more clutter lol
---
It's already too late for most solutions. Bethesda said they would fix explosive energy weapons and add them back in the loot pool. That was 18 months ago, so it seems like they're not planning on actually doing that. They also can't remove them from people who got them as genuine drops and have held on to them for so long. Removing the duped copies is the closest to a real solution they have by now, but it seems they don't have the tools to track or do that. Also too late to do anything about the hype, RMT traders have spammed around that stupid "legacy" term so much that people get rock-hard at the mere thought. So unless bethesda decides to step in and do something, the best you can do is play the fucking game and stop trying to break it even more than it already is
---
well i will tell you it is indeed animal friend rank 3 , and that is the only perk you need
---
Actually,  the time between match loading has significantly reduced .
---
Incorrect. There are deathclaw eggs, mothman eggs, radtoad eggs, mirelurk eggs, radscorpian eggs...
---
I'm certain that the inside of White Springs is supposed to be the player lobby
---
On the talk about whitespings, I recently got a jetpack and marsupial, allowing me up on the roof of the hotel... Absolutely nothing up there! I was hoping for at least a few silly signs or scrap
---
this is old and wrong you only need animal friend 3
---
Munchkin_jesse I believe is how it‚Äôs spelled. She‚Äôs usually on in then evenings Eastern Standard Time.
---
It's pretty easy if you wanna be op just grab frog legs and demo expert üôÑ
---
no all the same ones can still be tamed
---
Yes, FOMO is a factor for me.  I am now addicted to the crack cocaine of doing these dailies / weeklies, to receive all these shiny new trinkets.
---
Only problem is, I am insanely over-encumbered and can't fast travel anywhere, so completing these + the main quest is taking ages, and I often can't complete all the dailies. I really can't be faffed with sorting through my inventory for hours, so on I trudge, staying up late, feeling as rough as a Yao Guai's rear end the next day, whilst trying to work at home. My 14 year old is also grinding this, more so than I... probably at the expense of his lockdown homework...
---
I seem to remember WoW did this to me before I decided to go cold turkey on it, and get my life back... Crafting profession, marketplace grind, collect/kill x number of these, etc. I could go Fallout 1st to clear my STASH of scrap and put it in the Scrap box, then move my carried stuff to STASH but I don't really want to pay extra for this game, over and above the initial outlay and a few atoms purchases here and there. I actually stopped playing for many months around the time Fallout 1st came in. I only started again when Wastelanders DLC arrived, but can only play a few hours per night. I kind of agree with those that say this grind makes them play the game in a way they do not really want to.
---
Oh well, I'm off to put a couple of cucumber slices on the bags under my eyes...
---
I really hope so but knowing Bethesda they won‚Äôt do anything to my score. I just love playing 76 in general. I have around 700 hours in playing and I‚Äôm level 314. I‚Äôve also played the BETA. Just for Bethesda to put me in timeout corner. It‚Äôs really harsh.
---
RIP
---
You need only 1 perception point. My melee unarmed ninja wears a full Unyielding set, and that means like 32 strength and 16 perception at low health. Kick those points into strength and endurance.
---
There is one. Problem is if you make one you're gonna have added durability. And you have to get rid of that extra durability to damage it to repair it. 
---
If you go to the palace of winding paths and hang left there's a table with one on it.
---
Yes I read the email but people have been getting un suspsend and un-banned early.
---
The lobby im in has like 5 people in it just two or three days ago i was in full lobbies now it is impossible to find a full lobby its weird
---
I only buy PA skins. 
---
Dont do camp stuff.   To me the whole season is just a PA skin.
---
I mean, they weren't actually playing the game to begin with, so no real loss. Since they already cheated through the rest of the game, they probably used the exploit to reach max score already though, so they got their instant gratification fix from that too
---
Okay, that answers the question. It is a collectron at my workshop. I don't have the CAMP budget to build one at my camp, so I wasn't able to compare.
---
But I use Xbox. I would have to make a whole new Xbox account. I don‚Äôt want to start at square one again :(
---
Who? Any proof of that or is it word of mouth?
---
I run a hybrid heavy gunner and commando. I use Junkies for PvP and Bloodied for PvE. The only issue that I have is managing weight when I swap back to full hp but it isn't bad.
---
Bear arm counts as unarmed. The same with gauntlets and knuckles. You can use the bear arm and benefit from the mutations.
---
So, I have a question concerning this. A few weeks ago, shortly after creating a new character, a random player approached me and gave me 1000 Large Homemade Gifts.
---
Does that put me at risk of being banned just by having them? Or would I, specifically, had to have duplicated them in order to get banned?
---
If it's the former, is there anything I can do to prevent being banned?
---
Just look in your PipBoy under ‚Äòeffects‚Äô 
---
No nerd rage, visit some radiation ‚Äòtil it kicks in üòÜ
---
Perfect that's where I'm going now! Ty
---
It seems like so much wasted space. Why don‚Äôt they make events that that take place in some of the numerous spacious areas of the resort?
---
Can't believe I forgot about that one.
---
Definitely will do!
---
Yup they take a long time not just weeks we're talking months here better to take your loses for now and start another account
---
It‚Äôs a shame that Watoga is a ghost town now. Such a cool area that nobody ever uses.
---
Seems to me it is. There is a whole black market for this which generates real money for proprietary property in which the originator receives no benefit. So yeah duping guns in video games is a problem in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world.
---
Better, hit with the nuke seconds after leaving the vault
---
also wish they would have them snap to foundations
---
Well one person claimed they got un banned or un suspended but hasn‚Äôt shown evidence yet and I think Bethesda support on twitter are trying to un ban/ un suspend people.
---
Pretty close considering it would be hard to get the ‚Äúclutter‚Äù that they have in that shot. But you nailed all the key elements! Well done! Was thinking of getting the garage myself. Is it worth the 500 atoms?
---
it be fantastic but this has been requested on day one and has always been ignored. We don't even have ceiling paint in the game sadly.
---
And tons of cool skins available to give you something different to look at once in a while.  At this point I'd take a fixer skin that makes it look just like the combat rifle.  Pretty much the most popular and sought after gun in the game and the only shade it comes in is "fixer"  .
---
Lol I don't need it, I have a full Unyielding heavy combat set but I only use it for crafting stuff. They should add an auction house to sell bullion gear, it would be under their control so they can avoid duping issues if they do all the transactions server-side.
---
And the RR is pointless because PA and hazmat suits have a invisible 98% radiation reduction thats not shown in the stats.  So a 500 RR hasmat suit will take 1- 2 rads a second in a nuke zone while you at 437 will take 16 - 18 rads.  And if you pop a RadShield to get it up to around 700 you'll still take 15 - 16 even though your stats show its better then the suit.
---
got it, thank you
---
I did the same thing when I got marsupial, a lot of lame empty rooftops, but it really feels like the game opens up once you are that mobile.
---
If you haven't already, climb senneca rock, its pretty cool for the view.
---
Gonna give it a go. Thanks.
---
Really?  That sounds cool, do you have a picture?
---
yea, I know about the red asylum dress rarity and mass dup of xmas gifts.
---
Having done PParadise once, I figure Bear Arm is a just PITA to get, so it's not that common (ditto the fixer plan).
---
The rest, I wouldn't know unless the seller outright said it.
---
If you're playing solo, go full bush wookie, you'll rank up faster. More time alive means more XP.
---
You sound like Greece a few years back
---
Mods are allowed on PC and they are awesome. You'll want to get the perk loadout manager. Performance is going to depend on your hardware. I get 60fps at 4k.
---
I‚Äôve got another helpful tip. Scrap weapons as much as possible, this is how you learn weapon attachments.  It took me a dozen or so levels to figure that out.
---
The bugged weapons I meant are the weapons with "magical" legendary effects that melt enemies on servers with even slight latency issues.
---
On PC and Xbox, gamepass brought in a lot of new players, so it seems higher levels are spread out among the servers since there are so many new players. I assume it will start to even itself out soon.
---
Just start a new account man.
---
How are you planning to kill players in your team?
---
So I uhhh, didn‚Äôt log out. First time here. And 5 of my 9 are completed. 
---
I should of taken everyone else‚Äôs complaints more seriously üòí
---
I applaud the attempt..I hope I can visit this and hear the wonderful opening Fallout 4 piano notes in the background :)
---
15 int full uny armor for full exp.  Bloody dont matter as much. 
---
Weapon dont matter for 99.9% of content.
---
I think the ban only got people that actually did the dupe. The people I know that duped are literally all suspended at this point. The ones that were at the train station buying all the dupes, and had a ton of dplicates go through their inventory are all still fine. 
---
Here's my advice if you got banned: dont open a ticket. The one guy I know that duped and opened a ticket got a pretty promt email saying they looked into it and his suspension was upgraded to a permanent ban. Best chance is to hope they're overwhelmed and eventually just release the accounts they have left. It'll take a lot of man hours to sort through the massive amount of account actions they gave out.
---
Why has no one said ‚ÄòLook under effects tab in your Pip-Boy‚Äô? 
---
It displays all current effects from food, armour, mutations and even Nerd Rage! Genius I know...
---
Sticking tape on my living room tv is a no no, it‚Äôd annoy the heck outta me...
---
You say that, but the guy who bought a duped item is banned, check the beginning of this thread
---
idk i was doing NW this moring everything was fine. then i get to work and fallout Jesus returned on me. and everyone is crying, and holding they mutated kids, and saying they never duped nothing while wearing a gold rolex. its wierd.
---
Join at the same time and hope for the best. Which did work just now üòÇ
---
Nice man
---
It's not april 1st
---
how? i cant, all i can do is send email verification to a dead email
---
My doctor likes to remind me of this a lot.
---
you know, that's such good common sense and it never occured to me..I thank you!
---
What‚Äôs up your a*s?
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Whitespring likes throwing me lvl 80 when I legendary farm
---
I‚Äôve started blueprinting and bringing in elaborate structures. Makes for some fun and interesting end of matches.
---
Thanjs
---
Lol probably
---
Personally, I love it. My only issue is that it can't be attached to existing foundations (so you can't, say, build a house for a camp and attach this to a doorway for a garage), *BUT* you can still get it close enough to the foundation that it can still be used a garage for a house camp. It's still quite spacey, too.
---
Same, they seem to draw enemy fire.
---
Scarecrows allegedly do to, so they may serve as a first line of defence for your plants, that is if you even want one in your camp.
---
Yeah both times there was like over 5 mins left
---
Yeah sadly we are not sure exactly what makes them auto complete. But logging out before the reset seems to help
---
Man everything affects the real world by that logic. But ask someone that doesn‚Äôt play fallout 76 if it affects them and them and they‚Äôll say no.
---
I do not, not sure how that imigur thing works. If you're on xbox you are welcome to check it out
---
I really wish they'd nerf the range and accuracy of enemies. It's ridiculous how far away they can snipe your camp from. I've had things shooting my stuff that I couldn't even get to load using a sniper scope.
---
I just tried that and it refuses to snap
---
True.  Although we all did get some (mild) suffering already when vendors were turned for a week or so...  At least I could make and sell serums to the bots for some income.
---
Lmao. I would love to meet the lawyer that is taking that on.
---
Wait are you the lawyer?? Even more hilarious.
---
mark it on the list.. they'll get to it.
---
eventually.
---
Thanks but I just meant the quest title...so I can delete until a good one pops up.
---
Might want to make sure you are giving out correct info.

Can he prove that he didn't dupe I'm all for giving him the benefit of the doubt cause Bethesda has made that mistake before but even so it would also depend on how much he got its possible that Bethesda saw a huge increase in the amount of rare items he has  its likely he will be unbanned in a bit of time
---
I use mods on PC all the time.  It says they don't provide support not that you can't use them. Work on your reading comprehension.
---
Great idea.
---
Yeah Ward still is a lazy ass and sleeps most of the day or glitches sitting sideways in his chair
---
It took a while but a stimpak just showed up.
---
Ridiculous
---
This post had me all nostalgic for the launch days of FO4.  Well done!
---
I agree. At the same time Bethesda should ban themselves for never being able to keep their shit in a pile.
---
I do something kinda similar in nuclear winter. I drop in random locations and whenever i get into a fight i immediately throw down my camp and begin spamming vault boy/ baseball player statues. It usually confuses people enough that i can escape. I also usually make it to the top 10 with this tactic and bush wookying lol
---
Np bro.  :P
---
I DID actually fix my performance a little bit. The whole movement and combat system just felt sluggish for a PC game. One suggestion I saw said to disable vsync. So I did that through nvidia 3d options. Another said to disable mouse acceleration, I had not tried that yet.
---
Or some are just tired of grinding the same boring events and trying to get that legendary God roll weapon for half your sole just to try it out. Willing to risk it all for one hell of a fun weekend. It was the best weekend I‚Äôve ever had since launch and for me it was worth a ban. Zero regrets.
---
Haha good for you.
---
This community, man.
---
Yes but that does not mean they are allowed.
---
The only violation in place is your duping on zenimax TOS. Todd thanks you for your money though

If people were never successful in suing Sony or Blizzard for their bans, then i can‚Äôt see this going anywhere
---
This is amazing! Could you post a picture of your vault dweller inside the camp? For size comparison purposes
---
Did you play NW today by chance?
---
Dunno. How much bullion you got saved? Besides some weird bug I‚Äôve never seen before the only explanation is that you were at bullion cap for anything but 100.
---
This discrepancy is exactly what I am talking about...
---
I'd have to say unyielding because of the amount of AP you can stack. You can pretty much rain death on anyone when you're jetpacking and using a stealthboy.
---
Actually, if you pay for a subscription, they have to have proof of cause BEFORE they can ban you. Suspending you pending an investigation is a breach of contract. I am sorry you don't know how the law works.
---
I would start off with a new character to get your bearings, when you‚Äôre ready and remember how to play, start playing your old character again. I did this when wastelanders dropped a few months ago. I made it all the way to level 4 on the new character.
---
What happened? What‚Äôs duping?
---
Gatling laser has amazing accuracy with true long barrels. Two shot is not a good prefix. If you don't want to do Junkie's (honestly, the negatives of addiction are not noticeable at all), go for furious (the gatling later shoots 18/s and over 22/s with faster fire rate - you'll get max bonus after 9 hits). With 3rd rank of power user it gets 1000 shots per fusion core.
---
There really isn't a better gun for casual and chill sessions...
---
A Gatling plasma is great at close range, so keep one as backup I guess?
---
This is not counting legacy. An explosive gatling plasma wrecks everything (including yourself if you hit something too close haha instant death). An explosive gatling laser also wrecks everything, just slightly slower.
---
Great post, i love those ideas as well
---
No not in a few days.
---
Try server hopping. I‚Äôve run into that issue too and what I believe is happening is that someone was there shortly before you were and therefore he doesn‚Äôt have as much as you‚Äôd like. There‚Äôs also a daily limit as to how much you can buy. 
---
I‚Äôve switched servers in the past and been able to buy the max after a few tries. Just try loading in at the wayward so you can walk right in and hopefully no one has beat you to it. 
---
I hope this helps.
---
Damn, i got some questionable items aswell. Not many tho, hope i dont get banned for acquiring them trough trades
---
What discrepancy?
---
Sorry, my bad, didn't see the image link, it looks great!
---
May not be much but at least its somthing.
---
Thanks for the good laugh.
---
 If your account was suspended this last week and you are a Fallout First member, there is a class action lawsuit that is presently being filed. The breach of contract due to the subscription you pay for to access services is in violation of the law. If you are one of the people that have been suspended pending an investigation, then you have been suspended without proof of cause and therefor Bethesda has breached your Fallout First contract. If this applies to you and you would like to know how to become part of this class action lawsuit, please dm me.
---
Yes they are. Reread what it says. It says they are not supported as in no technical support and it may break your game. But it does not say they are not allowed.
---
&gt;The breach of contract due to the subscription you pay for to access services is in violation of the law
---
except *the dupers* are the ones in breach by violating the terms, and therefore, invalidating their subscriptions. legally, they shouldn't be charged in the future, but they have forfeited their right to use the service by violating the agreement.
---
Edit: rethinking this post and my original comment, I think OP completely has a point. I believe dupers should be punished, but Bethesda needs to provide the receipts. They can't just punish people on suspicion and say "oops our bad, at least you can play now!" I don't like cheaters in this game, but I think people need to be a little more rational.
---
Wait why are you trying to do this exactly? Did you get banned or are you just trying to change your email?
---
If you're banned you're better off just making a whole new PSN and going from there. Kinda SOOL.
---
If you just need to change your email but can't cause you can't log in or recover it, talk to PlayStation support. I've had a similar issue and got my account back after answering some questions about it.
---
Second NW I ever did I actually won, but battle royale is dumb. Not gonna play it again.
---
Step 1: If your friends then ask your friend to join a random server. 
---
Step 2: hold down the ‚Äúoptions‚Äù button on your ps4 controller and go to the part of the menu that has your friends
---
Setp 3: select your friend and press join.
---
Septim 4: profit
---
The contract likely stipulates you can be banned pending an investigation, or words to those effect i.e. can suspend for any reason.
---
What did he say?
---
You could, I have seen people who have. Not sure if it was just one suspension/ban wave and it done or there is more. If you haven‚Äôt been suspended yet, then you are probably fine, if there isn‚Äôt more waves.
---
Odd question: does the whiskey bottle (junk) it collects have a white cap on it?
---
Im glad you enjoy the new Scrip, Chores and Other Repetetive Events-system!
---
They did say that the hotfix would help them in figuring the cause out.
---
Yup lost 5 weekly and 4 daily challenges yesterday.
---
yea, its an old email, a very dead one, hasnt been used in a while, so ill talk to them, thank you
---
just 1? I doubt it
---
I'd like this a lot.  lets see some hexagon bases
---
Damn synths
---
I'm not sure what the cap is but I spend gold as fast as I make it.  Hit 1k, get a new piece, repeat.
---
Mine wasn't, because I'm not a cheating idiot.
---
I know one of them is called time to collect
---
Do if it‚Äôs a breach of contract, do you mind sharing the clause of the contract that was breached?
---
&gt;*Todd Howard will decide your fate*
---
I mean you might be banned idk they're shooting the ban hammer blindly
---
Again, I am sorry you don't know how the law works.
---
You bet. Try to remember things you might have purchased. Theyll ask you about it to verify that its you.
---
Looks like you‚Äôve been eating too many of Dilbert‚Äôs Pothole Potpies
---
you said you were not on when the challenges reset , did you play NW last before you logged off last night?
---
Someone's camp. You'll only lose five caps. Store your junk.
---
Probably about 1am. Most of the dailies reset at 1 so my guess, score does too
---
My body my choice
---
I'm going to try this as soon as I log back in.  Hopefully he doesn't give me the cold shoulder and refuse to even open the dialogue options.
---
I tried and it didn't work
---
Suspending while they investigate, which could lead to a ban. Pretty straight forward.
---
Interesting. Then I have no idea. It‚Äôs not something I have experienced but hopefully the other guys comment is correct and it‚Äôs just another...sigh....bug that you can work around by hopping or whatever.
---
That would require proof, suspension prior to proof is in violation of the subscription contract.
---
Made enough money off this game to not care about being banned or how much I paid Bethesda. Just walking away happy
---
Good to know thank you.
---
Oh this is cool. I wish you could share blueprints.
---
Banlanders
---
Dunno what to tell you. I farm legendaries a lot which involves killing a lot of high level mobs all the time. I gain a level in around 30-45 minutes.
---
I only use emergency protocols power armor with bloodied, and the health gauge is like 1/2 the reason why.
---
But pretty boom boom..
---
Well if that makes you sleep better keep with that argument. Just like paying for sex doesn‚Äôt affect everyone right?  It only affects the person that was maybe forced into that trade and their family but it doesn‚Äôt hurt you so it doesn‚Äôt matter. I am sure the people busted for prostitution used that argument with the cops and were let go. üôÑ You obviously do not have a world view on how even small things have great impact.
---
I think they patched the ability to do that.
---
That would be a pretty fun game mode, people all able to play with guns that are fun and not committing to hours of grinding for that nearly unobtainable God roll. I'd love to play I'm a server were everyone is happy with all the guns they have!
---
never effected me ether way. no idea whats going with others though, sounds horrible.
---
Okay, that‚Äôs good to know lol.
---
Yea l agree grass and trees poking through walls etc sucks! Brilliant build though üòç
---
Beating a dead horse
---
Hey man, if thats how you feel, more power to you. Judging by posts and comments though, many don't share that sentiment and are being salty instead of just going "welp, I knew there was a risk."
---
Awesome, thank you for the help.
---
BUAHAHAHAHA :DDD This is the best so far :D
---
Tanks for atoms would 100% be pay to win 
---
/s just in case.
---
there has been some **speculation** that the delay for purchasing ranks is because they dont want people to pay for ranks because they are trying to figure out how/if/when they should compensate players for the score glitch..
---
advancing all players a set number of spaces on the board is the popular front runner.. but of course its all just community guesswork at this time...
---
It‚Äôs not that bad buddy! I just got a lvl 5 two shot pipe revolver! Think about the tedious 20-shot early level combat!
---
Sweet, are we high level now? lol
---
like ghouls or u talm bout them one off deathclawd
---
I‚Äôll buy gamma rounds at any price. Gotta keep that ghoul slayer gamma gun charged.
---
Wastehammers
---
Mods are allowed. But, they are not supported by Bethesda, as in tech support or troubleshooting.
---
That's how it is, the article above explains it, the other poster is just a dumbass.
---
Change server. Sorted.
---
Wait, what is duping?
---
I'd give up virtually all my CAMP budget just to live in a crap-shack with Dogmeat.
---
I built mine the same as my rifleman character. The perk cards are all in perception. 
---
It‚Äôs fun but the firing rate sucks. My alt has a few melee perks for backup
---
I traded for a BE laser rifle last year. I know damn well it's one of a million dupes of the same gun.
---
That doesn't say they are not allowed, it says they won't give technical support and it may break the game. It does not say they are not allowed.
---
Covend-20
---
That's where they said they'd give out Haz-mats. If anything it'd be alot more interesting as a new player to actually walk out into some nuclear fallout.
---
So its hardware issues, not software.
---
Watoga estates has a lvl 3 safe behind the reception desk.
---
I purchase the prefab.
---
Get inside lightin, the rocket have FX on the exhaust port,  the red rocket sing is illuminated and only need 3 power to work.
---
Have 2 doors and take minimal budget. For a std base need 2 prefabs...1 get too overcrowded.
---
Uses own foundation no need to create foundation based on concrete 
---
For 500 atoms is a nice Gesture from Beth.
---
It would be fun I know it as I have some fun legacy‚Äôs I got ages ago so I consider myself lucky
---
Has that been working pretty well in NW? I love blueprinting stuff to bring to NW. You can really employ some psychological tricks to keep opponents guessing. My absolute favorite is just placing a 1 foundation building with 4 windows, 4 clean american flags on them (you can see through them from behind, but they're solid from the front), and a roof. Place that blueprint down like 12-15x in quick succession in your build area, then hide in one of them (blueprint just a wall and flag to replace the wall youre scrapping to get inside one building). Then just sit back and watch the gears turning when they see all the buildings. Will they shoot randomly, drawing the attention of others? If they do and someone else kills them, will the survivor now also search for someone that may or may not be there? Either way, you get to watch the whole thing and are ready when they do shoot down a wall (which rarely happens)
---
The global bandemic.
---
Wow you are literally arguing that duping in a video game is just as bad as prostitution? Damn bro you need a life
---
Center of the screen Just the 1 line with ballistic bock
---
I don't touch NW unless I have to. I haven't played it in a while.
---
He's probably gonna keep them for the ammo converter update.
---
No they said that July 14 u can use atoms 150 per rank
---
While building sometimes things work best standing at a distance while placing. If you walk further away rotate the door it'll eventually snap in place.
---
Op is obviously referring to water tanks 
---
Bow are novelty weapons. They are way too slow and clunky to be efficient in anything else than soloing some dailies. If you encounter a horde of enemies, or you engage in any sort of endgame content (like queen) you are screwed. Not to mention the VATS first shot miss bug is expecially harsh on slow firing weapons like bows. Don't. Just don't. You thank me later.
---
Why don't we all just claim the dupefest was a protest against the SCORE autocomplete bug
---
Did you do something to get banned?
---
ImTotallyInnocentButFoundThisInWhitespringsVendorOrInPaperBagOrThroughVeryLegitTradeWave
---
Too long?
---
EDIT:Forgot to add trade excuse.
---
You said Tanks.. as in Vroom Vroom Bang Bang tanks. I was just poking fun at your mistake.
---
You are aware the law isn't universal, right? Like, other countries deal with this in different ways, yes?
---
I am more than 'up to date' with how the law works, since I have worked in English &amp; Welsh law for more than 15 years now.
---
Through yesterdays hotfix they added extra logging, which will help them find the root cause. It isnt fixed yet, but its their highest priority atm
---
Its weird how few teams I'm finding in general, if there is one then it's the same scenario as you, one full team with maybe one or two randos in there own team. You'd think all the incentives provided would be enough to draw in more of those lone wanderers...
---
To play devils advocate, increasing team size may not be the cure. Imagine how much harder starting your team would be if there was already a full team of 6 or more people. Plus you know people will preffer the team of six since that's 5 additional perk cards potentially shared, caps when someone completes a event, and increased likelyhood of consistently getting x4 bonus. People will keep filling in the moment a member drops.
---
IMO this would make starting a new team from scratch under their shadow all the more depressing. I think team size is dependent on how many cooperative players you have rather then the opposite.
---
Shut mouth
---
Penny drops.Damn now I see how I only got 1 ballistic bock drink and not the unlock.
---
I mean.. Then couldnt we fix all the issues?
---
What type of law are we taking here? Bird law?
---
I bought a duped weapon. But it doesn't matter they robbed me. Its not my fault their shit game has all these game breaking glitches
---
I think Forager gives one called Scavenger Hunt.
---
As someone with the fasnacht bot this seems way less annoying lol I wish there were sound options for the bots like the liberty prime armor
---
Nice! Probably get it tonight!
---
Good to know! Thank you!!
---
I see youre not disputing the ban tho..
---
also this is probably covered in the TOS you agreed to...
---
1000% this. I‚Äôve been begging since backpacks were introduced. Some outfits look good with them some don‚Äôt. Let us decide.
---
That means you were rewarded with 1 ballistic bock to consume. It‚Äôll be in your aid category of the pipboy. 
---
When you unlock the ability to craft it the other message I mentioned will be displayed.
---
I know just ato correct at work
---
It's better than ever with public teams and us veteran players helping out the noobs. I may appear out of nowhere to blow your head off if you have a bounty or to take your workshop if I need it, or just chase you down the road with a chainsaw when I'm bored, but I'll help you out with some supplies and stuff afterwards if you need it.
---
I feel like we need more powerful enemies first.  Except for a few enemies I feel like after lvl 100 there's not much out there that can put up a good fight.
---
So if we start seeing greater than level 95's on a regular basis then I think those mobs should have a chance of dropping higher star items.
---
poorly.. but it is working for me on PC
---
I noticed that too, I wonder if it shows or not for others. I can only hear people now calling us hackers that we're using a non visible jetpack. Unequipping and equipping the chest piece resets it.
---
I wished they made a questline for some legendary power armor. Like that quest in fallout 3 for the t-51b power armor in that military base. So many secrets and codes to get to finally enter the place.
---
Then why did I have to look for him outside the wall 10 minutes ago, and why was he there? Probably because still walks around.
---
It doesn't wanna snap no matter what I do
---
User implied I was upset, because I had to clarify.
---
There are terms to that service.
---
If i want to play a br play this
---
Even Charlie is a better lawyer than this guy.
---
I'll eat an edible then smoke up
---
I think it's a good deal. Nice features and low CAMP budget. Also, besides the specific garage door, you get a free normal use Red Rocket door. But as others have pointed out, it's really too bad the floor doesn't snap to other foundations.
---
That's what you get
---
I did dispute it on their website but knowing bugthesda they'll take weeks to here back from them by then my 1st will already be over
---
Yeah. Found that out the hard way when I fat fingered the wrong button.
---
It is your fault. You partook in the glitch/dupe and violated terms of service. Being out 15 bucks is 100% on you. They didnt steal a thing YOU breached the agreement.
---
I never duped but I'm banned. I tried to dupe and didnt manage it think I had the timing wrong and gave up. I have duped weapons that other people gave me and have 150 holiday presents I was given. Didnt expect to catch a ban since I never duped but hey ho that's what happens, Bethesda will decide my fate now currently only a temp suspension. I paid for a game and didnt harm any other players experience so dont believe I should be banned, hell I gave other players a better experience by giving them god roll weapons that I was given that I wouldnt use and they would.
---
 Dont think I deserved it since I didnt dupe but prepared for all the mad bethesda simps here that definitely tried to get a duped weapon but no one would trade with to downvote me hahahahha
---
Yo. I am 95 and wanna hit 3 digits. I've been helping my team so im low on main ammo but my two backup guns can grind np.
---
What's your psn?
---
Edit: just saw it. Ill add you after work. May be this weekend depending on whether brother plays today or not (he just plays solo games)
---
You broke the ToS you agreed upon. It is totally on you. The charge is for month at a time, not daily. Should have thought about this before using exploits/duping/whatever you did.
---
Thanks.from your first reply I figured that's what happened.silly me.
---
For a buying a duped guns.
---
When fixed I want a protection with Todd Howards face, that slides around on a massive tiger print rug singing It just works.
---
You can nuke several different areas in the forest right now.
---
 I got bronze and silver "ground zero" trophy during faschnacht.   Judging from the number of impolite comments I heard when the warning/zone appeared on the map, lower level players were not amused.
---
Morgantown is nuked semi-regularly.  
---
New Gad catches one occasionally, as does Charleston.
---
Keep doing his daily quests. You‚Äôll get it eventually
---
so you did nothing to get banned? then they will eventually let you back in...
---
Buy a duped weapon
---
That's fair, I can't argue with that, I guess.
---
Especially seeing as there are innocent players being targeted. Sure, they may get their account back in a day or whatever, but it doesn't change the fact that they are being harassed and prevented from playing just because someone at Zenimax didn't like what they saw.
---
You know what, my mistake man. It's easy to get caught up in sub drama. I labeled this as another duper sympathy post, and it very well may be, but I think transparency and a solid foundation to these claims are vital. With exceptions to the obvious (people with thousands of bobbleheads, dozens of the same legacy), nobody should be banned based on suspicion alone. I think dupers should be banned, but not at the cost of innocent players.
---
Nice that the door can be used in other spots! It really is a shame the foundation doesn‚Äôt snap but based on everyone‚Äôs comments still sounds like a good deal!
---
Um.... that‚Äôs not how this works. That‚Äôs not how any of this works.
---
I have a maxed out bow build.  Yeah fire rate stinks and you don't get near the rate that the bow says because you have to draw back the string.  It tends to miss more than it should on vats if you ask me.  I like being able to keep the same arrows and change the bow type with a quick mod, like going from plasma to explosive.
---
As a lark I put ultracite arrows on and did a few queen fights and each time I was able to do enough damage to get her loot.
---
I‚Äôve had it a few times now on PS4. I‚Äôve restarted the game to fix it.
---
you can put doorways back to back, then use replace to change to a regular wall
---
Okay! There goes that theory I guess.
---
But what about the days I already miss of fallout 1st?
---
They broke the contract, they're entitled to nothing.
---
Relax it‚Äôs most likely a temp ban
---
Just playing the game randomly yields me so many legendary items I'm dropping every 1\* armour and weapon and 2\* armour.
---
The biggest problem is that 99,99% of the items are useless to my build or in trading, so the 3\* Bloodied Broadsiders and Ultracite Gatling Lasers are just taking up my stash space waiting to be scripped so I can roll some more scrip. 
---
This is way the dupe wave happened btw.
---
I dunno.. Im not a bethesda rep.. maybe they will give you a free month if youre innocent..?
---
This building design has served me well. Knowing sometimes going on the roof may get me headshot makes the three entrances vital to duck out in a final circle, running out the back is very likely no matter how you place it. I've won a few games from hiding in a building and having others shoot at me, give up their positioning to other enemies and I just sit pretty. 
---
I may make one of those little mouse hidey holes. Have you considered using a version of the brick window that allows you to clip right through it? Make a maze with those. 
---
Building in NW sort of does bring a psychological element into the game, you turn a dwindling duel into your own SAW movie experience if you spawn the right stuff.
---
PA for me was forever ruined in FO4. The way the character sort of bounces around is way off for a hulking suit. Not to mention it ain‚Äôt worth the hassle with cores and damage resistance not being that great.
---
Thanks, I just lie to myself and say it's nature reclaiming a pre-war structure lol.
---
My camp has been on the golf course for ages probably since beta and I hate getting nuked:(
---
That‚Äôs that shit I do like
---
I accepted the risk just to try my unobtainable dream weapons. That was my end game goal after all. This was the exit I needed after 2500hrs playing
---
 your tears are  so salty... mmmmmm
---
Read the ToS
---
The war of banthesda
---
Went to sugar grove
---
Mr. Gutsy wrecked my ass
---
Now I'm scared of bots
---
But im still gonna have those fallout 1st days gone
---
I agree with most of this but it is fun to use.  If the OP has a perception build and enough spare level up points I say try it.  Frustrating at time but fun overall imo.  I put on ultracite arrows and did some queen fights and did enough damage to get her loot.
---
They went into god mode and stacked buffs and gained exp with 1k leader bobbleheads
---
So thaaaaaats how it done!
---
I don‚Äôt think the season will end in 2 1/2 weeks, because it‚Äôs coming in August 4
---
low levels inside morgantown airport terminal, moma dolces, grafton dam....
---
I think there's another outside the airport in morgantown...in the tents next to the terminal building (controls a safe?), but I could be wrong about that one.
---
What‚Äôs your IGN ( in game name) I‚Äôll send a friend request when I get home
---
Nearly everything on 76 roadmaps has been delayed, so just one more. Fret not, you‚Äôll be able to throw money at Bethesda soon enough.
---
They postponed that feature.
---
They should add higher level gear.
---
I got banned and all I did was use the reddit vending should be ok
---
Ok thx for the info
---
Tanagra Town for the crickets.
---
How do you know it was duped?
---
Server hop tangara town. There are cave crickets near the top, you can get 40-50 or so acid a trip
---
Ok mabey cause of hot fix on the dupe
---
I like wonder glue 
---
Sniffing it gets me fucked up 
---
Tell me your secrets
---
your confused. he has full access to his fallout first. he however has ZERO access to fallout 76. which was revoked due to breaking the agreed terms of service.
---
Sounds like you just got one and not the recipe. Keep trying and it will pop eventually. Mine took several days.
---
Op is talking about tanks not ranks. 
---
Thanks for the info OP!
---
I will if I think about it next time I game but if you see the garage the foundations used to create the non-garage area are one floor tile from front door to back and the part of building behind garage with desk and computer is two foundation tiles wide, with garage included I believe it is about 4x4 foundation size for the main area not including the vendors and awning.
---
Well I mean you did attempt to dupe so it‚Äôs kinda deserved but only a temp it shouldn‚Äôt be a perma as you had good intent
---
well.. its not really info so much as hopeful wishes...
---
What?  That‚Äôs your argument that this is a victimless crime and no one cares. Same argument that is used with prostitution. Really hits home when you use a real world example. So run along ‚Äúbro‚Äù. Maybe learn a thing or two about right from wrong. It will help you get a life or at least lead a productive one. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíØ
---
Dupegate
---
Not worried and this is the very casual chat I had in mind when making this thread today.
---
Their emails have indicated they have no way of correcting lost score. We‚Äôre into week three of this and if there was a plan to help those affected they aren‚Äôt telling us. I think the extra daily is the weak attempt to help. Doesn‚Äôt do much when you loose your daily‚Äôs also. I haven‚Äôt seen a single Bethesda employee pop into one of these threads to give any reassurances.
---
Thats impossible for any developer.  Just because an exploit is there doesn't mean you get to take advantage of it.  If someone in public leaves their wallet unattended on a table you shouldnt take all the cash out when no one is looking.  
---
Just because you have the opportunity to do something against the rules that will benefit you doesnt mean you should take it.
---
Dupemas 2020
---
Can't say I'm part of banhamerwave cause i haven't been banned 
---
‰πÅ[·ìÄÀµ‚ñæÀµ·ìÇ]„Ñè
---
If you didnt dupe, you deserve your noctural rolling pin. No amount of  whining about "the people who control the market" will change that.
---
So it's their fault you used a exploit and knowingly duped items :DDDDDDD
---
That damned ato correct
---
Will do, thanks
---
So because I knew someone that duped it means I duped and should be banned even though my friend that has duped guns is still playing rn
---
I wouldn't expect much less than that with the raider tag lol, fun is fun, thanks for being one of the good ones though
---
I would absolutely love to nuke Vault 76.
---
Iboughtitbrobannation.
---
Yea I was thinking it was cause of hot fix of dupe and banning
---
Snallygasters and bears. EDIT: Sorry, didn‚Äôt read carefully enough that you had it covered already.
---
It never gives
---
We're the captain now
---
If before the dupe 99% of the weapons i got where scrip the rng in this game is the baddest in any game i ever played
---
I think it something with the challenges being bugged and completing themselves which could force those affected to buy ranks. Or there is a case there at least in the EU but that's just my theory.
---
If you got banned for buying a single duped weapon, I'd say that a high percentage of the player base would have been banned by now. There's more that you're not telling.
---
Seeing as a community manager messaged me... yes I do.
---
I didn't dupe anything I bought a duped guns from someone but the guy that duped and has all the guns is playing rn
---
Your post history shows that you were duping. You were selling dupes. And you were helping others dupe. Don't blatantly lie to us.
---
i run a bloodied bow build for fun. but due to fire rates it is not viable in most event . due to swarming.
---
Lmaooo imagine asking for support and the expected outcome is nothing
---
Ah I didn't see that! Where do they usually post these things?
---
How many times have they done a banning spree now? (Stopped playing a year ago but recently started again)
---
I read someone took a year to get it.That's why I was so happy when it popped up.ah well back to the grind.
---
Joseph Anderson on Youtube actually calls it Bethesda's Bug: Is it a bug, or an unintended feature?
---
Because he most likely duped it with a friend and then tried to hide the weapon behind the old "bought it from a random persons vendor" thing.
---
Did you play NW before log out? Did you access the atomic shop before logging in?
---
With limited access to stuff, I think you nailed it. Fantastic job! üëçüõ†Ô∏è
---
I finished becketts on my big guns character. Currently working on commender dagaurres on my bloodied character.
---
Honestly, one of my fave mods of the game!
---
Check their post history. They were duping.
---
It only cost 3 corn
---
What do you think TOS is? It's a contract that you promise not to break, and he broke it
---
Even triggering VATS will consume AP, which drains your core a bit. I don't think its that much just to target, though.
---
Vats eats threw you fusions cores. Any movement also drains it, sprinting and jumping drain them faster
---
I honestly wish more would have been banned! I know tons of people that I played with regularly that were duping just so much, none of them got banned.
---
I wish the shopping mall would be turned into a community hub.
---
Tangara town, Treetops for what ever is there and toxic Larry‚Äôs meat co for the snarlygasters.
---
I have been playing with the train car in workshops etc. too but after it seemed some lost space due to electrical wire scrapping in mt camp occurred I trashed it. It was good though, probably scrap the truck stop in a week or so and rebuild my old one. I just unlocked the star wallpaper which had a perfect place in my previous camp but no use now. It was a good waste of time making it though. Fun and mildly frustrating, I thought it would be easy lol
---
I was already moving to a Bloodied build prior to seasons starting, but I've noticed such a difference it makes when you take the time to really turn the math in your favour, which is a disadvantage to anyone with a different kind of build, new to the game, or doesn't have the time to figure it all out.
---
Stop lying, we can see your post history.
---
There's a way. You have to use the flamer trap to destroy a piece of the roof. Then build the piece next to it and so on. After you are done repair the destroyed pieces and voila! A round roof. I'm terrible at explaining things so I will try to find the link for the post I learned it from.
---
Edit: here's the link Circle roof!

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault the bank deposited $10,000 in my account, they shouldn‚Äôt have charged me overage fees for spending money that wasn‚Äôt mine‚Äù
---
Today is the first time I forgot to log off. Fortunately I didn't have any problems either.
---
yeah I'm thinking you might be right
---
Sounds like blantant cheating to me.
---
Check their post history.
---
Can you control the new one by cutting power to the whole building?
---
I was messing around with various methods to power it with/without turning on the neon and the rocket but I didn't notice if the door was moving.
---
They haven't banned any of the players from the stackable dupe
---
I was online about 25 mins before the reset. And I kept checking how much time I had left. Until it was 0 minutes left in the menu bar. Came back a min later and it reset the 24 hours but with 5 of my challenges complete. I should of just logged out. I felt like maybe I was the 1 percent since it hadn‚Äôt happened to me yet. üò£
---
:D :D :D

Are you high? üòÇ Or are you just extremely bored?

Nah man, all good, cheers.

Hotel outside flatwoods has a level 0 box .

No, door is purely manual ‚òπÔ∏è

Freakin awesome!!!

I couldn't get it to work either at first.  ultimately I had to stand just inside the doorway looking out and move my bullseye over the side of the door, but a little off center, then it decided to snap. but as I was trying to build it, it took up my whole screen nearly.  annoying.  good luck. it will eventually work.
---
Tanagra town and abandoned train yard are by far the best, unless you go private world and use extractors at hemlock. 
---
Doing the circuit of Tanagra, abandoned train yard, snallies below hemlock with the Grafton monster can easily net you 200 a circuit. Most I‚Äôve ever gotten from Tanagra alone was 86 and 2 legendary crickets to boot. 
---
Server hopping just Tanagra is probably better overal,  but that actually takes longer for me because my camp is in a popular spot, so it takes me 14 attempts of the game trying to put me in the same server before I can get on, so I‚Äôm reticent to leave a world I‚Äôm on anymore.
---
Makes no sense if a bank did that they would be at fault not the paying customer who didn't even know the money was there
---
I don't know how people know where and how to do this. I found a door sticking out of the ground at one camp, you open the door to a small, very small cave that had the top of the player's piano barely sticking out of it. If you play the piano, the sitting animation brings you into his underground camp/vault which was well laid out. Not sure how this is done or even figured out by people. Blows me away.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
What I‚Äôm gathering from all the replies is that it‚Äôs counterproductive to use them over something else. That sucks but now I have a reason to go back to my initial plan of shotguns
---
Interesting. I‚Äôd like to see some actual proof of people getting un suspended this quickly. I‚Äôm sure its happening slowly though.
---
Camp fire tales can be farmed for a lot of acid, 
---
 going to hunters ville and searching the meat bags.
---
How ever acid can be found all over, usually along side lead. Work out a good route and hit a few locations, I can farms 1000+ acid an hour if I'm really going for it, up to 2000 if I can farm campfire tales.

I saw a lv 70 attack my 3 star mirelurk king and message me to pvp him so he could kill it over psn
---
You should recreate this with dark matter captain cosmos power armour chassis‚Äôs and one normal captain cosmos chassis if you unlock the skins!
---
Ah, I hadn't thought about the shared perks and caps, good shout. 
---
Should it may be that each server has one team to join per group? One for events, one for INT, etc etc, rather than personal teams? Again keep the bond capped at 4x. If the entire server joined one team, there's the issue of all the potential perks being shared. But then again, everyone benefits from that, so it isn't necessarily a downside
---
Fair game now bud, on you go! Here, I'll even help you light your cigar. Lock n Load!!
---
lol.. ya cant fix stupid yo
---
And jetpacking is lethal.
---
Love PA all the same.
---
you should be a lawyer
---
Of course you did nothing but buy a single weapon. 
---
Copied from one of your other posts"
---
"I'll help you dupe them thats how much they are worth."
---
I‚Äôve been saying that for weeks. I‚Äôve been at work and logged off. I‚Äôm sorry it happened to you also, but that isn‚Äôt causing this.
---
The syringer needs a serious power boost. 
---
Really wish they would improve it, and the chainsaw.
---
Is it on xbox
---
I learned that Bulking Acid yeilds in MORE acid so Bulk it all when you can. Few scrap items actually reduce weight from the individual scrap numbers so avoid them unless you're selling some back to a vendor.
---
toothpaste also cleans old plastic car gauges, endless uses
---
I hear it works on teeth too
---
read your terms of service. you violated the agreement and your permission to use the software was revoked without warning. you can as the email stated contact customer support and see if it was done in error. but you know and i know you duped. you so duped. and you got caught. Soooo hit the road jack and dont you come back no more no more no more......
---
It's all good, I suspect you'll find most players doing the same things are just bored and will be happy to help you out too if you communicate with them. We're all just waiting on something actually challenging to do at this point since they removed the Vault raids.
---
Every 8? Can you spend my scrip for me please? I spent every last scrip I got for 100 lvls after 50 and still haven't rolled a weapon worthy of everyday use for any build. I Just keep getting more scrip fodder. I don't even want junkies/bloodied. Just something furious, executioner, quad maybe, but nope nocturnal, ghoul/mutant slayers, assassins, or troubleshooters is all I ever get. Good armour rolls, nope. Here have some auto stim or life saving 1\* garbage. I'm nearly 1000 hours in and have gotten garbage for all my effort.
---
It's not quite the same, but my favorite thing to do when griefed is to get killed, wait a minute before seeking revenge, pop a stealth boy, then drop a few OS beacons, whip out my BE Gatling Plasma, and carpet bomb tf out of their base. I completely demolished someone's camp in less than 5 seconds, starting with the radshower and generators.
---
We need power armour stands, NOW!!!
---
I read it wrong sorry lol
---
That‚Äôs a good idea. My picture now though (I just logged on for today) wouldn‚Äôt be very believable since it‚Äôs been a couple hours.
---
You are the one crying, dude.
---
JUst answered another on this, it was hell. Moved around sideways, from inside, from out etc. until one movement saw a brief flash of green. Then I spammed the place button while trying to pass back and forth over that one green flash until I hit it at just the right time. Took a long time. The irony is I scrapped it. It will (and often) auto-shut visually and physically but the game will still register it as open, so you then have to close it and open it again to have an open door, which will just auto-shut again. I just scrapped the door.
---
For sure. Using the jet back you can see your core going down haha
---
System?
---
well played.. you should keep this in clipboard for future use..
---
in fact im replying to your post so I can steal that shit and post it like it was my research later..
---
thanks yo!
---
Bummer. Xbox
---
LOL,thanks for pointing that out.
---
I got four 3-star legendaries there yesterday.
---
all you're doing is making me realize how much I need and miss Dogmeat.
---
Not yet.
---
I typically go the opposite way and let them get the first hit before finishing the enemy off.  I will only shoot them first if they're getting overwhelmed or are about to be attacked from behind.
---
What about fixes to the Vault 94 scout mask? How about allowing me to fast travel? If you listen to your fan base how about you get rid of the useless primary categories of ‚ÄúGhoul slayers/Mutant slayers/Exterminators/Hunters‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôm glad and ban wave was issued but this seemed selfless on Bethesda‚Äôs half, why can‚Äôt you utilize these hot fixes for problems we‚Äôve been urging to fix  pay attention to your fan base and these exploits wouldn‚Äôt happen
---
You have to buy them from sunny
---
My turrets still go haywire on friendlies and yesterday my vendor.  Thought they fixed that last last patch.
---
But they didn't accept my offer I didn't help em dupe cause they never replied
---
That's crazy. Wonder if that's how it got its name in the first place.
---
Its like bethesda was a school shooter and just indiscriminatly shot bans at everyone who critiqued or bullied them so "bethumbine banning"
---
OMG YES!  But instead of doing a small quality-of-game improvement like this, that would make so many camp builders happy, they'll probably spend months of development time making some new crappy game mode that nobody wants or plays.  Then force people to play it by making it a Season reward.
---
It happened to me so should now be fixed
---
It's not been released yet, think it's been held back the now.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Legendary dragons are legacies?
---
The only plan I've seen any of the sunnys sell is the plan for the bow itself.
---
They care more about duping sooo
---
I used to take so much group photos back them
---
I did not to either
---
You need higher rep to buy them
---
Yeah like I'm not mad I knew the risks when I attempted it but seeing people with those sweet new weapons I wanted to be able to dupe some good stuff to trade to get something. Ended up getting them without needing to dupe but here we are, i kinda just want to know the exact reason ahhahah
---
You have to place it, it's beyond hard to get it in place. It's under walls. Also, it's bugged and auto-closes all the time but the game still thinks it's open so in order to enter through garage door you have to then "close" it and open it again, 2 animations for a bug. Not cool, I just scrapped it.
---
Do you have an idea for why it's being held back?
---
jeez, glue is for weapon repair not sniffing!
---
What exploit?
---
Thanks.
---
I tell you one thing I‚Äôve done which is fun I‚Äôm my workshop blueprint 
---
If you place a switch on the wall it will just clip through to connect above making it flush. So what I do is place a missile turret by the door. 
---
I already have 4 heavy mg on the top so if it gets swamped I open the garage door and throw the switch and it‚Äôs hilarious to watch
---
This is a good idea but because the max player limit is only 24 I can't see any supposed hub location ever being very full.
---
How high. I'm Cooperative with both.
---
nice
---
Still need any help?
---
I don't play after 9 a.m. CST for many reasons. I'm not going to hit the max rank anyway. I don't log in until after 1 p.m. CST and I don't have this problem. Something else is causing it.
---
Yeah. There is a way to earn a little settler rep from the former raider daily, though - send them to foundation for a little settler rep.
---
Lmfao! Too funny. 
---
Todds probably wiping his ass with that 15 bucks right now.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/wuhbjLi](https://imgur.com/a/wuhbjLi)  
---
Here is more if people want to see some hot piece of ass.
---
do the raiders settlers quests up to a point, then you can get the plans for explosive, plasma, etc frames for the bow/crossbow. Then later w/ max rep the compound bow plan
---
[edit: words]
---
Friendly I think. Ally is for the compound and mods
---
I'm not sure how to reply.
---
dunno, wife has a JE plasma gatling from early beta and she's not banned, ymmv
---
Did you get the other guys Bhm? because I'm on now if you want mine.
---
Smash for this. Smash for that
---
If I recall, the update notes yesterday indicated that they added logging to challenges in the backend to try and collect data regarding the bug.  That does not sound to me like they have "no plans to fix".  They just dont know what they're looking for/at in terms of the actual problem.
---
Did they? Do you know why they did that?
---
thanks
---
good lord those are some god rolls though
---
Lucky hole mine with that PA. Kill some cultists get some Xp and mine all the lead. I can rarely be bothered searching every single ore vein down in there, and I still end up with about a thousand lead usually after smelting.
---
As an aside there are like 6 or 7 ore deposits at hornwright 03 also, right behind the fast travel spot, as well as a lot of iron around the place.

I think if they had an option prior to joining a server this could be fixed.  Play -&gt; Join Building Team ... Poof, you are loaded into a server that has a building team and automatically added to it.

Lucky Hole Mine by Fort Defiance is currently the best place to farm lead ore. Can net about 500 lead with the PA inside the mine

Cite applicable law then

Happens to all of us. :)
---
my friends who play every single day for the past months suddenly aren't coming online anymore...can i see if they have been banned?
---
I stopped using defenses and the scarecrow and find my CAMP needs much less maintenance and receives less direct attack then when I had defenses up. I have no proof but it seems like to me, defenses just put a target on your camp with the AI.
---
Thank you. I must not have made it far enough to find the veins early so I thought with Wastelanders this mine was just a spawn site for cultists.

I prefer marine armor for the rad resistance. Secret service would also be good but they currently do not have ultralight mods for limbs so that's a deal breaker for me.

Yes I‚Äôll be home in about two hours
---
Dude this is way to funny, not only is this guy a phony pothead, but he clearly was duping himself and now is crying about how he did nothing wrong, what a goof, please cry a little more like a baby so I can lick up all those salty tears
---
Prob using it to snort chems off OP's mums arse.
---
Only 4 levels? Hell im lvl240 and I still get just over 1 full level for doing that event (with the tent spawn glitch ofcourse) just tag the mob with a little AOE.
---
However, those methods are completely legit and not done by exploiting the game.
---
Scavenger trader.
---
I heard he prefers buffats
---
Oh... uhhhh... can you confirm your pip-boy works fine? Sounds like Bethe- err Vault Tec gave you a faulty product.
---
Exactly this. So many people think you can quickly fix a bug, and if it takes this much time Bethesda doesnt care about said bug. Coding just takes a lot of trial and error, this issue is their highest priority right now, so much so they delayed purchasing SCORE ranks till its fixed.
---
I call it ‚ÄúThe Real End Game‚Äù we have all been searching for.... I mean, getting that unicorn was so many players end game and getting to play with it for an entire weekend was priceless.
---
I started my first break from 76 when the score update came out and broke a lot of stuff. I'll be back some time after those things have been fixed.
---
Umm I apologize if I‚Äôm confused but are you just looking for lead ore? If so go to lucky hole mine in the south east. Also get the super duper perk so when you smelt it all down you can walk out it with about 2000 lead scrap. Also another spot down in the south west for steel where you can get similar amount in like 10min. Also if you need acid to smelt it all down go farm tanagra town in the mire you can get 80ish every run
---
Ive only done a few recently but it seems as awful as ever..
---
Nah it‚Äôs really spread out all over the place. It‚Äôs a mini maze but easy to traverse when you get used to it. 
---
People tended to advise using the glowing ore mod for that place in particular so you can see it all better, but considering the current ban shit, even though it‚Äôs never been an issue and isn‚Äôt really related, mods have never been officially sanctioned I don‚Äôt believe, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it personally, but that‚Äôs just me being overly cautious üòÅ
---
no or they'd call it tv screen paste, that's silly
---
Adv xp is rewarded for kills. The more active you are, the more you earn.
---
For a win, with 3-9 kills (on average), I get anywhere from 1200 - 1800 per match.
---
But does just using vats for like a second use more core or does actually shooting in vats use it?
---
Yesterday I was at a Heart of the Swamp with a few others. We found the heart, killed the initial group of mirelurks, then didn't recieve any more objectives when those came up as completed. The HUD just showed the event and the time left. I ran around for a few minutes to make sure no random strangler enemies were left, but there was nothing. And no, the strangler heart was not open, nor could any of us damage it. I don't even think it showed a health bar.
---
I have had much better luck since around The time wastelanders dropped. Not from The queen tho, just in General much better drops all around
---
1. No. Stash is different from in-game world containers that anyone can take from.  
---
2. They're not blueprints. There are Recipes for food/drink/etc. and Plans for both gear and CAMP items. They are found in the NOTE section if your person and Stash inventory and in the same for every Vendor; IF they sell any of them.
---
3. At level 5, PvP is automatically turned on. You can turn it off again by going into settings and turning on Pacficist mode. You can turn it off again if you wish.
---
I play on xbox but I'll check if they have something like that on there
---
So pretty much every really good weapon in the game should just be assumed a dupe?  I mean how the hell do you expect everyone to know what is and isn't duped?
---
Personally, I play self found (when I play).  I trade for materials and recipes with friends and that is it.  
---
However, I am not self-righteous enough to think everyone should play my way, nor should everyone just trade for items that have shitty rolls just to avoid being a dupe trafficker.  
---
Every item I see someone playing with that is good, I suspect is probably duped.  I don't feel like they should be punished for it, as the game is set up to allow easy trading and even vending.  
---
So unless someone is distributing duped items or actively duping them, there is no reason whatsoever to punish them for having a duped item, unless you think nuking the majority of the playerbase is a great idea.  Because if you have played for more than a year, you likely have a duped item or two (or have used duped cosumables), and that is just factual.  The duping has been far too prevalent with ammo, chems and god rolled weapons/armor.
---
Hell, even if you just loot items, you likely have duped shit.  Someones bag they dropped on death, a random weapon that was dropped in a bunch of other weapons (caught many people doing this with duped weapons early in the game), etc.  
---
So you might be a trafficker yourself and just didn't realize it.
---
I want powdered wig now.
---
Make it happen please, send daily suggestion emails.

You can only choose between the options you own.

I promise any one that shows up a 3 star if they don't kill it.

I got mine to fit, but I ended up removing it because it was closed every time I logged in, and that's where I have my vendors. I dont want people to think I shut it to keep people away from my vendors..
---
To be fair I see Bethesda just perma ing your account because of it
---
Yeah. I had a Jetpack and ate throw 3 full cores in a blink of an eye so I changed to the Assembled (faster AP refresh speed)
---
I play at night too, Eastern time. With all of the new players it's hard to join queen lobbies but I see a few of them on xb1. These drops have made it a lot more entertaining.  Lol.
---
Dude you stayed on top of this degenerate. Good on you. If you're on ps4 "i can tell that we are gonna be friends...." üéµ
---
he's just come out of the vault.. doubt AOE was an option :)
---
Probably more of case that they couldn't tag enough enemies before they died. I took my 22 there and got 3 levels but only because i had a fast firing weapon.
---
Anything that uses ap will drain it
---
Please. Your boos mean nothing, I've seen what makes you cheer
---
Theyve delayed purchasing ranks untill this issue is fixed. They are also working on a way to right the wrong of losing out on SCORE. When they say they cant give players SCORE, that means the support team cant give you SCORE. They have limited tools when it comes to helping players, thats why when its a coding issue they refer it to the dev team, such as the SCORE bug. There is a plan to restore SCORE loss, they are looking for an effective way to implement it.
---
Bloodied Tuesday
---
Stealth armor isnt tradable unfortunately. If you missed out on it you can pickup the plan from foundation for like 4k gold bullion when you get enoigh reputation.
---
Can you please post a link for the datamined items?
---
Ah ok. Thanks. I‚Äôve been hoarding fusion cores and have like 40 full ones on me. I used to use the jetpack but like others have said it eats through cores. (I don‚Äôt have the perk that makes them last longer yet)
---
We have the option as well. It's X. But it's greyed out at this time.
---
It kind of makes me want to actually spend script and see what I can roll now at the legendary vendor.  Lol.
---
Solos are difficult? It take me about 15-20 to run through it. The only time I die in one is when I kill myself with explosive .50
---
If its PS4, you'll even lose access to games you already "own" as well.
---
Looking to make your own case?
---
Its like the fast travel bug, in one post community dev confirmed its an ongoing issue that has multiple causes and hard to nail down.
---
Some bugs are not as simple as change 1 value and fixed.
---
What I love about video games and most communities is apparently everyone who plays has a development background. And in every community everyone acts like their game is the only game to have bugs in the history of video games.
---
I though scrip reset was 20 hours or something like that, not tied to a specific time of day.
---
Or the girl in crater aeri I think
---
Xbox
---
It is every 20hrs. Same as the vendor bots caps.
---
Yours has a roof?
---
*Fancy.*
---
A combination of that and S.C.O.R.E. probably.
---
I see your point.  Not sure how to make that one "fair" for all levels though?
---
low level scorched are what, 17xp?
---
10k/17= 589 dead scorched.  
---
(a really long time.)
---
===
---
IIRC, L62 charred ghouls are worth about 115xp
---
10k/115= 87 dead ghouls.
---
(maybe 30 minutes and maybe one server hop. repeat)
---
Completing events etc that are already dailys or weeklys - that's balanced, as the system doesn't make a distinction between taking out 15 scorched at collison course or 15 ghouls at One Violent night.
---
 Terms of service are not law, nor are they legally binding. Terms of service can be, and have been, ignored in courts of law before as it is illegal to violate or abridge someone's rights in a contract. I.E. you can not sign yourself into slavery. If you haven't learned the law, please sit down.
---
I'm a Bloodied Build;
---
Watch me destroy everything!
---
Then die of a scratch.
---
On the substance of your post, I have memories of those days but also was there when people started one hit them and leaving others out of the rewards. I can still farm legendaries there, it's just not as often but also not as crowded which I personally like. I don't want to miss the shot on one and I often accidentally one shot them without even trying so I don't want to screw over others. Personally I think we just need a true player hub. For fighting ghouls with others and showing off gear with potential legendary creatures. It would be cool if there was a radiated building that was spawning ghouls and when it goes off it'd be a server wide hoard mode people could join in if they wanted to. 
---
On a political and very petty note, why do I cringe when anyone says make "blank" great again?
---
Was in Grafton and noticed a dog with a bandana sittin on a porch. No interaction options tho. Then some radtoads killed it while I was about to research it haha
---
Yes! It should be on all platforms save for Switch
---
The settlement building is simple enough, but it has so many options you can go from little shacks (always my preference) to farms to entire cities with shops and people living in it (that you have to kidnap first). The UI is a little overwhelming at first and has room for improvement, Ill say Fallout 4's was better. 
---
I suggest starting out w a "cheat server", set all of your resource settings to max so you can just relax and build. However the survival aspect is also really fun and tense. I think its $40 but it goes on sale regularly and might even be on gamepass now bc its been free on PS+ a few times. 
---
Gameplay wise it sorta feels like a bridge between Skyrim and Oblivion with Minecraft elements. All the milestones of a Bethesda game: odd voice acting, uncanny models, shotty animations, bad combat, but it manages to be a fun time if you enjoy settlement building.
---
Are they really suggesting that?  I have not had any challenges auto-complete as I make sure to log out completely before reset but that would be wild.  Free score i guess.
---
Darn. No help here. Might want to edit your post to tarfet your demograph. Goodluck!
---
If you just logged in and go straight to those tabs then it would show.  
---
I still haven't logged in after the rollover and won't for awhile.  
---
In preparation for "Ghost of Tsushima" I'm watching "Seven Samurai" (3 hours).  
---
Pictures taken with a cell are time-stamped and you can see when you logged in recently.
---
It sucks but hopefully they'll compensate for the issues and find the bug.
---
im not sure if she is still there, but once you beat the questline, the suit is available through the Foundation's gold bullion vendor once your rep with them is high enough.
---
both the plans and the suit itself cannot be dropped or traded. they are player-exclusive items.
---
I can get 2.000+ for the 2 sentry bots in less than 5 seconds, but i guess adventure xp isn¬¥t the goal here so it is ok... would be a plus tough.
---
From the horses mouth (aka July 14 hotfix notes)...

"Implemented logging that will help to better track and find the root cause of an issue that can result in Daily and Weekly Challenges completing automatically. Addressing this issue is a top priority for us right now. The information we will receive from this additional logging will help us track down a fix more quickly. "
---
Fixing faults isn't always quick and easy however much some claim it to be, especially when it's intermittent or has no obvious cause.
---
It isn't invented for like another 100 years.
---
Scrap any bloodbug proboscis, bloatfly glands, Abraxo, and if I recall correctly antifreeze that you find.
---
*headslap
---
Green thumbs! Fml that's what I wasnt doing. 
---
yeah its pretty great..
---
my favorite so far is the class action lawsuit clown.. lol
---
TOS? how do they work? hahaha
---
Use a courier.
---
I was looking for a nuke zone because I wanted to farm up some flux. I hopped words at least a dozen times just to find one in the bog. Nobody was anywhere near and I had a good 25 mins or so to farm in relative peace. I did run into a *** wendigo Colossus that I had to run from since there was nobody nearby to help.
---
I'm hoping I can find more high level players doing nukes this weekend since it will be double XP.
---
ü•∞
---
Theres a few locked doors inside fort defiance
---
Maybe it was my mistake then. I thought they reset at the same time everyday. Thanks!
---
Is it a separate door item from another time or did it come with it?
---
If you dooped a single gun, you deserve the ban. A single tos violation is still a violation. The magnitude is irrelevant.
---
Getting hit by the cryo (blue) floaters drains fusion cores!
---
Might be worth it. For example i have gotten 2 junkies fixers, 1 bloodied gatling plasma, 1 bloodied explosive gatling gun and a bunch of tse, aae during just a couple of months
---
I mean you do have the right intentions but don‚Äôt you think the people you should be targeting are the ones who own mules rather than idiots who know no better than just to dupe,no way am I saying duping right but I hardly find it fair the lv 600 with the mule doesn‚Äôt get banned but the lv 60 who bought a duped gun gets banned ,btw I am banned before you asked so maybe I am biased who knows rly?
---
Thanks! I thought it was set to a specific time.
---
And thank you for that, I used to dupe in games years ago, just decided I don't want to anymore, I enjoy grinding for things so my games last longer.
---
here you go pal..
---
terms of service for fallout 76 1st
---
"You may cancel your membership at any time. Any cancellation will be effective at the end of your then-current membership term. Bethesda reserves the right to change the fees or billing methods at any time upon notice to you via email and through your account. If you pay a periodic (e.g., monthly) subscription or membership fee for a Service, Bethesda will provide you with at least thirty-five (35) days advance notice of any such changes. You may cancel if you do not agree to such change."
---
you agreed to it. weather you use it for 1 minute or 1 day or 30 days. it's their money. o and feel free to cancel at any time.
---
I believe it is also a rare drop from savage divide.
---
Also- good luck on the Shielded. I have 1000 hours of game time and have done those quests a bajillion times and have never gotten it on any of my characters.
---
If you no lifed this game and used all xp buffs smartly, that‚Äôs totally reasonable.
---
So, I can sit next to you then yeah?! Budge up. You're bullshit's taking up all the room.
---
You're absolutely right. I wanted something like Boston's Red Rockets. I bought the log cabin bundle hoping to build something like Pioneer Scout Camp or the mountain cabins, it was just a prefab üòí
---
I grew to enjoy it kinda.
---
I was however suprised at the explosive bows performance in NW, not my first option but I've downed players with it.
---
I think if you capitalize on the explosive bow and related perks it could be more effective at swarm control as long as you have a nimble character who can round them up and kill em all in one shot with that double explosion radius.
---
Mind you, explosive doesnt count as a legendary modifier.. so you can stack on others, I presume you can get instigating or two shot (idk what's available for bows)
---
I would also relly on stealth and escape artist, just tag the queen with consistent sneak attacks.
---
I've got a lvl 40 side character I'm going to change to a bow build just to see for myself.. but that has to wait to the end of the season now cuz the unyielding xp grind has me on my main.
---
Will continue to do research, determined to break the bow in some legit way just to see peoples reactions.. Though that's most unlikely.
---
I think (based on what others have said) anything that uses or affects AP drains the core. So maybe the curl effect lowers your AP?
---
Nah, trying to see what  your qualifications are for speaking about law since you haven't provided any.
---
I havent played since sunday because of a trip and I'm paranoid that when I get back today I will be banned. I've never duped anything (other than with super duper) and with all this talk of banning and me not trusting Bethesda to properly ban people, I'm worried me and many others who are (claiming at least to be) innocent will be banned.
---
Welcome to the game, you must be new.
---
Someone did a map of the mine.

---
Thanks friend, that gave me an idea of its size. :) I think I'll buy that bundle
---
You know what I mean lol. They are a bit of a challenge, not a place to to get good loot. I do find a lot of decent mats in there though. I run stealth, doing silos is kind a walk in the park for me. (Except that one assaultron in that one hallway, you know the one...)
---
people on reddit have said they want that.. bethesda has typically said nothing
---
Cheers! They're also a homophobic fuck. Xbox unfortunately! Love The White Stripes too!
---
but only if you have the actual food/drink available in your vendor :)
---
They use that line WAY too much...
---
I like my alarm towers. Its funny watching people come creeping out of the brush to come see ehats happening
---
I'm having worse luck on the queen then ever, but luckily my bloody weapon drop rate is back up to prime levels for the first time in months.  Good thing I'm not a bloody build.
---
I will try this and pray it works thanks for the heads up coach
---
It‚Äôs not a *full* roof though! There‚Äôs a few big holes!
---
Also use this  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
it's pre wastelanders so a few bits of info may be wrong. 
---
basically hit up those gyms
---
Hoes mad bc hoes broke tos
---
in water or dry land?
---
I'm happy with it, they can slide down my ufo slide that you also get from the board.
---
Ah, I understand. I hope someday they put somebody in charge that actually understand the community and doesn't give into commands of people who don't want to work for things :/
---
Oh man. We woulda been best cross over buds. I got asked like 20 times if i was gay in june. I said "nah im not that cool" every time. :) when they cross play imma jam out with you, brother/sister/whatever-the-fuck ya are :D
---
Edit: type-o
---
Not often on something that would actually make them money. Something must really be wrong with the rank up system if they delayed that cash cow. It would be in their best interest to fix it as soon as possible if they want people to spend as much money as they possibly could.
---
Lunchboxes, cranberry relish, well rested, inspirational, unyielding gear, grinding high level mobs nonstop for hours on end. 
---
Again, it takes dedication but totally doable.
---
Your reward for victory is more testing! -Zax
---
I always carry a couple toxic goo after a west tek run .
---
I mean idk how to do it but I‚Äôve been getting a lot of xp by doing tons of queen runs and being in a event team
---
That‚Äôs the beauty of fo76 being an online game, now we can force Bethesda to add in obvious stuff like this.
---
you know what.. it doesnt matter anyway.. 
---
ill be on in 5 minutes 00huntr00 join on me.. 
---
ill be in the stream right behind flatwoods.. Ill eat a grenade for you
---
Why would they even want the ammo he probably doesn‚Äôt use? Can‚Äôt sell ammo yet can you? I haven‚Äôt been on in a while
---
They should add the floor skins for the prefab stairs that go up to a second floor. Or make it customizable to have different combos of stair/floor skins so that you can make less clutter if that makes sense.
---
Quite possibly. I ways think of it as cryo = very cold and very cold = draining battery irl haha
---
Ah! Good point.
---
Thanks for listening and not just yelling like half the others I spoke to so far
---
No worries I'm going to put it up on my camp and if you're on and I'm still on I'll take it down and give it you.
---
Oh crap, a year!?! I got it on two characters and don‚Äôt remember it taking very long at all. Just hope luck is on your side.
---
it says ‚ÄúENDS IN XX HOURS XX MINUTES‚Äù at the top of the screen lmao just check. Same time everyday
---
It‚Äôs like a Zjob
---
more like a daily karma farm.
---
My thought was it ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù the electronics/suit so they have to work harder to preform at normal capacity so that drains it. Like in Iron Man when his suit got too cold it ‚Äúfroze‚Äù and everything failed. Just without the failing part.
---
not sure if it is still around since yesterdays hotfix, but a handful of players already used god mode to achieve level 100 within the first week.
---
I only go into PA for rad resistance and big boss fights, the loss of legendary effects is too crippling.
---
Market value is whatever someone will pay.  So if they sold at a price higher than your preference, then the price is self-justified.
---
You are trying to force your ideals onto everyone else and ignoring the basic principles of a true free market.  Anyone can price anything at any price.  If you don't like that price, you don't have to buy it.  
---
The price someone places on something in a free market that has no method of monopolizing is always justifiable because the only person whose opinion matters to said price is the seller and the buyer.  If you aren't willing to pay the price, you don't qualify as either of those two.
---
I agree that it is too expensive for my wallet, however that simply makes it something that no longer concerns me.
---
Ahaha nice try :D
---
vendorpocolypse2020
---
Imagine being on r/fo76 just to criticize people who play it
---
Loving all the downvotes from the banned ones lol
---
Just thank your lucky stars and sell it again
---
The only issue I've come across so far is the critical hits challenge. I have tried vats and shooting an enemy in the head and i don't get any credit for critical hits. Has anyone else had issues or have any tips for that one?
---
If your on xbox ill gladly take that of your hands
---
I have been waiting for this for months. It pleases me to no end that they finally cracked down, at least a little bit.
---
I feel no pity or empathy for anybody who cheats, exploits or dupes on a video game and gets banned.  In fact I cheer Bethesda for finally breaking out the ban hammer.
---
Just know, that it is temporary probably, according the message, that was gotten from Bethesda:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hqzlm7/from_today_and_the_next_days_9_daily_challenges/
---
That's good then .I am a little lucky in games so maybe not to long to wait then.
---
still, most collectrons have two options.
---
junk or raw scrap, weapons and ammo or chems and alcohol, candy or toys.
---
I'm super surprised this already isn't a thing.
---
I dont need more gold. Got what I needed.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it matters but I don‚Äôt look at the atomic shop until after I finish a challenge in adventure either. 
---
I‚Äôve never had an issue doing the NW challenge last either, I just always make sure I end up going into adventure mode as the last thing I do before I turn the game off.
---
I got banned yesterday and legit didn't mind. Now I'm forced to take a break from hearing "Foundation is a good place"
---
no because the other plushies are super small so i assumed it was just gonna be larger then them and it was
---
its simple you agreed to take part in the service for a fee. and as part of that agreement, they clearly state they take the money up front. and if you break the agreement they stop the service. and at anytime you are unhappy with the service feel free to cancel it at no extra cost to you. that is a cut and dry case. but if you feel unjustly taken for you $9.99 go hire a $1,000.0 an hour lawyer. and when you lose zinimax will bill you for their $10,000.00 an hour lawyers. have fun  parry mason.
---
And a todd howards seal of approval that theyll work harder next time!
---
I'm consistently flabbergasted by the people who think 76's middling reviews and poor launch are some greater symptom Betheda's current state or some kind of decline. And believe me, if you didn't like 76, I understand ( I do like 76, but I still get where you're coming from). But come make this post again when TES6 ends up being the most pre-ordered and well reviewed game of the decade and reddit acts like they never doubted bethesda. I'm not even trying to suggest that Skyrim deserved the praise or the industry impact it had, but what happened-happened. And it's going to happen again. And OP, I don't want to single you out here, half of reddit seems to have the memory of a gold fish.
---
What 2nd and 3rd do you have on yours to make it magic? Or is the Junkie part enough to do it?
---
would make sense if there was some super amazing reward. there are some decent one but not good enough imo to shaft the people who actually grind it in order to stop the glitched score people from getting stuff. there will always be glitches because this game terrible designed and held together by threads. people pay for this game and more. stop shafting everyone because you can't fix your game. my stand on this situation.
---
" I mean i guess value is based on owners discretion, it is not worth that to me " ????
---
Please keep politics out of the game.
---
This would likely take a lot of work on Bethesda's part to fix this. And I'd estimate less than 1% of players ever use this.
---
They don't even fix bugs that affect 99% of players.
---
In short: they will never fix this.
---
Yes it is true, very widespread ban. No one knows for sure how many people but a sizable group for sure
---
Whether directly participating or indirectly benefitting, a bot swept accounts and if they decided you have too many of certain weapons ammo or consumables, they suspended you.
---
I was told that if you take a big mouthful of water and spit it over your shoulder it also helps.
---
So... Basically real life sales is a Tos violation, but exploiting a glitch isn't? Somehow? What the hell are you smoking?
---
I just started but this is one of the top things I want..
---
lol true. I guess im just used to new characters and not new accounts. whenever my buddies are leveling a new guy they just make like 100 Molotov cocktails for the hordes and they go up really fast lol.
---
Hehe I'd be well up for that bud! Brother here, you? Not that it matters haha. We are all one anyway! Aye!!
---
Then you play other builds with other weapons
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to experiment with a 4 man medics team. If everyone had a medics faster fire faster crit fill commando set up. We‚Äôd at least never die!
---
It's todd planting evidence so he can ban you.
---
And Bethesda's methods are done by exploiting the community.
---
Who was it that said that the glitches in their games were "features, not bugs" again?
---
Same thing if you want crosshairs for your stealth activity‚Äôs
---
You're very welcome, I look forward to seeing the grand adventure(s) of RF_huntr versus the shunned vault dwellers!
---
Thats why I always build on concrete platforms

---
What‚Äôs your STR and END specials stats?
---
Yeah, I was doing that at first as well, but then one of the people I play with said he went into Adventure before logging out for the day, but still didn't get the challenges the next day. But, he turned the game off after NW, but before logging back into Adventure Mode, so IDK... Anyway, we're just sticking to this and it seems to be working.
---
In the most non political way, I am not american just an observation
---
The workshop top left of the map, can‚Äôt think of its name but it has places you can set up the extractors.  Worth doing if you on private server.
---
The engine bethesda uses came out in 1996-97. They first used it for Oblivion and have been keeping it running on spit, shoelace code, and prayers for the last two decades.
---
Its buggy af. Its unstable. Its hilariously unsecure. Its lighting engine is pathetically out of date. At this point, its a travesty of modern 3D game design that this engine keeps getting used by what many would consider a top(ish) tier studio.
---
What it *can* do is render some pretty outdoor vistas. So it has that going for it at least.
---
Same. But ya thats why I phrased it that way. You human. Me human. Human good. Love you, Vault Dweller stay healthy. 
---
Ps you know how good it feels to be the sibling not in trouble? Like your brother or sister fucked up and they can't go to movie night? Yaaaasss anyone who played fair is finally having their day in the sun!
---
My guess is one violent night, but you can use the guitar sword or wardrum to make some noise too.
---
Dude you've made three posts over the stretch of 4 hours to seethe at dumb video game stuff. You and the cry baby dupers are cut from the same cloth pal.
---
You have to trigger a critical hit. When your crit bar is full hit y (on xbox) to trigger a crit. Shotguns work great as each pellet procs counts towards the crit count
---
I must be lucky then
---
i agree but banning them killed what little left of the economy there was imo its better to have 50% of something than 100% of nothing
---
I'm quite certain that people who claim they didn't know the items they picked up / bought were duped are just trying to cover their tracks. While in reality they were duping with a friend/second account and tried to cover their tracks by dropping/selling it. Transfering the duped items from account to account to make it seem they are unaware the items are duped. If you go to any exploits/cheat chats/groups this is exactly what they try to do. And they try different kinds of methods to fool the detections bots. I'm 100% sure that if an actual random person goes to another random persons vendor and buys a item that is duped while not knowing it is duped.. He/she is quite safe. Unless he buys like 10 copies of the exact same item.
---
Tons of people got banned from this one
---
It seems you cant have only one foundation with stairs up bases anymore. Had same problem and had to rebuild few weeks ago.
---
Now I did read, that adding a second foundation with stairs might help with this problem. So you could try that, but you might get stuck with those too...
---
Nothing. Just cheaters bitching as usual.
---
Because its funny watching cheaters bitch about geting caught cheating.
---
It was a special item for people who bought the Tricentennial edition. It was doled out to everyone by mistake. I honestly forgot I ever had it until you mentioned this.
---
Large amount of players were banned, whether they directly participated or indirectly benefited from the dupe. It was non discriminate. Big deal because MMO games don‚Äôt generally alienate chunks of their playerbase
---
Something that might interest your ignorance.

Dont forget working on a reliable acid income, Tanagra's cricket, - yao guoi cricket snallygasters hordes if you can manage to kill anything while letting the leader alive  from both other AI and players unaware about how it work, you'll stock enough material for a few weeks.
---
Edit : Hemlock hole's acid nodes  ( 3 )
---
Amen.
---
I swear u can find arrows sometimes after killing stuff
---
It was done but a bot so alotta of people where caught in the cross fire that didnt dupe and the hammer was also very heavy in general with banning almost everyone that did the dupe.
---
Value is based on what a seller wants from something and what a buyer is willing to pay.  Having an opinion that it isn't worth that is perfectly fine, but trying to force that opinion on others is not.
---
I mean have you seen some of the weird shit people pay for at auctions?  Good that they have a hobby, but it isn't my cup o' tea lol.
---
Honestly everything in this game is a glitch/bug and people exploit it with/without knowing. Also, what in the world are you smoking if you think selling items for real $$$ isn‚Äôt against the ToS?
---
and so should the wendogo colossus its should be bigger
---
A lot of actual dupers are being banned and they are throwing a bigger fit than usual. There were some innocents as well, but I guess they just never saw it coming and now their mad.
---
I bought guns and got banned I had like 5 nice things I wanted and traded for things I had.
---
It‚Äôs definitely something with NW, the only time I ever missed challenges was a day I did the NW challenge first because I was trying to get the Ghillie Suit unlocked.
---
I also don‚Äôt play during the mornings so that‚Äôs maybe part of it too. *shrug*
---
Cant you guys just be fine with having only 90% of the benefits or something? lol or god forbid, 80% ?
---
I was a former Jet head.
---
I SAID THAT AS IN IT IS MY QUOTE
---
Fuck aye man, that's how it goes! You're a White Stripes fan aye?
---
This one is now. And that particular gossip, blame and gloating teat must be suckled until it is dry, or until the next one comes around. 
---
 No one wants to suckle an old teat. 
---
I went too far with the teat metaphor. I realise that already but I‚Äôm not changing it.
---
Edit- People are unhappy with the game for various reasons. Controversy and action is an outlet for that, even if misplaced or out of proportion. 
---
Teats.
---
Also curious about this for Xbox, have been looking everywhere.

Does anyone know why we can't buy levels yet ?

Platform?

I will help. I will be on around 5 pm eastern us time if you want

---
just play the first couple of settler quest
---
Because Bethesda had been very restrained in the past, so players expected to be ignored or (at worst) lose items. 
---
Actually catching a real punishment was pretty shocking.
---
Thats so cool!
---
If you got 1 of those weapons(not 1 of each type)it may have been your saving grace. If you got more then 10 of each type then yes your account may have been affected.
---
Armor outside of PA is pointless.  PA has hudden dmg reduction which is why t45 is nearly as good as ultracite and so on. 
---
Only good for the effects nothing else.
---
I believe that‚Äôs the fancy western revolver that has a rare chance to drop from turning in pleasant valley claim tickets .
---
Anything generated in a camp item is not worth sending something like this. I remember I took someone's water and they were severely upset. It takes like a minute to come back, you can chill.
---
Telling anyone they should die is fucked.
---
Came with it. Not sure if you can use it on non-garage structure. Didn't try but the other powered garage door works differently and has no logo. This one opens and closes without power. The garage itself needs 3 power to light the Red Rocket sign, interior florescent lights and the rocket flame.
---
Oh shit...
---
Shit...
---
That would not surprise me but I‚Äôm wondering if some random player got a weapon of the ground and them wham bam banned
---
Do you have a Bethesda account?
---
I really don't care about made up Internet points? Truly just want to help people out.
---
Definite. Did you lose any friends from banwave? I only lost one and i legit am prepared to part ways cause ugh..
---
 Cheating in anyway sucks.
---
Mind if I guess, are you Aussie by any chance?
---
I think being friendly should allow you to get a stall and you can put other items up... and you can get messages through it with trade deals and put items for caps, do auctions etc.
---
And not like a server specific thing
---
Thats weird, I looked through every tab and couldn't find the door. Thanks for the answers. Do you remember what tab its under?
---
I think you would have to by the bundle but the log cabin I really nice.
---
So you're saying you were sober for a bit? Get out.
---
I can give you one but I won't be on until a bit later. Kit_cloud is my psn
---
Did you......üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
---
I love all my duped stuff. And so does every one who got some, they're so happy to have decent gear
---
You can scrap the weapons so if you had one collecting scrap before now you get ammo as well. I didn't like the raider voice lines so I swapped it back to my other one but set it for ammo and weapons. You don't need to have this guy insult you in your camp and threaten to kill you or blow it up! The other guy always invites me to come with him, even if it is to collect unstable nuclear waste. Such a friendly chap.
---
Sweet child. JK in all seriousness, it's a chem made from Kaleidopore, ash rose, antiseptic, and blood leaf. It increases weapon accuracy and gives +5 luck, which is great for VATS crit builds. It was introduced during Wild Appalachia, and the recipe is a rare drop from Project Paradise.
---
lol i know like 20 people that duped a shit ton and didnt get banned but people that bought duped items got banned thats wack bethesda learn how to fix and make a functional game
---
That bundle with the Piper outfit is not a bad deal if spending real money it's a couple bucks less than the standard atoms, plus you get 1100 vs 1000 and an outfit. It's only a one time purchase but it's how I got the atoms to purchase that bundle. I was pumped for it. I like it but I think after a week I will rebuild my old CAMP.
---
I have seen both types of people. I saw a group in NW. Mind you I didn't play NW before the S.C.O.R.E. daily. Anywho I could hear the other guy say there is one next to you. Also said he saw level 15s at monongah power plant. I was thinking how is he seeing this. Is a power armor thing. Then it dawned on me he was cheating. He knew where everyone was. Also for the duper. This guy said in my public group "didn't realize I could hear his conversation" I have a way of getting all the nuka cola stuff what do you need I can get anything it's how I make caps. My thought was what a dope. I have played solo up to level 180 and never had a need to buy anything except bulk materials to craft the things i need for my adventure for the day. I earned every cap I have by just playing the game as is bugs and all. I don't understand the whole duping thing. Well unless you sell weapons on eBay for cash. Still a stupid idea. What a waste of money. All my guns are free except the sweat and work to earn the caps in game. I wonder if I ever found duped stuff in the vendors at whitesprings? Is there like a scanner somewhere to see? Lol like a price scanner at Wal-Mart.
---
The server is kinda slow, just change cells aka ft somewhere and you usually see the marker.
---
I do like the log cabin but the hole in the wall rustles my jimmies. Why is there no window? WTF!
---
:\\
---
No-
---
Should be a perk, yeah.
---
Bungalow. It is broken though. My favorite is the log cabin. It fits just about everything.
---
no its been awful
---
Can you copy and paste what it says? I'm at work.
---
No ü•∫
---
not sure what you mean? You mean the floor concrete foundations? If that's what you mean that's what all my floor is. I didn't use wood floors at all. Grass still poking through.
---
Haven‚Äôt had a chance to revisit it yet. Will check it out this evening but others here have said you have to rotate the door around and then it snap into place.
---
I am right there with you regarding the frustrations placing the garage. Took me three attempts at rebuilding a camp from the ground up to get it to look level and decent with the foundation
---
and the difference is???? everyone was notified via email from bethesda. and their cases are under advisement and if you feel it is in error contact customer support. this web address doesn't say  so or how the case resolved. do you have the results of said lawsuit? and hows the current lawsuit going perry mason? got a court date yet? how much dup can a duper dupe before they get banned?
---
Because why not if I dont have to.
---
I don‚Äôt play Fo76 anymore I was just curious because I kept hearing this and wanted to see from the active community
---
People who also received duped items got the hammer  as well.
---
Walls, maybe 2/3 down.
---
They‚Äôd have to eliminate the caps cap.
---
I'm a level 30. I recently stumbled onto Wade Airport when a Level **226** jumped me for no particular reason. Of course, the encounter was over in about 10 seconds and he/she helped themselves to my junk. I figured it was just part of the game, and now I make sure I walk around with the bare minimum of stuff as I presume it will probably happen again.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LM0CZZ9Uw8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LM0CZZ9Uw8)
---
Also all the events always popping up all over the map are really confusing.
---
Could you elaborate.
---
Traincar?
---
Only some people are unhappy with the game, however almost everyone is unhappy with your teat metaphor.
---
I doubt that would trigger any ban flags. If it is just one weapon somewhere. Loot a bag full of same item? Different story. I don't know how the detection bots work but i assume they can distinguish random people from people who have been a lot in contact with each other. Meaning if i drop an duped item and you pick it up, you wont get banned since we do not know each other or have not been in contact with each other before. But if we have played together alot, maybe be friends, traded together in the past the same scenario might tigger a flag. But again, i do not know how the detection bot works. But i know the system can't be that dumb that it bans random people for picking up random items.
---
Its not hard, I have set right now, by byproduct of making other full sets. All it takes is a little bit of effort and time.
---
1
---
Only 33, but haven‚Äôt done any weeklies yet
---
I thought that was just the reset for the dailies exclusively, didnt think it was the timer for the ingame quests and the reputation stuff
---
thanks for your useless comment:)
---
A medics laser rifle can heal incredibly well preferably with less vats cost on a commando build. Use beam splitter and you can heal close to a stimpack worth of health for you and nearby teammates every 3rd shot
---
I think they have found a good balance now but it remains to be seen how the future content is. If it's easy to plough straight through everything in a few hours like Wastelanders I'll probably stop playing and only come back when there is more story content, most of my friends already have. It seems almost like somebody that had a big hand in designing the game at the start left soon after and has returned and started fixing all the stuff that's been fucked up along the way so hopefully that is the case.
---
Nope you are permabanned and there you got what you deserved
---
._.
---
I don't have any irl friends that play, not noticed any online friends missing as yet. I'm scottish! You? I love the band, love most guitar music, especially Blues &amp; Psychedelic.
---
Technically, couldn't Vault 79's Command Center make contact with Raven Rock or the Oil Rig? A gold reserve they set up would be factored into post-war communications I'd imagine.
---
Where‚Äôs your CAMP built that Grahm comes by? I‚Äôm wanting to buy stuff from him sometime.
---
That's too harsh.
---
Turn on pacifist mode.
---
It is big. It's giant compared to the other plushies.
---
Sadly there are many  100+ lvl players who dont know how player vendors work. Keep seeing this every day. And people get mad at me for selling Fashnact masks for 100 caps. I got so upset that everything is not either 33, or 22, or 11 caps.
---
Space on PC
---
Press and hold, friend, press and hold.
---
I disagree, it‚Äôs so easy for non-hackers and gamers, who play by the rules, to accidentally dupe in this game; to the point that you never quite know you did it until it happens and you are paying attention to it.
---
If you duped knowingly, then Bethesda has an obligation to delete the items you duped; including the original so that you have to work that much harder at your grind to get the lost item back.
---
Maybe next time those people won‚Äôt dupe. Unfortunately duping is within game mechanics because Bethesda never releases a piece of software that has been 100% bug free. So duping is their fault and not the fault of the players.
---
We could argue this point all day, but if we were in court, I would wipe the floor with legal jargon that no judge could refute; not 1 player would be banned.
---
Far as I know they take a long time to decide if your banned or account wiped
---
It's a quest reward. Just do the quest.
---
Doesn't matter. This isn't the fix. Got hit even though I've been logged out.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll give it a try.
---
I had the exact same experience when I was early level. It took me a LOOONG time to realise I could scrap junk and store it. I got a lot of shit taken from me when I got killed. I‚Äôm currently level 201, this person was level 11 so i figured they might have thought I was a griefer but even AFTER i explained what the wanted system was they still told me to die. I was like Jesus Christ it‚Äôs a game. Calm down!
---
I always talk to low players coming to my base, that Id just drop anything they need, or craft a gun or armor
---
Well, I wish you luck. Thanks for the advice and the chat :)
---
Any of the popular weapons, 3* bloodied with faster fire rate and whatever the preferable 3rd perk is, are probably duped.
---
okay thanks for the info.
---
It was a frustrating build for sure and took me about 6 hours and multiple tries. The foundation wasn't level or it went underground at some point, or didn't meet up on the other side of garage like it should. Also, some of my foundations would lock into place like when using the stair stack glitch. Never encountered this with foundation building alone. Not sure if it's a new bug or related to the garage. Even some concrete foundations I placed across the street not connected to any other structure locked into place. I had to tear it down and rebuild it multiple times, probably between 3 to 6 times at least. Honestly miss my old CAMP but I can build it easily. This one, despite how simple it looks was frustrating (yet fun) so I will leave it for a week or so and hope some players enjoy it when they find it.
---
You can now convert it to points to buy ammo you do want.
---
German by blood, but I'm from the states hahaha.
---
I‚Äôm confused by your confusion. 
---
Take your time. Explore. What specific holo tapes are confusing you?
---
What part of perks are confusing?
---
You if your guns are breaking that quickly and ripping through ammo that fast I suggest switching to melee and probably not an automatic weapon until much later in the game. Invest early on in things like rifleman or slugger to give more impact of your weapons.
---
And as for events. Just ignore them if you don‚Äôt want to do them. You can disable notifications in settings and in your pip boy.
---
Deal!
---
It's cool üòé
---
If you're looking for 1 prefab to put all that stuff in, I'd recommend the log cabin or red rocket.
---
My first camp consisted of the seedy shed with armor and weapons workbenches, sofias console and a sleeping bag. MAYBE be able to fit a vendor where sofias console was.
---
Right now I have weapon, armor, tinker, chemisty,  ammo converter, ammo creator, stash and scrap box in my red rocket building. My 4 vendors are outside.
---
Didn't know this was a commie sub!!!
---
Ain't no thing as a free lunch here in Apalachia, boy.
---
Ah Scottish. Cool. Sounded non American [good thing]. I'm from us but not very patriotic recently ;)
---
I play piano. Pop classical and working on more rocky bluesy stuff. I sing like I breathe tho. I love it.
---
Woulda def bought you a whitesprings drink if I could my guy :)
---
With all the duping, I don't even know anymore.
---
This is why i go find newbies personally and just hand that stuff out to them specifically. I trust people to be decent in the community, but that just sets things up for the new guys getting jipped. 1 cap per bullet is what i do and the newbies still thank me. I legit just dropped 2k .38 ammo and a fully modded gun for a new player last night and they felt like they hit the jackpot.
---
word
---
I had everything set up to try a bloodied build, had a good weapon, decent unyielding armour, enough points saved up to rearrange my stats and perks but my ocd will not allow for a low health build. It‚Äôs counterintuitive to how I‚Äôve played every game for the last 25 years.
---
Log cabin is pretty boss
---
I won my first match it was pretty fun, got a kill
---
59
---
Ofc, didnt say anything els
---
No problem, good luck to you too, I think you'll find the game quite fun now.
---
The random events popping up just feel like I should partake, but then I get lost when I come back to the main story. And like I accidentally discovered the overseers house before I finished finding all of her holotapes, so I have a quest to follow her steps but I‚Äôve already found her.
---
just some that was rare before dupes
---
No they weren't they were given an excuse clause, not a reason. The reason would be the evidence of wrong doing. In these instances, there is none. Were Bethesda able to state what someone did (I.E. AFTER the investigation) then they would be well within their rights to punish people they have found to violate the terms of service, but as of now they are suspending people they SUSPECT of violating their terms of service with NO EVIDENCE. If you are unable to understand the difference, then you shouldn't be talking on this topic at all.
---
The game isn't that ... intuitive on how to repair weapons. If you've played Fallout 4 then its fairly similar, but RIP legendary gun.
---
As one of Velt's teammates I can confirm this has been working. I would add though that I don't do all of the challenges like he does. Especially the crafting and workshop ones Zzzzzz.
---
I thought all the map was available to nuke.
---
Yet, they have been known to temp ban while they investigate, then drop a perma ban, if you do not believe me Juicehead has covered this multiple times.
---
nope nothing but scrip and sometimes not even any flux for the reward
---
Vault. 51.
---
I agree. It's a game. I find it relaxing. People need to chill.
---
24
---
\^yep this - at first I thought I was saving weight but it was only because I was burning through plastic lol.   Bulk Aluminum and lead and leave everything else as regular scrap...
---
So I was messing around with it and got it to work. it even let me delete the other foundation and stairs and still delete and place floors as I please. However, for testing purposes, I deleted everything except the one foundation and moved it somewhere else, then tried again, and now even with 2 foundations and stairs, I can't delete floors again. Why Bethesda has so many mind-numbingly stupid restrictions on their building system I can't understand. It's ruining this for me.  
---
Update: ok so it does work but the stairs for no real reason can't be next to eachother, they must be one behind the other, facing another direction.
---
This whole sub seems like graduates of Karen University.
---
Quite deservedly so, for sure. Thanks for holding me accountable.
---
He smashed one wall in my camp before my turrets slowed him down.
---
I left the server before he did more.
---
My turrets also do not like the scavenger, fortunately he is not essential üëç
---
Hmm. I wonder if they made that the default starting spot for each new session if people would absolutely hate it or dig it
---
Nah. I figure it's part of the game. I plan to return the favor once I'm in the 200's.
---
52
---
im pretty sure everything is wiped so like your account will be useless
---
Im still kinda new. Is there a way to speed up the process of entering the bunker to generate silo codes? Such a slog to generate a map search area.
---
Any other tips too would be appreciated
---
I get buying cosmetics and such, no issues with that but giving money to some asshole on ebay for duped items is completely different to that.
---
the colossus or regular?
---
It was a totally foreign concept for me too.  I still have moments of anxiety when I look at my health bar and see all that red.
---
Red Asylum
---
I think its just the fact that its junkie. Its a 2 star and right now i can't remember the 2nd effect.
---
Ya those two are the one's I'm mainly looking at which is annoying because they're both pretty cool
---
np
---
It has nothing to do with the game or it's mechanics people will ALWAYS cheat in a game.
---
Personal favorite is when an obviously low level player has mini-nukes in the vendor for 250 caps a piece. Little do they know that missiles and mini-nukes are trash that just take up inventory space.
---
I love this idea. I built my house In this shape but aesthetically it‚Äôs not there.
---
And I‚Äôm only level 21, but I‚Äôm trying to do the main story but I keep finding level 40+ enemies that I can‚Äôt even damage hardly.
---
I would totally do that!
---
Adding some additional options to diversify playstyles.  It's easy enough to outright kill an entire encampment full of raiders n such. I want to be able to cause mischief and mayhem with them first. 
---
 Lets say, a weaponized cannibal mutation that when it hits the desired human target causes them to begin violently attacking/consuming thier closest former ally, then, if they survive, transforms them into a wendigo...   would be so much fun
---
eww the asylum outfits are so ugly but thanks
---
Omfg thank you.
---
Really the game went from really hard to playable and fun once I picked up the marsupial mutation.
---
Use a different gun so you don‚Äôt screw other people over. I have an explosive handmade I just shoot at the ground around things I‚Äôd otherwise one shot when there are other people trying to get hits on it.
---
These downvotes are brought to you by **dupe crew**.
---
Events come and go and have nothing to do with the story. You def can avoid them. 
---
As for the overseer, her being gone doesn‚Äôt really play into the narrative of the original questline at all. It‚Äôs more your interactions with the other NPCs/tapes (rose, Abbie, etc). If you talk to her she tells you that you should go find her tapes. It‚Äôs not as jarring if you take your time to listen and read through notes.
---
there isnt a mounted colossus is there ?
---
even the stuff i didnt dupe? i mean im pretty sure they see what i duped and what not
---
Enter Ian Malcolm saying, "Now that is one big pile of shit."
---
You have to slow down then. Clearly you‚Äôre in a high level area. Level up a bit.
---
Why didnt you just launch a nuke yourself?
---
Get a single silo code for the silo you want to launch from (it really doesn't matter), then Google fallout 76 launch codes, there are websites that update and will just tell you what the code is, the real way to do it is very tedious.
---
They did also kind of nerf camp building as well
---
Of course! I‚Äôve deleted my AC for now until they up the exchange rate / cap on credits but at least they‚Äôve announced its shortcomings. Useful for all the .38 laying around.
---
Right but is that really a bad thing or not? There are a zillion weapons if some sort of logic were rolled into drops where you were only given things related to your build you would miss out on trying out things that might unexpectedly work for your build
---
Delete it.
---
Ohhh?  New mission.....find serum vendors.
---
the game is SO RESTRICTIVE about camps and placements, its mind boggling.
---
"Rebuild Appalachia, rebuild America!", yeah sure i cant place 2nd floor without a stair...Nor be anywere near anything that survivors would move in.
---
There should be apartment camps, maybe some indoor maybe some outdoor. there should be personal vaults! an inner cell that we can just build more freely. it would only take a single floor sized area or something.
---
You are surprised when the bonus for buying atoms was a skin from fallout4?
---
Also isnt that YOUR outfit and piper stole it because she aint even born yet.   Because fk continuity.
---
Responders fireman uniform with the white helmet
---
I think of it as an accelerator for what you already do, sell ammo you don't use and buy what you do at 1:1. Stack that with workshops and the ammo machine and you'll be rollin
---
Interesting idea.... I'd love to be able to choose my fast travel point as I often fall off a cliff when first spawning at my base.
---
As a non-auto rifle build I feel the pain of .38
---
I‚Äôm only 132 and was the highest on the servers. Uh, thus is an odd feeling.
---
Take ur ban and go somewhere.  Ur just gonna dupe again.
---
Ooh thanks. I just bought a pile of scrip weapons and there was a Junkies Pump that I guess I might need to test out.
---
thats hot
---
How dare you. I haven't spent 120+ hours looking for a red asylum for you to call it ugly
---
or have i?
---
Red, Yellow, Forest, Blue, Pink Asylum
---
Various Jumpsuits (BOS, White Powder, Forest Camo)
---
Responder Firefighter Outfit &amp; Hat (white)
---
Leather Coat / Traveling Leather Coat
---
Tattered Field Jacket
---
Just a few I can think of off the top of my end.
---
HAhahahaha :D for real, or jokes. Thanks for the laughs.
---

---
i dont worry that much if they perma ban me because of this tbh so i can move on to better games (and there a lot better games than fo76 , we all know that) so i dont have to worry about futures updates that breaks more than it actually fix the game
---
wait, is that different from the invisible attacker you sometimes get in the regular game?  sometimes I hear punching noises and start losing health, it's really weird
---
There'd be more players if they would fix the PC gamepass issues. I don't want to have to move windows from my SSD so I can play a game I may not even like.
---
You are not wrong sir. Gimme my basic options. Pretty sure I stumbled across a small shack somewhere in the mid / southern region of the map made from ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô items that we don‚Äôt have access too (such as fencing, half fences etc). Such a shame.
---
üòÇno i duped for the first and last time mate. and like i said everbody makes mistakes and has to learn from them. but its ok i forget people like you are never doing mistakes :D
---
anyone talking about "skill" while using 3rd party programs to aim or worse is a complete and total scrub.  Right alongside mind people using hacked weapons in adventure mode pvp, lol.
---
Thank you for being honest
---
Bethesda cant track duped items. So ifbthey really got them on accident or didnt realize theyde be fine unless it one of this like 4 or 5 mod weapons
---
Not rare, but my favorite is glow in the dark skeleton
---
Yea. If u believe that.   Been gaming online for yearsssssss.  I don‚Äôt glitch or cheat.  Crazy how I never got false banned in any game.
---
I have batteries included (reduce weight) but I eventually want to use a Gatling laser so I think I‚Äôd need a giant stockpile or the perk that doubles their efficiency.
---
You will be given a clear choice screen, the vault raid, do everything up to that point. Then make your decision who you want to raid the vault with and what reward is more important to you.
---
It's still greyed out on PS4.
---
Im not talking selection im talking how placement workd
---
I hate using it too, but when a perk requires you to be in PA (Stabilized) then you kind of have to be in it. I'd be much happier using reg armour with my HG build, PA sucks. However, until they actually overhaul the perk system and put the perks in the right categories, or rework them all together you'll be stuck with us.
---
Sbq is weak against plasma.
---
It absolutely is. I'm pointing your own contradiction here. I realize what you are saying, that people is running around with duped items without them knowing, but I don't get it. Yeah, the market is inflated with them, but thanks to who?
---
 Being passive of a condition to which you end up partaking in a context is NOT the same as being the one that creates said condition on the first place.
---
 The only reason there's all those duped items around is thanks to guys like you. It's not the same issue at all.
---
 Yeah, people end up being part of a fucked up market, but if it's you that fucked it up in the first place, then you are the root of the problem and deserve the punishment.
---
 And before you say that the problem comes from Bethesda for not fixing it or making it possible, that doesn't really change anything. Theft and murder are possible in real life, that doesn't mean you can go around doing it.
---
 You know that they are wrong the same way you knew that exploiting is wrong. You can't just go around deciding that a specific part of the ToS suddenly isn't valid because in your head, a problem is allowed by mere existing.
---
Some people received a weapon that may have been duped from friends or traded with someone and were banned.
---
(I wasnt banned myself)
---
Ok. I didn‚Äôt know if it was obvious or ‚Äúhey guess what you sided with them‚Äù
---
No.
---
Ok. Thanks!!
---
Well its the same when you look at the upvote to downvote ratio on here to the post about dupers deserving to get banned, its at like 86% upvoted, so their "80% of players were banned" is just bullshit
---
I chose the raiders as I find the settlers tiresome.
---
But to be honest in the greater scheme of things it doesn't make any real difference to the game in the long run.
---
So you break the rules, want back in and hope you get to keep everything? Maybe you are right, but history is against you. I think they pretty much wipe your account if they find you violated the TOS and duped.
---
46
---
Oh, I have no intentions of reading any links you post. I was just attempting to waste your time even more.
---
I've been using my bow a lot - primarily to launch enemies into orbit for the laughs.
---
I go through arrows like CRAZY. I couldn't imagine having to carry enough arrows to actually kill with. I crafted 300 and after one guided meditation I was below 100.
---
More arrows would be nice! And make them lighter too.
---
no the colossus rug is in the game but q mounted head or a full mounted creature would be really cool
---
The only legendary perk that I am actively excited for is the Anti-venom perk. That goddamn poison damage just grinds my bloody build to dust. Also, try testing felt-damage in body armor vs power armor of equivalent DR ratings. Spoiler, you take less damage/rads in power armor with say 300/300/300, compared to body armor of equivalent DR values. There are tons of build in, hidden damage reductions for power armor.
---
Yeah, but think this is very important:
---
Jet packs go WHOOOOSH!!
---
I usually raise it high enough or pick a location with low grass. But I get what you mean.
---
Are you on xbox bro? I started playing a few months ago and it was hella confusing tbh coming off of fallout 4. Got it down now would be down to help you with your journey lol
---
Yes. That's what it is. The reason you're not seeing a lot of people on Fallout 76 is because they were all banned..
---
Explosive railways are not legacies, by the way. Not sure why no one else said anything about that.
---
It‚Äôs sad you think a random number generator determines if you‚Äôre skilled or not. It doesn‚Äôt but have a good one!
---
Bows for range, shotguns for mobs. Not touched a rifle for ages!
---
One guy jumped in mine with a bunch of fert and then nuked my camp. 
---
It was a great time all around tbh.
---
Low 30s
---
Get the water breathing perk, hide in water, will most likely get 2 or 3rd place, and profit.
---
keep hanging around the barbershop you must want a haircut, makes sense
---
Yeah that's why I use it, I have maybe 50 or so cores on me most of the time lol
---
51 I'm at. Noticably longer grind already, but not unbearable thus far honestly. Hour or two at most a day now.
---
Shopping mall / top of the world, I want hubs than can be captured and held for 6 hours or 12 hours. Say you capture the mall for the raiders you get raider exp and quests from them for the duration of the holdings.
---
Get a load of this guy
---
a colossus hand as a chair
---
Hahaha. Yeah jetpack+Marsupial=no where is too high.
---
The quest line starts with a piece of paper on a table next to Boomer.
---
Pacifist mode only stops you from doing damage to people, not from people doing damage to you, although their damage done is limited unless you engage back
---
Ah gotcha!
---
6
---
yeah but it's fun seeing some lower-level get excited about fancy lamps and mounted fly heads
---
Thank you for your honesty, I wish the other people on here complaining would own up to their fault and have your state of mind. Will you be coming back when the ban is over? 
---
PS- I think we‚Äôre all happy people on gameflip and eBay can no longer get hundreds of bucks for in game items. You helped the cause.
---
In the end, it was all worth it. Definitely the most fun I‚Äôve had since the game released. Got to try all my end game goal weapons. I accepted the fact that a ban would come so I‚Äôm not salty. I was done playing anyway and what better way to exit than have one hell of an awesome 5 days of playing and meeting new people. Hats off to a wonderful send off.
---
I want to try the tedious method at least once, saw a streamer do it and the process was super cool.....but your right, super time consuming.
---
I'm Newsman77, I'll be on around 5:30pm and will help.
---
I always thought of dupers a nameless, faceless cheaters. After reading things hear today I feel less animosity toward them.
---
Thanks for the story, so Robin Hood of the wastes it is üòé
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a pretty common glitch. A lot of times I find them floating in the air.
---
Ah yes, the ‚Äúdoop‚Äù
---
If they‚Äôd let us pick a server spawn point from the main menu it might help, like you set either crater, foundation, white springs, top of the world, vault 76 etc and you always load in there

STR: Pack rat - MAX, sturdy frame (since I need power armor for ghouls and rads), Traveling Pharmacy for all my meds, Bandolier and Heavy Gunner. I think if I use the vampires gun I may not need as many stimpaks to heal to stay above 60%

I only own 40 full ones. I‚Äôve been farming PA but they are lower. And I hate the fact that perks don‚Äôt work for your stash as in if I put in a fusion core it‚Äôll bump my stash weight by three but lower my inventory weight by 0.3.

Nice! I teared up when i saw the counter where the cash register would be..

FO76 was also slated for not having new content for months at a time other than a few 2 week events so your comparrison isnt very good, adventure players went from last spring to spring this uear with nothing of any real value
---
I've never actually duplicated anything on purpose. But I did experience a glitch with the holotapes to call the drops. Every time I transfered one to my stash I would still have just as many in inventory still.
---
If you go to an ultracite ore vein you can spam click them to endlessly spawn scorched, which in a nuke zone drop the mats you seek, there is also a chance for any ore in a nuke zone to turn into ultracite, meaning almost all nuke zones allow this style of farming.
---
Whitsprings most often has Uore by the bunker entrance on the south side, either in the rocks or along the road.
---
Also, mats used to be free to grab without attacking the enemy, but you seem to be forgetting that they were also first come first serve and whoever looted the body first was the only one who got stuff.
---
Why an incredible waste of money lol
---
I just had an hour and a half session on PC with no problems.
---
They definitely used to have this in the game. I don‚Äôt know why they got rid of it
---
The important thing is, a bunch of people died, and that's what brings us closer together.
---
Same. I'm wearing the glowing skeleton mask, a full set of heavy combat with pumpkin paint, and the ghillie backpack. Looks great
---
I think largely because Bethesda set an expectation of apathy towards exploits.  SEVERAL duping mechanisms have gone by since the original set (that saw a heavy banhammer to be fair)  without any real consequence.  We saw whitesprings restaurant duping, we saw christmas presents in the display cases duping, etc etc without any real ramifications. The markets were flooded with super duper goods and life was good.  Then more recently the server jump from vendors made the dupe mechanism insanely easy with low/no barrier to entry for anyone to do and it made accounts flush with fun weapons and hard to get outfits etc.  Suddenly Bethesda has chosen to care again and hit hard and broad with the banhammer, so yeah, quite a few folks are upset based on inconsistency from their game developer.  Did they exploit, maybe.  But did the service provider set an expectation of complacency, definitely yes. If they were consistent we wouldn't be having this conversation. Most folks would not exploit out of fear of reprisal, but instead we watched wave after wave of things happening with little response. So much of the support for this game is just "phoned in" smh.  I feel this comment is headed for downvote city, as most people who agree with me have finally left the game for good after this one.
---
Ah yes, the ‚Äúdiots‚Äù. Thanks for sharing, we definitely needed to know this.

Just ran white springs yesterday, MAYBE 10 ghouls in the golf club and then they weren‚Äôt respawning for over 10 minutes between. After an hour in the nuke zone I had 5 hardened mass 1 glowing mass, and 5 HRF. Definitely not worth the trouble of nuking it. Your mileage may vary though

I admire your willingness to help new players and I'm sorry someone took advantage of it.
---
Aren't there some locked doors there and the speculation was that they were for future content?
---
Honestly, it'd be pretty neat to have the Whitesprings as a hub for all players to "live". Basically rent a room (a cap sink) and allow people to decorate it (no trap items since you'd never have to defend the place). You could even set up vending machines in your room and just sell out of it.
---
In my perfect world you'd also have a extra storage box in your Whitesprings room (which, again you're paying daily caps for so you're not getting it for free or anything) so that'd be another benefit for people middle of the road who aren't looking for fallout first, but want more storage.
---
I salute you comrade! Our fight will not be over until all people have access to shipping containers for which to build structures with! Revolution in our time!

Np. Please note it's gotta be a regular laser not an ultracite as ultracite is not ap efficient.

---
It'd definitely be a challenge for new players, but I think more experienced would enjoy having an area to reliably farm High Radiation Fluids and Glowing Mass.  I get that stable flux is meant to be a fairly rare resource, but it can be tricky to gather enough HRF and GM.
---
It'd really be nice if there was an area that was like the Glowing Sea from Fallout 4.  Somewhere where more powerful, nuked version of high-level enemies would frequently spawn.

From what I‚Äôve seen others saying yes- they can many weeks or even months and depending on how bad you duped/exploited it could result in a perma ban. And yes-your characters are deleted and wiped clean and you start all over again.
---
Maybe if they gave us a standard armor choice, Powered Arms or something designed to handle heavy guns there would a choice for some people.

Yeah it's funny how they are getting mad at the company instead of you know the people actually doing it, they are making excuses for these people, like what?
---
Lol another dumbass who says ‚Äúduping ruined the market‚Äù and also how it apparently ruined the gameplay experience of everyone, you do know that the only reason why high end items are cheap and available is because of dupers? Also did you know that duping weapons doesn‚Äôt break the game at all? All it does is provide players with some of their dream guns (which may I say are all legitimate weapons, not hacked), so if you are trying to complain that these weapons are broken, then go yell at Bethesda for adding them to the game. The only idiots complaining are the ones who were vultures and benefited from the dupe glitch, they just like throwing people under the bus. Also the other kind of idiots are those who don‚Äôt trade at all and don‚Äôt understand a single thing about the trade economy of FO76.
---
Some one just messaged me asking for help and why i didn't know where they need to go lol
---
what did you get collared for?
---
which platform?
---
I was playing this morning and exited my power armor to eat a corpse and when I re-entered my armor it said I was over-encumbered and I realized I had an extra chalice and when I deployed it, it was a full set of ultracite power armor. I literally don‚Äôt even know how it happened. Hope they fix this shit. Kinda worried I‚Äôm gonna get banned even though I didn‚Äôt do it intentionally.
---
Yep. The doop. Kept stopping me posting if I spelt it correctly lol

Probably because NW is still in Beta...after 2 years.

Some weapons make it worse as well.  Was wondering why I was going through fusion cores so fast all of a sudden one day.  Turns out you do not want to take vats shots with an lmg in PA.  By the time my AP bar had depleted I was losing roughly 20 percent of a fusion core from firing maybe 10 rounds.
---
There was a ban wave exactly like this in February 2019 and the reaction was exactly the same. It's just been a while I guess.

Right? The resort is literally an event space, after all.

If it wasn't for caps the prices would get out of control. I do think some caps should be higher.

44...a rapid jump thanks to the weeklys. Now for a long dry spell because the next 'must have' for me is 30+ ranks away...
---
Hmm probably because i duped, i thought if i only have one copy of a weapon i could get away but they saw me, they saw me all the time...

Yeah a little bit dramatised

I cant say i am inncoent soo at the end its my fault of being too greedy and wanting to try a be flamer

I've also worked way too many hours lately and am slightly delirious.

I think you meant "it's a moo point"
---
As a day one player, I despised the Atom Shop bc of the prices. The constant sales are much appreciated and allow me to get stuff I wanted before. Theyve been "better" about consumer friendly stuff. The Appalachia starter pack is a good value for $8 (why Appalachia when the outfit is from Boston???????????????????????)
---
Still, they want us to spend our atoms before we can spend them on The Legendary Run lmaoooo
---
It sucks because I see both sides of this arguement. Like yes, it is detrimental to be too powerful, and it's hampering others play. But at the same time I understand that it's not like being powerful wnough to oneshot ghouls is a bad thing, like the point of the game is to optimize and get stronger, and its like you are the villain for playing the game normally. Really it's just Bethesda's fault for having the game be so unbalanced and wack xD.
---
Lol ü§£
---
Yeah, heard that one too. Maybe it‚Äôs more like dueling hiveminds at times. Reddit gaming subs have always been polarized when the topic of micro transactions come up. I just find it funny that before Wastelanders, the big debate was whether Beth was violating a cosmetics only pledge by adding repair kits to the shop. The downvote patrol at the time were shredding anyone OK with it. I can only imagine the violence if that crowd were around to see this many people indignant about not being able to get at the rank up micro transactions. I‚Äôm honestly amused by it all.
---
I mean probably yeah i cant say iam innocent

Someone is salty

It was moddable before. I had an Alt that i gave the Armor Plated Plan to and was able to put it on the small. It just wasn't skinable.
---
Well if you are going to be Full Health &amp; Tanky you‚Äôll need switch some stuff around. Especially in STR get [Blocker if this perk is maxed, because they way percentages work, it means you almost take no damage from melee, which what ghoul attacks are]. Max out all your heavy Gunner damage perks [this will help as you‚Äôll do enough damage, I.e kill your enemies before they touch you]. 
---
If you are in PA you don‚Äôt need ironclad, PA already supplements lots of rad resist and damage resist. If not, then Max your Ironclad it‚Äôll help out. 
---
Get rid of weight reduction perks if you want to be tanky. Once you are able to take a punch, you won‚Äôt need stimpacks. [you will literally reach a point where u just toss them away or sell em cause they weigh much]. 
---
With Vampire weapons, you are really looking for decent enough damage- you won‚Äôt be putting out monster numbers like bloodied. Best bet is to Max Out Heavy Gunner Perks under STR &amp; maybe chuck on some One Gun Army under LCK. Recommend getting your hand on a Vampires Faster Fire rate Heavy guns!
---
Maybe this build attached will help. That‚Äôs a PA full health assuming you are using Vampire heavy guns/ w explosive effects.

This.  I'm a bloodied melee build, my primary weapon when I'm soloing is a bloodied powerfist that one shots just about everything but if I'm doing an event or playing in a team, I use a bloodied switchblade that takes a few stabs to kill a charred feral ghoul.

oh sorry i didn‚Äôt realize you were talking about dailies. Idk when those reset, i just know that treasury notes can be turned in 20 hours after the last time you turned them in and smiley will reset to sell you his gold for caps on sundays

Yeah, so let's contribute to breaking the game so we can have our fantasy fulfilled. 
---
Robin Hood must've took from the rich and gave it to himself this time around.
---
They did that on some old dupes, but not sure if they‚Äôll do that with this as it‚Äôs one of the largest ban waves I have seen. Sure, it can be necessary to wipe some but most dupers were duping to avoid the extreme grind that is 76. I couldn‚Äôt see any that I know who were banned coming back fresh to start that grind all over again. That opinion might just be from my experiences and the guys I‚Äôve talked to who have been banned, but time will tell.
---
Yeah boi, you tell them, the endless hordes of 3 star mobs which drop 1 star useless weapons.
---
So much fun!!!
---
Lol the only time I‚Äôve seen lights shine through walls is on Halo 1, a game nearly 2 decades old
---
I have 4 characters, only one really uses power armor. It's the way to go with heavy weapons but otherwise you're better off outside it.
---
Just buy hacked accounts for 1$
---
I saw some legendaries there for sure, but last time i run silos was like year ago, i came back for wastelanders
---
Had to say goodbye to my floating greenhouse domes too.
---
The problem I'm having is that I can't find master picklock as a perk card that I can equip. Its not there.
---
Yeah, that tends to be mobs that haven't respawned properly. I get it a lot with super mutants. Sometimes you'll come across one standing there with only their underpants on and not reacting to anything (unkillable too). Usually you'll start taking random damage, so I'm assuming that on some level, the mob is active and attacking you unarmed, but visually, it's just stood still.
---
If you do come across that, have a look on the ground because you sometimes find random loot just lying about.
---
GL in your future endeavors..

---
I would honestly rather not have Whitespring to become nuke central again... In fact I wish they would cap out the level of the enemies so the place isn't always swarming with level 68 ghouls. I would like to see it become a safe-ish hub where people could set up camps and/or have interior rooms available for players to claim. Make it a place where people can set up a home if the so choose.
---
That said, it would be nice also if there were places worth nuking besides fissure prime for the SBQ event. Have more enemies in an around the sungrove forests in Cranberry Bog or areas with a lot of consistent spawns in the Mire. Somewhere where we can farm materials for stable flux.
---
That would fit the style of this game perfectly. How have they not done this yet.
---
Not at all. I play NW. I think its crap on Bethesda's engine.
---
On sundays for smiley, ive been waiting around every monday for him, although the youtuber i watched could be wrong

If i find out any timing info ill post it here

No i mean its not the fault of the game or the fault of anybody else

Nothing special. Kids are jealous they either didn‚Äôt get an Bloodied fixer or that others have them now and theirs is ‚Äúworthless‚Äù. Worried ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù is ruined. And now they‚Äôre ecstatic that others are being punished for it.

Plop down that yellow portable work/construction type light and check out the radius at night.
---
I can see server hosts and location through my firewall
---
Same but that really only works with stairs etc. You can't drive a car up stairs into a garage or to fuel up so I had to compromise to make it look like a fueling station. if only the ramp foundation snapped below not above, or at least for me it never snaps below what I placed, wants to go one level up.
---
I am sure every criminal justifies their actions.  .

But your honor he had more than me it was fair to take it.

Pray to Bethesda to hear constructive criticism of players who have not yet lost their faith for this mode.

**Elaboration on "Bethesda manipulating the community".**
---
After the disastrous launch of F76, Bethesda came out and made a giant announcement, they swore up and down that nothing would be allowed on the Atom Shop except for cosmetics. They swore there would never (with emphasis on the never, they kept pointing to the never to emphasize it) ever (also emphasis on the ever) put any items which would give any form of gameplay advantage. They did interviews emphasizing this stance, made promises up and down the block and did everything they could to make sure everyone heard about it.
---
The reason I am being so repetitive is because honestly they were about this repetitive about it. Everyone thought they were telling the truth. People trusted in them and a good number of people (myself included) came back. Less than a year later they had repair kits, scrap kits, passive collectors for scrap and whatnot you could buy with real cash. There was even a fridge that made food rot slower. A bunch of extra stuff you could not yet get in game. I don't know if it has been added to base game since, but definitely stuff that provided an in game advantage. 
---
When people complained they were carpet bombed with dislikes, people would get all sweaty and talk about how it is not a competitive game, about how "It's not like people are taking scrap from you, so what does it matter?", or "If they want to add something to the Atom Shop they can, it's not like it gives much. It's like a tiny bit of extra scrap stop bitching.", completely ignoring the entire point of the complaint and being a bit insulting. They honestly acted like paid shills for Bethesda, although that is not confirmed to be true *(or false)* in the slightest.
---
**Explanation on "features not bugs".**
---
There has always been a meme around Bethesda games about them releasing a buggy game and taking ages to fix it, or not fixing it at all and saying that it added some flavor to the game. Be it Elder Scrolls, Fallout or any of their other games. Look at Skyrim, beautiful game but riddled with bugs. On PC the most popular mod is one that fixes literally thousands of bugs that Bethesda just left in the game. It's called the "Unofficial Skyrim Patch", or the "Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch" (because when they remastered the game of course they didn't fix any of the bugs at all). Fallout 4 has an unofficial patch, Fallout 3 has one, I do not know if New Vegas has one. All of these fix thousands of bugs per game. They always laughed it off and said it made the game more fun.
---
***P.S. Thank you for actually asking for an elaboration instead of just screeching. You'd be surprised how often the second option is taken before even asking what the other person has to say.***
---
51. I got the raider cage tree last night. That was one of favorites.
---
Yeah, it's pretty common.
---
I've seen Scorched, Ghouls, and Super Mutants. They stand there naked, in a breathing animation, and headless. They don't aggro at all.
---
you should be angry about the situations that cause caps to be a necessity.. not the caps
---
The last thing I do every night is the NW challenge. I have only had my challenges auto-completed once and that was when I was playing through the reset time this past Saturday. Outside of that one occurrence, what challenges I did first or last or the timing of them have had no impact.
---
It would be sweet though I'm sure the console folks would be shocked by all the hacking on pc :(
---
One could say that you and I then, make a pair. a pair...of...
---
Yeah.
---
Time to make a new account
---
hey Perry Masons back, i just finished season 2 myself. the software embedded into the game which is designed to sniff out duped items and the method dupers use. auto flags the accounts for reviews. but since your a english, legal, sofware and video game wizard you knew these as well. which btw is listed in the TOS. and you agree to allow them to do. now since the software  picks up the illegal anti cheat events and flag is for suspension. it send the effected person an email. in the event of mass long term events it bans them. now as new methods arise and this software remembers things they the company let you dig a hole big enough there is no doubt. and they let the axe fall. so Perry Mason, is the person who account suspended or banned guilty? did they cancel their 1st membership before or after they got the email saying they were perma banned? are you saying tehy have no intent to email these suspected cheater the finding of their investigation? all this and more on the next episode of Parry Mason &lt;cue credits&gt;
---
I've been suspended, got 1st and did trade and buy weapons. I did send them a ranting email mind you, so that could delay things. But they do indeed treat their loyal fan base like shit. I'm now in my old account and back to level 30. Sucks.
---
Ahhh okay, thank you. Kinda disappointing.
---
You get more XP by hiding in a bush than killing players. 
---
Downing -and- killing a player: 30 xp
---
Risk of death: high
---
Sitting in a bush for 2 min while you make coffee: 30xp.
---
Risk of death: low. 
---
Other than that if you really want to get better at confrontations: 
---
1. Practice
---
2. Always stay with your team. 
---
3. Buy a cheap mic if you don't have any. 
---
4. Some weapons are crap like the Scoped Hunting Rifle. You can literally have all the rifle perks and bloody mess and land a headshot without killing the target. 
---
5. Know the map - where are the crates
---
6. Don't rush. Create opportunities
---
7. On Adventure mode grab a workshop and make some blueprints for NW
---
I think that's only an option if you bought the original collectron.
---
Ok yea I‚Äôm lvl 60 and this is my first time seeing all this, Thanks
---
HAs anyone had a glitch where it doesn't spawn? I went there on my alt and it wasn't in the cache.
---
.38 fixer is the answer.. good as a daily driver
---
just take turns running the area swapping out who the leader is
---
Just hit 32. I'm not really.grinding it either. I don't do the NW stuff, and I only do the exp one if I'm close to.getting it. I just did all my dailies in 15 minutes today.
---
I'm yet to log in for today, but I *believe* I'm at 35 with 200 S.C.O.R.E to 36. I'm not sure if I'm on track, ahead, or behind but I did my fair share of grinding battle passes in Fortnite, Modern Warfare, and Rocket League. Burned myself out, never touched those titles again.
---
At the end of the day, it's just a game. If I'm not feeling up to the dailies etc. I now go code or watch anime, knowing they'll still be there for me in 16 hours.
---
next time to prevent this put it behind a locked door and bring the new players through the door
---
Aww man my main account got banned after just tripping over that paperbag sitting at vault 76 entrance with a stack of legendaries in it?  How did that happen?   I mean who doesn't find sacks of the perfect items just laying around some times?  
---
Or you know that one time you just accidentially got into god mode and just happened consume that stack of 1k bobbleheads that I totally didn't just find laying on the ground from that 30 random letter named character account and then played for a couple hours without noticing anything at all happening.
---
If nothing else that cage is my end goal lol
---
Huh reasonable. Thanks for elaborating.
---
See this:

---
What one?
---
google.com
---
I‚Äôd just focus on things that are in the western part of the map.  Once you venture east it becomes tougher (relative). Events tell you the suggested level.  I‚Äôd just do low level ones unless you have a buddy to help carry you.  
---
Morgantown airport is a good area to farm for materials and kill low level enemies if you need supplies and want to level up
---
Every thread that mentions dupe are getting removed LOL
---
I agree with you. I‚Äôm still a low level so I couldn‚Äôt do much. But I‚Äôd love to sneak break into someone‚Äôs house with a fire axe raid there vendor then leave. But also some level 200 could find my house Fatman and the end.
---
it hasnt been that empty that Ive noticed on PC as far as players..
---
vendors on the other hand.. are barely existent RN...
---
How many unapplied perk levels do you have? (Not unopened perk packs, but level-ups that you have not applied?)
---
Don't know what rock you've been under but plenty of games have caps on currencies like this one does. While some could be increased,  they have a purpose.
---
Brotherhood vendor in Whitespring Resort.  You will probably have to log off/on a few times but they'll show up eventually.
---
FYI, they are expensive.  I think the cheapest you can get them is 9600 caps.
---
Don't use VATS in adventure mode. It's good practice targeting things and aiming manually.
---
4 people. They were just really popular.
---
You‚Äôre fooling yourself if you think Robin Hood would ever have began if he had not considered himself poor as well.
---
I've played games with caps. It encourages people to spend them rather than saving up for a mega-rich economy. 
---
The problem isn't the caps, it's the low level. Most expensive item from game vendors are serum plans at c20k so why is the cap cao not twice that at 40k?
---
Well I have all the slots taken up for perception if that's what you mean
---
Nah. You are. Pretty sure they're going off the logins since that dupe worked with server hopping.
---
Look at the last spot on the board.
---
That wasn't an outcome, it was a change of litigation process, arbitration is just another form of grievance settlement.

---
As the minutes ended without one side being awarded legal fees from the other, I imagine a settlement with a non-disclosure was reached. Bethesda better get their checkbook ready.
---
The score points start to replace items in your display cases and stash until all you have left are your score points to keep you warm.
---
Sony won‚Äôt let it happen
---
i just said many have two options. for example, the raider one has ammo and chems as two seperate options. my point was that even if they only had the standard one, there should indeed be two options, junk or scrap.
---
Anybody here know if you can kill a consenting teammate (and visa versa obv)? Honest question, I‚Äôd do this one in a heartbeat then!
---
Thats part of the challenge
---
Yeah same. Even when the challenge for buying/selling was on it was the same. Went from easy 15k caps a day to barely anyone even visiting. 
---
Just as I set up my sheepsquatch plushie area too. All those seconds wasted.
---
Idk i would say like 40% of active players in communitys thats my guess
---
It's part of the last level. Its listed with the planetarium and other stuff at the very end of the Legendary path.
---
Excuse my ignorence but what quest is it?
---
With that shit you gotta give it directly
---
1 person and 3 of their mule accounts
---
I can see how you get confused.  Its a big world, and there are many different stories.  
---
  Many of the notes and things you find are going to be disjointed because if there's more than one, you don't necessarily find them in order.  and you may not find one in the "middle" of a series until 6 months from now.
---
In a way though, not much different than if you were to find yourself in that position IRL.  Roaming a place you've never seen, minimal direction, figuring out whats happened (and why).
---
  You find all sorts of snippets, pieces of the puzzle, but its not until later that you are able to put the pieces together to start getting a better picture.  Thats one reason the overseer says to find her tapes.  She did not physically appear in game until wastelanders; the tapes tell the story up to that point where she actually appears.
---
No no, I‚Äôm not trying to get around it. If I was I‚Äôd just make a new Microsoft account. And yes, I was duping and selling the products for caps to people who couldn‚Äôt get these items themselves at a 100 cap profit per item.
---
I have the circus trailer plan (haven‚Äôt learned it).  Not sure it‚Äôs use when I now have the traincar, log cabin and red garage?  I know it‚Äôs a highly sought after plan for trading 
---
Log cabin is nice, but it does take up some budget.   It also doesn‚Äôt snap to objects so you‚Äôll need to mess around with flooring to have the entry way line up.  More of a minor gripe though.  Traincar looks cool but feels confined.  Wish the backdoor or top opened.
---
I've played NW last, shut the game app, and started Adventure Mode the next day and... Had zero problems at all.
---
The joint was jumping after update 20, but now it's dead.  I'm on PC too.
---
What suggestions do you have, I‚Äôve been looking for something other than COD
---
For the price the new red rocket garage is pretty nice. I have most of the others but this is the first one I think I'll use a lot.
---
pffftrrrrr... ummm brotherhood/raiders/free-states? ... signs and letters... also maybe the watoga bot
---
Ahhhhh got yah, thanks
---
I mean I meant to put them on display but I scrapped all my junk not thinking about them.
---
Public teams are mostly that tbh, share a card, in an int one for extra xp
---
Hmm just a thought but similar has happened before but.
---
‚Ä¢ What if shops had an option for a level cap locked section you could do this so no daft snobby lvl.400+ come along and take it all.
---
The option could be scaled along from lvl 1 - lvl 50 lock it out so low lvls have a chance.
---
‚Ä¢ Also to limited a lose of so much ammunition make it a 2000 shell lock so a low lvl could only take 2000 shells instead of maybe accidentally taking all 40.000 shells.
---
Or added to this it could also scale up by level say lvl 1-5 500 shells, lvl 5-15 1000 shells and so on.
---
We also still need a bulk selling option still too.
---
Can I ask what type of ammunition was it? as if it was say it .308 it could of been an MG.34 player as Hitlers Buzzsaw runs through so many shells.
---
lol, bethesda works in mysterious ways. If you dont want to risk a bann, dont play the game.
---
Your acc is probably still under investigation you habe to awnser the email but idk what you have to write them
---
No, that‚Äôs not what I mean. Look at the bottom of the screen where you press the key to pick perks and apply level ups. If you have more than 9 unapplied perks, then Master Picklock will not be unlocked for you yet. 
---
See the list on this page that lists the perks by level by SPECIAL point to see when each one unlocks. What you get in perk packs is random, but what is available to you in the game as you progress is NOT random.

---
daily crossplay post. ..... answer NO
---
Thank you for asking for elaboration instead of just screeching. A lot of people skip right to the screeching and plug their ears whenever someone says something they disagree with.
---
So yes, I am apparently blind. lol thanks
---
Hmmm
---
Fair enough
---
Yeah it was part of the donut shop bundle for some weird reason.
---
Your optimism is refreshing.
---
As a new player: What the hell is going on?
---
I just got the protective lining yesterday and I‚Äôm level 312. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get the shielded plan.
---
you're\* English\*
---
It is astonishing that you continue to post given how incredibly inept you are.
---
At least 5
---
I did it the long way, new char then bought the 1st 2 plans then did Rosie's worst as they have a  higher chance to drop them
---
I love it when people break into my extractors and steal stuff. I check the map often and the second you are wanted im coming for you.
---
The AboutTimeWave.
---
Except the Super Mutants, who used to be 3 Scorched in a trench coat.
---
Well as they‚Äôve singled You out. And you duped I‚Äôm going to say they have proof you did lol.
---
What's a trump troll? Is it like a normal troll but rather than hide under a bridge they hide behind rascist and immoral values disguised as patriotism?
---
I noticed that on Xbox before the Banwave. As soon as it hit GamePass, there's low levels and not a ton of events going on.
---
I'm hoping it picks up on weekends. I'd like to do the SBQ but not Solo and not exclusively with level 1-5s.
---
your perma banned bro. was nice knowing you. their email was simply a legal thing to go were looking into it. but they arn't your done.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea. I just have to remember to store it before I scrap all my junk.
---
I have also switched from PA to full unyielding SS gear. I was previously using the ultracite PA and decided against buying the plans for the T-65 since it would barely provide any more protection (at least, based on what this subreddit says). Instead, I got the entire SS set and with the S.C.O.R.E requirement to level up EVERY DAY, the unyielding SS set makes leveling so much quicker while still keeping somewhat high (490 DR / 390 ER / 301 RR) defenses.
---
With food and group leveling perks, super mutants give me 500 ish exp PER kill, from a measly 176 per kill when I was in power armor. It has completely changed the leveling game for me. Combined with a bloodied death claw gauntlet, and its a pretty fun experience!
---
I keep a set on me exclusively for shopping at cliff top vendors(in case it‚Äôs a trap or they log off and I fall) and for jumping off tall structures (like after I‚Äôm done farming the monorail elevator). I don‚Äôt have much use for it otherwise.
---
so very very many vendors east of the forest are scarce now, high level players(&gt;lvl150) are 1-3 per server it seems. Hopped servers all day and this is what I see on xbone
---
The amount wasnt the problem this time. Read what ppl write that have been banned. The auto bann bots pattern is even known in ‚Äùunderground 76‚Äù üòâ
---
patience.  The mounted regular wendigo is a reward in a questline you probably haven't done.
---
Have you read all the posters in (any given) train station?
---
I believe I got mine off the Watoga Bot, and I had to server hop a few times for it to show up.
---
Edit: the Watoga Bot in the Super Duper Mart, not the Train Station.
---
This always happens to my free stuff vendor for lower level players. The level 200 something guy takes everything, even the moldy food! I'm like...wowww!
---
The holy Todd Howard cockslam 9000.
---
He will get there. You can‚Äôt tell me there is anyone playing this game for a year and doesn‚Äôt own a single duped item. You don‚Äôt have to be a duper to have good stuff, most of the good stuff has been duped for quite some time.
---
Well, glad to have read it here so I can finally stop looking for one..
---
Did they issue more bans today?
---
They came from that person opening holiday gifts, they didn't dupe those plans, but the gifts they came from were...
---
For the last seven days there was a piss easy exploit that meant you could make copies of your weapons using the robot vendors. All you had to do was put it up for sale, and before you confirmed the sale, you opened your social menu and went to join a friend. When you‚Äôre on join, you spammed A as quickly as you could because you‚Äôd sell the weapon and leave so fast the sale registers server side but not client side. Go back to the server you sold the item on and you can buy it. This means you have now got 2 of the item.
---
It seems some newer players think you can just be randomly ganked, this isnt the case unless theyre doing some rare glitch way to kill you. Keep pacifist mode on and dont take workshops(unless you store junk) dying to a player will cost you all the junk you carrying and a bit of caps based on your lvl. Youll likely be given items by higher lvl players so that another good reason to not play private.
---
Out of the few times I've traded with random players ingame, I've been scammed twice due to the horrible trade system and interface. It's given me ptsd that I've never even attempted to use any of the trading subs, plus it seems like a lot of work to use an external source to facilitate a trade inside of a game. 
---
The trading system needs an overhaul and rework so that both parties put the items for barter up and then they BOTH have to accept the trade to complete. Caps will be in a separate line from items.
---
Also, power armor should be easier to trade and inspect while it's on a frame.
---
My Sheepsquatch plushie is sitting at my fire pit just chillin'.
---
read all the posters in any train station.
---
i enjoy how you keep commenting on a thread that was  removed. you idiot.
---
If you want to leech EXP from the event, best option is to put an explosive shotgun on the new character you want to level and just go to town on the mobs when they arrive.
---
Something about the dupers being enraged just makes you all warm and fuzzy doesn't it :D
---
Bruh I‚Äôm over here at 7 because the games kinda boring now
---
Look at all those downvotes, all these butthurt dupers lol
---
45 as of last night, hoping to hit 47 tonight
---
Yep because there‚Äôs hardly any dodgy weapons floating around on console lol.
---
The trade economy is only what it is beceause of dupers like you. So your argument about understanding is invalid here.
---
 You can't go around calling yourself a hero for selling "good products"... The discussion here is about where those items came from, and they come from exploits. I realize you want, very deeply, to deny any responsibility here... But it's a waste of time, for both of us. In the end, you are banned, most of the community consider it rightfully so as well. So you can cry and try to offend people as much as you want buddy, you are in the wrong here. You messed up, get fucked.
---
They haven‚Äôt singled me out though. Fuck tons of people are being banned, including people that didn‚Äôt dupe. 20% of the people on my friends list that are banned didn‚Äôt dupe, nor did they request I dupe anything for them so I didn‚Äôt.
---
Honestly they're cool as hell right? Been worth the legendary run for that. I just got the blood eagle tree cage thing and it doesn't excite me. I've seen people complain about the size of sheepsquatch boi, but it's a plushie. it's big...For a plushie. 
---
Also you can just put 10 down and negate any size issues. Quantity makes up for size and quality amirite??!!
---
tbh I'm usually too busy running away, but I will try that, thanks
---
Bruh your permad my friend duped 1 things and is now permad so I would think you will be wiped
---
You guys have Gatling guns that fire orbital strikes? Handmades with beam splitters? I thought those hacked items were only on pc.
---
Anyone have one for sale on them ?
---
32, but I lost 4 days due to travel last week.
---
Seems unlikely they got a suspension for nothing. However I know of a couple of players who did and haven‚Äôt been pinged so maybe they pulled names out of a hat
---
I found out today, doesn‚Äôt mean I wasn‚Äôt banned yesterday
---
&gt;already have one annoying person at my house who doesn‚Äôt shut up. 
---
Married life, amiright?
---
I found them at the whitesprings, 8900 caps
---
Can you place more than one down and how much budget does it use?
---
As far as court of law is concerned, that is the outcome. So, your lawsuit and legal expenses will likely result in arbitration that'll get you $10 at best. See accurate representation of your face -&gt; ü§°
---
This is Bethesda we‚Äôre talking about here. That wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
---
You clearly are proving my point because that‚Äôs not how you get good legendaries. Lacking ability to understand the finer loops of getting legendaries doesn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúbEtHeSdA dUmB‚Äù. Just accept that you‚Äôre bad and you need to use dupes and cheats and it‚Äôll be much easier for you. Once you accept the problem you can avoid the bad choices and find legitimate ways within the terms and conditions to do things and earn gear.
---
I guess your another one of those idiots who‚Äôd much prefer items being sold up to $1000 US on websites and also have items which are practically unobtainable. Not to mention you‚Äôd also promote scamming because guess what, there‚Äôs no trade window feature either, quit replying if you have nothing worthwhile to say besides the stupid ‚Äúyou deserve to be banned, it makes the game better‚Äù, because honestly, this dupe glitch has literally created content and brought a large amount of players back, it was the one chance people could get their hands on legacies/other high end items without having to give an arm or a leg.
---
You are using a real world example to compare against a game with virtual items.  I think you take the game too seriously, the opposite of Bethesdas attitude of this game.  lol
---
Averagebaters? The guy from YouTube?
---
I gotta be the guy to say if you put up all this stuff for free you can't really blame anyone other than yourself. If you wanted to give that stuff to newbies for free you should have just, I dunno, gone out and given that stuff to newbies. For free. You can't resent people for not mind reading your intentions with a vendor set up like that. 
---
I'm not saying what lvl 400 dude did wasn't shitty and greedy but you don't seem to appreciate that this is kinda like that 'person putting a stick in the spokes of their own bicycle' meme.
---
Fasnacht? No, no. banacht!
---
I readily admit this, and acknowledge that I am very paranoid.
---
Yeah. I used to have to do this before they put all the Stings and Things insect parts on the do not scrap list. If you get into a habit of storing before scrapping, it's not that bad.
---
As someone else pointed out though, if you spawn into a work where your Camp can't be placed, you need to remember that stuff isn't protected anymore. Proceed with caution when crafting or repairing in those situations.
---
You can get it as an award when you have done enough quests for Paige.
---
IIRC, it was 2 steps before having to decide which faction to side with.
---
I feel like they should just do what other companies do when an exploit hits, FIX the exploit first, then either delete said item or rollback the character
---
For example, when destiny 2 had a bug that could get you a masterworked version of the bad juju, Bungie just disabled the ability to obtain the weapon, and blocked you from using the masterworked version until you hit the real requirements for it.
---
Actively banning what seems to be a huge part of the playerbase for an easily accessible exploit is a new concept to me.
---
I don't think so and although i do think it would be cool between the consoles but i don't want crossplay with PC due to m&amp;k, increased fps and the hackers/modders etc.
---
Get secret service armor with a jet pack and you'll REALLY have some fun.  Never cared for jetpacks on power armor but I wouldn't trade my SS jetpack for any other mod.
---
I finally caved and bought the game recently, but I won't spend a dime in the atom shop or on fo1st subscription until this and other glaring issues are addressed
---
Yup. I came here to say I was on a Mr Fuzzy ride when someone logged out and the song keeps playing. Indefinitely.
---
I still have nightmares.
---
Yes but no. I‚Äôm not him
---
Not saying it happens all the time, just that when it happens it seems (according to the people I play with and others on Reddit) to be when you last played on NW... If you haven't had the issue, that really good!
---
Probably a lot of reticence over the bans for dupes, so people are more wary of purchases, coupled with influx of new players on servers from gamepass, as well as lockdown stuff easing more and more in certain places. I suspect the endless XP grind is taking a toll too. Not as many people travelling constatly just to check out camps and inventory when there are SM's to farm and brains to eat.  
---
My trade died a death. I usef to sell thousands of ammo a day and loads of serums constantly, but rarely see anyone anymore.
---
Go to Southern Belle Motel and there's a magazine on a table by where Boomer is that starts it.
---
With EXP mattering more with SCORE and even more with legendary perks I am thinking about the same. I like PA because it is low effort but passing up 30% more exp feels hurting.
---
To add on - make sure it‚Äôs the exact same character. 
---
Source: did the above and still got boned
---
Pretty sure your accounts gunna get wiped... suxs to be you
---
44 here.
---
I believe you, wink wink.
---
I think the servers are just super full of new folks from the game hitting GamePass
---
People do this all the time. The most common is under the map camps. Never heard of anyone getting banned for this since it doesn't really hurt anything.
---
It's just surprising. Previous duplication glitches were patched out and that was the end of it, save for the ban wave a couple of months after launch. I, and it seems most other players, didn't expect any kind of widespread pushback from Bethesda.
---
Oh my god yes. 
---
I wish the dome would snap right to the door.
---
Appalachian economic crash of 2020
---
Oh god, I‚Äôm so sorry that me knowing exactly how much health I have, which other games like TF2 have as a default, is cheating. Lord, I never knew that I was a bad person for being able to see a number on screen. Jesus, how many people have I screwed out of a 3* because of this? I am so sorry.
---
Do you ever look at the LFG (Looking for Group)? Lots of players post there, SBQ in 5 minutes, Encryptid, SBQ x3,...
---
You can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried it...
---
You sir, are a scholar and a gentleman.
---
If you cheat, you get banned. Simple as that. Rule enforcement isn't a bad thing
---
PS4 user here .... did not see another user last night for 2 hours .... got bored and logged off
---
Lucky hole mine.  Exit big bend tunnel near Watoga and hang a right.
---
I usually walk out witharound 600 Lead Ore...(which smelts to what, 3000 lead scrap, more if super duper procs) a couple hundred Crystal ore, a fair amount of acid, and some of steel.
---
Cap me on the earning, or cap me on the buying side. Whatever is best for the game. But do they really have to cap me on both?
---
First it was a third of the fan base then half, now it‚Äôs up to 90% today ü§£
---
That'd be probably one of the coolest things bethesda could do. Get myself a big ass sheepsquatch
---
Yep, the plushie is cool.  The Hanging Raider Cage looks OK to me, I might use it.
---
&gt; All the og players who have been playing for over a year now that got banned aren‚Äôt exactly stoked to start a new account and just start over.
---
fuck em.. 
---
im more interested in going forward with the players who did not get banned than worrying about and making excuses for the ones who did...
---
I guess you don't play Red Dead Online, huh? lol
---
No, you can't kill teammates.
---
Okay, thank you so much again :)
---
Straight up. I made my psn account in 2016 when I discovered his channel. Then after 3 years the channel turned to shit and I left. Haven‚Äôt changed my account ID yet because it‚Äôll fuck with my trophies.
---
just burn through the wastlanders DLC. get the secret service armor and you'll be fine. you can role you up a nice set of those. what else is there to do during a the covid thing. beats going outside in the heat.
---
No you do not answer the email
---
What will be will be, reply or not...
---
I figured as much
---
well, hate may be a little strong.  excuse me while i dismember this prick who cheated ... I'll say more when I'm done
---
you got a drill from the SBQ? 1139 hours and still never had a drill from the SBQ so how about you take your bragging out of here?
---
It has happened before and many will return for the next update.
---
Also, contrary to popular belief, developers aren't going to go all hands on deck with their families during a plague and start working on a fix that will be uploaded and distributed to the entire game base.
---
Sony charges a lot of money for non-scheduled updates. Tuesdays and Thursdays is the schedule for every game. If you see content updated m, it's because it was installed on those dates.
---
Thank you mate, seems to have worked
---
I'm still here, almost 3,000 hours in.
---
i tryed to start vending again but is the same thing as usual I go to an event come back to a high lvl player sneaking invisible trying to bug the fucking vending machine.
---
You should have received an email about it. It‚Äôs probably dated yesterday.
---
You know, I spent nearly 300 modules and scraped together 5 Uny pieces and 3 of them are 1*.
---
Found some last night at the Sutton train station vendor bot.... Couldn't afford 'em though at 9900 caps :(
---
Private servers are free?
---
Maybe if youre lucky you get unabanned if not fair enough i mean i can at least test my luck
---
honestly. bunch of dramatic tarts! 
---
Every world i've been to while hopping has been jumping.
---
Just been on Discord chatting with guy been banned 3 times.
---
One was for 2 months, 2nd about 2 weeks then only a matter of hrs.
---
Account started working again each time, no interaction
---
Any 1* rolling pins or pitchforks you‚Äôd be willing to trade?
---
I did, and at the bottom it says ‚ÄúIf we haven‚Äôt heard back from you in 96 hours, we will assume your issue has been resolved‚Äù or something like that
---
My buddy got hit with ban hammer. He hasn't duped or received duped items. Watch yourselves.
---
Vault steel replenishes on login though so you can just server hop and get all the steel you need (as long as you have scrip)
---
I don‚Äôt even think they know we exist lol. Unfortunately the majority of players really don‚Äôt give a fuck and while that shouldn‚Äôt inform Bethesda‚Äôs decisions it definitely does.
---
Lol I agree most of it isn‚Äôt for any in game advantage tho its just zenimax jealous of all the eBay/ game flip sellers out there making money cause zenimax legally
---
Can‚Äôt sell their own weapons for real money. I was on last night and felt like I was back in November of 2018. Meaning no one on any server and the ones that were on were all like level 15 üòÇüòÇ
---
....how could it not be the first reason against cross-play that pops into a person‚Äôs head?
---
Something I tried once was building near an in-world container (in this case, a refrigerator).
---
I put a sign above it that said "take an item, leave an item."
---
It worked pretty well. People would take some things they wanted and leave some things they didn't need or didn't want to carry.
---
I really want the garden dome thing. I have most of the other prefabs. That's the only one I've been waiting for for so long
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug. You can fast travel and it takes no caps.
---
there is no official information available on this topic..
---
I hope they delete the accts.. refund fo1st.. and hardware ban them all forever

Also Cave crickets, rat poison, antifreeze, abraxo, (double if its industrial),  occasionally, you'll find  jars of waste acid, player vendors, occasionally, bot vendors.

Or camp on an acid node.

I am having fun slam dunking your idiocy, removed or not, this is fun making you look like the complete and total moronic tool that you are.

my vending machines hasn't seen much activity much lately..... think people are using their caps to buy gold bullion now....i could be wrong tho
---
I got the waves of scorched event at the airport inside a nuke zone once and while they weren't glowing ones the scorched were dropping glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids like candy.
---
But I'm not sure if the event was already triggered before the nuke or came after.
---
How do you know the servers are dead? You'd need to still be able to play the game to know that, which you blatantly can't.
---
Dude best comment of the day for sure hahahhahahaha
---
lol "cookie cutter* crowd indeed !
---
idk because i assumed that people would play fairly :/ my bad i guess
---
A few things I‚Äôd like them to do /fix:
---
-	fix the blueprint issues with the half dome and others 
---
-	let us use wallpapers in the interior
---
-	a rocket less version of the garage for easier roof building
---
-	snapping (ideally door to door for things)
---
-	an limit increase from 3-&gt;5 now all prefabs compete for 3 slots 
---
-	use standardized door sizing for both single and garage doors so previous or future doors would be swappable 
---
-	above ground stair connection
---
Less ghouls, lower legendary chance, and the aggro range on the ghouls have been lowered significantly
---
Exactly, however I didn't find anything that stated that it's not a bannable offense, and with the recent ban hammer coming down, I just want to make sure I don't get screwed. I'm just concerned since I've started doing guided tours(you can seriously make a massive bunker if you plan it out right), and it's been kind of an enjoyable experience letting people in and hanging out. Plus, I'm paying for a FO 1st account, so the last thing I want is to be banned just for trying to create a cool camp.
---
You are right, you did, I just take what it gives me, as when I deleted their ally item for me I didn‚Äôt get a quest immediately and instead waited a day.  I probably sequenced it wrong or something so that didn‚Äôt seem like a great option. As I lost the day anyway.
---
I have a glitched nocturnal explosive faster reload rolling pin i could trade
---
I used to have a meme vendor filled with "legendary" drills i got them so often.
---
Ended up scrapping them for stash/vendor space.
---
That said, don't think I ever got one from the SBQ, so congrats on that.
---
IMO.. your "buddy" is not telling you the whole story
---
I carry hazmat suits for rads
---
Nah I can play no problem. I‚Äôm saying the servers are dead because there is no one in them
---
If it gave us score it would be fixed already
---
Truth
---
Imagine that i was just scrolling in new and seen this. People with a brain wouldn't go out of there way for fallout 76...
---
more XPs for you!
---
You would rather play with high levels spraying everything with duped BE plasmas?
---
I guess that qualifies also, but I was referring to the "I dun care what evidence you can pruv, I believe Trump!" type of moron.
---
Ugh
---
I like how you didn't say you duped or not, just added that they couldn't prove it. :P
---
Lol lies.
---
I had 1150 hours and I‚Äôm gone now and not starting over time to move on

Arbitration works the same way, large settlements are not uncommon, and when arbitration fails, it goes back to the courts. Fuck, how are people this mouthy so fucking stupid?

I suspect they smartened up, probably added some sort of tracking code in last patch, maybe a serial number for certain items, not sure...
---
So, yeah, they probably can prove things.
---
That‚Äôs because wether I did or not is irrelevant. You need proof before you take someone‚Äôs game away, especially when they have a premium subscription to said game.
---
Except they took months to come out so a ravenous fan base ripped through them right away
---
I can't wait to get one of those for myself.
---
Personally, once I cheat in a game, it's no longer fun. Without limitations and challenges, there's nothing worth pursuing.  
---
So, even if cheating in Fo76 is easy, it's just not appealing.
---
I haven‚Äôt played NW in months and after reading these comments, I‚Äôm glad that I haven‚Äôt.
---
Lucky
---
He could be but ive known him 15 years and to lie about something as piddly as a ban on 76 would be out of character. But the possibility is never zero i suppose.
---
It should be, I hate those camps.
---
I would rather not struggle doing queen events etc
---
Means a lot will be doable and *maybe* enjoyable again instead of nerds one shotting everything instantly. 
---
I have been having a blast at feed the people and manhunt especially with low levels. I go in tank the shots and aggro and let them fire whilst I just punch the fuck out of everything with my bare glowing pustule riddled hands. 
---
Mad Dog Malone has had some right beatdowns, the punk. 
---
Stuff like encryptid and queen fight has still been fine.
---
People said the same thing about the first ban wave. It didn't happen then, probably won't now. Dupers got mass banned in ESO once and said the same thing, however that game is chugging along five years since
---
Can you cite your source for that? The Creation Engine‚Äôs limitations don‚Äôt seem to allow what you‚Äôve said to occur.
---
Your account name explains your poor attempts at belittling my statement.
---
"if people would stop being absolute cunts" i probably wouldn't play video games as much ... I'd interact with other humans a lot more, that's for sure
---
Will do, thank you for your help.
---
Since launch, they have never banned anyone for camp glitches. Not for build budget glitches. Not for under the map glitches. Not for floating items. Not for wiring glitches. You‚Äôll be fine. To build a good camp, you really need to learn some of these glitches to stand out in a sea of square boxes
---
pssst. daily challenge. level up....... fastest way to level up? make a new toon and run to the wayward. takes 5 minutes.... and its across account challenges... shhhhhhh
---
That's nice of you.  My first character (now my my main) on PC found a level 5 Instigating Pump Shotgun and a level 30 Legendary Pipe pistol of some sort (Two shot, I think?) and they both lasted me a long time.
---
Especially that shotgun, which was OP for the next 5 levels and still usable afterwards.  One-shotting all the weak scorched I ran into for the first part of the story arc (as long as they were at full health) was an eye-opening experience.
---
I later dropped some low level legendaries I got from that one event where you kill 3 legendary wolves in the Forest off in that same box.  Hope they helped another newbie.
---
I could Jet being useful for altering the VATs experience in someway. Maybe due to heightened senses you can target crouching or invisible enemies? Maybe it provides a faster run speed or sprint without so drain for a limited time. They could reintroduce it with a change of lore possibly.
---
yah i aint seein anyone on pc anymore
---
While i, sadly, agree that they are never going to fix this i don't think it would be hard to fix.  
---
The powered lights works as expected (they keep their colors when you log off). Worse case scenario if there is a newbie taking care of this he could just look the powered lights code to see how it's done.  
---
Problem is they're probably running a dev team with like 3 or 4 people, idk. Almost two years later and the game is now (almost) how it should have been at launch :/
---
I'm far too lazy and usually it's not that hard to find one on a public lobby.
---
Ye I had a great server this morning with 7 people doing back on the beat.  Then the whole group just started hitting events.  Everyone got a shot and xp it was really fun.
---
I miss the 10,000 angry robots. Bring those back.
---
I mean if you want them to respawn have your friend leave and rejoin the server
---
It was nice doing Uranium Fever and no one one-shotting the 3 lengendaries so a low level player could actually tag one.
---
I'm almost level 200 and just go to that event with a TS Tesla. I tag everything than let other kill to try and give as much xp around. I've gone up 1 level and triggered 10k xp 3 times around level 180 this way. So much tagging
---
Lotta selfish people in this game, man.
---
I put sodas in my Nuka Cola vending machine, and most people take just one and go on. But twice now I've had someone come in and take every single last one in the machine. Just open/close, open/close, open/close, over and over. I don't get it. It's weird, obnoxious behavior and the people who do it need to grow up.
---
My friends are having trouble getting into the same world because the server is full. But tbh that's possibly because we joined another person's server and they're pretty popular. They run three Scorched Earths and an Encryptid every day, and we usually all have trouble getting in anyway
---
That's got nothing to do with the banwave. That's just being on the wrong server.
---
This is probably my penance for getting the croc backpack in my first ornate pail
---
Oh it‚Äôll come back. People move on and play different games. I guess it‚Äôs gotta be eye opening to Bethesda to see that such a huge chunk of their player base just got suspended tho. I‚Äôm so curious as to what their plan is. It seems like a lot of people are getting suspended and didn‚Äôt even do anything. So they say.
---
Yeah, I just meant those ultracite pieces from the queen. Lol
---
since no one can see it perry mason. your doing nothing. now im off to go play some 76 have fun
---
Recently I‚Äôve been carrying early game plans and extra stims for new player on the Xbox. I don‚Äôt trust having them in my shop for free
---
I predicted they'd be banning people in other games by now according to numbers people throw out. We'll get there. Also that's the best use of that stonks award I've ever done. I've waited all my reddit life for this moment. 
---
I'm proud.
---
In what way?
---
Sorry to hear that.  A surprising amount of people in games (especially online ones) are unscrupulous sociopaths, and it's one of the reasons why I don't do what you did, and instead hand things over one on one to new players.
---
Either by trade, or by dropping and indicating with an emote.  I've successfully given away stuff like low level weapons and ammo that way.  I also drop stuff I don't need near the entrance to my camp or throw it in a container at a train station the way I've seen other people also do.
---
I usually tank and call low levels over I‚Äôm just saying stuff like queen and encrypt are much harder now
---
I tend to make protective under armor and give to low level players in care packages and I'll message them explaining what the suit it for and someone down the line to pay it forward.  I think trying to leave something that anyone can access and leaving it up to the honor system doesn't work, been there and not doing it again.
---
well, you know them IRL so Ill have to take your word for it.. 
---
but there must have been something that bethesda saw which triggered it.. 
---
I doubt they just threw darts at a list of player names ya know..?
---
It's the middle of the day on a Wednesday. Get back to work!
---
Leaving the dupe going on from Thursday through Monday was kinda baffling especially how widely public this dupe was... could also be intentional, players who are suspended which is majority of this wave, will come back after suspension in a few days or week, by then, buying SCORE rank will go public. Causing most who lost time to buy rank. 
---
wow, I just sounded like a conspiracy theorist... anyways ;/ just an opinion.
---
There are still a ton of duped weapons out there so I doubt it. Anyone currently trading a B2525 fixer or explosive flamer out there received a duped copy guaranteed
---
Thanks! Totally agree about the sea of square boxes comment
---
Yup, if they just matched the basic template options from Rust we could have so much more freedom with camp building. It's just laziness or too much work for the dev team and it wouldn't make them any money.
---
My man, I'm don't disagree about VATS being iconic. I actually thought it was a very immersive feature when I first played. Wouldn't mind if it was expanded in complexity to include more strategy. I just can't stomach it without time being slow. I also have very little interest in running dungeons with people. Generally, if I'm gaming online it's for pvp. Trying to cooperate with real people is the worst and why I am playing a videogame to begin with ;'\]  Especially when the strategy is the same every time and you just choose a role to play. This mandala-by-numbers thing is less joyous than previous iterations of the title.
---
Thanks for the info kind stranger! Guess there‚Äôs a first time for everything then... sigh...
---
Depends if that bunker is full of presents, bobbleheads and BE fixers.
---
...but why?
---
Technically you are exploiting a glitch in the game so theoretically they could ban you for it.
---
However, they've been around since the game's been out and nobody's ever been banned for it yet.
---
I, personally, have my generator hidden underground as I got tired of creatures spawning in the closed off room and destroying it.
---
Very low... have bulit in internal and external lights...2 doors and using 2 get enough room to vendor + base + worldbench
---
Damn you to hell!!!! Heh, that‚Äôs the only plan I wanted from that damned event.
---
crap !!! excuse me while i go get rid of those mounted frog heads in my cabin ....
---
True story for sure. Only thing I can think of, is the day it happened we had made new toons and were flipping toons alot for a bit. But idk he is pretty upset with spending actual dollars on atoms and fo1st.
---
im sitting on 4 3 star unyielding parts atm. and a 2 start marine leg. i got the body on the 3rd module, the left arm on # 25. the right on #34 the left leg on #47. saving up for the right leg now. it gives me somethign to do all my quests are done, dont give to shits about xping anymore, got like 400 tickets from the mask event. so i just grind script.
---
Feed the people has been crazy lately, with all the high level carnivores and new players doing it for that sweet 12 percent XP meat. People have started selling it in camps again and it's great. I have 20 tins. 
---
I remember doing that event a lot when the game released, when it gave veryone on the server the reward. I hadn't done it it forever but now it's rocking again and I'm literally having a ball running and jetpacking around punching things.
---
I think it's the scale this time as this dupe was REALLY widespread. We are talking thousands of individual active players banned here, I have played since beta and this is without doubt the largest ban wave.
---
Im so stocked to try with a decent crowd. :) played a bit last night; experienced similarly.
---
Making a script would be really cool and take some skill. IMO To understand how to actually do it, code it, actually hack it. But cool as an academic exercise. To actually put it into practice and share it as to ruin the game for us. That's not cool
---
SS armor is missing all the mod options that scout and combat have.  no ultra light or deep pocket for limbs is good example.  i bought ultra light today and can only apply it to chest.  Wouldn't let me apply to legs.  I already have dense on chest so another wasted purchase.
---
Dude you are not wrong. My group said the same thing. It made people use up gifts it brought down the cost of rmt and made the market so cheap for legacies. I definitely think with the amount of exploits that have came out since wastelanders should tell us some one on the inside is leaking shit and it‚Äôs on purpose
---
I can't imagine finding playing that way enjoyable.

---
What OP said. Crits need to be triggered in the vats screen when the crit bar is full. I just figured this out today and I have been playing for 4 months now. Took me a good hour to get it done.
---
They could have given a hint or tutorial or something.
---
To my knowledge, they don‚Äôt write it themselves.
---
It took me a while to figure out if/when I should do the events, dailies, and quests. And, what is the difference between them all...
---
My recommendation to new players:
---
Follow the main quest and the wastelands quests, but when you need to go to a place that is too hard, then slow down. Clear the bad guys that are medium/easy for you. 
---
If you see an event (yellow hexagon on map) pop up:
---
-if it is in an area you feel confident about go to it. The rewards are worth it. 
---
-if it is in a place you haven‚Äôt explored yet, wait a minute. See if some high levels are there. For the medium difficulty ones, there should be 2-3 people above 50. If not, don‚Äôt bother. For the hard difficulty ones, if there are 4-5 people above 75 or so, you can join them and get a bunch of XP and maybe some rewards. Just know you will probably die. Nbd
---
Dailies are little tiny quests that each area of the map have. Good XP and rewards. Do those if you can. Again each region had their own dailies so if you can wander in a region and kill most of the baddies, you can and should do those dailies.
---
Okay. Bye.
---
Don‚Äôt envy me too much, that‚Äôs about the only stroke of luck like that I‚Äôve had
---
I'm just not sure if there's a rhyme or reason to it, really. I only do the super easy NW challenges, so I'm not on all the time.
---
Have you not heard of the famous naysayer of yore, Archibald Murdomcsalt? 
---
He said bread would never work and once punched a horse to the ground for disagreeing with facts, in favour of conjecture and heresay.
---
Hit 41 last night.
---
What utter sorcery! Thanks. I just checked my caps before FT and although it makes the noise of taking the caps, it actually doesn't. Thank you, subject may be closed! (coz IDK how to close a topic in Reddit, I'm still kind of a noob here!)
---
I used a Tesla shotgun and the 2nd lightning arc counts again. So 5 for the 5 electric arcs, then 5 more for the 2nd set 5 arcs that hit the another enemy. Doesn't work every time, but can happen.
---
nah, just walls, a bunch of astroturf, and a collectron that I'm fairly sure has a drug problem and may try to murder me in my sleep. The camp glitches are fun and don't hurt anyone, but I draw the line at duping - just ruins the game if you can cheat like that.
---
Wait, you can get whitelisted?
---
Nowhere near as many as the amount of posts complaining about the ban, let me tell you
---
I feel for you.  Bethesda CS is garbage.  You may have a permanent ban, or you may have a ‚Äútemp‚Äù ban that lasts for months while they eventually look into it.
---
I have a big problem with a very long temp ban, and everyone else should as well.  You‚Äôre guilty and gone or not guilty and... time out to miss season, and catch up with RL cash?  An investigation like this should be quick and non-destructive on your character.  It should not last months.
---
Btw, I‚Äôm not banned.  Apparently that statement matters in these topics.  What should matter, and something we all should agree on, is that Bethesda‚Äôs CS is a mess, has been stated to not have crap all for tools to help players, and is slow as molasses.
---
Yeah... no skill. Not cool. Nevermind then üòÇüòÇ
---
If they just give a slight slap on the wrist to duper‚Äôs and exploiters, then they are saying ‚Äúcome cheat in our games and we don‚Äôt care‚Äù
---
They have to let the hammer fall and hard
---
Who told you this?
---
Quality over quantity I say.
---
It's just a hunch really. They can't manual check all accounts so it needs to be an automated process of some sort (pending further review).
---
Maybe all players transactions are logged and a software scans for dodgy events, something like that.
---
You don't kick people out of your store unless you have some evidence. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The lobbies are full of noobs who don't have vendors set up so it feels empty.
---
You want to see ones with skill, look at the TF2 bot invasion. Most of that was coded by people and made for bots.
---
Spoiler for the quest!!!
---
Yes, its a quest, then the robots don't attack you on sight.
---
Low tier events Idm I give away the legendarys that don‚Äôt suit me I tank I call over etc but queen and encrypt I am struggling
---
so your pissed you got to shoot more bullets and not just stand still to get notes. sweet.
---
i have four full vendors full of great shit at great prices.  they buffed wendigo too much. now is bullet sponge who rewards don't warrant the ammo waste.  level 409 pc.
---
Probably but whatever server I go to had more low levels then high
---
The explorer's outfit hides the backpack for some reason. Not really sure why. I don't see where there is any clipping to be had on it. Maybe the hood is just a little too far down the back?
---
&gt; Feed the people has been crazy lately
---
I know right? so crowded i just loot the buildings across the street and wait.. lol
---
If that was the reason I would have said but believe what you will buddy
---
Ooo, I will have to poke around there more, thank you!
---
I have not. Probably due to the name McSalt being entirely fictional and made up by me.
---
You know I understand that aspect and I agree to some extent but also I look at their devs and their QC. If duping is such a huge fucking issue in this game then why don‚Äôt u have your entire fucking team making sure it doesn‚Äôt fucking happen again. If I was the lead. I would be fuckin firing people. Just saying. Because every time there is a dupe people will do it. And then they have to get rid of more
---
Of their players. Look at it like this. You have a dog you love it. The dog gets Into the trash every time
---
U leave. So u start putting the trash up or
---
Making sure the dog can‚Äôt get to it. One day u leave the trash out and come home to find the dog
---
In the trash. Are u mad at your self or the dog.
---
I've not run into this issue yet. Then again I dont even log in before they reset weekdays. I will keep it in mind for weekends though. I also play almost exclusively on my private server, but I heard that can still cause the problem.
---
I‚Äôve only been killed by another player twice the entire time, once was when I became wanted for destroying a wall in someone‚Äôs camp (Some backstory: This was back when the game first dropped and I had no idea what I was doing, I trapped myself inside by closing the door that then became locked at level 3) they took most of my stuff but left some for me. The second time was when my friend and I were taking the Gorge Junkyard, they came in contested the claim killed us both and didn‚Äôt even take the workshop from us. I was very mad but I‚Äôm not going to resort to stupid threats.
---
I had posted on another thread my server was as good as I have seen in months.  I was almost late to work because line in the sand came up and someone had just popped a lunchbox and I got confetti blast.
---
They got rope-a-doped
---
I also love all these posts acting like the cheaters are some martyr.  Like they took down a big baddie, without even considering the people they took down with them. I‚Äôm not even talking about people who accepted duped Items, I‚Äôm talking about the legit player who got a decent but not great roll on an item but now can‚Äôt get rid of it because the market was flooded (and still is)
---
I don't run unyielding / bloody, but I mostly agree.  Outside of certain heavy gunner builds, legendary armor with a good backpack, and the jetpack SS chest is the way to go for me.
---
No fusion cores, higher weight carrying capacity, legendary buffs that can't be matched in PA, backpack mods, the list goes on and on.  Since Fallout 4 honestly, and especially in 76, Power Armor's been nerfed to the point where it's niche, rather than generally powerful.
---
I mostly only use it to show off the fun paints I have, some of which I got from the Atom Store.  Really like the Nukashine and Free States ones for instance, particularly on the T-60, which i use over superior models for looks.
---
I really wish Bethesda would Balance PA to make it more useful though.  By at least letting us keep the backpack carry weight and mods or something.
---
Outside of Rad zones or for fall damage prevention (which I don't need because my legendary armor gives me 100% fall damage reduction) PA's really mostly there for Stabilized Heavy Gunner users.
---
I tend to leave ammo piles, duplicate plans, and such in brown bags by the vendors in the train stations.  Someone will see it and take it if they want it.  If it's a lvl 400, at least I won't know about it and be peeved.
---
Saw too many 200+ lvl rushing up to my brown bags during the Fauch (sp?) parade to take recipes, berets, and masks that they clearly didn't need and/or planned to sell for hundreds of caps later.
---
Yeah honestly I may do that if there's a lot of people in future. No point fighting for one shot low level mobs, especially when there's multiple level 300's there with explosive HM's.
---
I'm just there for the meat and jetpack shenanigans.
---
Possibly but according to what I am looking at the Secret Service in Appalachia has no relation to the Enclave so they might not even know who The Enclave even is.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service
---
You need to learn the advanced power connectors plan.
---
I thought having this was a fever dream of mine. I'm missing it too
---
Hahaha dude i love that thing! I'll be on later today or this weekend. I almost hit 100. My little crew I've bwen helping has almost all gotten above 50 and we have diverse and awesome crew. Im so pumped.
---
Lol yeah. Your like instigating explosive shotgun is worth nothing now. I agree. The fact that the most rare weapons in the game are spread around like chewed bubble gum means your gonna see new players walking around in god tier shit
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs still pretty good for farming high radiation fluid.
---
My buddy and I did it this past weekend for the entire time of the blast zone and we got a lot of legendaries. Nothing really special, but good scrip fodder and dozens of high radiation fluids.
---
Idk what level you are, but id suggest waiting until level 50, not for how difficult it is, but for the leveled weapon as on of the quest rewards. If you care about it anyways.
---
I would say the severity of the dupe and whether or not you had duped them yourself or picked them up. 
---
Judging by your comments, you duped to make a profit and therefore you didn't just happen to pick up these items. 
---
You'll probably be banned for a few weeks and Bethesda may even wipe your characters.
---
I am on
---
Use your perception point for literally anything, just put a damn card in there.
---
Unless your goal is to never have a single stimpack in your inventory......get rid of born survivor and use those points for bloody mess.
---
I LOVE THIS!
---
I still see lots of people nuking Whitesprings on PS4. My biggest issue with nukes isn't that Whitesprings isn't targeted all the time anymore, it's that there's only 4 locations worth nuking; Whitesprings, The Burrows, Fissure Site Prime, and now Monongah. There needs to be more of a reason to nuke other places, imo, because going through all the effort of launching a nuke and then either wasting it or being forced to drop it on one of those locations sucks.
---
Companies dont like charge backs no matter the reason.
---
I realized I was still paying for my Runescape membership many months after I stopped playing. Charged back the last payment since it was like a day since it was made and now I literally cant do anything on the account till I pay them what I charged back..... Even though I didnt dispute the other months of payment that I didnt use.
---
Nevermind I wander between games and them locking me out is going to lose them money overall as I was planning to eventually return and resub. Now I'm not.
---
What am I supposed to be seeing? Two posts with combined 32 comments. There have been a flood of low level players. That isn‚Äôt because all high level people were banned lol. That second post doesn‚Äôt even make sense.
---
People always say things like ‚Äúservers are dead‚Äù but the game has tens of thousands of players online right now. I think people just don‚Äôt understand the game when they make those comments. There aren‚Äôt supposed to be (and can‚Äôt be)‚Äôhundreds of people on servers.  And low level players are because of game pass being released recently.
---
i dont do bloodied.. but im not sure i would run suppressor under any circumstances.. 
---
3 pts for 2 seconds of 30% damage reduction.. I think maybe you could spend those points better?
---
I have the opposite problem. There's a bunch of us high levels all trying to get to events like Manhunt first lol.
---
wait, I thought the whole legendary drill debacle was fixed.
---
Alright I‚Äôm on Minecraft with my cousin I‚Äôll hop on fallout like In a hour
---
There was video on yt recently showing how to dupe sss equipment by inviting a teamate then trade in the weapon or armor.then have your teamate go to the machine and they could buy the weapon you just sold in the machine...my reply comment was why don't you just earn it instead of fkng up the game....crickets.lol.why even play if you are going to cheat?makes no sense.this was on xbox.
---
k
---
Ae ri at crater or sunny at foundation. Or a random travelling trader can just have them
---
I've had my tent here just for convenience. Didn't realized it caused this. Wow.
---
That other people are noticing how the game has emptied out, it's what we were discussing?
---
Early on when the game came out, I would sometimes log in and find that my power armor frame had duplicated in my inventory. I would always just drop it somewhere and jump to another server and hope that nothing came of it. Happened like six times. But I didn't get hit in that first ban wave so I guess it turned out ok.
---
Very cool idea!  Stackables with cut-out window and door frames.  Would be a cool and realistic aesthetic.
---
ü§£ü§£so funny...ü§¢ü§¢but so gross at the same time
---
community is hoping so.. Ill tell you that much
---
The dupe isn‚Äôt fun. Playing with the gear you duped is. Giving it to a guy who would normally never have a hope in a million years of getting anything even remotely close to that good is so satisfying it‚Äôs almost as good as an orgasm. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs like this:
---
You own a bank, and you leave the vault wide open so people can easily take shit outta there. But the thing is, you left it open for a week and watched them take everything, while you stood by and did nothing. Would you expect people to not take it? No! This is why you keep the door shut and locked. The police might find the worst offenders but your insurance would laugh you out of the office. It‚Äôs all your fault.
---
Now imagine the same scenario but instead of a bank vault it‚Äôs a piss easy exploit players can benefit from.
---
Dang didn't know that's how this bug works, lost 2 of my weeklies yesterday
---
Plus shotgun shells.
---
Just depends, if I am near max caps I have a few things in that will not allow me to go over if I am low I stock it up with the good shit.
---
I spray the ground with a vampire's explosive LMG and swap a heavy card for armor weight reduction. Only does 6 explosive damage so it's perfect for carpet bombing and tags more and does less damage than a tesla.
---
Saddly this is not the first time it happens.  
---
People in good faith helping Bethesda, and get unfair ban in return.
---
86, I'm good!
---
I would say swap it with tenderizer or move the points to agility and run adrenaline (if they ever get around to making it work again)
---
Then we find out that on reality they *do* have the tools and they lied the whole time.
---
If you don't have a low level explosive shotty you can load them up with molotovs for easy tagging.
---
Would go a long way to making me feel less defeated, just like a base 2,000 score sent out to all players as a sorry
---
unsless i'm mistaken the game fills up a server. then activates another server. usally keeping open 3-4 spots per. ive noticed alot of people doing the level up challenge trick of creating a new toon. anyway. sorry you have to participate in events to get rewards. hopefully more people will get on and you can afk more.
---
You've been unfairly deprived of some worthless imaginary shit, so as long as you sue them for compensation in the form of some worthless imaginary shit, I think you've got a strong case.
---
When I'm on I don't see much traffic. I sell excess plans, simple made foods and ammo. But with the new convertor for ammo I'm slowly just dumping it into that thing to make up for the crap inventory space you camps can hold.
---
I like it, but the load times kills it for me. If I get killed quickly because I spawn into a high traffic area I have to wait 5 more minutes (give or take) after only playing for 30 seconds or so... kinda sucks then
---
Not at workshops, they can just blast you if you're there. Am a victim of it. There Was a dude just going around the map and flipping people's workshops. Like okay buddy take the handful of steel I had if that strokes your tiny peen
---
Oh no... I hope they don‚Äôt wipe my melee character, only the one that did the deed XD
---
No, it prevents people from doing damage to you also. They fix that in a patch a while back.
---
Yeah, im on the fence on that I one. I tend to get hit while attacking so I figured if I'm at 20% health all the time I should try to take the least possible damage. Open to swapping suggestions if you have any.
---
We misplaced our water cooled bone saw,and by replaced i mean stolen.if you could get it back we would be very grateful.
---
like how we have to make posts to remind people to not be logged in so their C.H.O.R.E.S. dont get borked instead of beth fixing it
---
Yeah you guys act like all them guns floating around are legit right? how many of them bloodied fixers do you think purveyor drops? All we were trying to do was share what we had in our inventory with each other not trying to sell or trade anything on the market!
---
Most likely, I think it links in with the delayed paid rank up feature too.
---
Once they fix the bug, likely we will see either an extension to the double SCORE weekend, or extra events which will be quite similar to what we are seeing currently but awarding significantly more score.  
---
Obviously users who have not been hit by the bug will benefit a bit more, but it gives those affected a solid FREE way to catch up.  
---
It also ensures Bethesda does not get hit with negativity by offering a monetisation system that is exploitative of a bug.
---
Naaa Beth is not trigger happy, and when they do it's more like a shotgun from afar. They hit some and don't care about collaterals.
---
But never has there been a warning or ban for using mods that are not geared towards cheating.
---
The dude still working on this game is kinda stressed and somewhat jealous of everyone else working on Starfield.
---
I tend recover about 20% of the bolts I fire from bodies, even when they are green pools of nuclear goo!
---
And many more posts complaining about posts complaining about the ban.
---
this, Im a bloodied commando build. if i am running solo at WS, i one shot everything. If i am with a group, i get rid of some of my rads and use a level 40 bloodied 10mm smg to make sure everyone get a hit on enemies
---
Same here bloody days I spend killing mole miners and the only two plans I wanted croc and marine helmet no where to be seen spent all me caps on 3 toons and nothing
---
they need to snap to foundations and id like modular version of the prefabs to allow my camp to not look like every other camp
---
I know of 4 people on my friends list who duped the crap out of this wave and the last ones. 
---
2 of them have millions of rounds of ammo,  millions of gifts,  millions of tokens and crap tons of every god roll and legacy in game. 
---
Guess what? They are still playing RIGHT THIS SECOND. 
---
This is what irks me about Bethesda,  they are so so inconsistent it‚Äôs unreal and just makes them a laughing stock.
---
Nowhere near as many posts talking about "so many people banned" lol
---
I was thinking about this very type of situation before and thought, while time consuming, in situations where something is meant to be communal/take one, what if you individually stocked your vendor to allow only one person to grab a ‚Äògoodie bag‚Äô at a time? More time consuming, but you won‚Äôt have individuals taking advantage of the situation and clearing your entire inventory that‚Äôs meant to be shared. You could even put up a display a sign like ‚Äòrefilled often‚Äô if someone shows up while the vendor is empty (though that might be a double-edged sword).
---
Those who would steal from others can go away to the corner of their C.A.M.P. and snicker about the 100 10mm rounds and few Stimpacks/drugs they got ‚Äòfor free‚Äô and plot about what they‚Äôll sell it back for to people who will never buy it. The few sour apples of this community, lol.
---
Just a thought.
---
I'm on ps4. Servers are always dead anyways lol. But I am happy that the dupes are gone.
---
I do find funny that a few streamers that play the game suddenly stopped as well...wonder why.
---
Speaking only for myself, I'm done with the rep/gold grind, at least on my main, and it's been replaced by the module/SCORE grind and it is A LOT less fun. I didn't mind the gold grind because I like playing events. What's left now is less satisfying and I'm logging in less frequently and not playing as long when I do.
---
Yea I was gonna say, I experienced this for the first time in all the time I played this game, I was doing what I usually do when I‚Äôm at 25k+ caps, visiting player vendors and seeing what they had to offer, I found this guy that had 100k ammo and over 100 weapons for sale, I fast travel and noticed he was afk in a separate box away from his interesting base layout( it was almost T shaped with no entrance on its sides only a single stair case leading up to the top then down into the inside, then I noticed I was in a very long and narrow tunnel(walls of punji boards) with the vendor on the other side however my first step I instantly died and the afk owner immediately rushes to me( I assume he was checking for junk) and turns on his mic and starts to flame and be obnoxious(even after leaving his camp) so I simply just left the world and found a new one. The guy was almost lvl500 btw so I‚Äôm guessing he has nothing better to do
---
&gt; or move the points to agility and run adrenaline
---
generating more damage is never a bad thing
---
I was about to rage quit trying to get mine in lol. I had items in and around the door area that just needed to be moved.
---
If you were on Xbox, I'd join ya!
---
I‚Äôve never bought in game items but I‚Äôd 100% rather spend $5 on an item I‚Äôd use over $5 on a cosmetic lol
---
as I said.. I do not run bloodied so take my opinion with a grain of salt..
---
I just dont think 30/2 is a good value for 3 perk points
---
Bethesda is completely against us having fun and getting end game items. Anything that has a slightly higher chance of dropping a better item gets the antifun update and becomes boring again
---
^^ I got banned and don‚Äôt even care.. the game has been getting old to me for a long time and thought some new legacies might spice it up for me. Getting banned just let‚Äôs me play other games I‚Äôll enjoy
---
Same!  Chinese stealth armour and silenced rifles now.  It's a brand new game.
---
Well that certainly was a metric ton of nonsense.
---
If you still have the ' V.A.T.S. unknown blaster, it makes this challenge a heap quicker and easier. Camden Park is a good spot to go.
---
Sorry, a little out of the loop here. When exactly is the reset, and why should we avoid it?
---
This is what happens when you make a game free to the public (game pass). All the losers see if they can hack it for fun.
---
I‚Äôd love an armored vehicle prefab for my C.A.M.P.
---
Using the grocers backpack mates them with almost nothing, I usually stock up to about 40 bottles
---
I agree here. NW is usually a good tell of players and I've only had full lobbies (50-52). Maybe all the level 100+ are grinding NW seasonal rewards while we can? I know I am
---
The game is perfectly playable solo now, the raids and stuff are just for players that enjoy team-based problem solving and want unique stuff as a trophy. I think part of the future plans is allowing more flexibility for players, we already have tanks in PA and now rogue character classes with the stealth suit so if they continue in that direction and improve stuff like Medic's so players can be healers too it will start to look more like a proper RPG. The VATS being more strategic is an interesting idea, maybe they could add a Legendary perk or something that actually adds a small time dilation effect to the creatures you're targeting.
---
They should just put the ft mats back into the game, it is quite ridiculous.
---
What special is bloody mess in
---
I like to keep a stock of 1k ammo of the types that actually sell.  If I'm running low I'll put up 250 at 2 caps knowing it won't sell, giving me time to build up more stock while not feeling my internal obsessive stare at me for the gap in my vendor inventory.  It's an issue.
---
lol, need to loot them.
---
Pulowski‚Äôs shelter on super budget
---
Over the past two weeks I've completed three or four that didn't even give me score didn't even register it
---
I‚Äôm glad they banned the cheaters what‚Äôs the point in playing if your going to cheat
---
This change was applied few patches ago too, its been like this about a month. I know, cause I rebuilt my base then too and had no problems with single foundation and stairs...
---
But, you know Bethesda ;)
---
I would recreate Shipment from MW and have PVP sessions.
---
I get more than that from queen fights if people actually let the SBQ and SBs live long enough to spawn a group of scorched.
---
Thank you! You are amazing!!!
---
excavator armor with bone armor skin that wood look cool
---
You are amazing! Thank you!
---
Did they actually ban people?  I am sick of seeing all the Bloody 25/25 Fixer kids.    
---
I'm so lost ... I hope they actually did it.
---
I accidentally added a second set of stairs to my main set, that‚Äôs the entrance of my CAMP. You can only see the top of them, but I can‚Äôt delete them because ‚Äúpart of the structure would not be accessible‚Äù. 
---
It‚Äôs mega annoying.
---
Most vending machines I have frequented lately have been flooded with overpriced armours, thousands of those  goddamn mounted plans, commonly dropped plans for the listed price, bloodied/junkies weapons I have no interest in purchasing, or bulk junk for the same price the vendor bots charge. So, at this point I don't even bother with player vendors. I might try again in a couple of months, but I doubt anything will change. Until then I'll just grind my characters until I'm satisfied with all my builds.
---
 Do you even read what you are writing? That's some high level mental gymnastics right there. I aplaud you for your creativity.
---
 It's like an organ trafficker trying to justify what they do because they are somehow saving the lives of his buyers. What the hell...
---
How is game pass affecting the dupe?
---
Events where you have to play instruments
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recipe:\_Tasty\_squirrel\_stew](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recipe:_Tasty_squirrel_stew)
---
i think Le grande gourmet in the white springs sells it.
---
What do you mean, in fo4 the moment you found PA , games switches to easy peasy mode. I always play without it in fo4, for more challenge (survival)
---
I‚Äôm not sure you understand. What I‚Äôm getting at is yes, duping is wrong but Bethesda is at fault for allowing it to happen in the first place.
---
Yeah, and half the world being quarantined during release didn‚Äôt help either.
---
Figure out a build and work towards it.  nukesdragons has all the perk cards and required SPECIAL.
---
The best builds I've found in no particular order, explosives, commando, fileman/sniper, shotguns.  Each will require a certain SPECIAL setup so you can't take all of these.
---
You gonna want some basic perks like frog legs, bloody mess etc that work for all.  
---
Certain perks are underrated.  lockpick can access some amazing equipment.  Hacker can reveal enemy positions on the map for a few moments, giving you amazing situational awareness including finding the player(s) who have nuke briefcases.
---
Lastly, bringing all of this together of a squad of 4 using voice chat like discord to coordinate will elevate your results massively especially if your teammates do not suck.
---
Not as many are being claimed on reddit im sure.
---
Your missing bonus due to int. Most people grinding the xp have full unyielding(15), 15 int, builder team(4), egghead/herd mentality (8 - 11 depending on strange in numbers) that's 45 int plus the xp boost from food, well rested and lunchboxes. Doing half of that I can get 10k xp twice on a single loop of my 3 favorite legendary farm locations.
---
Been around since beta, but I can't remember a single "ban wave" for QOL mods, just 2 bans for a cheater's one.
---
Could you link me up with evidence for your statement?
---
People on PC with Game Pass get a copy through the Windows Store that has no link to their main Steam or Bethesda account.
---
At rank 3, it‚Äôs an extra 15% damage.
---
was idontusereddit1234567 taken?
---
ESO did once upon a time. A huge amount of their end game playerbase actually. Anyway that game is chugging along five years later and even when dupes do pop up in that game very few people use them for fear of getting banned
---
Damn I‚Äôm also on xbox but had to stop and say hi to my otaku kin lol‚úä
---
Yep, I actually felt really sad about it. I am very easily pleased and I have been ok with everything until I realized my previous white springs nuke zone was useless. Like OP said, it was just so much fun, regardless of XP or legendary drops. I just wanna kill endless hordes of enemies with my buddies.
---
I‚Äôm not one for battle royal games either, but NW isn‚Äôt  too bad. Forza Horizon 4‚Äôs BR (Eliminator) is a pretty nice take on it as well.
---
Oh yeah my b forgot game pass is for pc too.
---
Nah, you don't wanna go near that dirty stuff.
---
Ahhhh. Ok. Thank you kindly. 
---
Def do not have anything like that. But I also never sell (or buy) any 3* legendary stuff above $1-2k
---
I thought maybe dupers were the dumbledorfs    selling items for 10k etc, which completely upended the economic system of 76. Not like we  have FO kids we gotta put thru college?! Plus it isn‚Äôt hard to make a lot of money in this game, in a short time if need be. Unless a person is just too lazy and doesn‚Äôt want to play game, as intended; in those cases, idk why they even play. Happy wandering ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Yeah but you said it elsewhere, not part of this particular thread of discussion.  Can't assume people read every reply in the entire topic.
---
But you helped me and my friend realize that it wasn't something on our end and we really appreciate the feedback. 
---
Hope you're having a great day, dude. Stay awesome.
---
Hey, I'm one of those people! It started off as laziness, forget to change the price before putting them in and just didn't care enough to fix it. Now though... people keep buying the ammo at 2 caps a piece. I think they're stupid, it's overpriced for sure, but hey if people want to pay double for ammo who am I to say no?
---
Same on Xbox. Virtually no one. No vendors. No one to do events with. Sometimes see other high levels  and they don't come to events or have vending machines up. I've noticed this over the last few days.
---
Its not difficult, its tedious and unfun. I launch 2-3 a day usually and its becoming a grind.
---
Oh. Ya. That‚Äôd seem a bit fishy fo sho
---
me thinks some people are at work right now? I am at least
---
The bans aren't nearly as significant as some people are making them out to be. It's a combination of A) people came back for the update and are starting to leave again, B) gamepass so pc/xbox has many new players not participating in events etc, C) some cheaters have been banned, D) just pure luck where you end up getting put. Player count on steam is still only slightly below the average
---
Grow up, then you'll get the difference between a cheat and QOL.
---
Ohhh boo hooo!! Who cares if someone duped!!its a damn game .. it‚Äôs the developers fault  for having the issues.. Bethesda;so let‚Äôs ban all these players because little Johnny didn‚Äôt learn anything in his coding class before being hired in by Bethesda!! Maybe finish the development stages of the game before delivering the game to consumers without all these issues( aside from duping) seems like that‚Äôs what any other developer does before release thier game. Bethesda went half way with 76 and said ‚Äúokay it‚Äôs finished‚Äù so no it‚Äôs not the duper‚Äôs fault imo!
---
Yeah, nowadays on public you're lucky if you get someone considerate enough to move in a group with you and not one-shot everything in Whitesprings.
---
Yeah, the only difference is that the organ trafficker can magically make organs out of thin air and give it to anyone who needs one for free, not to mention they aren‚Äôt harming anyone and aren‚Äôt taking organs from someone and causing damage. Seems you like arguing yet you have no idea what you are even trying to prove, like I said, quit replying if you are one of those imbeciles who just want to say ‚Äúyou deserve to be banned, dupers ruined the game, FO76 is unplayable because of you evil dupers‚Äù, unfortunately not even an organ trafficker can save you unless you replace that brain of yours üòÇ
---
Gotcha. A bloody build I am not. Too much time spent on load screens üòÇ
---
You don‚Äôt need first aid as a bloodied build, your health is so low all you need is stimpak diluted and you‚Äôll be fine
---
It does now.
---
Carnivores have the squirrel stew or w/e its called.
---
For crying out loud, it's a game not a meetup for masochists.
---
I‚Äôm saying we recently have an influx of low level players due to gamepass being launched last week. Low level players don‚Äôt have camps. That saturation of low level players makes other incorrectly think nobody is on the map.
---
It‚Äôs just not true and it‚Äôs a result of people not understanding the macro picture. A server won‚Äôt be empty lol. That‚Äôs not how AWS works. Again... 10s of thousands of people are playing the game right now. There just are now a lot more low level players so the ratio of high to low is skewing low at the moment.
---
Just think about it logically... how could servers be empty if you have over 10K people playing on your platform? It‚Äôs currently a top 20 game on Xbox lol
---
I would _love_ to know legit, new player counts. My hunch is that the vast majority of "newbies" you see are people rolling a new character, or mules. I'm pretty sure most of us that have a level 100+ character, have at least one other low level character, or have started over from scratch just for fun. The first 50 levels are the most fun, so I've replayed them a few times myself at least.
---
Anyways, all I'm saying is you were never going to get your goods to a newbie anyways. It would have been a low level mule, or someone else that was effectively well off anyways. You helped a person either way and probably improved someone's day, who cares what level they were.
---
Open C:\\Users\\"username"\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Project76Prefs.ini
---
Search for iPresentInterval and set it from 1 to 0
---
would be even better if u would just get all that shit straight into inventory, solves also legendarys that falls into the abyss.
---
Alright, thanks.
---
Thanks for your words! God bless you and all. Stay safe!
---
I've read about that happening. Server hopping seems to fix it
---
Pro-tip: Go newbie hunting and drop them stuff directly and use the gift emote. You cannot rely on people to do the right thing and furthermore there are a number of international players that play on NA servers and they probably just think you are being cool af. Don't take it personally.
---
The plushie is the Big Thing I want from this. I mean, small, but...you get it.
---
I'm a bit behind but every rank up gets me closer to that cutie. So excited!
---
But you agreed to a term of service...I didn't read the terms but I agreed to it and am smart enough to understand taking advantage of an exploit for personal gain was wrong...
---
one violent night.. the PC for Fertile Soil.. what else?
---
Yeah, as long as you‚Äôre in a group you‚Äôre getting benefits.
---
As far as herd mentality I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve heard it does still work.
---
Damage reduction (given by damage resistance) in Fallout 76 is a function of DR and the damage the mob does, and there is a certain point where you hit an upper threshold for how much damage reduction you can have. For mobs that don't do much damage, this threshold is hit at lower levels of DR, while for harder hitting mobs you hit that threshold at higher levels of DR. Because of this, stacking more DR is not always the optimal choice and actually sources that apply damage reduction (for example the blocking perk or the fireproof perk) is much better for overall mitigation.  I have not tested it, but I doubt, that no matter how much you stack your DR, you'll ever beat PA in raw mitigation because PA has hidden damage reduction.
---
Try using your camera. If you‚Äôre pointed in the direction of the corpse of an enemy, it‚Äôs name will appear on the screen.
---
the burrows is the way to go now but no one ever nukes it
---
Oops, disgregard pls
---
Most ban waves in the past were a joke. Ban like maybe 20 of the worst offenders, leave everybody else with a slap on the wrist, let all their mules with all the cheated items go free. They grew lenient and people exploited all they wanted because they knew nothing would happen to them. Based on the chaos in certain discord servers right now, MANY more accounts are being targeted now, including some of their mules and the main accounts associated with their burners
---
Yes, I've tested this.  The description for herd mentality is not accurate.
---
I gained very little and what I did gain actually went back into the community again.
---
I've tried that - does not fix it unfortunately. I checked that alt's inventory and tried to craft the backpack in case I learned it. No dice.
---
If the game is too hard for you, there‚Äôs always FarmVille or something
---
Not until they fix build issues, like snapping.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Hunters Long Coat
---
And when those casuals leave, our servers will be even more devoid of useful other players to interact with, I'm surprised you haven't seen the difference at events yet. Not enjoying it right now I have to say
---
You do get double xp from running it twice and double legendary enemies in certain ones, making it good there
---
I handed out a bloodied 3* hunting rifle today. Sometimes its worth the effort to find the low levels and get them to take the stuff. Then you know who got it, and they can trade up when they are ready.
---
I didn't even notice that wtf
---
Maybe playing Fallout 4 simultaneously idk
---
üòµ
---
Well, Fallout 76 has gone from outside the top 100 'most played' games on Xbox Live to within the top 20 this week.
---
ESO sits outside the top 50, and that has around 8,000-10,000 players on at once. So, I reckon Fallout 76 must have gained about 100,000 players to be sitting where it is. At least on Xbox and PC.
---
That's why I was doing it. For the new Xbox players. It is why Xbox servers (and I guess PC servers) look empty at the moment. New players have yet to set up vendors etc.
---
Also as a bloodied you‚Äôll want your health around 20-30% so serendipity, nerd rage, and adrenal reaction will kick in, so if you have born survivor hitting you with stims at 40% you‚Äôll never get the effects of those perks.
---
I had a 415 on a public team the other day.
---
Was real nice, helped me complete a bunch of events without one shotting stuff.
---
but then people will cry they get over encumbered by auto loot drops..
---
frankly I would rather pick up what I want than have to drop the things I dont..
---
in the absence of glowing corpses or some other such highlighting.. using the pro snap camera works to find corpses as long as they havent sunk under the map
---
You are seeing a lot of low level players because of game pass. Not because of the ‚Äúban wave‚Äù.
---
Still a gain and doesn't matter if you gave it away or not you still did it...if you robbed a bank and gave the money away did you still Rob the bank?
---
&gt;sugar bombs
---
I never get more than one or two Sugar Bombs in the Mosstown bathtub. Have you gone there recently? Is there more than one Mosstown bathtub with multiple Sugar Bombs?
---
I don't quite get it, are you trying to imply that it's bad that they are finally doing something? That it would be better for them to just continue doing nothing?
---
While I understand what you‚Äôre saying; let me play devil‚Äôs advocate.
---
So, it is true that there is a pandemic going on and not many developers will be working in house. While, yes, an update would cost them money, I foresee that this could have been handled server side thus avoiding an update (they‚Äôve done this kind of thing countless times).
---
Could BGS not just have disabled joining off of friends for the weekend? That would have eliminated the dupe right there and gave them time to fix it without risking players or the economy. They chose neither.
---
Not apologizing for anyone who was banned, but I do see how this could be frustrating. They clearly set up their detection bot to issue bans for the dupes. Cool. Why hasn‚Äôt that same bot been deployed to detect people doing the god mode glitch? Cheating in Nuclear Winter? Handing out .50 Cal Machine Guns that can shoot orbital strikes? There was a dupe recently where people created millions of presents and absolutely wrecked the cap economy. Bethesda did nothing.
---
All of what is happening could be avoided if Bethesda was actually consistent in their responses.
---
Did this yesterday for a legendary Bloodbug that showed up right after killing Sheepsquatch. Still took me a couple of minutes to find it but at least I didn‚Äôt miss out on that 1 star ghoulslayer rolling pin!
---
Its an exploit. Wont say how its done
---
No.. because new players are a thing.. but how about this.
---
Fallout 1st players on private worlds can nuke.. anything! 
---
That would work for everyone, no?
---
How can they be devoid... there are 10s of thousands of people playing
---
The same, yet not the same. Yes, I deserve punishment and I‚Äôm not debating I deserved it.
---
I'm assuming that's what this is, somebody at the studio said enough is enough and went full out. I wouldn't be at all surprised if they are intentionally overstretching the bans here just to make a point in hopes that people will think twice before cheating in the future
---
Yeah yeah... Because you must be a hero that did nothing wrong. All in all, at the end of the day, you are the one who lost your account and is salt about it. So cry me a river.
---
Why people downvote him lol? I never understood people who to lazy to Google for 5 sec and find an answer right away
---
This happened to me with Fasnacht day masks, plans etc. I thought I'll put them all in and thought all the people that missed it can grab them! :)  I put them all in right after for a few caps each and someone came along and just bought them all out. I felt so stupid after. -\_- I should've waited awhile to do it. Lesson learned.
---
You missed "usefull" you know for public teams and events...
---
Sometimes if I go too fast the cursor disappears altogether and the scrap menu starts scrapping things in other sections.
---
An easy way to tell if you have the correct Sugar Bombs is by looking at the package. The dirty ones are the ones you want. If the package is clean then you have the wrong ones. Sell those.
---
On PC the ini file can be edited to do client side stuff like remove grass, make water transparent, prevent Bloody Mess explosions. It might also be possible to do what you want. You have to either check yourself or find someone who known more about the settings that are available.
---
lucky I‚Äôd trade my berserkers rolling pin
---
Teats
---
Took a while for another one to show up but no, there's not a cap on the empty bottle. I don't think empty ones can have a cap.
---
I know junk walls are coming... Maybe someday for these. 
---
Someday our builds will fit with the world. Someday.
---
Better question is why? Lol
---
Luck.
---
Ahhh is that why I see so many winter icicle lights and santa crash plans in everyone's vendors?
---
I had this problem. The game was installed, and I knew the "install" option would fix it, but my SSD only had 40 of the required 65gb free.
---
Only way I could play was to uninstall DOOM Eternal to free up space (that I didn't actually need) so I had 100gb free and then the install button worked, it detected the game and then just launched.
---
As usual, Bethesda products just work.
---
You're seeing a scared straightie right here. I don't dupe but I will never start now. This last method almost broke me but I'm here
---
I generate more caps than I can spend still, so my vendor just has random stuff so its there for fast travel. We need more caps sinks
---
No, I'm suggesting the product team should have been consistent with both their support and maintenance of this online world they created. Also just explaining why folks are frustrated/angry or just plain done...
---
Any update? You guys hotfixed the exploits quick can we get a hot fix on our vault mask and the cap?
---
It's apparent that Bethesda lacked the means to properly implement multiplayer. I think the concept is great, but this game is essentially the prototype for the online franchise and unfortunately, they have seen how flawed the system and security measures in the game really are. They will learn from these problems, but I can't believe how mismanaged things are and how incredibly reactive they are to potential exploiters. I guarantee that the friends I have, gave me duplicated weapons, could I prove it? No, but would you turn down a God tier weapon that someone gave you for free because you're too morally upstanding to accept a potentially duplicated item in a game? Hell no. You take that bitch and enjoy the hell out of it. Well, guess what? I have a lot of amazing weapons that I legitimately acquired as well, but now I have to worry because someone is watching what I have and what I do in a freaking video game? I just got banned, and it has left a really sour taste in my mouth, especially when I have payed so much money for video games...it has turned into a business that caters only to players that dump their pocket book into the cash grabbing and flawed monopoly that the gaming industry has become. You know what true exploitation is?? Taking fucking gobs of cash from people for things that should be earned in a game. Straight up can't play now, so I'm probably saying piss off to Bethesda for a while...

It‚Äôs because of more players in the game.... not less. Eventually those new players will level up. We saw the same thing when wastelanders dropped. Average player level went down because of all the new players joining the game. It wasn‚Äôt because people were leaving lol
---
You have it all wrong. People were saying servers were dead after wastelanders. Obviously that was not true.
---
I was fast selling aid items a few days ago and then I got a warning about selling on of my favorited items. While still on the aid section I was accidently attempting to sell a favorited gun.
---
Idk the actual numbers, but if steam player count is anything to by, it's a small overall percentage. Also worth considering that many of the cheaters have multiple burner accounts, some for the duping, some for muling, some for selling. 5 bans could represent a single person
---
It's the middle of a workday in the US.  :-)
---
as to why, probably because instead of making 200 5.56/5mm/10mm/.38 an hour,  user in question is pumping our 1200 of each an hour
---
"Those dirty POORS who didn't pay the entrance fee!"
---
Wait, what?
---
I now realise why I had no fibre optic scrap left the other night, and had to buy a load in bulk from Modus' production facility. Modding Gatling Lasers also seems to chew it up.
---
I'm more on your side, but alot of people don't understand when you click agreed to not do specific things in the game and when you do those specific things expect a ban...weather you read the agreement or not
---
Lol you idiots dupers were keeping the games economy going and now that there all banned good luck finding any good armor or weapons at player vendors because with 76's abysmal drop rate Noone will be selling any god tier items so enjoy your supressors 1‚òÜ lead pipe, it's all you will find now player vending may as well go the way of vault raids and just eliminate it all together. This game is circling the drain and all you anti duper morons deserve what is coming next, sbq yall can't kill without wasting all your ammo for a week yall have a brand new event coming up the colossal problem yeah good luck with that. This game is dieing enjoy the death throws!
---
Bloody mess is under luck, it adds 15% damage for all weapons you use so it‚Äôs a must have
---
It was fixed like a year ago. Drills are still part of the regular loot she can drop alongside the legendary, so it's probably that
---
What's the return rate on 5mm?
---
Maybe so.  I do have a small sample size too.  We'll see how it goes in the next few days.
---
I played since beta, its certainly different this time.
---
If you haven't noticed, fine, we'll have to agree to disagree:-)
---
For a while I recommend dont buy, because I believe that Bethesa implement trasactions log to catch d*p3rs and can still activated...
---
I know lol, i was being a dick with my original comment lol
---
Yeah, makes sense I suppose. Forgot about the Game Pass situation bringing some new folks in.
---
Wow
---
 Incredible work. I would just assume it was an in-world structure!
---
45 now actually thinking might finish it in time frame
---
But this is not bad thing actually, they are always on vendor and like 1k per. Back in time you had to relog alot of times to get desired mods. And deep pockets for combat chest only learner via scraping, no recipe üòí
---
Herd mentality still works.
---
It's been awhile since I was sunshine oil merchant.
---
Grahm
---
Okay thanks I shall hold my beloved caps for the time being.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since launch (so you have a week on me lol). 850 hours so far. It‚Äôs just the influx of new players. We see the same thing during free weekends.
---
And like I said, I deserve banning. I do not dispute this. I originally wanted to know if it‚Äôs permanent or not.
---
Are we talking about the ammo converter?
---
Do not know about xbox but I know for sure that Sony against the crossplay Todd mighty Howard said it himself
---
They have all the proof they need on their end. They don't need to prove to you Jack shit. It's their game and you broke the ToS you agreed to.
---
ha the name gives it away!
---
In the meantime, [here](https://i.imgur.com/aHjpLr5.jpg) is me and the plush bois announcing our album of sheep song covers. 
---
It's pretty much just baa baa black sheep on repeat with a triangle in the background, but it rocks none the less.
---
I rebuilt my camp from scratch and refilled my vendors last friday. Have been online 2-3 hours every day since then and have a lot of pretty cheap items (5 cap stimpaks etc). The only thing I sold since then were three individual bullets from someone doing that challenge. It's as if people just don't bother with it anymore.
---
I do hate the fact that they retcon like everything. You have source material the least you can do is stick to it
---
Thank you, just curious. There are old ones that have a cap, you used to be able to find them in the workshop that foundation took over, so they are no longer obtainable. I was wondering because it wouldn't be the first time that bethesda added an incorrect version of an item to a drop list
---
playable yes. playable, but enjoyable? Also, my reference was to the "Chad Feral Ghouls," you foresee in future-event-vaults if you take my meaning? Also, I am pretty sure that I can't keep up enough DPS with any of the rifles I have found so far to kill SBQ. The single player content is maybe 1-2 weeks if you have some Beth experience but take it easy? I am telling you man, I had a mod of FO4 that just turned the sandbox into constant chaos, it was glorious. Also upgraded the AI to super nasty so they had actual combat strategy to contend with (instead of more spongy bullshite).
---
I find him fairly often these days but he never has them! 
---
Happy cake day btw üôÇ
---
Run a vampire gatlin gun (using the same one for 6 month) build so I doubt you was cranking those out for the needy.  Once again goodbye.
---
I bought a few items straight from the train station while people were trying to dupe them lol. I'm not banned so I think it's safe. Besides, items from a player vendor isn't what got people banned
---
I don't dupe, I fail to see the point in not having fun playing.  Having said that, I often dump plans in (to me) large quantities in train stations, especially ultracite pieces.   I do it with ammo, plans and gear all of the time.  It's not always cheaters doing it ...
---
This. Only occasionally at that. It's glitchy as fuck though, definitely not worth 15k lol.
---
Jokes on you, I'm always low on that stuff.
---
I think you can buy the plans for advanced power connectors at white springs in the little mall or maybe from modus production terminal
---
Like a cows opinion, it doesnt matter?
---
Sadly I don't have the camera yet. I need to work on that.
---
Stop spreading misinformation, this is straight from the [Bethesda website](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44182/~/how-does-pacifist-mode-work-in-fallout-76%3F)
---
"Pacifist mode can help ensure you do not become flagged as hostile or wanted. It¬†will also reduce the risk of being killed by other players.
---
Note: Players will still be able to damage you while pacifist mode is activated but this damage will be reduced and that player will be flagged as hostile."
---
 you can downvote my comment but it doesn't mean its wrong
---
I been buying from player vendors and have had no issues.
---
That sounds depressing If I had to run that gun nonstop I would quit the game!!
---
Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Best thing to do is call a friend over so you can keep leaving the server and rejoin, it‚Äôll refresh his inventory
---
[You are welcome.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/647)
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind but no they really don‚Äôt. Why the fuck is my grandad banned? He didn‚Äôt even know there was a dupe glitch going on and he didn‚Äôt even play the last week and a half. He logged on today and was hit with the ban. So what proof do these cunts have for that one? I‚Äôll tell you, none. There is no proof. Stop licking their boots and come back when you‚Äôve done your homework.
---
But yes, I did deserve my ban.
---
Fallout 1st membership perk: Deployable Venderbot Stall
---
Makes sense. Inconsistency is a problem for the time being, but if they continue being strict for future exploits, at least that will be taken care of. Their support in general could use some more consistency, or for that matter a complete refurbishing. Trying to submit a ticket almost feels like trying to file your taxes for the first time
---
Yeah. Sometimes I get put right back in the same one, so waiting a minute or two is a good idea
---
Have them keep him in the trade menu so he doesn‚Äôt wander off and disappear
---
Wow in that case I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs no crossover. Sounds ruined on pc
---
+1
---
Okay thank you.
---
It's nice never need to farm ammo and it gets the job done.
---
I got killed in some player trap camp a week ago when i was at his vending machine. I didn't know what happen at first but then i went back to the camp and look through the window saw another player at the vending machine and then the room filled with those spiked boards and that dude died. I was like Bethesda can't fix shit! It says a lot when players are out smarting the development team who say they patched the problem only to have it still be a problem.
---
I have been seeing this as well for months. Have actually sold a ton of ammo cause of this.
---
i think OP means the max raider rep ammo producer, cant tell for sure though but my guess is based off the munition factory part since the workshop and raider machines work semi similar
---
Yeah, I don't have the camera yet. I have it on another character but since the quest to get the camera isn't obvious, there's probably still a lot of people without one.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Actually the creation engine allows for number id code to be used to spawn in item like with console commands in prwvious titles so with that in mind even if item arnt stacking they have the same item id till they are altered from the version dropped
---
My man! Hope you're watching some good stuff these days. Also nice rikka pic üòÇ
---
I started a new character a while back and got the small backapack. He's now level 101 and i just realized the other day that i had never gone back and did the tadpole stuff. TBH, dont think i will either
---
&gt;Also the maps are practically empty.
---
The maps? There's only one and it's pretty full btw, that's why the game *needs* more maps. 
---
Are you talking about content or players, because if it's for players is probably because of the ban wave.
---
Best to leave it up in case other people come looking for the same question!
---
I want a Legendary Bloodied explosive Boomerang
---
No- he is talking about the actual munitions factory workshop ammo producer, you can have it operational at your camp. It‚Äôs a glitch.
---
They have proof otherwise they wouldn't have banned anybody. Whose boots am i licking?  
---
I'm giving you the hard facts, they don't have to prove to you anything. Don't cheat next time.
---
The worste part about the tramp camps is I find that if they get you forgetting to put your junk away, they tend to server hop immediatly.
---
I think you can use your personal terminal to find a tourist and get it quickly. Don‚Äôt quote me on that though! I‚Äôve had it since the day it came out, back in the glory days [when you could do this](https://youtu.be/uoht2eytEJs)
---
So I have 10 identical combat rifles and it can tell me which is which. I don‚Äôt think so somehow... Otherwise they could have removed all the dupes of every weapon that has ever existed.
---
...where does one acquire this?
---
The Dupening
---
Is there a channel or a way to learn those glitches?
---
--close
---
And there site isn't updated just like a bunch of tips while the game loading aren't updated.
---
I have pacifist on.  I have had people unload their explosive LMG's on me for over a minute.  I took 0 damage.  Your comment is wrong.
---
Take over the munitions factory workshop, north of the map.
---
That makes sense tho
---
Yeah
---
I feel this way too... I just don't care for the new SCORE season pass... I hate things that make me feel like I have to commit to it like a job or put in a lot of time to reap any reward. This is a game for me, and I'm not going to make it my life. I haven't logged in for about a month, and have just been jumping from other game to other game, looking for something now that will capture my interest.
---
Lmao I didn‚Äôt lose my account, they‚Äôd probably restore it to everyone unless they decide to perma ban pretty much the entire player base that has been active/played for awhile. I just find it funny af that they chose to kill off mass of the game, at the end of the day, you probably have duped items in your inventory also, so cry me a river because you seem to love replying with pointless messages. Just shut up and go back in your basement instead of making notifications pop up on my phone, or I guess I might as well just block considering how many smooth brains there are who just love saying the same thing over and over ‚Äúyou deserved to be banned, hahahaha, you are evil‚Äù. Meanwhile they have an entire inventory filled with duped items, so yes, go cry me river because you seem to like starting fights in the comment section but you are too afraid to face the truth. Not to mention people automatically assume that, ‚Äúoh you duped, you are horrible. You probably duped over a hundred times and and gave everything to everyone, oh I hate you because you never gave me one!‚Äù, yeah yeah get real, most of us duped like at max 20-30 times which is pretty much just enough to get most of out friends the copies of items that we have, just because you didn‚Äôt have any friends with good stuff doesn‚Äôt you mean you have to get all salty about dupers. That‚Äôs the plain truth, the only complainers out there are players who didn‚Äôt manage to get their hands on these high end items, or players who want to throw other people under the bus and then say ‚ÄúI never duped before and all my items were honestly obtained‚Äù üòÇüëç
---
Probably depends on the situation. Buying 1 item, probably 100% fine no matter what the item is outside of hacked stuff on pc.
---
Buying 25 bloody explosive laser rifles with identical durability fit 50 caps a pop? Might want to avoid doing that.
---
Agreed ‚Äî Grahm‚Äôs stuff deserves a mark up, but ought to be closer to 1500 than 15K.
---
Some players like myself have so many legendary weapons and armor pieces that we can‚Äôt sell or scrip them all, I end up dropping legendaries on the ground because I‚Äôve hit my scrip and stash cap so I would welcome scrapping for modules
---
Lol yeah I definitely will avoid doing that
---
Been stuck on signing in screen since noon
---
i traded a legacy for it then i found him and got it but i dont have it anymore
---
So I cant quote the vocabulary that Bethesda use? You seem to think i done it in some passive aggressive way, when really i used quotes to, you guessed it, quote something
---
No,its just that there are that many banned accounts from duping.
---
It's pretty low if you only want one specific type of ammo. You're better off just capturing the munitions factory workshop and setting it to 5mm.
---
My. Grandad. Wasn‚Äôt. Even. Active. During. The. Dupe. Wave. He. Was. Banned. There. Can‚Äôt. Be. Any. Proof. He. Cheated. Because. It. Is. Physically. Impossible. To. Cheat. If. You‚Äôre. Not. Even. In. The. Game.
---
Well they actually did that over a year ago left one of every weapon that was in people inventories . some got around this by adding different reciever and barrel which actually do change the weapon.
---
Think of it like this when the rifle spawns it is like cmbt(leg effect1,2,3)number 1 then each consecutive one is listed with 2 then 3 to prevent them from stacking
---
just hit up a personal terminal at someones camp to find the tourists body..
---
its not an ideal situation.. but it works..
---
(On PS4) I was buying stuff  from vendors yesterday and last night without any hiccups...so I believe it's safe. I did see a Bloodied non 25/25 Handmade (coudnt remember what effects) for 12k caps...needless to say I didn't touch it..lol. God roll or not.
---
I use my jetpack to go up there all the time and I hop around on the roofs and target practice on charred ghouls.
---
When the white springs is nuked, I find that using the jetpack on my power armor and running along the cottage roofs, gives me a really good advantage at farming glowing ghouls.
---
I'm sorry but you don't make the rules, Bethesda does, how can you dispute a fact which is written on their own help website, it isn't outdated, you are.
---
You can deny the proof all you want but I won't entertain your delusional argument, good day.
---
Literally 1 retcon between 4 and 76. Bruh new Vegas had worse
---
To be honest i dont mind the poeple that duped i dont care i dont do it, but for the players who bought or received duped items and got banned, i think thats completely unfair, theres so much duping that happened most players might have something duped, a weapon, flux, armor, presents plans or whatever were all at risk that means?, its ridiculous, the dupers can get banned but buying duped weapons or receiving duped items without knowing shouldent be banned, its not necessarily theyre fault either
---
This‚òùÔ∏è
---
I think that jetpack is the best thing in the game!!
---
Great Idea, but all im reading is :server crash: :server crash: :server crash:
---
15k caps? which weapon it was?
---
If it's a shared account or same system they probly banned the whole system or IP. Dunno.
---
 Maybe you need to learn your lesson.  Don't be a scummy cheater.
---
It really is. Creation engine is terrible for PVP.
---
You can‚Äôt sell ammo.
---
Gotcha... generally from what I've heard is after the investigation goes through they make a decision to wipe the account to give it back or permanently ban it...in some cases people get their accounts back with all the shit they had still, it's up to Todd friend good luck!
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
The finer loops of getting legendaries?
---
Wow bro, that's very deep. I'm thinking Todd and his merry company thought the same thing when they've set the chances of good stuff at around 0.2%. I mean it's so much fun needing 500 events for a good gun.
---
And that's why I love shortcuts. And you're the reason why Bethesda will keep shipping boring grind games.
---
Mmmmmmm thank youuuu
---
Oh many have out of curiosity. Nothing wrong with "I'll be darned, it works" and then moving on. I don't all the time. But to make exploits a game its self gets pretty boring pretty quickly.
---
saw the edit, wtf dude.
---
Different house, different console. And if cheating in a game is being scummy, what am I if I actually do something that affects people in real life? Don‚Äôt throw around words like scum because I duped to help people in the community who would otherwise have never gotten a weapon even half as good.
---
which system you are? it‚Äôs only one badge left for me, I need revive ally at water, let‚Äôs help each other out
---
I swore it glitched and sold a ton of harpoons on me.
---
I don't think it's been totally fixed. I still find the odd Legendary ghoul that will have only a drill.
---
Or a fancy hairbrush. It's one or the other, it's only ghouls, it happens only in the Whitespring and in all the times that happened to me the nuke launch warning will go off a minute later. Without fail. I guess the target selection causes a bit of a server strain as the area is prepared for what's about to go down and there is simply not enough time to spawn in the correct item. It's odd.
---
Many apologies. The maps (servers) are practically empty of players. But you bring up a good point about the lack of content.
---
True lol
---
I just soak up any videos related to ‚Äúcamp building tips and tricks‚Äù. There are a lot of youtubers with some useful bits of info here and there. My first thing to learn is something I still use to this day. The circular walls glitch by a YT‚Äôer named Jug. Watch that and his other tips. Then check out building tips from some people like DTD gamer, no respawns, Miz Tracey, TNG, decoys dungeon, etc. There‚Äôs a lot to learn. If you have any specific questions or want an up close tutorial session (on PS4 only), add me and I‚Äôd be happy to show you some stuff.
---
Shipping containers was in FO4 build mode so it doesn't make sense why they're not in 76's
---
...the bot invasion was just so..scary
---
This just happened to me. Stopped playing Fallout 76 and quit out to play COD around 10 pm yesterday. Went to work and came back today at 4 pm and most of my daily quests are already completed.
---
The plushie is my favorite, I think I have about 20 at my camp right now lol
---
I didn‚Äôt even realise bows are in the game I should probably play again lol. Haven‚Äôt even looked at wastelanders yet
---
Noice.
---
Nah I truly believe people that cheat in video games are scum. You won't change my mind with that.
---
 You are the kind of people that ruin shit for everybody else.
---
 Don't be a scummy cheater.
---
lets try pinging u/Ladydevann worth looking into those issues, in case u'r not aware of them
---
What have you been doing for the passed 20 levels?
---
Agreed. Only reason I commented was I found this thread searching about this exact problem.
---
Yes, multiple times. The biggest I can recall was a trade stealing hoax in early 2019. Dozens of threads here claiming to be victims where people would run up to you, force open a trade, and steal your items. It ended up being 100% fake. Last Christmas, there was an actual hack on PC that allowed a few people to loot your player like a container, but that was much later and not an exploit in the game
---
No new content besides endless grinding is thinning the herd.
---
Looks great man
---
Dear Godd... Creator of the Divine Appalachian Wasteland... Please hear this prayer in good grace... As a loyal subscriber to Fallout First... I ask nicely that I get my account back intact... Amen.
---
Don‚Äôt bother saving any weapons or armor unless they‚Äôre decent legendaries. There‚Äôs 0 need for them.
---
This doesn't appear to work anymore.
---
It used to be a great way to get rare plans but now it seems to be locked to the same inventory per user for the lifespan of the server.
---
You don't deserve it, though.
---
I actually have no idea I just never needed to pick a level 3 lock
---
I hope not.
---
I'm not seeing it. Numbers are indeed lower, but the dozens of people I've accumulated on the friends and social lists are still active and playing. YMMV
---
I want a red cap with 'MWSGA' on it lol
---
Haha, yup! Did you add me? I'll be on later today.
---
I had him attack my workshop when my buggy turrets attacked him.
---
Hell, the word cunt means nothing where I am so I don‚Äôt care what you call me. I‚Äôm just saying calling me scum is a little strong over a few pixels. And I wouldn‚Äôt say helping people bypass the ridiculous amounts of RNG is ruining the game for them.
---
You don't have to apologize friend c:
---
I said the map is full of stuff so it would be cool to add a region like DC or something to have more stuff there so the new contest isn't too forced.
---
And yeah it's probably the ban wave why there's so little amounts of people on servers.
---
Don't worry, in a while people will be back online, or not, if they used exploits.
---
enjoy the world and read the notes and listen to the holotapes, explore more than the quests points, do not rush to the endgame.
---
sacrap everything 
---
Do all the main quests and pay attention to the narrative, try to do some events for your lvl, don't save weapons/armor to use latter isn't needed trust me I did that, take the perk big deal(the one that makes you sell things for more money) and sell your stuffs to a vendor, remember keep the junk at minimum I sayed 200 of each only ballistic fiber screws and adhesive is worth saving a lot, ammo if you don't use sell it at 1cap on your vendor.
---
meds weight is high so keep what you use per session on the stash only and don't hoard those alcohol bottles they are heavy
---
edit: about scrip yes, scrip everything g you don't have a use for but remember it caps at 1000, and buy modules with it to make legendary armour at the endgame
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true as I‚Äôve done this very recently
---
I'm sure it doesn't stop at video games. It's just the kind of person somebody is.
---
I'm perfectly fine over here in PS4 world all by myself, thank you for asking though.
---
2nd wave of bans coming in 25 mins
---
How is it less ghouls, i see same number of ghouls at the same spawn point as they were 1 year ago
---
q.e.d.
---
As a low level don't keep you're weapons or armor. You will be switching weapons and armor every 5 levels or so. Your storage should really only be legendaries and scrap. Make sure that any power armor you have stays on the frame, if it stays on the frame it's only 10 lbs. Focus on quests, events, and killing enemies. Use xp boosts like caned meat stew and the wise mothman buff. Once you hit level 50 start farming for legendaries and getting your build together.
---
I cheat in 76, fine. But if you knew me in real life maybe you‚Äôd change your judgement.
---
I remember the great New Years character deletion scare. Basically some dude said he was able to mark your character as unessential and delete it entirely after killing you. It was completely fake and impossible to do, he was just trying to get attention. Lots of people believed him though and there were constant threads on here talking about how they were afraid.
---
Become an ally with the Raiders then you buy it with 750 gold.
---
Oh I remember the Christmas hack, pretty wild time eh?
---
And that trade thing is really interesting, thanks for sharing c:
---
It was a typo
---
Oh thank you!  
---
I‚Äôll see if I have any
---
Also a lot of low level alts that veteran players are rolling for the easy to accomplish Daily Challenges on low level characters.
---
Cool. All I was saying originally was that duping is a method that seems to take a lot of pointless effort.
---
Don't keep items that are to high for you and do use the script system, scrap legendaries that are less that level 50
---
I send him out to find me chems
---
Read the link I posted
---
"Note: Players will still be able to damage you while pacifist mode is activated but this damage will be reduced and that player will be flagged as hostile."
---
Probably because when he wants to buy something he has to find the chair and other stuff clipped into the wall or ground to be able to enter the camp.
---
I personally find them ok as long as someone puts a sign with flashing lights that say click here.
---
It's crazy how a single post can cause so much noise, well it's pretty understandable because character deletion is such a big deal.
---
Thanks for sharing didn't knew about this one :)
---
"I don't get why people cheat they don't have discipline and cause unneeded bans"
---
"Blame the player not the game, I never dupe(d) and have great gear"
---
I think the theory is that the bonus challenges we're seeing this week are because of that.
---
or players who kill brahmins should become wanted.
---
If you completed a quest then it won't be showing anymore because it's done
---
This picture just made my day! That's awesome!
---
I'd buy that album
---
I think you're right. I think it's the ban wave too. I enjoy playing with the new players, but even they are not as many as I'd hoped with Game Pass. I entered a public server today for example and I was the only person on there. I had to double check I wasn't in the private server. üòÇ
---
I would love new regions added to it. That would be awesome.
---
My suggestion is learn about some XP buffing methods. Intelligence grants a 2% XP boost. Some serums boost the effects of certain food that can also grant XP. The harder the enemy the higher the xp grab. I suggest this because of the legendary boardgame and it'll help grab some perk cards that can help you in the future.
---
Second is suggest learning about character builds. Everything from bloodied junkie tank stealth etc. That can dictate what weapons and armor you keep, scrip, trade or sell. 
---
My general rule is all 1 and 2 star weapons and armor get scripped. Exception on 2 star if it's something like a bloodied explosive or two shot explosive. Not everyone agrees to this but it keeps my inventory tight.
---
Second I scrip all legendary that is damage or protect against a specific enemy. That includes animals scorched or the likes. I also scrip anytjinng below level 40.
---
Third I drop all mini nukes missiles and other bullets I don't use. I come across enough if I suddenly need them.
---
Sell unused meat grenades chems and the rest to an in game vendor. Offload some weight and get that 1400 max caps per day.
---
In your pipboy and stash box, sort each category by weight. You'll be surprised how much stuff you have thats killing your inventory space. 
---
Some players also start a second character on their main acct. If you can get a trusted friend to move stuff to said character that can at least store things you love but may not want to use right away.
---
These are my methods some may disagree but take what works for you. Good luck!
---
What does one do once every achievement has been obtained and all collectibles have been had, All locations discovered story complete?

Go for it!

Lmao you've just encountered one of the anti-armor fuckers that annoys even the most skilled players. Get help or a magic shotgun.

Five minutes of my time to dupe a god roll and or a legacy compared to a thousand hours of play time and not coming even remotely close to a good roll? I‚Äôm sorry but I have to disagree.
---
ty i did not know that they had been working on righting the wrong now my blood has stopped boiling thanks again for the info
---
We're also missing timed switches which make making music pretty much impossible.
---
Yep.
---
Really, scrapping and crafting/modding have gotten ridiculously sluggish over the past few patches.  There's nothing smooth about that process at all now.
---
Yep. Maybe...just maybe...people get bored of repetitive grinds. I did. Though it gave me the idea to get all the fo4 DLC and have a proper go at it. I'm having a great time with it.
---
If fo76 gets the patches and fixes it needs, I might return some day. But I'm at the point where it's just a flat out boring draining repetitive waste of time.
---
I would love it. But just don‚Äôt see it for this game tbh. 
---
The only way I see, was if private servers became cross platform. Since you can control who joins the server and it would only be you and your friends.
---
Do you have this screenshot you're talking about? There's no Sea Captain's outfit in-game but there are a few might still coordinate with the hat, like the Longshoreman's Outfit or a few military-style outfits from the Atom Shop.
---
There are no QUESTS showing up. Not main, nor side, none of them. And I had like 8 quests to do before. I‚Äôm still level 15.
---
just accept that this game isnt made dor hoarding
---
scrap every non legendary armor and weapon, trust me you wont need them and gain more from scrapping them
---
if you get legendary gear, when its not max level, decide if you have use for it, if not scrip it at one of those yellow machines around trainstations
---
dont hoard chems either, sell them to vendorbots, 
---
same goes for radaway/radx, those are easy to come by you dont need to hoard hundreds
---
explosive ammo like 40mm grenades/missiles/mininukes... dump them youll never even consider using them and they are very heavy
---
as for junk, dont stash more than 50 of each except for ballistic fiber/screws/aluminum/fibreoptics
---
and levelling, well stick to the low level areas like the ashheap, forest and toxic valley
---
try your luck at the savage divide every once and then and sooner or later youll be powerfull enough to explore the whole map and finish the main quest
---
level 20-35 can be hard and work as kind of a break in progression but once you reach level 30-35 itll get a lot easier
---
I have wanted to know this since I found the hat ages ago. üòÇ
---
rip
---
I think most players will get to the point where they are one shotting most enemies if they stick with the game.   
---
But it's not that hard to carry more than one weapon. It's a fun excuse to use some  weapons that you might not otherwise ever use because they aren't terribly powerful on their own. The flaming chainsaw and/or alien blaster are fun when doing an event with low levels. I'm a melee build so my tesla doesn't one shot things and also conveniently tags a bunch of enemies so that everyone on my team gets loot.
---
Just wait, it's high level either because it's scripted or the area had a high level in it first. Just wait and play more to get higher level or wait till the One Appalachia update.
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs there for the taking so the 400 didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. 
---
I‚Äôm 350 and I would have taken some fusion cores for sure.  Maybe not ammo as I have plenty
---
Can't argue with that.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculously expensive, I‚Äôd try the hard bargain perk and grape mentats to try to get that bad boy down in price
---
Should name and shame him.
---
You are in the wrong thread sir lol
---
Crap in your vendor? Hidden vendors?
---
I keep track of local workshops and train stations for this purpose. Train stations are my starting point for most play sessions away from my camp
---
trouble shooters armor. put a set together
---
If that would happen no one would sell them for script anymore since they are 50 each. 
---
I don‚Äôt recommend it scraping directly into modules.
---
How come people suddenly know that "large amount of players" or "large chunk of playerbase" had been banned? Where's this info coming from exactly?
---
2000 score isnt even close to what I lost. So far I've totalled 7500 score lost. Others have lost more than me. 2000 is hardly a drop in the bucket and more of a slap in the face than anything.
---

It is being worn by the Fasnacht Toothy man mask player
---
shoot them in an extremity.. also a troubleshooters armor piece helps
---
"It didnt happen to me, so clearly it cannot possibly happen to any other human being in existence."
---
That is odd. I've never had it happen ever since it was *properly* fixed (since I remember once they said they fixed it and they didn't), but I think I do recall having a legendary not drop any legendary loot once or twice. I also don't visit whitesprings and barely do anything nuke related other than SBQs, so it could be restricted to that like you said
---
As someone who has dreamed of building his own custom green seacan home/bunker on an acreage one day, I would loooove to see this brought to the game.
---
If the quests were under the event tab thats because they ended, if they're not events just fiddle with the pip-boy untill a quest shows up. It's hard to help cause we can't see your screen.
---
I intend to strawman my way up to Todd Howard himself and steal the game's code to do something with it, and you can't stop me
---
I‚Äôm guilty of this also lol. Currently at level 13. May need to delete and start over soon.
---
I already have all the awards. I just want to be better at fighting, some of your tips sound good.
---
There are maybe 8-10% less players at peak today, compared with yesterday [https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340)
---
And I really doubt that the difference is because of the issued bans.  A very small percentage of the player base was likely affected. Yesterday's little bit of extra traffic is easily explained by the update of the atomic shop, more people would've logged in to see what's available.
---
Def follow the main questline to start. You'll get to around lvl 50 by the end and it'll help guide you in the game. 
---
As far as SPECIAL goes: find a build online and follow it. The good part of this new system is after lvl 50 you can switch around special points if you want. For instance I started with a bow build and am now transitioning to guns. 
---
Set up your camp with the bare necessities and crafting benches until you've got a good stockpile of stuff. If you want to make some easy caps find a water purifier plan and farm purified water. They sell for 4 caps each. 
---
If you feel the need to farm supplies and ammo. I cannot overstate how much I love to farm Horizon's Rest at the early levels. Muties give far more exp than scorched and ferals and they drop gunpowder, .308, and hunting rifles that you can scrap for components and parts for your own sniper. Horizon's also has really easy bobblehead and magazine spawns and I continually find collectibles that other players spawn in but forget like the magazine in the plane fuselage on the hill which are good for displaying in your camp or stockpiling/selling in a player vendor.
---
When we have meat week you'll have an hourly chance to get it. Check him every time.
---
It doesn't really contradict lore, it contradicts what Myron said. And it is absolutely 100% in character for Myron to lie about inventing something he figured out how to Macgyver together for honor and glory.
---
It‚Äôs referring to the Atlas Observatory in the Savage Divide. It‚Äôs a pre-war space observatory that secretly ran a semi-successful weather control program. No clue what we‚Äôll be doing up there
---
Agreed, like come on dude it doesn't matter if you bought thousands worth of atoms if you break the rules  like an ass hat then tough titties my dude, should have not broken the rules.
---
its a pre quest thing for the BOS content
---
That‚Äôs my point.  You would be better off dumping at overseer camp or flat woods than putting in your vendor. I mean, free is free.  Hand it off directly if you want to do a good deed otherwise it‚Äôs fair game
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/some-fallout-76-players-are-griefing-pacifists-with-nuk-1840035172/amp
---
They did change it a while back people grief by throwing dot dmg based items and kill them.
---
Hence why I said a chance to drop modules, so it would only be worth doing once your duly scrip is used
---
Vats is broken anyways.
---
Microsoft says different.
---
There are SO MANY things from the base game that haven't been ported over that should absolutely be ported over. Doesn't make any sense. So much money left on the table for a company that apparently doesn't want to leave money on the table. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
ü§¢ü§Æ
---
I played like 8 hours a day all last week, and once it brought me a broken handmade rifle. Idk if that's because I didn't touch empty it out all day or what but I've noticed it will have random times where it will bring me more then just chinese swords, frag grenades, and blood packs.
---
It's going to be a task the whole community has to prepare for the BOS coming to Appalachia. I believe it's going to be restocking quests.
---
A lot of players are filing a class action lawsuits against Bethesda and Microsoft is the way to make that happen. No matter what you the Terms and Conditions say, you can't suspend or ban players without proof.
---
If you spent any money on Fallout 1st or on Atoms, and you can't use it, that's fraud. Bethesda is about to get shelled by Sony and Microsoft who is in fact their boss. It'll be interesting to see how this turns out.
---
I really hope you spent some of the atoms and Beth gets you for cross-country wire fraud.
---
It doesn't really contradict lore, it is not entirely a retcon, it contradicts what Myron said. Myron was the only real source on him being the inventor nobody can confirm that absolutely. 
---
And it is absolutely 100% in character for Myron to lie about inventing something he figured out how to Macgyver together for honor and glory.
---
There definitely needs to be more to do there. Has anyone ever been able to get into those rooms upstairs that you need special access for? I feel like it should be more of a public hub type place with more going on. And I definitely miss the days of running through the golf clubhouse hacking up ghouls then running from there to in front of the houses to hop on top of that bus and slowly snipe away at a deathclaw
---
Good one Professor Sarcastic, staying true to your name. However, if they were targeting people for having single instances of godly items in their stash, I'd surely be one of their highest priorities instead of a level 23 with a single explosive laser rifle. This is clearly not it chief.
---
Junk walls should have been there from the start, easy Fallout 4 port. Instead we've had nothing but concrete barricade walls.
---
Why not get your son to kill someone as your character?
---
Why not? He paid for it.
---
It's not instanced to the player but they grow back quickly so who cares?  If it worries someone so much they can lock away their crops or grind for the Spinny Shit Keg to make them grow again instantly.
---
Apparently the blueprints dont work, but you can just stack them with board &gt; floor safe &gt; board &gt; safe etc
---
As said above unless you are planning on another character and gifting stuff down, then scrap it.  As others have also advised save scrip until 50 for purveyor.  Also, get a strict regiment if you don‚Äôt have 1st, keep your junk to like 100 max and 200 for the stuff that is harder to harvest like screws.  Same with chems, keep it tight and storage is manageable.  I got into finding plastic and bulking junk as part of how to max on caps every day.  It also kept my junk in balance.  Some great quests if you haven‚Äôt done them:  Mistress of Mysteries, one of my favorites!  Did you get your Excavator power armor, great to help get weight capacity and you can do it at level 25.  Think it starts with the Miners Miracle quest, look it up down at Garrahan Mining.  I am assuming in parallel you are working the wastelanders quests both settler and Raiders don‚Äôt forget until the final choice.  That also means dailies to raise faction, great exp.  few ideas
---
BL3 has marginally better drop rates, but suffered extremely from poor weapon and build viability. So it wasn't that different but the farming is a tighter experience.
---
The patching recently has helped a lot.
---
Fo76 has a criminally awful loot pool, the only game on a similar level is ark, and you can mod your way out of that problem.
---
This is also what I heard, it‚Äôs the build up for the BOS. Ad victorium ‚úä
---
I sell for what it‚Äôs defaulted at.
---
Add more bosses while you're at it please and thank you
---
I keep a table by my vending. I jump on it and drop anything I truly do not want there instead of listing for zero cost.
---
People suck.
---
Weapons for the comrade collectron scaled albeit they seemed a few levels behind me, mine regularly brings me lvl 45 (I'm close to lvl 90) broken chinese swords and once brought me a lvl 15 handmade.
---
ribeye steaks are yummy carry weight buffs
---
The last community goal was cleaning Appalachia. We had to kill so many scorched/scorchbeasts to hit a goal every so often. 
---
If we hit the goal we got a prize. Some were icons, extended event times, purveyor sales. 
---
This will most likely fall in the same category. Probably something with building or gathering supplies.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be a way to bait players into pvp?
---
You can probably get refunds for sales AFTER your ban (i.e fallout 1st sub auto renewing), but anything before the ban is null. You got the service you paid for, and then you voided it by violating their terms and getting banned. They might give you the refund just because it's not worth the hassle for them, but it's still fraud in most countries. Telling people to commit fraud is also a crime in many places. And the more people do it, the higher the chance they WILL do something about it
---
Oh yeah, that's a military general uniform from the Atom Shop. I think it's only been available twice, once when the game came out and again last month. No clue when/if it'll come back.
---
I intend to place this one at my CAMP for new players to gather a few rounds or weapons from. 
---
Thanks for the guide!
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt see that. Sorry.
---
He also still glitches in his bed.
---
So I drove the getaway car for a bank robbery and the other guys didn‚Äôt pitch in for gas. I‚Äôm wondering if I can sue them for the money.
---
I have had 3 waves of scorch beasts. That was not fun.
---
50 is to low man if he needs to make repairs often couse he can't join Sqb yet to take the improved repair kit. I have always tried to maintain on 200 and isnt so heavy.
---
Ahhh. Thank you!
---
Ha, my pleasure. Glad you liked it. I did that the other day when I first unlocked it. It amused me greatly. 
---
Thanks for the vote of conficence. We need all the pity purchases we can get honestly, Bo Peep is a hell of a manager, she's got a sheperds crook and a bee in her (literal) bonnet.
---
Don‚Äôt kill the Brahmin at player camps for it though. There are plenty at Flatwoods if you‚Äôre that desperate. Don‚Äôt be scum.
---
Just saying my thoughts thats what the comments are for.
---
To be honest, I don't really care. Drill or Nocturnal Rolling Pin, both are useless garbage. :)
---
Server hop and the quest changes
---
Or delete the ally item and put it down again to change it
---
I think he's try to say it's like Neo in The Matrix. Or like Fry in that Futurama episode where he drinks 100 cups of coffee.
---
Does kinda make sense in terms of physics, people have often theorized that small insect such as the common fly, which are capable of insane movements and reactions are able to perceive time on a different scale to us, but we just see them buzzing like crazy and can barely keep track of them let alone smash the little buggers.
---
It‚Äôs how some Youtubers thrive.
---
Is that why they keep dying, I was wonder wtf was going on. Thought my turrets were not working and something was sneaking in
---
Most of the emails sent out right now are listed as temporary suspensions until investigations are complete. There's nothing you can do with that. If you get banned, that will have all the proof they need. If the suspension is lifted, you can't do anything about it. Either way, it's just as stupid as all the other reddit lawsuits that never got anywhere
---
What should I do. I never duped but when I first started playing some high levels gave me some stuff that I realise now was duped. (Large Christmas presents).
---
But that means Bethesda would actually have to track that and they would rather ban people for trying to get a decent weapon for once in their life
---
But now all the time you spent in game is now pointless.
---
Five minutes to cheat but hours losts. (If it is a perma ban)
---
I love all these keyboard lawyers.
---
70+
---
Pip boy- data- quests
---
well im talking about stuff like cloth, wood and such they are easy to come by if you run low on them i think its hard to pinpoint a certain amount of how much you should have, but i agree maybe 50 was a bit low but it also depends on wich weapons/armor you tend to use and modify so i guess hell find out for himself 
---
as i said, i agree though maybe he op should save like 100 of each
---
Have you listened to the new radio broadcasts? There‚Äôs a couple of YouTube videos about them and their translation. There‚Äôs a BOS force coming
---
Edit... well eff you, downvoters
---
Most high level players i know are continually bumping up to the cap limit cant find anything to spend them on as no one is doing caps for good items any more. 70% of the time my vendors are off due to this. You might luck out and find a diamond here and there but usually you are not going to find anything worthwhile in any camps that are selling. Kinda of a negative feedback loop of an issue. Thats why a better camp sink is needed. Smiley is a good start but once a week means 4 days latter ive almost make the 6K back just from Robo vendor selling.
---
I've been asking for over a year now for the Fallout 4 concrete set, seems to have fallen on deaf ears.
---
They just need to use the Fallout 3/NV version of Jet then.
---
On XBox and PS4 as you‚Äôre paying for the Live Services.
---
I have been busy grinding that S.C.O.R.E.!!!! My serums have been selling like crazy so it is tough to keep it stocked. With the duping stuff going on, I took my good stuff out of my vendor. Everyone has the ammunition convertor so I feel like there is no point to sell it and free up space for other stuff.That is just what is going on with this level 330 player.
---
Make up? I don‚Äôt know. 
---
Overreact and blow things way out of proportion? Yes that‚Äôs how you tubers make money.
---
Ad Victorium.
---
That's for sure.
---
Me and my 1* bloodied gronak's ax had some good times at the Nuked Whitesprings back in the day
---
It's the safest you can get right now other than only using what you find. Most vendors are regular players listing what they found and don't want. There's no guarantee they didn't get it from a cheater, but it's at least a smaller likelihood. Most of the big cheaters all just use trade subreddits or discords, so I would definitely not recommend using any of those. Player vendors should be fine, as long as you just use some common sense with their machines. If they have nothing but fixer plans, asylum outfits, bloodied fixers/lasers/handmades, probably not somebody you want to associate with
---
A glowing super mutant behemoth does 250 damage with it's melee hit.
---
898 armor factored against 250 damage =\~ 68% damage resistance
---
You would be reducing the damage of a behemoths strikes down to \~80
---
A level 65 scorchbeast deals 85 damage, which would be reduced by \~78% to \~18.7
---
A glowing mirelurk king does 62 damage with it's ranged attack, which gets reduced by 0%, dealing 62 damage
---
138 dr and the blocker perk at 3 will reduce thee damage of the glowing behemoth down to \~68. meaning the blocker skill is worth more than 760 dr
---
I really want the seedyshed. It looks amazing. I currently have the train car, it's so cool. Its my main base. I also have the red rocket garage which I want to play around with even though i just built a train car base. I also have the bungalow they released and I hate it. It's way bigger than I thought and you glitch through the walls. So my vote goes for the train car.
---
Thank you! That was driving me crazy!
---
Odd, I find heaps of junkies and furious but almost no bloodied. So that‚Äôs based on my own sample size which is more than enough to be statistically significant. However, I acknowledge that‚Äôs still a small amount of data size. Regardless, 99% of drops being crap that you have to store/lug around for days until you have enough script limit to sell is absurd.
---
Hey it hits harder than anything on your banned account so I'm good.
---
I honestly wouldn't care, but I haven't been playing much recently so for the first time in a while I'm not using up my daily scrip limit. A nocturnal rolling pin would actually provide me some minuscule benefit for now!
---
*Cough cough*
---
"Journalists"
---
Btw, 100% agree with you.
---
Scrap everything except what you‚Äôre wearing and using, scrip everything that you don‚Äôt use regularly. Also be sure to scrap all junk items so the heavy junk pieces aren‚Äôt weighing you down. You‚Äôll come across better gear on a daily basis as a low level player so it‚Äôs easy to hoard stuff, you have to break the habit of holding on to stuff and just get scrap happy lol. Also if you have the means the fallout is 1st scrapbox makes the whole experience much more enjoyable
---
Seems to have become a new sport recently. I only have ammo for 1 cap and Serums for 350 caps in my vendors and my poor Brahmin is pretty much always dead when I come back to camp.
---
Camp Brahmin should be made essential, like your allies. Put them into downed state, let them recover, done. Constantly murdering the Brahmin of others is in poor taste and says a lot about the mindset of some people who play this game.
---
LOL, yeah, as if their downvotes mean anything to me.
---
My braham keeps glitching out. It dies and the thing gets destroyed whenever I load into the game
---
Yeah, they grow back real fast, go for it
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pc. I personally am on Xbox. I don‚Äôt have any raw data I just am solely speaking on my observations of server activity, the amount of camps on a map or the amount of events that happen.
---
That's toxic
---
Thank you guys for the tips! I appreciate the help.
---
I think a public hub would only work if there is a reason for players to be there, whether its just a free fast travel point, or added content like arcade machines, or special enemies
---
Brahmin at player camps can only produce fertilizer and you can milk them for some free rad away milk. They don't drop meat or leather.
---
Thank you for the reply, I‚Äôd say that was a very coherent stream of consciousness. I tried full health, berserkers and bloodied builds. Only bloodied felt fun.
---
Naw, xbox
---
I don't know why people have downvoted you but you're absolutely right and you even have a source to back up your claim. Can any of these people who have downvoted you provide any evidence against what u/p34k3 has stated?
---
Sorry
---
What's ridiculous is people with 100s of levels selling stuff like alcohol for 50 caps apiece.
---
Easy work around is dont kill players Brahmin
---
Edit:Brahmin  say moo
---
theres not , its only visual for dramatic effect
---
One other thought ... if you have weight reducing perks, better to store those items on your toon than in stash where the perks do not apply. For example, with bandolier perk, it‚Äôs more economical for my toon to carry ammo and the only ammo in stash is what I am vending.
---
so you‚Äôre not just a cheater you‚Äôre a thief
---
I don't play nearly as much as i used too but whenever i log in, even at peak hours my servers are so empty. I'm almost a level 500 player too and the people who are on are all really low level players.
---
What do u mean limits? Only 1 of each item? Gonna be hard to repair and build things
---
Ok cool that‚Äôs what I was looking for. I knew it was for BOS I just didn‚Äôt know how the quest structure would work
---
If it‚Äôs not permanent then I still wasted a thousand hours trying to grind for the perfect weapons and armor, but at least I have them now instead of wasting ten thousand hours before I eventually did get it. Assuming it‚Äôs not permanent, now I can go about spending 1000 hours kicking ass.
---
Is this the Bethesda twitter page or fallout one?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anything about the bans on them
---
Wow, nvm I guess
---
This would be great for my Blue Ridge Trade Outpost CAMP
---
That's not how it works, friend. You don't get to make demands and threaten to cheat if they're not met. The only change that will come of that is your account privileges
---
Find a new piece of technical data
---
I dunno why I was downvoted for me not fully understanding the ranks
---
I lock my plants away. When people harvest my plants I cant make adhesive or corn soup. 17/h is all the plants placed at a camp so if you have more than 17 it hurts you.
---
Note that the Gladiator perks have diminishing returns. You may want to try reducing each Gladiator perk by one rank and adding in Martial Artist. It's very satisfying to have fast swing speeds.
---
Maxed out Adamantium Skeleton is crucial for melee builds. You don't want crippled limbs in a fight.
---
You may want to run at least 3 perception for the lockpick perks. To deal with scorchbeasts, you want a rifle or shotgun to cripple their wings, so Concentrated Fire is also useful. When not lockpicking or fighting scorchbeasts, you could use a more useful perk such as Night Person or Refractor.
---
Most enemies are rad resistant, so Overly Generous is not that useful.
---
Dodgy will drain your AP, preventing you from sprinting to your enemies or power attacking. I don't think it's useful for melee builds.
---
For Junk Shield to work, you need to carry a lot of junk for the maximum bonus. I usually already have high damage resistance just from my armor, so I don't think this perk is good. I've heard there are diminishing returns for damage resistance above 350.
---
If you are going for high damage, Adrenaline and Tenderizer are good. The bonus from maxed out Tenderizer is closer to 10% than 7%, despite what the card says. Adrenaline isn't currently working, but it sounds like Bethesda will have it fixed soon.
---
Last time I got a wanted tag I purposely stripped and stood at the nearest train station to face judgement.
---
Bethesda Support twitter page. You have to view all their tweets and you‚Äôll see them responding to people asking about the ban and they direct them to a link.
---
Welcome to the internet, where the masses of morons prove why a true democracy can never work.
---
Clownshoe!
---
Iirc, somebody managed to get in there with the PA/photomode exploit and said that you can actually loot most of those weapons. It's not intended though, it's just there for decoration
---
Once you find a techical data note it will trigger. I know they are found in safes and those cigar formed trash cans, and in desk. Probably many other places to find them
---
Sadly im on ps4
---
The Wanderer offers Lucky Find as well. And another mission to rescue a kidnapped Settler, can't remember the quest name.
---
Yea gamespot particularly is bad. The amount of factual in accuracies in their articles are pretty breathtaking.
---
The only time I saw them on Grahm was when I ran into him in a higher-level area, so I think the area he's in might have something to do with his inventory.
---
Ah right got ya. I was bored at work earlier so thanks, hope you have a good evening!

Can someone help me get the bounty hunter achievement?

You definitely should read that. Unless flies are able to fly at the speed of light, they perceive time just the same as us. They're able to dodge our hits because they're "equipped" for that. I understand what you're trying to say, though. But (back to the fiction lol), keep in mind that in The matrix, Neo isn't just high on jet ... he's litterally in godly state. Jet is only supposed to relax you and make you more aware of what's going on in your immediate surrounding and the "slow down time" effect they gave to it was just a cool and practical way to reflect that. 
---
If I was asked to chose an effect for it, I'd just give it a +% vats hit chances and a +% dodge chances but it's still "meh" lore wise because you're supposed to be able to dodge through perception, not RNG. I guess that's why they opt for "f*** it, let's not add it".
---
Edit : Now that I think about it, Neo is actually a good comparaison to how jet was working in FO4 since he's in a simulation and can slow down time ... heh. Thanks for the chuckles!
---
Yup.  Ain‚Äôt even mad. Every downvote is a dupers sweet sweet tears.
---
Firm handshake ü§ù
---
I doubt you'll be able to keep the weapons, and you'll be really far behind the SCORE season, I dunno... I think playing the game as intended seems to have it's perks.
---
Go to the military wing in the bunker. As soon as you find some data in one of the desks stop looking. Go hand in the data. Log off. Log in. Gog back to the bunker. Any junk left in the drawers has a chance to be a technical data.

But u can only do 1 at a time...if u have two or more, the others are worthless there on out....only take one at a time

You can't loot the weapons. They show a interact pick up prompt but you actually cant do anything with them.
---
Unless you don‚Äôt get caught that is. And what about the people who didn‚Äôt cheat? They‚Äôre still gonna be hella behind.
---
The caps limit is particularly egregious. I was trying to convince some of my friends to play and that was the deal breaker. 
---
Wandering the wasteland is still fun for me, I‚Äôm still finding new stuff but I try and ignore all the limits. If I was actively conscious of them I‚Äôd likely quit due to how frustrating it is.

imagine if there was no scrip limit.. people would dupe any ol junk legendary to scrip and spend it at mumbles until they got god rolls..

There's 9 dailys now though. Plus no one really knows until xp increase days either. I wouldnt sweat it
---
I mean, 2nd week in and I'm at 38 atm from doing the dailies &amp; weekly's so I'm not sure the non cheaters would be left behind?
---
Between PS4 and Xbox? Yes. For PC though? Hell no.
---
PC can suffer through the fun NW games they play while we console players can play NW while not having to worry about such crap.
---
Before you say that they can turn it off and on it would affect my gameplay if I would to play adventure mode as well since their fucking items would circulate everywhere.
---
When u actively dupe, its not a mistake. It was a your CHOICE.
---
Where's that info coming from lol
---
Ignore that shit. Nothing but bs virtual stress.
---
Sorry, I stopped reading and downvoted after "petty little bitches".
---
Maybe you want to start again and this time in a constructive tone. Just a thought.
---
The first time I went there, I was shot at by a party of three. They followed me from house to house and kept shooting me nonstop. 10/10 would go again.
---
The non cheaters who were wrongfully banned anyway, I mean.
---
The gold grind also has the benefit of its rewards being guaranteed. It'll take me two weeks to earn X reward, but when I get there, I'll have it for sure.
---
The module/Murmrgh grind is much much worse because there's no guarantee you will *ever* get what you want. You can roll forever and never hit the one in a million chance of rolling the weapon/armor you want.
---
The module grind hurts worst because at least with the Purveyor you might roll something someone else wants, and then maybe be able to trade. With modules you personally have to hit that one in a million.
---
Ayyyeeee i think we found the fella whose cheerios got pissed in.

I currently have a bungalow that is not attached to anything in the air above my camp. I haven't been able to remove it for 6 months. I have tried building up to it and placing a platform underneath and then removing the bungalow but.. uh... no help. Good luck!

If you think the limits on currency being lifted will reduce duping, I got some nice swampland for sale.

I've tried in the last week several times on Xbox and inventory didn't change after leaving the server and returning, even with another server hop in between.

Since you are low on luck I would ditch the meat perk and for bloodied mess for sure.  That extra damage is huge for your build.

Lol

I'm personally proud of my 1* bloodied shovel. Helps a lot with burying bodies at the cemetery
---
also.. calling people stupid isnt very civil...
---
Yeah they are they got patched out when wastelanders came out.
---
With how bad it is with hackers/cheaters on PC especially, it's probably for the better that this game doesn't cross-play with console. Maybe Xbox/PS4, but definitely not PC until they actually fix everything.
---
Might just be unlucky

---
Perhaps but from what I've seen on here most of the players getting banned either picked up a duped weapon or are actually duping them.
---
Personally I'm happy with my weapons and never risked duping them and thus far I haven't encountered any issues.
---
It‚Äôs the original scorchbeast design, if you fast travel to Seneca you can see it if you look up
---
I'm a thief for getting a refund on something I purchased and I am not allowed to use. Okay.
---
Don't give a fuck actually, just thought I'd give some advice to the people smart enough to take it before I leave.
---
Na man. 1 weapon isn‚Äôt getting u banned.  Having multiple duped most likely will.  
---
If anyone is saying they got banned for 1 weapon is full of shit.
---
K byyeee
---
I know, I‚Äôm just trying to get a precise location to take a picture of it. Such as on which cliff edge it is located on and such.
---
The "Bethesda makes us cheat" argument, I see...
---
There are plenty of players who play the game and don't cheat and either deal with the grind, ignore it and play around it, or just stopped playing the game.
---
Yeah, I agree that a lot could be done to improve the game but honestly who are you kidding. Bethesda could put together the worlds best and most fulfilling gameplay loop in the history of gaming and people would STILL dupe and hack.
---
There really isn't any excuse for cheating.
---
I want one a middle finger it‚Äôs a mature game
---
LOL, you just literally compared getting your money back because you can't play a game because they terminated your ability to (from duplicating virtual items) to a real life bank robbery?  Talk about apples and oranges.
---
It's how all Bethesda games works you have a item reference from he game files and a item reference in your saved game.
---
They all have to be unique so they need to add item creator reference or something, that way you could see the duper.
---
It. sucks. I rolled around 25 gauss shotguns before I found one I thought was good, and even then it's not top tier. Just good. I think I've probably done about that many minis, and the one I'm using is bloodied bash LOL. Demoralizing as hell and I'm not going to engage with it anymore, I don't think.
---
If Bethesda would just set these things to weekly limits, not daily, it would restore so much of my goodwill. I have no problem playing 76, I just don't want to feel like I have to every day, especially when it's not particularly fun.
---
At first I liked displaying them. But it takes up so much storage space.
---
Fast travel and look up and a bit to the left, it‚Äôs pretty hard to miss
---
I didn't have the free space to try placing two (it's a pretty large physical footprint) but I can say budget-wise it takes up half as much budget as an equivalent size garage made out of separate floor/wall/roof/door pieces.
---

The syringer was awesome in Fallout 4!  I would hit BoS PA patrols with PAX serum (causing them to turn friendly so they would ignore me), sneak up to them and pick pocket the fusion cores from their PA, which causes them to exit said PA and usually be in underwear, then a quick melee hit to take them out, put the core back into the PA, and take my brand new PA home to sit in my collection.  I had like 60 sets.
---
Secondary question: does simply building the Brahmin pen make them appear? If not, how do you get them?
---
Yooo, they need more of THAT added to the game.
---
First time I wasnt ready for it, went from "oh, ghouls in here" to "oh shit to many!" So fast.
---
lol RIP thread
---
Things like this really make me mad this sub has an asinine "don't name names" rule. Fuck that guy, he should have his name smeared all day long.
---
No, they did that to harpoons and The Dragon. I‚Äôm 100% sure I got a BE railway recently from the Purveyor. Can even provide the date I screenshotted it. Was after Wastelanders.
---
I believe it stacks from when I used unarmed so you need to keep hitting them to get stacks like most games.
---
I heard talk of diminishing returns for exp gain past a certain level, not sure of stats though, but full Uny and food buffs are good enough
---
I was not even close to satisfied with my armor. Then I got an ass/sent set from a friend (duped of course, what isn‚Äôt these days) and I was happy with my gear. But others were still running around with nocturnal bash damage pipe rifles, I mean most of the people I duped for were using non legendary weapons and armor. Over a hundred levels in. I just had to help them.
---
Neither are you, sir
---
Pc only good for hackers and when the new systems are out the graphics on these new systems is going to be as good or better then alot of pc get a ps like the 100 million plus rest of us....
---
Since you are going for bloodied, there is a beneficial bug related to health bonuses and the mutation Speed Demon.  If your HP is below your maximum health bonus, then when you run your HP will jump to your highest health bonus. Thus, maxed-out Lifegiver makes bloodied builds more tanky.
---
Okay, you might be right then so I won't scrip mine just yet.
---
 I like how your line of argumentation is based on attacking the other person since you have no actual substance whatsoever, you keep saying "you this", "you that"... No dude.. Reality is, YOU are banned, and yes, you deserved it, no matter how much you try to deny it or offend whoever disagrees with your fan fiction.
---
 The actual plain truth is quite simple, you accepted the rules, and you broke them, now you are being punished for it. It's that simple. 
---
 No matter how much you keep crying, trying to come up with excuses, trying to look like the good guy, you, YOU, fucked up. The results speak for themselves here salty boy.

Also for extra reassurance, remove freesync/Gysnc from nvidia control panel 3D settings , choose selected file (fallout 76 exe.)

lol how is this getting upvoted. Are you guys really putting tape on your TVs?
---
I built a small adhesive farm, and I sell out of bulk adesive regularly. I have it set to 75 in my vendor, i also sell bulk copper in good amounts too.
---
You‚Äôre safe, friend! I promise it‚Äôs not legacy. They‚Äôre great weapons, but not legacies.
---
Meanwhile I get something like 50% of other people's arrows, bolts, and railway spikes from corpses they shot.
---
This has probabaly already been said but any excess junk you have you should turn into bulk and sell at vendors. For me I bulk up any junk over 300, usually steel, wood and cloth.
---
You'll get a hang of it, it use to be stressful for me but you'll find out what you need and dont need. As for leveling up, dont stress it, between the side quests and main quests you'll have a lot to focus on until level 50-60.
---
No they are visuals, we tried that when she first arrived... But we got disappointed.
---
It was fun to stand inside and see ppl look thru the hole in the window lol
---
Yeah ghouls are closer to 300xp per for me
---
Do you honestly believe that either people would understand what you meant by that emote or would even care if you did?
---
Some people just want the event over with and get the XP and reward from it and not farm it endlessly.
---
Is it confirmed to be the original concept art? Because I searched it up and nothing popped up with anything looking like that.
---
I'm on PC. I can get you that revive.
---
West Teks like that. Nothing or 1 legendary on a server or two, then suddenly there's 5 3 stars.
---
I'd really like a mode where the whole map is a nuke zone and the only cold spots are indoor areas. Also make that mode no fast travel.
---
Also no PVP restrictions or legendary items.
---
That would be a fun mode just to try to survive in.
---
Don't be frightened to restart as your understanding improves. I've restarted 3 times and although I could have done better with perk cards, I'm sticking with my latest attempt. I'm now up to 35 and apart from some challenges putting up against enemies at a much higher level, generally if your patient it's all doable. Relax into it and have fun.
---
you‚Äôre hopeless. Enjoy breaking terms and conditions and getting banned from this boring grind game as you like to call it.
---
The problem with tagging hordes with your level 5 quad pipe rifle so you don't accidently one shot them is you end up getting swarmed by high level mobs cause you're too afraid to damage them and incure the wrath of everyone else who one shots everything anyway or are too weak to help out when you're trying to hold off 6 high level ghouls with your level 5 pipe rifle.
---
I'd rather just play solo and avoid situations like this - esp shit like Uranium Fever
---
As long as ur in a group, they work....distance doesnt matter
---
The story is going to break into two distinct paths. The original story which is told through audio tapes, notes and environmental story telling. The new story which involves settlers and raiders is set one year after the Overseer left the vault. All players that completed the story before wastelanders patch are considered canonically one year older than new players, and it even acknowledges this. The two stories overlap up until you are done dealing with Rosie at The Top of the World. The old story really takes a lot of exploration to flesh out, you will get into a bunker way later that connects a lot of the dots, and even there some of the secrets are well hidden.
---
Total douche move
---
I would rather need 25 legendary modules per armor/weapon, and get to choose affixes, than this. I rolled at least 50 Secret Service armors before I got even *one* with the Harder to Detect While Sneaking affix I was looking for. Of course, its main affix was Nocturnal. Because screw me I guess.
---
It's basically turned me completely off the game knowing that the only way I'll ever actually get top-tier gear would be to find someone who somehow has it and then dupe it.
---
you ran out of time..
---
he moves 1 space a day in order to be at the end of the board on the last day..
---
its not really a race per se
---
Definitely.
---
Ummmm....I hadn‚Äôt thought of that. Lol!
---
you can‚Äôt use them because you violated the TOS, do you think this is the first time this happened? People have tried to be sneaky with refunds on F2P games for years.
---
Do you think that bethesda won‚Äôt true up and appeal with microsoft refunds like this? There have been cases of people getting banned from app stores for that
---
With ya 200% brother
---
Ah! Got it.
---
Yeah that bird thing looks just like one of the original concept arts they shared of scorchbeasts, there was also a 2 headed one concept. It‚Äôs a little disappointing they only implemented the bird one as a corpse and not a different variant scorchbeast
---
Just watch.
---
From my experience it does seem to take from the stash before scrap, total BS when you have some cool junk items you want to display
---
From experience, it's random as fucking shit.
---
My scrap box often gets ignored til last, it'll take shit directly out of my display cases, then my stash, then my inventory. Then sometimes out of my inventory, then my stash. Rarely does it ever use the scrap box for it's gorram function. (kind of pissed, just lost more items out of my display cases)
---
Then you are part of the problem, as most ammo is defaulted at 3-5 caps each. 1 cap for all ammo except ultracite or cores is reasonable. Any more is overcharging
---
I am not being sneaky. I requested a refund because i did not get what i paid for and i got my refund.
---
So how exactly is he a thief for wanting a refund on non-delivered services?  If he paid for 1 year, they terminate the relationship at 6 months.  He should be due 6 months refund.
---
It resets off of item pickup now, real world ones not ones in containers, I believe it resets after 150 items looted. Not entirely sure on the number.
---
Ahhh, I had okay armor but with the wastelanders I grinded for the secret service armor (mainly for the jet pack) but I managed to roll 2 unwielding pieces and 2 ballistic pieces so I've been lucky with the rolls.
---
Also back in may I did a ally quest and got a great fixer roll, so I never needed much and never cared for the laser legacy weapons.
---
Maybe luck but I do think you can progress without needing to exploit the game.
---
I mean, they are bats, which are different from birds. Maybe they‚Äôll be reimplemented when the BoS return, as a way to replace Scorchbeasts in certain areas. Since the BoS want the ATLAS Observatory, they might be able to manipulate the wether to mitigate the danger of the Scorched plague by driving the Scorchbeasts further into the Cranberry Bog and south of WV. As a result they leave, but now since they are gone these bird creatures take their place and are much more hostile.
---
He's joking btw
---
Of course not, this is clearly a sarcastic post regarding the lack of ways to communicate in this game.
---
Some people would probably be happy to trade completing a low level event that rewards less xp than a super mutant for some scrip fodder, but unfortunately you just cannot actually ask them that before they blast the boss with their legit b2525 from ebay.
---
The extra dailies are only confirmed for this week and aren't going to cover the two week gap alone. There are also calculators available that allow you to plug in numbers for xp weekend and factor in double daily weekend as well. They said they will have more SCORE opportunities to announce down the line but, based only on what we know, if they want to make it 100, they are going to have to hustle or buy levels down the line to catch up.
---
You'll find a lowlevel wanted eventually
---
Big rip. I ran out of fallout 1st yesterday and now find myself hauling junk around which im not used to.
---
You‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt know. They can have some robot put out a radio signal to gather inside that huge building for some joinable group quest or something? Change it every once in a while so it doesn‚Äôt get old? It just reminds me of the Combat Zone in Fallout 4. So much wasted potential.
---
Ah thats a shame
---
I have no problem with banning miscreants. But how the hell do you know if you've bought a weapon or armour or plan etc from a duper?
---
As a low-level player I've had higher level players dropping me very useful things. Should I ignore these gifts?
---
I'm selling all the masks for 222 each and some dude almost cleared me out. Glad they didn't stack.
---
And then they fast travel and get a 300 lvl to merc me
---
This has never happened to me.
---
use Animal Friend to tame a wolf 
---
and there you have Dogmeat
---
Yes definitely. There are a few youtubers  who are falsely showing bugs today that were only around during the beta and on game release. Such as random death zones and such. They also make up lies about bugs to make the game sound even worser. 
---
They proceed to bash the game for all the bugs it has and tells everyone to avoid it.
---
Some of these YouTubers removed their videos though after they were harassed by the community for falsifying how bad the bugs are.
---
Not crying as much as the dupers, tho.
---
If i had to take a guess the area prob doesn't have a nuked version of itself since it isn't suppose to be possible, sounds like a shortcut they would do.
---
yeah i appreciate the reskin lamp that looks almost identical to the one i already own
---
I can get on did you add me?
---
The traveling traders have them and don‚Äôt require reputation to purchase them. They cost around 1k caps a piece.
---
it works for things on the outside. What i mean is there's no way of routing a cable inside the garage, except if it is from the front door
---
Yeah, I did. I'll be on for quite some time
---
Tech data bought at player vendors will not work fyi
---
I feel the same way. I have a routine every time I log into the game and I have to use at least 10 arrows to clear out the area. I'll get around 6-8 of those arrows back every time.
---
No I thought you were adding me
---
It‚Äôs clear that few people here know much about TOS or the precedents in court around subscription based gaming. 
---
If you buy a service and they null the contract, (yes they, it is their choice to ban, it may be a reaction, but it is still their action) you are welcome to receive refunds. They know this, that‚Äôs why they will pay. They‚Äôve already been sued via class action once over this game successfully. 
---
Microsoft is a third party, but at the end of the day, banks side with consumers. So you get your refund. 
---
This is not even touching their predatory marketing practices. False promises regarding falllout 1st. Selling broken in game items, failing to deliver on their promises at launch already landed them in shit upon game launch, it‚Äôs really only gotten worse since. Why do you think they are so quick to refund anyone‚Äôs atoms at any time for any in game item. They know they are selling broken shit, and marketing it as functional.
---
For all you people who don‚Äôt play MMO‚Äôs, play this game and now think you understand the industry. This is not how these games work. Radio silence is not the norm, worldwide ban hammers are not the norm, instant refunds on any item is not the norm. We love the universe so much we look past a lot of UDAAP violations
---
I knew there was people doing that! Thanks finally I know I'm not descending into madness xD
---
Thanks dude c:
---
It took me over 1000 hours to get to where I am now, and not a single thing I got naturally, everything I have has been bought, traded for and/or duped.
---
I sent it lemme check if I sent it 2 the right person
---
about tree fiddy.
---
is it possible there was a super mutant horde at the same location as the quest?
---
Also do you have a key card
---
I would have nuked that shit heads camp immediately
---
The challenge: break the game
---
The pursuit: don‚Äôt get caught
---
Its fun, exciting and a bigger challenge than anything the game can throw at you.
---
I want:
---
Mental powered doors
---
The ability to place wallpaper on powered doors
---
More powered doors
---
Powered windows
---
More cool powered stuff
---
I love powered stuff
---
Right? Saw someone running around in NW in the black Captain Cosmos power armor already.
---
I suppose that would depend on their Special stats; I primarily play Adventure mode, though I've reached Overseer rank 75 in NW so far. Because I run a Power Armor Heavy Gunner build, I don't have a lot of points in Perception (think I've got the stat to 4), where a lot of those rifle perks would be. So I miss out on the likes of Tank Killer from the get-go (just using that and Master Rifleman/Commando would need 9). It's why I've stuck with shotgun perks; that Combat Shotgun is still incredibly powerful when it's used well, and I find I don't need many perks or boosts to make decent use of the other weapons I tend to use (Handmade,. 50 Cal, Minigun if I can find one, grenades).
---
To be fair, if they have the right weaponry, two or three jumps is all they'd need to take players out. I've never actually used the perk myself, so I never would have known just how much it was changed. All in all, it doesn't feel like the nerfs did much for the meta of NW (from the perspective of someone getting shot to death by those using the peek. =P). Every top player I've come across uses it in combination with either a rifleman build, or explosives. Very rarely (in comparison) I'll see them using the Gauss Shotgun, but it never strays from those three combinations of winners in the matches I've played on Xbox.
---
Bethesda fucking sucks so much man... big sad
---
not when you violate the ToS, you surrender your right to a refund
---
I completed the WL campaign with a second character, to side with the Raiders this time. Used gold to get the SS chest (my other guy is a PA heavy so I got T65 with him). And it just kind of dawned on me, holy shit, I'm going to be doing this with two characters now. And that was kind of it for me
---
IMHO, as mentioned just start new character and keep passing all the quests.
---
In case finding any legendaries keep bloodied and junkies weapons  for sure, or even better check item prices on sites like this https://fed76.info/.
---
But you should understand that is isn't 100% accurate - as banner mentions  "use your own brain".
---
Regarding main quest line keep completing both raiders and settlers quests until you will see a popup that says that you won't be able to continue quest line with another fraction. At that point decide what fraction would be better for your build.
---
And personally I will suggest to wait on starting encryptid event (for smth like taxidermy quest) unless there are couple high level players on the server, this event kind of hard.
---
Also join encryptid event if someone starts it, same applies for SBQ.
---
The limits stops you. I do enjoy the time I spend here, but the limits, its like I already turned it over with last day playtime. Im with you, get rewarded for playtime. Not removing all limits maybe cause the cheaters, but raise it alot
---
Oh you accepted it didn‚Äôt get the notification for it and yea I got 1 I‚Äôll let you drop it
---
I‚Äôve run into mobs of radstags and Yao guais that seem to be endless at Colonel Kelly‚Äôs monument and it just recently started happening. There will be like 10 radstags and 5 Yao guais, I‚Äôll kill them and they will all respawn immediately multiple times.
---
Goddamnit monstah!!
---
Amazing luck bruh, use it to but lottery not legendary! üëç
---
You see, I would be part of the problem if I actually sold ammo.
---
Now, don‚Äôt be rude for literally no reason.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but even non-dupers can and do one-shot everything.
---
But I agree, the bans on proven cheater should stand.
---
Considering how easy it is to obtain, not suprised PA dosnt get much improvement, really hoping we get some higher tier sets or legendary pieces... really like playing a Two Handed PA User
---
what platform?
---
in the audio settings there are volume sliders
---
-ETA: PTT means your mic is off unless youre pressing a button.. "push" to talk
---
Roughly 5k
---
The game bugs like skyrim did and your trophy comes to life and destroys your camp
---
The thing is some stuff is definitely not worth what the cap value is listed as. It works in single player fallout games because the "market" is determined by the NPC's (devs) and in that world what is the agreed-upon market value. In a multiplayer game like 76, the market is decided by the playerbase, and by now it is well-established what certain things like ammo sell for based on their abundance in the world. It's the same with any other multiplayer game that has trading.
---
Just be glad it is not 400 weight cap in stash like at launch.  
---
.that sucked.
---
This was inside a building. Whenever I got it down to 2 to 0 mutants, 10 more would come guns blazing from upstairs and downstairs.
---
Yeah some ppl really ask for bann lol
---
I stay logged in and watch each daily disappear one by one as they get replaced with a new one . Guess I‚Äôm just lucky 
---
        It‚Äôll probably happen to me now Lmaoo
---
At your camp for around 10k caps. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone. People are still buying these plans.
---
lol yes
---
I requested a refund after I found out there's only one entrance and it's hard to place things inside of it and not have the stuff jump up top. The one door just made me think it looks like a trap.
---
I think it prioritizes player inventory, then stash box, then scrapbox. 
---
Scrapbox *should* be the last thing it chooses from, I'd rather deplete the resources taking up carry weight, but it still feels bad when rare junk you're trying to collect gets scrapped.
---
I'm on pc and I have the game on steam
---
The diner in flatwoods is easy. That's where I went.
---
Max out all three heavy Gunner perks, One Gun Army &amp; Stabilized if you are in PA. &amp; should be able to put out more damage.
---
Love it - hope you can keep it up
---
I‚Äôll try to find a video. There was one about someone bashing the game and the video showed a guy doing a meat week event. Meat week was more then a year ago lol. I‚Äôll try to find it.
---
If I don‚Äôt reply to you again I gave up lol.
---
Probably one of the funniest sites when I go there... One Yao Guai stacked against 50 Rags üòÇ

Thanks for the explanation, I have never played an online game before so thanks
---
ok.. no horde then..
---
but.. fucking right on tho.. I wanna go in some buildings with you
---
Wow I'm barley breaking 700 hours played and can confidently say I like where my character is, I only have one explosive weapon but I play stealth so I hardly use it.
---
Maybe it is down to luck and perhaps more ways to acquire rare weapons like the fixer, bear arm etc are needed but like I mentioned I never even thought about needing a duped weapon/armor.
---
Can confirm I bought one a few days ago at 10k 
---
Haven‚Äôt seen any obviously duped yet
---
We need to also able to place the train whistle and use it
---
Have you worked out why you're stressed about it? Might help you sort out whether you should be stressed or how to manage that stress.
---
&gt; So someone tell me how I should be playing this game at a lower level? Focus on quests? If so, which ones? Should I just randomly wander the wasteland looking for enemies? 
---
There's no "right" way to play the game overall, let alone in the lower levels.
---
However, the thing that works for me is not to rush things. It makes the difficulty curve so much smoother and you get more story, quests and loot this way too.
---
Right now there's nothing new on the horizon that warrants you to be a particular level to rush towards so don't rush. You're not missing out.
---
&gt; Should I even be keeping weapons and armor that are too high level for me? Or should I just scrap them all? 
---
Unless it's an awesome legendary, everything that is much higher level than you you could just either scrap to learn mods or sell for caps. 
---
If you're like a level or 2 away from being able to use it, maybe hold onto that but any more than that and you're just wasting inventory space and time managing your inventory to be worth it. You'll always be able to get more gear at that level.
---
I dont think being on steam matters for the purpose of in game voice chat..
---
I feel like a lot of people simply don't have mics, or don't connect them. Personally, I enjoy playing games solo, and even in team games, I just take the advice or direction of those with mics. While a little clunky, the emotes in 76 serve pretty well for communication!
---
Oh, really? The last time I tried that (though I don't remember what console or controller), the buds didn't fit at all (I'm an Android user, primarily playing Xbox and Switch, though I do have a PS4). I don't think I've got a working pair or buds on-hand at the moment, but I'll have to look in to that eventually. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I see a lot of vendors but it seems like people aren't taking the time to restock them with everyone being busy xp grinding. I know I've been slacking.
---
I LOVE this mentality.
---
First make sure it has a heavy barrel mod, adds more damage. Make sure you‚Äôre using heavy gunner perks, demo expert, and more importantly use stabilized w/ power armor. I can‚Äôt get on to check right now but mine does I think somewhere around 200 per shot but that‚Äôs with every perk to add dmg and it‚Äôs primed
---
Ty.
---
If ur on PC I'm interested :) IGN: NewBlood-
---
GL.. I hope you figure it out
---
My anti armor western revolver and QE double barrel shotty can one shot anything sooooo
---
*Get better gear instead of blaming dupers :p*
---
Don't worry dude, but I'd be more than grateful if you did that.
---
Good luck on your video crusade brother!
---
The quarantine boredom is real
---
This lol, who gives a shit about the market haha, so all of you people that didn‚Äôt get banned running around with your duped fixers and exploding gat plas like you didn‚Äôt get them from a duper Hahahah fck you, I‚Äôve put over 3270 hours is this game and got banned. you might ask why? The reason I could think of is having tons of useless fasnact mask from fasnact week, I‚Äôm guessing that could‚Äôve triggered the bot didn‚Äôt dupe sht and still got banned. ‚ÄúYeah everyone who duped got banned right?‚Äù Get the fck out of here
---
Format.
---
If you didn‚Äôt roll it for yourself and it‚Äôs even halfway decent you can say, depending on the weapon, with varying degrees of certainty it‚Äôs been duped. Any legacy weapon you traded for 99.9% duped. Most god rolls, 95% duped. If not more.
---
So I just tested it to make sure. Had about 100 steel for in my inventory and made ammo with it. Now have 60 steel in my inventory. I believe it does but not sure yet
---
This is a handy spreadsheet
---
You can photo mode glitch through the door. You can't loot the guns.
---
Ok dude. Just been a lot of posts that read exactly like this that was dead serious. Like if you're not farming the heck out of the horde bosses, you're playing the game wrong.
---
Ok, point noted :)
---
Could be a glitch then because now that you mention it the last time I wa lucky hole mine I got swarmed with 20 cultists, 7 were  legendaries and only 3 dropped any loot- the others just clipped out of existence upon death. I was a little sad about that lol
---
Didnt think much of it since the rest of the game was super glitchy at the time.
---
I am here for this. Take my money!!!
---
Not necessarily, I jumped to a Yao Guai horde event the other day and ended up inside Watoga Emergency Services with them tearing all the ghouls apart lmao
---
If they are on display they won‚Äôt get used. I still have my colossus voice sack thing
---
The discussion is beyond duper getting and staying banned. The wonder is the grey area. Those who've benefited from that of others either willingly or unwillingly. A lot of product moved this past week. A lot of talks around here have been "I only had this one thing." 
---
And I'll be honest... The dupers that have been this for a long time have been doing it on easily aquirred burner accts. The professional game breakers haven't lost much as they don't drive their family car to a bank to rob it. So the game will still have it's issues of one shotters and the likes. People are laying low now but it'll be business as usual soon.
---
Well, sometimes Bethesda does weird mistakes, so maybe it could help
---
Ah yes.  Plus letting the low levels in radiation suits tag the glowies.  Used to be a level up every 10 mins!
---
The whitesprings nuke zone is one of my favourite memories of 76.  Just so satisfying waddling inside afterwards, or to the train station to sell the wares.  Or even finding a decent legendary at the vendors and buying it.
---
Scorched Spore Carriers!  Join us!
---
I did the upstairs one at camp McClintock, which is 0 lockpick, but there‚Äôs also a 1 lockpick to the watchtower next to the main gate
---
that is where I get my ribeyes from.. most people DGAF about your cows tho and will slaughter them for their own gain.. while also plundering your water purifiers if they are unlocked...
---
And not even slightly original or funny.
---
No excuse for duping
---
I had someone do that to me, I didn‚Äôt kill him because I thought it was a trap and the moment I killed him I would become a target. He followed me around for awhile begging me before he found someone else.
---
I think these reports are coming from the mains of the burner accounts that d/ped. "I never did it!" But they have 5 B2525 fixers or constant trade history with a now banned account
---
Its an suspension but I've heard it takes months to get any answer back to decide you've been banned or account wiped
---
I think Todd should award legendary Fixers to every player who never duped, knowingly bought a dupe, or wantonly, publicly lusted for a dupe. Or throw us a couple Daddy-Os and a Hunter's 50% VATS Drill.
---
really?
---
I bet I would have known that if I killed cows at peoples bases in the past..
---
Used to carry obital strike beacons just for those!
---
Sounds like a horde event spawned inside the building which happens sometimes, most of the time you end up inside if you travel to the event but nothing will be there but it is possible for them to be.
---
Ican only point you advice. third party to already figthing guys. Its core element for  battleroyale games.
---
cities crowded spawn and kiliing people not that hard.
---
Are you basing this on previous legal precedence?  And I bet it varies from state to state.  If you pay for 1 year of service, and your relationship is terminated by the company you paid for that year of service from regardless of violating their TOS I am guessing you have a legal right to AT LEAST a refund for the service they no longer provide.  I don't know this but when you purchase FO1st on one of the platforms on console, do you even get the TOS that you have to accept before paying?
---
I always overlook it myself, but see their flair: PS4
---
Sold two for that a bit ago almost instantly. I bought one for my alt two days ago for 7999. Bargain.
---
Dumb question. How do I smelt ore? I have tons of it.
---
The fact that Bethesda made an enhanced edition of skyrim but left so many game-changing bugs in like that dwemer armor ability meanwhile the Unofficial patch had it fixed pretty soon after its initial release in 2011 shows just how incompetent a company they are.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering about this since it says you need to be near your group for it to work. So you can be anywhere on the map doing your own thing as long as you‚Äôre in a group?
---
Remember when people actually went to WS in parties to hang out, now its a ghost town :\
---
I feel like there's also no excuse for leaving a game breaking exploit up for 5 days. Both sides messed up imo.
---
I'd be concerned if someone is behind after double XP and double score. If you keep up with the dailies and weeklies you should.br fine after the double events.
---
Follow what that guy said. 
---
One or two purchases (of different things) generally will be ok but it's best to follow your gut. If it doesn't pass the sniff test, just let it go and move on.
---
my assumption would be mobs did it unless youve seen players bludgeoning your cows..
---
Np
---
You got a drill?? Pshh that‚Äôs nothing, I‚Äôve got a rolling pin
---
I got myself wanted by picking a lock at Bog Town.  It was a box you have to lockpick even if you claim the workshop. I defended the workshop then wanted to get the daily challenge of lockpick.  What does this mesn now?  I have never dreamed of being wanted.  What can people take?
---
a badge of honor for being good and well behaved is the silliest tadpole scout shit i've ever heard. but there was a new lamp in the atomic shop yesterday? i mustve already owned it because i didn't notice it.
---
So no hope in item purges or account resets? They have to make a new psn or move on you think?
---
Mmm that's so weird. I have everything you said except the prime receiver but it still does the damage I stated before. Could you let me know later how much yours does?
---
Thank you
---
Here ya go - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hrwhot/my_fo76_character_in_front_of_my_red_rocket_truck/
---
Lol how can the game be dead? Think a little. Just released on gamepass lol
---
I already have all of those except one gun army wich doesn't really give bonus damage if I remember correct?
---
A few people have already beaten him to the end so he‚Äôs already lost in the grand scheme of it all.
---
I mean they're knowing for firing the ban hammer blindly 
---
*"oh your empty account that participated in the dupe?"*
---
#BAN
---
*"Your dupe goodie filled account?"*
---
^nothing ^to ^see ^here
---
I was really lucky lol, I kept thinking I was gonna die which was gonna suck b/c I was "cucumbered" and I didn't want to keep going after my loot.
---
acid and a chemistry table
---
discord mod here, server with around 500 players we proably saw 2/3s of ppl having accounts banned, the ban wave is still ongoing, they suspended many casual dupers and perm ban the ones who duped 100s or thousands of items
---
Very dickish move... but what interests me more is that it couldnt have taken you that long to spell out "free for newbies"... or is it just becuase navigating the letters are so annoying that it feels like forever? For me its the latter.
---
You can smelt at a chemistry bench, you‚Äôll need waste acid and at minimum 2 ores. You‚Äôll the smelting tab at the bench.
---
Definitely due to the ban wave. It really only
---
Affected end game players, and games pass retention will be low. 
---
Enjoy the new wasteland of low levels who really don‚Äôt care enough to have played the game prior to it being completely free.
---
Make a new account at this point when you get your old account back it'll only have whatever atom shop items you purchased
---
But fr we need a mounted grafton boi,
---
That sounds absolutely ridiculous and I love it lol. The pumpkin paint is so awesome
---
Chemistry workbench, scroll to the bottom and there should be a smelting tab
---
The eye lamp is functional in every PA I apply on but not working on T-65
---
&gt;but at the same time the RNG is so bad that I can't blame someone for wanting a shot at their dream gun
---
Come on dude. There's zero excuses for cheating. Yeah, there's some shit that's not fun in this game but you're more than welcome to either accept the game for what it is or not and stop playing the game.
---
Who knows how Bethesda will play this but I hope your friends are permanently banned. As disappointing as it may be for you personally, I get that, it's better for the overall health of the game.
---
no excuse for duping. breaking the ToS Just because you could don't make any sense. I hope they get ban permanently or wiped accounts.
---
You said that the RNG is tame, now you're saying that if you want a specific weapon you're "killing yourself with those odds".
---
I never said you need the best weapons to do anything. I'm saying if you want a specific item and stars, it's too much RNG. It's RNG with 4-7 layers
---
Yeah you guys are having all your high level players spread out over servers because of gamepass. Events might be a bit harder for awhile until the newer gamepass players get the swing of things.
---
Right with you.  I‚Äôve not been banned, but Bethesda CS is horrid, and we‚Äôve been told time and again that various ‚Äútools‚Äù to help players don‚Äôt exist.  So.... how are they investigating this?  
---
Perma bans?  Fine, I‚Äôm guessing the evidence is clear as day.  Temp bans?  You owe it to your customers to be thorough and quick.  3 month ban, and you did nothing wrong?  Well why the hell was there a ban?
---
Now if this was simply ‚Äúhey, you know picking up 1000 presents is wrong, you get a week time out‚Äù, I‚Äôm a-ok with that, but communicate that.  Don‚Äôt leave your customers hanging, if you value them.  The state of this game as it is doesn‚Äôt make me feel valued, these actions just re-enforce that.
---
Thing is, you‚Äôll get downvoted to oblivion.  There really isn‚Äôt much conversation when you get down to it, Bethesda is a mess of a company with some beloved IPs.
---
I don't think I'm going to do hamster style anymore.
---
No excuse for duping. Permaban would teach a solid lesson. 
---
This is the way.
---
Banned
---
I mean, it's kinda funny?
---
Each time you repair it, you get a new milk chance from it... There's that I guess? To make pepperoni rolls :)
---
Keep them. Afaik Bethesda has been looking at weapons with the same unique ID. Least that's what the dupers I was in a party were talking about. I'm the only one that was in the party that hasn't been banned lmao.
---
that would be delightful and you get XPs according to how long you have it in your possession.. and when you get killed its location gets reset [to one of several possible locations]..
---
-Edit added in brackets
---
I already have what looks like shipping container/semi trailer doors in my build list. But nothing fitting to put them on.
---
&gt; No i was not banned nor am i defending those who were justifiably banned. But 
---
Code for "I'm definitely defending those who were banned". Much like "I'm not a racist but..." style of comment.
---
Easiest way is if you know you did something wrong. ..did you dupe or have dupe weapons. 
---
Then it should darn well be perma we DONT want you back.
---
It isn't.
---
It's an suspension
---
Todd Howard will decide your accounts fate in like 5-6 months
---
I've seen it going from 3k (before the ban wave) to 15k (good luck with that).
---
Somewhere in between I suppose.
---
It‚Äôs just easier than being in the middle of doing something and having a stealth build destroy you while full of scrap.
---
There is one i know of which i've only ever seen posted on here once. I saw the post and had to test it for myself and it worked. It does involve dropping a nuke in a certain place.
---
Wasn't defending duping. I was stating that I also think leaving this up for 5 days was a mistake on devs end. If they care enough to wipe a chunk of the player base they should've cared enough to do something when it got their attention on Thursday. There's two sides.
---
Not true. On PS4 a load of people got banned/suspended. I had 1bout 50 people in my list who played daily and for hours at a time. I got suspended and about 40+ on my list did too because I messaged them to find out.
---
I‚Äôm just wondering whether Bethesda test before they sell something cost people money
---
So I have to wait HOW LONG?!
---
Part poor game balance, part you're probably comparing to a broken weapon/build that shouldn't be that powerful.
---
Could also be your build too not being optimised for it. It's not a terrible weapon by any means.
---
Aye. I farm horde events often. Good for junk and loots.
---
Put your claws away, you frothing moron.
---
OP: you should've received an email. Unless you duped 956389 different items you should be looking at a temporary suspension like most of us.
---
25 Charisma is max discount so I'd use an unyielding set and hard bargain (3 Charisma boost essentially I'm fairly certain)
---
maybe he taged someone by accident and didnt know about "pacifist mode" is off. so it is not a good thing to say these exact words but what u did is kinda not good as well. Whatever players say online doesnt mean they actually want it for real, not everyone has nerves of steel.
---
Just your scrap as usual. Just head to your nearest train station and let someone claim the bounty on you.
---
Ok
---
What???
---
You've never cheated in a video game?
---
Cheating in an online game isn't a valid way to play
---
Lol, yeah  most likely.  Could ve some things for Beth to consider for the next iteration of the game, next gen consoles/highend pc
---
This is what happens when GTA Online and battle royale players join other games.
---
Just to clarify: my opening comment wasn't directed at you :)
---
Much obliged friendo.
---
Yeah some people randomly get a letter months laters saying your account is banned or has been wiped
---
I stopped replying because I saw an infinite loop coming on but this is a good one.
---
I plan on it a lot of people seem to enjoy it and it‚Äôs cool to see people win big
---
I know
---
Anywhere on the same game, so you can be in an instanced encounter and still have the benefit.   However, if you remain in your group and go to a new server, you lose the benefit.
---
I have been "wanted" only once (doesnt that sound sadly pathetic :'). It was for picking a lock at a camp to see what was inside, I didnt even know what wanted was before that. Then a lvl 200ish shot my lvl 40ish dude in the head 10 minutes later. I do t even remember if I lost loot and found the whole thing highly amusing. 
---
Other than that I've only ever seen one other wanted on the map for ~10caps, which would have cost more to fast travel too to kill.
---
100% agree. Kind of ridiculous people try to justify cheating.
---
 I have tons of really good gear without ever cheating.
---
Well that kinda stupid of Bethesda
---
Oh buddy you forgot to thank the duper‚Äôs for your inventory?, acting like your not running around with a duped fixer or laser ? Hahaha gtfo
---
no actually only one side, if a bank leave the door unlocked and you stole the money isn't the bank's fault that you robbed them, it's on you. is your responsibility to be a good Samaritan and report the bug and not proft from it, go read the ToS.
---
I hope you don't use the same logic you just used on real life.
---
And if you're lucky enough to not have the server crash around you, you get killed by whatever you shot with what is basically the equivalent of a straightened out paper clip!
---
Steam counts players as ‚Äúplayed‚Äù if they have touched the game, so people who have been banned and went to check count as having played. 
---
Far from an accurate reading on things. 
---
The reality is at any given time under 10,000 people are playing this game on steam. Those are not good numbers for a AAA mmorpg that just had a big ad campaign and are pushing for new players.
---
In 3, I'd say.  No way jet becomes that common on the east coast if it was made and distributed by one man on the west coast.  There just isn't enough infrastructure for it to travel that far in those quantities.
---
What about my cousin who just created his account today and started off banned
---
So 
---
email = perma ban
---
Login failure code  = account wiped
---
ü§îü§î
---
Same happened to me. When the vendors got fixed a few weeks ago I put all my gathered plans up for zero caps. The first few visitors only took what they were missing, but then a level 400 player came and cleared my vendors. He even took all 40 mole miner gauntlet plans.
---
yes, if you build a Brahmin pen, which looks more like a wheelbarrow, one Brahmin appears.  When it dies, repair it with 1 steel and 1 razorgrain.
---
Hmm only other think is then take your damage increase chems- you are a junkie, then be a junkie &amp; chuck down buffouts, phsycho, etc when fighting mobs ü§ôüèæ
---
No it‚Äôs a dick move.
---
It's been a known issue for a while.  I do not know what causes it other than t65 armor.  I'm pretty sure bethesda doesnt either.
---
How long is the suspension usually for, do you know?
---
Kinda hard last week when they had a weekly that required multiple days in n.w. to finish.plus, there's a repeatable that you technically can't finish.
---
That n.w. weekly they had reset on me on the second day,, hours after the daily reset, and i had already done the dailies, up to the n.w. one.  I checked before I went into n.w. and it was fine. It autocompleted as soon as I loaded into v51.
---
What a jerk.
---
You build it and then it just appears in the same spot.
---
Another user had an account suspended for months previously
---
You know what I want? A bright headlamp for T 65 PA. Is that hard to ask!?
---
I hope everybody that duped gets a permanent ban.
---
*it just works* 
---
It's rather more funny how their dupe detection system is working they're going all out on everyone even random accounts are flagged as *suspicious* and receiving the ban hammer
---
Do you have generic damage perks like bloody mess and tenderizer? Is your 50 cal level 50? Which mobs are you testing on and is it yellow or white damage?
---
They should put pvp rules in private servers , rules that can be controlled.  Like increasing damage cap and what not.
---
Support is never snappy about things that don't directly impact Bethesda's bottom line.
---
You're in for a very long wait.
---
so people are coming to my camp, not buying anything, killing Bessie and Elsie, and my turrets don't shoot them?
---
At least that explains why 95% of the time the only item damaged in my camp is the Brahmin
---
Idk because then people would probably still just stay logged in when it updates just in hopes they would get something. Considering people can just log out before it updates the challenges idk if they will give people stuff for something they could easily not have happen to them.
---
You probably already know. If you did dupe stuff yourself, probably best to consider yourself permanently banned.
---
Wow.. Okay. I thought it would be until the next patch or something.
---
shit happens. not everyone is a good person. try to store ur junk and turn pacifist mode on. whenever u have any valuable junk and some \*\*\*\* wants to loot u just alt+f4 and chau mamita.
---
YES
---
Ok, after 4 days of not finding anything that can kill a damn bug much less power armor I am throwing in the towel. I really tried to give this game a chance but I feel like I amf,ighting an uphill battle. I die, alot, constantly running out of ammo, constantly doing the boil water, make food, take anti-radiation dance more than I am actually exploring and fighting. I appreciate the help from everyone, just not for me I guess.
---
It‚Äôs stupid, I only duped to give to my friend lol
---
Yessir
---
Been a bug for a while, kind of funny that they reintroduced it in the atom shop and still haven't fixed it.
---
Depends on when they sort this shit out. May be a few days, may be never. Honestly just depends
---
Wouldn't be a bad option, it's fine the way it is it's just the initiation you can't have team fights at all right now
---
It was delayed. You should wait until the end to buy levels anyway since score per level increases. Get a better atoms/score ratio that way
---
Weapons and armor dont have unique formids a  bloodied handmade has the same formid as a junkies and a normal non legendary handmade. That's the problem with the whole system and duping and why they havent purged anything, the first purge consisted of stacked weapons and armor
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda. It‚Äôll be never
---
It shouldn‚Äôt delete anything? If the roll is full it doesn‚Äôt let you take photos anymore.
---
Did you reinstall recently?
---
There is one foot locker next to each robot.  
---
There are also tool boxes and the like that are hidden in the dirt around the map that gives tons of mats with some caps.
---
Select photo gallery and you can remove them easily.
---
Small indie development team. Pls understand.
---
The single best thing you can do is spawn near your team and communicate with them. Share stimpacks or ammo when necessary. Tell people if you find good weapons or armor that you don't need. Use the compass at the bottom and give an angle if you see an enemy.
---
Use the third-person view to peak around cover.
---
Try to have the high ground in a fight. Also try to flank enemies so they have no cover.
---
Remember to use chems and grenades. I like to throw and VATS grenades to kill enemies behind cover.
---
Create and blueprint a structure in adventure mode for use in Nuclear Winter. I made a sniper's nest that is pretty useful when the circle becomes small, since then I have the high ground.
---
Don‚Äôt justify one thing because someone else happened
---
By agree to TOS you mean that unconscionable contract that you click A on when you very first buy the game? UDAAP read it, learn it, understand what your rights are.
---
Or just give it directly I‚Äôm level 200 and if you have free 556 or 45 yoinkus boinkis I‚Äôm taking it it‚Äôs not my fault you put it for free and other people didn‚Äôt get to it first
---
I got it from Rose. Also got it from Uranium Fever on another character (this one I traded away - don't need it on two toons and managed a very good trade for it :) ).
---
You don't need protective to get shielded to drop. I don't have protective on either character and got shielded... Just very low chance 
---
Good luck!
---
So didn‚Äôt have quite enough points to get everything, short by about 12, so need to level up, but got all the strength, luck and most of the endurance ones sorted. Also got all the mutations.
---
The bear arm when I started as a junkie did about 130 dmg. Now, all built up it‚Äôs rated at 1323 damage! Going to go take it for a spin!
---
I'll raise you level 5 assasins shovel for 9999 caps
---
That‚Äôs indeterminate at this point.  I know people in the past that got a temp ban as a sort of time out for a week or two.  I also know ppl that got unbanned after 3+ months and their account was wiped clean... which is kinda pointless.
---
I‚Äôve not been banned but if bans are occurring because of duped weapon possession... whooo boy SBQ fights tell me half the player base could be wiped.
---
Know what screams certain things about a person?  ALL CAPS
---
If you get well fed, your 20% threshold does increase by 5 health without rejuvenated, and 10 health with max rejuvenated. Also, if you use max rejuvenated as a bloodied build, you will die when it runs out if your are below 50 health when it does run out, just like psychobuff.
---
So its storage is separate from my stash?
---
I get the reasoning, I just don‚Äôt trust people‚Äôs motives. At my current level I‚Äôd jump on the chance for some pvp action, even if it means getting destroyed but back then I wouldn‚Äôt risk it
---
I know :)
---
I was trying to use base numbers - running solo, lone wanderer3, bolstering armor or basic PA, no chems. 
---
With those, I get just a hair under 10k XP from the WS cottage /golf clubhouse loop and the 5 or so L40 mole miners outside of blackwater mine - at 30 minutes, more or less.  Slightly faster if I have consumed canned meat stew.
---
Compared to a low level who‚Äôs primary target would be lower level scorched and how long it would take to gain the same XP.
---
You are right, with armor, team bonuses, etc, it would take less time and fewer enemies -but still nowhere near what you and I can do at our respective levels.
---
Perfect take on it!  And that is definitely a [different song from the one I expected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlgHroMOPWs) from that title.  And a better one, too.  So thanks for the bonus song link.
---
Yes I did. I accidentally uninstalled the game. Would that actually wipe out your photos?
---
This!  We're both on mics, but no, I don't know where we need to go next.  My current quest is "help team leader".  
---
Yes, I can see the custom destination map marker when he places one, but I cannot see his yellow quest marker.
---
Yup, sounds about right! Glad to hear it. Enjoy being a monster! ü§ôüèæ
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kinda sad actually I got banned and can‚Äôt play with my friends
---
Yup unfortunately.
---
It is white damage and I have bloody mess but not tenderizer. The gun is level 45 wich is max level for a 50. Cal I think and the mobs that I tested it on where super mutant warlords.
---
So you did dupe. Enjoy your ban.
---
It‚Äôs really too bad they also just banned many of the generous veterans who would be happy to help in game.
---
Most people don't care. I don't even use my crops. I just have corn and tatos for the chef daily.
---
Ohhh.... now I want to set up a shovel store near the graveyard and camp that spawn lol.
---
By their logic since honest money is so hard to make, stealing is justified
---
Single player games, yeah. Very early on as a kid. Then I learned that if I had to cheat, I may as well not play the game at all.
---
I've never cheated and would never cheat with multiplayer ones. You know, the whole "do onto others as you'd have them do onto you" shit. 
---
Cheating is whatever in a single player game. You're only affecting you. In a multiplayer game, you're affecting other players, even if you think you're not.
---
I, for one, am happy with the teat reference because I grew up with a family who would call the person who comes in last ‚Äúsucking hind teat.‚Äù Just not enough teat references nowadays. And yes, I grew up in farm country.
---
Probably but I have to take a hiatus from my Xbox and don‚Äôt want to miss the giant sheep squatch plushie :)
---
Oh okay thanks for the reply!
---
Will do man, thanks for the help!
---
+karma Thanks for the heads up.
---
You need to have a new piece of Technical Data and make sure not to stack them as it "breaks" the quest trigger. If you've been hording them for a big payout, you might as well sell them all at a vendor because they are all missing the "Quest Start" trigger on them and are worthless. So basically make sure you don't have any in your inventory, find 1 piece, and go turn it in. On a good day of server hoping, I can get 10-14 pieces from the desks in the Military Wing of the Whitesprings Bunker. It just takes time and good amount of caps fast traveling back and forth.
---
I'll take your word for it. I don't glitch the game besides foundations, that's just what they were talking about. Also the only stuff I ever accepted from them was wood pieces which I doubt anyone duped. A full shrouded wood armor set sucks about as much as you'd think.
---
I would actually build things in workshops if I could load them again.
---
I managed to get one of these as a result of the dupe and it's kinda incredible. It's a lazy weapon sure, but it's so powerful
---
I dupe to give to my friends most of it wasn't even legacy items 
---
Other than that I mass dupe lvl 5 nw Lazer and handed them out like hot cakes
---
Your friends shouldn't have been duping.
---
Maybe your friends shouldn‚Äôt have exploited the game... just a thought.
---
Cus its an asshole. He possessed my cow one time
---
Just stop
---
8 weeks left
---
You had me at psychotats.
---
How many duped guns did you buy?
---
Random spawn point. A vengeful mothman appears at my camp every so often to make me soil myself.
---
Look at these Karen‚Äôs below me lmao. Nerds
---
It‚Äôs both the players and Beth fault. If they got a ban for duping they deserved it. Just because you need your friends because of depression in fallout doesn‚Äôt give them immunity.
---
If they are truly your friends play some other games. There are games designed for coop that would be a much better experience.
---
Unless they just ran strait into the camp vendor without paying attention to the camp, saw loads of stuff listed as free and thought "brilliant, this guy clearly wants this stuff gone to make stash room, ill take it"
---
Nice, I'll have to look for those
---
He broke my fence and possessed my communist collectron. Thats when they glow purple, right?
---
Yup, just put a stock on it.
---
Actually back in October everyone was duping legendary wood armor with sneak because they thought it would be the next meta pvp set...they were wrong.
---
I have good enough gear without cheating either. 
---
It's pretty sad that people feel that they have to resort to cheating.
---
Oh well, they got what was coming to them.
---
I wasnt expecting it, im near the whitesprings golf course
---
so much annoying to level an alt for this is too much work, but is a hell of a sledgehammer used that till lvl 30
---
Not enough actually. Got some dependable first hand information a bit ago. Its disgusting how they (Bethesda) are trying to blanket over this. If you guys like the duping and cheating, then Bethesda is perfect for you. If you don't and still hoping one day it will change for the better, well it won't. I am diffidently out for good on Bethesda. If you guys still find things fun about it, keep playing. But to me, its pointless, its like a cheating wife that always says things will get better, but it never does if not getting worse and all I can say is its my fault for being stupid enough to hang on this long believing Bethesda would do good on their part.
---
Sounds like a dangerous game....
---
Do you log in next to foundation?
---
Do you mean damage per shot? Damage per second?
---
I found a way to get multiple punjis to overlap in one spot, instant death to anyone that walks across it!!
---
If it's not something you need for your build or to survive throw it away. Replace your non legendary stuff with legendary stuff as you get it and scrap everything else.
---
This game isn't a good game to decide you want to collect one of everything in though, so plan one build and scrap the excess. Don't collect stuff for a "what if I want to change to that build" scenario. You'll go nuts.
---
You can do the legendary system  as much as you want, really no point in waiting as long as you're max on scrip when you hit level 50 so you can roll for a bunch of 1 star weapons and get the ideal weapon with the best first star to use till you find a better 2 or 3 star later.
---
Below level 50 just do all your main quests. Some people advocate waiting to do them so the legendary weapons they award will be max level. Really, none of those weapons are that great. Might as well get them now and use them because by time you're level 100 you'll probably have found better weapons than all of the quest reward weapons and won't be using any of them anymore even if they are level 50. The only quest reward that's worth any special consideration is to make sure you own all the previous tiers of raider underarmor mod plans before you finish the raider rose questline so she awards you the shielded plan and not the lesser one.
---
Well you know the saying about "too good to be true". But its a pretend economy inside a video game, there should be no concept of buyers getting screwed over, or buyers beware.
---
Good thing I got rid of the stuff after a day of getting melted by everything tougher than a molerat.
---
ü§Ø
---
Tri barrel should not affect damage but does lower range.  The lowered range may induce the damage drop off earlier causing the lower numbers.  Penta barrel lowers the damage to raise the rof even more
---
I wish, I wanted to be able to kill ward he does nothin all day and let people Rob his place.
---
I hate all of them. The raider one is actually tolerable.
---
Vintage nukashine for 100 caps? Yeah ok.
---
Sorry about your depression. In these uncertain times I feel the same. 
---
man it is weird to play alone. A vibrant community has been lost, and the winners are unfortunately many of the most negative members of the player base. 
---
In preparation for the mean comments you will receive, just know that many people feel the same as you, and many of those people are so disheartened they don‚Äôt want to read this sub. 
---
You are not alone, and if you and your buddies need recommends on new games, I am happy to share some!
---
You are cringe lmfao
---
If you don't like it, I'd be happy to trade you for itüòÑ
---
Yeah that makes sense.
---
Didn't even noticed on PC, the map looked as full as it normally does and when someone dropped a nuke there were plenty of high level players.
---
Agreed, solo is boring, and legendaries show up. Also, you get improved health Regen for 30 minutes after the event.
---
Nope been there since beta.
---
They migrated from the docks of Far Harbor.
---
Where is all this whining happening? That's hilarious.
---
I don't use heavy gunner myself, I use rifles. But I did have this experience when levelling up until I got the proper build and wondered why I did no damage. I think everyone goes through this lol. I mean if you hit them in vulnerable areas so for warlords in the head you would do more damage of course. The only thing I can think of is your receiver. You said above you don't use prime receiver. They can be a huge difference. Like I have one weapon with a .38 receiver on it on purpose. The reason is it's just a low level killing gun. It's sheet damage is from memory 80 or 90 less than if I had the second most powerful receiver (the most powerful is prime but that's just not economical to run all the time). I had to go out and look for a receiver for my rifle since I didn't even have it. Maybe it's something to do with that . Do you have the best mods for this weapon outside of prime?
---
I have perks that let me carry more stuff.  Bandolier is maxed out so regular ammo weighs 90% less.  Same for Traveling Pharmacy with chems, and Though Hiker with Food and Water.
---
Also have Batteries Included and Heavy Frame, but not maxed out.
---
With all my perks,  I normally carry about 160 lbs out of 235 (?) carry capacity.  Without them, it's over 500 lbs of inventory.  I take all the bullets, and all the chems with me, unless they are in a vending machine.
---
Your Brahmin will either give me its milk or it‚Äôs blood
---
Gotta be careful with your prices, though. I have a small cafe (purely for fun) where I sell coffee, donuts, nukashine, quantums, etc, and drug/alcohol recipes, but if I price everything too reasonably (donut 2c coffee 6c, rad ant lager 12c, etc) some dude will ALWAYS buys everything. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much back-stock I keep, because when I re-load the vendor some other spendthrift just comes along in a few minutes and clears me out.
---
Idiot me sold over 300 quantums one day at 15c per before I realized I needed to boost my prices or else I‚Äôd be wasting all my time searching for new stock.
---
They've at least been there since wastelanders (when I started) but I've only seen like six. All were in the mire or cranberry bog.
---
No they're not. They're just exclusive to the mire and not all that common. Pretty unsettling the first time one comes scuttling up to you.
---
Very often it spawns on sbq event
---
:v
---
Strange, PS4 here too and i server hop a lot, almost all servers are packed. Many low levels (as in lower than 10) in SBQ fights too which is kinda cool.
---
No one ever expects the Flatwoods Monster...
---
I'll try and explain as i lost the original video. One sec
---
Nope, and didn't notice anything different! 
---
The server was still full as it normally is
---
Yeah people in this thread seem to care about their cow way to much. It‚Äôs a very cheap fix
---
What are your addictions and where do they leave your special stats at?
---
If I see that I‚Äôm killing the boss
---
I think the whole ‚Äúnormal‚Äù players getting caught in the cross fire is bull being put out by duper‚Äôs to generate sympathy.
---
They aren‚Äôt honest to start with.
---
Yes, blueprint 2 of them and you can then put corn basically right next to each other.
---
That one guy in flatwoods talking about aliens on a holotape did
---
What does killing a video game cow say about people?
---
I think the whole guilty until proven innocent thing is ridiculous they should really investigate first and then ban if its suspicious not the other way around.
---
All can be viable but I would put my money on heavys . Captainoob actually takes out the queen with a non legendary pa heavy build
---
Here comes your friends shouldn‚Äôt have duped comments
---
Just like the people who tryed to shut the servers down unless pvp was reverted
---
Oh yeah. All the real dupers, the ones selling for money, the worst of the bunch got away Scott free. A basic inventory check isn‚Äôt gonna stop them. 
---
It just affects everyone who casually benefitted. The ones who were never prepared for the worst. 
---
There‚Äôs this guy who has been leaking b2525 handmades, fixers etc for the last month. Probably made 20 grand. He was not banned, and his prices have risen back to pre dupe. 
---
There is one winner in this whole debacle, it isn‚Äôt Beth, it isn‚Äôt the clean player base, it‚Äôs the people who‚Äôs side hustle was disrupted by the dupe, and are now back in business.
---
I have the same issue on ps4 disappears in about 10 seconds of loading
---
What? I got an emote
---
They're not all visible immediately. Most of them start out covered by geometry that periodically gets removed to reveal the "hole" w/the cache in it. It seems like every time you get one of those rumbles like when it first announces about caches (right after you enter the mine), another one is revealed.
---
I guess there's still new things for me to try and find!
---
This is awesome! Almost better than shooting things
---
I probably haven't actually used PA since i was level 25 (ie the first couple of weeks). A) It's so slow. B) It's so LOUD. C) Mmm, stealth.   
---
The only exception was when i was overencumbered and needed to fast travel. Then i got the backpack and realized minus the 10 pounds of chassis, i could carry more OUT of PA. Haven't stepped inside one since. :D  FREEDOM.
---
Most of them most likely are liying, but knowing beth, some normal players would of being caught in the ban.
---
I‚Äôm 90% percent sure it‚Äôs 180 items. Tried to google but came up with varying results
---
I can‚Äôt say posting this will help 
---
I can say that I understand though
---
Radiation rumble got easier.  No more people coming in and killing the ghouls I got crippled everywehre.
---
God-damned it butthesda, please
---
Solo seems to spawn ghouls mostly at the bridge.
---
The 4 or 5 grouped events spawned endless waves at the side meditation thing.
---
I went up almost half a level during this event (currently level 451)!
---
It‚Äôs really frustrating
---
I really doubt that there are that many "normal players" caught up in this. The problem is that the "legit" duper account would also be caught up in this banning wave if "normal players" have been too. Maybe even more so if caps weren't exchanged.
---
If dupers are able to get away with the above scam, then the so-called "normal players" aren't normal players at all and knew exactly what they were getting themselves into.
---
Yes I do and my build is fully build around heavy guns that's why I find it so weird. I'll see how much damage increase the prime receiver gives tomorrow. Thanks for the help!
---
Oh! Good to know. I did notice them towards the end of the event
---
&gt; I know in my heart since Bethesda Support was aware of the in-game mechanic and did not do anything about it, some of the blame is on Bethesda.
---
LOL. You left your door unlocked, so it's partly your fault I robbed your house.
---
Oh if you cripple do they stop spawning new ones?
---
But it from a vendor bot. I think the one in watoga sells it
---
If you use a stash box at someone else‚Äôs CAMP it‚Äôs actually just yours, you are not stealing their junk.
---
Nope, been there all up and down the mire since beta 
---
There‚Äôs usually one on the bridge by Harpers
---
And they jump scare me every time
---
It will not go away for me, at least 40 minutes in now.
---
They have to keep on top of it, i know some guy who got a dupped weapon from a trader, guess what? he got the ban-hammer :\\
---
I cant do much Mandy but I feel that this is the best action I can take at the moment.
---
Safe in the cockpit of the plane at Collision Course.
---
I see vendors everywhere.  They're just trash though.  I almost bought that half broke level 5 pump action for 40 caps yesterday though.
---
Which ones? My buddy and I both lost our workshop and giant creature weeklies so I‚Äôm wondering if it might be tied to the goal itself
---
I think Grafton station sells it as well
---
No, not for me but if it does for you, I'd probably avoid doing it multiple times over lest you get flagged as someone using an exploit and possibly getting banned.
---
I‚Äôm not ruling out the possibility of that happening. But so far all the innocent players who have pleaded their case always end up saying they only duped a few times. Or they thought the deal was too good to be true, or any other story like that.
---
My favorite was the player who‚Äôs husband played got them so they wouldn‚Äôt miss any dailies because they had to work and he duped just 4 times.
---
Maybe it's just your bare fists?
---
Tell that to the 14 year old kid I‚Äôve been playing with for 6 months who received a free fixer and plasma because of his prior generosity with his time by offering free camp building, that was subsequently banned. He wasn‚Äôt even here this weekend, came home from a family outing to find he was banned. 
---
Hardly seems fair to punish people who really weren‚Äôt responsible, while the biggest offenders get away no trouble, having lost an account they were prepared to lose.
---
Icing on the cake, this exact method of duplication was reported in the pts weeks before, and left alone. Quick to ban, slow to fix the problem.
---
60
---
If Bethesda had proper tracking and logging, identifying the parent accounts for burners wouldn't be that hard. We have a ton of stuff that we log out at work for use in potential fraud cases.
---
Oh man I don't really know of the top of my head but I do know that I chose alcohol, mentats, buffout, fury and another one that I don't remember. I did make sure to chose addictions that made sure I didn't lose to many/importent special stats.
---
Surely they didn‚Äôt do
---
Just like leaving your bike unchained üôÑ
---
What about camps with Turrets AND a bar? D:
---
The jail break event is where I got mine or at the watoga vendor for about 1,500 caps
---
Not sure how in my 10+ years of playing their games I never thought of "butthesda". You god damn magnificent bastard.
---
Harpers ferry vendor bot, he‚Äôs behind a building on a deck of sorts.
---
I hit it every time. Good target practice
---
The bans are pointless. Ive sat at a train station and listened to duppers brag about already getting banned and just buying another copy with the money they made from dupping. Making another toon and going right back at it. All awhile their main is sitting clean.
---
Then turn around and see a friend whose been on since day 1 make his dream gun because RNG hates him. Next day, ban hammer.
---
Yeah, solo always spawns the bridge. The hardest to get to for defense is the interior one. If a whole team shows up though, you can each stake out a section of the map. Yeah, trusty lever action and I went up plenty. Plus, Treasury Notes!
---
This is beth we're talking about, this wouldn't be the first time some nomies have been wrongly smashed with the ban-hammer.
---
there is, it‚Äôs under walls, by itself like midway
---
That‚Äôs my impression as well, PS4 servers are always pretty full. Banned folks want to make it sound like Bethesda is losing a ton of players, which is not the case.
---
Place a tile. 
---
Plant some corn in the furthest corner of the tile possible. Then plant another corn wherever. 
---
Now blueprint that. Scrap the 2nd corn. 
---
Now bring up your blueprint of the 2 corn. You'll find you can place one of the blueprinted corn closer than you could with a non blueprinted corn. Place it and delete the 2nd corn from the blueprint.
---
Now you have 2 corn right next to each other. Blueprint it. 
---
Rinse and repeat until you have 18 corn on one tile. 
---
you dig?
---
The helmet talks, and the chest also talks. They made a silent version of the helmet, but not a silent version of the chest. Therefore, a whole suit of prime will still talk regardless if it has the silent helmet. Kind of an oversight I think. I don't understand why the chest and the helmet both need to talk, it should just be helmet.
---
If you know what you're doing and apply xp boosting stuff as soon as you can it doesn't take that long and it's a guaranteed drop but you do you.
---
Vendor in Harpers Ferry carries them.
---
If your on PC I have a spare I can drop for you
---
Apparently the vast majority of the players are blatant cheaters, so I'm not sure why you thought this would work.  
---
Most noobs have no money and are not vendor hopping. You have to actually go find them.
---
Sure the PvP element of the game may have been heavily nerfed by Bethesda, but it's still part of the game. Dont wanna die while becoming wanted???? Dont become wanted.......
---
Dam man...shouldve asked me....its easy to do
---
It came with both a garage door and side door. The garage door is in the walls category.
---
And actually, I like shooting cars that explodes
---
One day I was shooting into this "truck" i was really terrified when it started moving, lol (I was low level that time) 
---
I wish there were more mobs like this
---
*"normal"* players are getting banned tho ü§î
---
Bethesdas dupe detection sucks they hit my empty mule and haven't touched my goodie filled one
---
Honesly..that an easy to fix it, ban the main accounts they use to trade the dupped stuff.
---
Found it, thank you.
---
I'm going to try and make it work and if it doesn't, I might trade it.
---
you cant lose the repeatable one. 
---
Last week i finished my daily's and weekly's , minus the N.W one.  Played NW and it auto completed the N.W weekly. The rest of the week i did all Daily adventure challenges first and NW after.
---
Looks real good homie
---
the lazynes on me don't let me boder by it since I spent 2 week's farming for my sledgehammer without knowing this.
---
but agree with you, with the right buffs is kinda easy to get to 50.
---
You can solo it and only have to kill 2 ghouls at the bridge. I usually afk it lol
---
Berserker gains the most damage at 0dr. As long as you don't use scaly skin, this would be a great hazmat suit gun.
---
If u on xbox1 I got u 1500
---
I was thinking like 100 or more caps every 5 minutes you held it maybe to a max of like 25.
---
I think the person who kills you should have it transferred to inv. Cant drop it and becomes wanted.   
---
Basically a game of tag but better then monster mash.
---
First time I ran into one I was trying to escape a behemoth and decided to run down a broken piece of road in the mire, didn‚Äôt expect the broken bus to swing around and claw at me... didn‚Äôt make it out of that one lol
---
You left your door wide open, your neighbors kept trying to shut it for you but you just wouldn‚Äôt listen, you finally get robbed, so you pull out a machine gun and kill anyone who might have known the robbers, a couple neighbors even, meanwhile the robbers are over there on the street corner selling your shit completely free of your wrath.
---
They have other bannings on their agenda right now.
---
Did you send in a ticket for the n.w. one?  I'm just curious, as I've not heard back from mine yet.
---
Yes!
---
I was wondering when I was finally going to see someone use the chore joke!
---
Yeah, and as usual, bethesda gave us what we wanted about a year late
---
I honestly hate those types of dupers only thinking for themselves
---
I duped to help the community.. here and there i asked for an service fee cause the dupe costed caps but other than that the dupers that are sitting on a mule filled with goodies and using to see for IRL cash are the scum of earth
---
Is this a discussion or are you reminiscing?
---
There are so many builds I want to do in workshops, and if they would save everytime I took it over, i'd love it (idc if it cost the resources every time either!!!)
---
I set him to collect ammo. It's not a big amount, but still cool to have a trickle come in.
---
yea, some times you need to use a hyperbolic example to get the message across. comparison still fits, even if you don't like how I'm doing it
---
That article was an insanely interesting read, thanks for that.
---
Right?  It‚Äôs clearly automated.  Then they‚Äôll look at it?  It just seems lazy.  Now if it‚Äôs automated and a time out, made to make people sweat and think twice, I‚Äôd be ok with that with some communication.
---
I admit, I‚Äôm spoiled.  ~10 years of WoW put my expectations up really high.  Old Blizzard had excellent CS!
---
I can't believe someone threw away this used toilet paper.
---
Which is only possible if they actually track that stuff. That's the fun thing about code. If you don't make explicit provision to write out and save operation information, it's just gone (aside from anything the system log might record automatically, but that's usually errors). Makes trying to debug something with crappy logging a real pain in the ass.
---
Dude if you think duping and cheating in an ONLINE SERVICE does no harm then there is literally no explaining it to you. 
---
But i do hope one day you start a business and someone fucks with it and you remember this.
---
Get out of public team and make a regular team...should still work
---
Sorry I've been at work, it's Dionysus09. I might get on in a few hours. Just got home
---
well, thank ya kindly.
---
well you just replied making it a discussion
---
Or Faschnaut Donuts!!
---
tanks!
---
Justice: where the casual offender suffers the worst penalty, and the worst offenders walk away unscathed!
---
Dont dupe dont get banned easy as that
---
Not sure how their tracking accounts and dupes but all I know is they hit an empty account while the goodie filled one didn't set of the flags ü§î
---
Epic
---
Meanwhile I barely move stimpacks at 6 caps.
---
:)
---
It doesnt
---
Yeah there's no way this is as widespread as reported lol
---
Must of been a raider!
---
Those guys were just pathetic anyway lmao. A handful of them tried to throw a tantrum with hacked weapons and by the time the day came, everybody already forgot about them. It was outright sad, like it went a few steps beyond the tiny dog barking loudly into something that just isn't appealing
---
It's a CAMP building it has no stash.
---
In this case better late than never.
---
How about a hazmat lab.
---
Good thing you didn't say that on their forums, you'd get a warning for 'Slander'. They apparently don't like having a bit of fun at the expense of their name.
---
So, I finally did it.
---
Not only did I kill 1 person, I even managed to kill two.
---
Then I was raped by dogs. Yah, that happened.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Handmade\_gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Handmade_gun)
---
Sounds like you need to find a better friend circle
---
And I hope people show you similar compassion when you make a mistake! Thanks for your valuable feedback that didn't address the post!
---
That‚Äôs what the dupe was all about. No reason to have 100 fixers other than to give 99 away. It‚Äôs almost like bethesda was protecting the USD earning players. 
---
few of the staple names are gone, this hurt the casual player much more than the prepared exploiters
---
and anything that affects the intended grind OR affects the ability to flood the game with legacy weapons that have been intended to be restricted is breaking the balance and the economy. All you are doing is defending notions desire and entitlement. Expecting that the rules (in this case, Bethesda's intentions and control) don't apply to you when you think you can get away with exploits in a multiplayer game IS entitlement issues.
---
I don't. It's a game. Enjoy your day!
---
Why are you belittling people who dont share your ideas? 
---
You posted something controversial and got upset because people didnt share the same thought.
---
I share cards, but so what if I didnt? That's not discourteous, that's just MY choice. No one is obligated to share cards, but the feature is there for those who want to.
---
I agree buddy ‚ù§
---
It looks awesome! I pictured it smaller, I think I'll buy it 
---
Thanks man!
---
yes since launch.
---
I have over 5000 hrs in this game and have never thought about duping this game is meant to by a slow burn it meant to take you a long while if you don't want to put in the effort play a game that doesn't take any. I have only gotten one rare outfit in my time 
---
A responder fireman outfit and I lost that and a dozen of so end game weapons in a transfer server crash yesterday it not the end of the world it's a game. The game not prefect it never will be unless the stop adding content and people would hate that too.
---
So just have fun and enjoy the journey
---
Lol that‚Äôs great. I was also a power armor collector in FO4. 
---
I always shot out the fusion cores though. Didn‚Äôt know you could pick pocket them.
---
I agree
---
Begging for the people that duped to get banned.
---
Not to ban themselves for possession.
---
If people wanted dupers gone, they‚Äôd demand hardware bans, not dummy account bans that stop nothing.
---
I don't really mind
---
Hopefully. I haven't had it happen even though I've played every day after the first week, but it is worrying to see how often it's complained about. Things usually aren't fixed until one update after the patch notes say it's fixed, but in this case it really is a big problem. Glad they're looking into it but it seems they could be doing just a tad more in the support department
---
ALL DUPERS SHOULD BE BANNED \*looks at his stash  full of legacies\*  \*sigh\* , damn cheaters!
---
My camp is on his route so I see him fairly often. When he wandered by last night my friends and I tried the the relogging trick and it doesn't work. Even switching characters didn't help.
---
When the server resets my quests for the raiders and settlers don‚Äôt reset. I am logged off during the reset, so I‚Äôm not sure if these quests are a 24 hour reset or something else. Anyone have any idea??
---
God damnit Bethesda, I thought I was going crazy. Funny how no glitches ever ADD currencies. Those are fixed immediately.
---
Just make sure your strength is as high as it can
---
So the idea is that people who are playing the game will see this post, and log out before the reset? Because people are reading Reddit *while* playing the game?    
---
Is your next idea to build a large wooden badger?
---
Only you don‚Äôt have any proof. Just speculation based on a bunch of guilty players saying that innocent players got banned.
---
Which is hilarious because if that did happen, it‚Äôs their cheating fault.
---
By making a mistake you mean purposely breaking the terms of service you agreed to when you started playing the game?
---
 I won't make that mistake.
---
Idk their tracking is broken I just hope I did a service by handing out rare outfits and nw lasers
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone that wanted that knew it was so widespread. I mean it‚Äôs literally a ghost town on Xbox the last two days.
---
Huh? How would this affect a heavy weapon?
---
Rock on
---
if they figured out how to not ban legit players a hardware ban would be perfect
---
Not even half of them duped and just had a lot of hours logged and decent weapons like I did. Yet, the ban or suspension just takes them out anyway.
---
So your a duper claiming innocent people are getting banned.
---
I never kill brahmin, the milk has more value for pepperoni rolls and Fasnacht donuts
---
Has nothing to do with the game but the sad values of most people to not understand consequences for cheating or realize that duping and selling an virtual item from a game is a crime and has ‚Äúreal world‚Äù consequences. The example was purposefully extreme.  Of course I am going to mess with someone defending cheating/duping/illegal activity. They deserve what they get.  It amazes me to see people cry about it online. What do you think is going to happen?
---
Actually if they can follow the item IDs and values of what you got in your inventory etc. then they also can find out when it started and that is the point when you got that item ID as a trade with player ID ... .
---
In mother Russia shipping container build you
---
I hardly open trade request from randoms but when I do, they usually request my top and favorite guns and then message me trying to trade scrip worthy items for it. I decline but sometimes they are persistent and keep bugging me. I wish there was an option to select weapons that are not for trade without painting, especially since there is not a paint for every gun and also paint doesn't necessarily protect your gun.
---
It‚Äôs funny to grief someone‚Äôs base? You sound like a kid with nothing better to do than knock over sandcastles at the beach.
---
I can confirm its 180.
---
unless your dumb and shoot the lvl 300, then no, that's not how it works.
---
All that work for a corn farm?
---
Except for rifleman and commando builds. Except for bow builds. Etc.
---
I drop those.
---
Xbox has text chat
---
He was looking for a good looking player to probe.
---
Yeah they just don't seem to care that some people who had spent hours upon hours in their game might be getting a ban unjustly. (Because it has happend before as well) Just leaves a really sour taste in their mouth. And probably wont come back after their account is restored in the coming months. 
---
I get it that some of the bad apples won't get punished as fast, but they gotta prioritize keeping the disciplinary action fair as well. For example, sure the person who did cheat and got suspended deserved it. But the person who didnt cheat is still suspended and under investigation gets their account back after the investigation is complete is all fine and dandy. Except for the fact that had to wait weeks ot months to get thwir account back and have all that time wasted.
---
Based on commentary from their support on what they can and can't see, it doesn't seem like they log much (at least of normal, non-error operations). Though that just might be a lack of support tools for easy access to such things. There are things that our support has to periodically poke at me for, because it involves going through system logs, ad hoc database queries, and/or other stuff that's outside their wheelhouse and that they don't have tools for easy visibility into.
---
You've said this before. I hope you fall to temptation one day and people show you the same level of compassion you show to others!
---
The fact this has to be posted is so sad honestly. This game will never be fixed.
---
I would put a point into something that increased recovery odds by 25%-33%.
---
Won‚Äôt someone please think of the children!?!?
---
Once again, another story if an innocent.
---
It's surprisingly fun, people tried to meme about it copying fortnite or whatever but the truth is this mode is doing better than anybody would expect it to. It seems to just be battle royale for people who don't like battle royale. The incorporation of fallout mechanics into it is pretty well done, and the balancing isn't completely awful
---
I feel ya on this my tv is once of the first flat screen TVs made. You could count all the pixels they're so big
---
Bloodied heavy
---
Well he didnt find one there
---
^Hard ^to ^believe ^i ^know
---
&gt;*But duper bad me want my E gat plas to worth $300 again*
---
Bethesdas approach to a ban wave is as lazy as there approach to building a game
---
Damn nice work! Brings back fallout 4 memories
---
Sounds good to me!
---
Yup!  Only time they will spawn new ones is if the turrets kill one, so it's best to try and get them down in the pits.  The NPCs are worthless and generally won't kill one.
---
The other spawning mobs can be a problem, but are largely mitigated by holding your ore until theres almost no time left.  From my experience, the 5-6 deathclaws dont spawn at 0 ore.
---
Yup stock changes it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs almost as if it shouldn‚Äôt have been used for an online only game. ESO uses an entirely different engine and it didn‚Äôt end up THIS bad
---
Maybe he was drunk and had his beer goggles going?
---
What I did notice both times is that I went into adventure mode and the game crashed to the desktop. When I relaunched the game all of my items were completed. üôÅ
---
Likely
---
Can‚Äôt until the 23rd, Xbox suspended me from Xbox live
---
Proof? Go on eBay and look for yourself. It‚Äôs fact that plenty of casual players lost their accounts, it‚Äôs also fact that people who have made thousands of dollars duping and selling, are still selling the same guns today. 
---
Bans like this don‚Äôt hurt the people who are ready for them, they hurt the people who are dipping their toes in. Whether you think it‚Äôs wrong to dip your toes in or not, that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that people are still doing laps around the pool
---
No usually the lvl 300 is with the low level in a team which means that the 300 can attack me
---
Can you please tell me or give me a link on how this whole dupe thing was made? I've seen something about a safe at red rocket but i assume that's not it?
---
Same. Sometimes I find them in the forest too, near bigger locations.
---
Turns camp into Shipment
---
This would motivate me to not just haphazardly out turrets, a few crafting stations, and collectors/etc. Plus there would be more reason to visit other player's workshops!
---
There's no blame on the company fucking hell dude. What's with the world today and noone taking accountability, and it's always someone else's fault.
---
Your friends fucked up. 
---
They've cheated, destabilised the economy in the process, and caused issues like vending to be brought offline for ages along with displays etc. No sympathy. 
---
Also maybe try making friends with people who aren't game breaking cheaters instead than calling for the return of people who are ruining our game.
---
If innocent players got banned, it‚Äôs your fault for spreading your dupes all over the place. 
---
Look, if your a duper, then your a cheater, and dishonest. So your not creditable or worth trusting. 
---
But please keep explaining how your the good guy,
---
I agree with you. I have never duped and I am never going to. Just don't get it. If you duped and Bethesda banned you - you deserve it.  You knew what you were getting into.
---
I never even bought good weapons or armor from players. Only cheap useless things for scrip. Try to get everything by myself. But I'm still kinda scared for my account. What if one of the suits or plans that I bought from player were duped. Nothing may happen to you, or you will be banned "just because".  I just don‚Äôt know what to expect now.
---
I doubt it, between consoles maybe but not PC
---
I have given into temptation. Im not trying to be insensitive but i honestly can say from other non-game related experiences honesty is always best. Even if it's silence. Sorry i seemed lacking in compassion. 
---
Truly accept that it comes from firsthand understand notsomuchas judement.
---
Ps: i could be wrong, but where have i said this before today? I dont believe I have. Thanks in advance
---
Maybe you should hang out with better friends. Just saying.
---
While your at it tell them to add head lamps to T 65 PA especially the bright headlight. 
---
I‚Äôm using X01 head just because of that and my T 65 head is on my X01 frame set...
---
Oooo, now I feel terrible! I'm new to the game, and I think I've killed a few moos, that may have been at a player camp for food.
---
I shall only milk and murder the Flatwood moos in future. Or go vegetarian...
---
Honestly no, Having done archery for a while, if you fire a shaft, and it hits something, intended target or not, it's almost guaranteed to not fly straight anymore. Basically useless.
---
Its unlocked on account so yes.   
---
The ammo machine from raider rep.  No.
---
No, you'd get that if you ALREADY killed the boss
---
mate MY opinion on it is, I find ugly the PA animation, is bulky, eat reactor like candy, too big for the screen on 3rd person, don't force me to use one. but I do agree PA needs more love, legendaryes and work with the gear buffs like carry weight mods and s.p.e.c.i.a.l buffs.
---
It doesn't work that way anymore.
---
Yeah bought the keyboff steam for him last week he activated it got thru setting everything up sign in was already banned which is hilarious
---
That would be a terminal mistake on Bethesda‚Äôs part 1/4 the way into the season.  You reinstate people with shoddy communication then it means you cost them rewards that you‚Äôll gladly take their RL cash for.  That would make me walk away from the game, and I‚Äôm closer to 3000 hours than 2000.
---
Now if you clearly state it‚Äôs a short term punishment ban, people may be annoyed but they can relate.  ‚ÄúOh you‚Äôre gone, oh, you‚Äôre back.‚Äù Is likely the extent of these temp bans, but I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong.
---
That people who do it are cretins who enjoy randomly upsetting total strangers as its the only way to make their full 2 inches hard?
---
If someone went to eBay to buy an item, then they aren‚Äôt so innocent are they? Especially if they paid real money for it.
---
Once again, innocent people doing things that get you banned means they aren‚Äôt innocent.
---
Not a justification, no one said it's the right thing to do. Only that I can understand why people would do it. There's a difference between justifying a side and understanding it.
---
Yeah, it's called crafting.
---
Really?, I haven't gone bounty hunting in a while
---
Absolutely.  More Responder/Firebreather items please.  Even just a steelheart/firebreather bot skin for scavotron.  I love the last set and turned. Lot of my house in to a Firebreather Post.  Maybe a floor tile with a hole in it and a pile that extends to the floor below?  Gas mask-less fireman hats would be cool too.
---
And maybe, just for like, an hour, the Fireman Outfit in the atom store.  Its drop rate is literally killing me.  I cant keep farming forest/valley events anymore.
---
A challenge against my own stupidity is one that I will never win.
---
Lvl 5 nw Lazer and red dresses everywhere and countless other dupers handing out legacy's or selling them out of their vendors 
---
&gt;Because when everyone is super no one will be
---
What exactly does not even half mean? 15-20 out of 50 people is still a ridiculously high amount. Even 10 out of 50 would be too many. If you're friends with that many cheaters, it's very likely that many more of your friends were also involved. Muling for, reselling for, or just taking too many freebies from the cheaters is still getting people flagged for suspensions, and rightfully so tbh. It's based on recent activity, not just inventory, I collect many bugged or unique items and neither me nor any of my other collecting friends have been hit. Even a guy claiming to have some dev room stuff like a nuka quantum paddle ball hasn't been hit
---
Yes lore reasons. Jet is invented by Myron, a char in fallout 2, long after this.
---
I killed one accidently with spray while trying to save someone's camp from being torn apart by super mutants. I felt so bad... Poor Brahmin.
---
He ain‚Äôt a child, but he is innocent. I really hope you don‚Äôt carry this level of pessimism throughout your life. It‚Äôs not healthy to systemically not believe 100‚Äôs of people pretty much blindly. 
---
But you get what you put into the world, I have no doubt this kind of attitude eventually will catch up to you, we all need people to have faith in us at some point in our life.
---
Was it an inventory check?
---
I just use a tesla for this
---
I propose the formation of a coalition for the implementation of a shipping container building set. We have to put the pressure on them! We can make this happen if we stand together under one unified banner of shipping container implementation!
---
Nobody knows what flagged people, and I doubt you get the full story out of people banned
---
Sorry for your loss, but glad you have a positive outlook. Hope you get that 7600 hours achievement here soon too! Lmk what comes after lol.
---
takes like 20 seconds ya gonk
---
*"Thanks, we'll let the development team know!"*
---
*"We'll pass this up the chain!"*
---
*"We're looking into this issue!"*
---
**That's what you'll get. And all you'll get.**
---
I haven't been affected (yet) and feel so badly for those getting hit by this over and over again... but honestly Bethesda will do nothing other than "fix" it. RNGesus help us when they do.
---
He bursts out from the computer/television screen and kills you instantly while giving you that blank stare in the process
---
Clearly the folks buying the guns and selling the guns are not banned. I don‚Äôt care what your personal beliefs are, but you cannot claim there is no proof when you refuse to look at the proof right in front of you.
---
There is an industry that this ban wave did not successfully disrupt, and that is not an opinion, but a fact
---
And there it‚Äôs. Turn it into a personal attack about how heartless and terrible I am because I won‚Äôt think of all the poor innocent kids that can‚Äôt play fallout for week. 
---
You‚Äôre putting bullshit and lies out there. So consider you‚Äôre own words as applied to yourself.
---
Yeah everyone keeps saying you can get banned for trading for items? Doesn‚Äôt seem rifht. I traded all my best guns (jffr250 hm, JE fixer, bff15r combat rifle and a stimpak diffuser plan) for a b2525 fixer and a be radium before i really knew what was going on. Keep thinking I‚Äôm gonna get suspended and lose like my whole inventory for a half decent trade.
---
Fuck ghouls. And certain Major/Colonel Handys have an anti armor cannon that rapes you, no lube.
---
nice when console players don't have to worry about scripting players and rampant hacks. always feel validated in my choice to not play on PC when i hear people talk about those issues.
---
Yeah, Eitehr the last patch, or two ago. TBF it kinda messes up my 4v4's group, but i guess it had to be done
---
Pretty sure we had squirrel scout badges datamined a year ago, many of us assumed the bow/compound bow would come with those. It would be nice, as much as people complained about them, those challenges were a good way to kill some time with more goals. They also encouraged many new play styles
---
Was logged out yesterday before the reset, and all but 1 of my dailies were already completed.
---
Was logged out today before the reset and my dailies are fine.
---
No rhyme or reason to this bug.
---
Players who kill brahmin should be banned.
---
Yeah it's overall just Bethesda being very slow with their communication and very vague. Ive dealt with other companies that were very fast and helpful with their replies. They probably have most of their resources focused on other projects which leaves FO76 to the wayside.
---
I feel relieved. The past 3 major updates all contained hard to get grinds that I wanted to do, but was discouraged by the rapid spread of various cheats. The cheaters were prospering without bounds. I feel better having played fair. I dont have a bloody explosive ultracite gattling laser, and that is ok.
---
Please enlighten me on the justification that was made.
---
Ha!
---
I already hit the build limit on my massive camp anyways. So I don't need wood. Lol
---
My friend never duped, in fact he hasn‚Äôt even been online for the past week. And he was banned today for no reason.
---
Well I guess I just don't understand it then.
---
I would never exploit, cheat or dupe on a video game.
---
Sure does. Almost need to try and get yourself killed sometimes lol.
---
I love how big and plushy it is. I have a couple in my camp as well. I have one surrounded with all the other plushies.
---
What the hell
---
No personal attack. I hope the best for you. I hope you don‚Äôt carry the attitude you have here, into your personal life. 
---
By the way, calling someone a liar based on absolutely nothing, is a personal attack? So really who is attacking who here
---
Blocking you now, no need to cross paths again. Wish you the best
---
Yeah lol I actually love it. Still doesn‚Äôt make up for the fact that apparently the dark matter skin doesn‚Äôt go on fixers smh.
---
They cheated for some instant gratification in an online game, of course they're too immature to take responsibility for their actions lol. What would you expect?
---
Bring on the squirrel scout!
---
Hhhm?
---
justifying desire and entitlement doesn't change the fact that you cheated and broke the rules and contributed to balance destabilization. feel shame
---
Just in general since your comment lacks basic compassion and empathy. Enjoy your day.
---
I never said people weren‚Äôt still selling on eBay. I never said it isn‚Äôt still going on. I never said denied it.
---
'A couple' is an understatement for me
---
Different guy but I could use some tips sometime. What's your plan? Mines kit_cloud
---
I'll have to look up the excavator power armor. Thanks
---
yah prob to do wit range drop off is 204 to 96 for rof increase from mid 90s to 120s
---
Yeah that's pretty annoying :/
---
Correct. No sympathy for the devil.
---
I‚Äôm attacking you. Because I don‚Äôt believe you.
---
I hunt wanted people and I also take the loot.
---
Will see have fast you could craft b2525 item for your friend
---
I don't think the Secret Service would know who The Enclave is, but the Enclave would definitely know who they are, considering the resources Vault 79 is sitting on. The Enclave would also know that they existed in close proximity to a major asset that had gone offline. Considering there's no evidence that the Vault lost communication capabilities, just lost the ability to access those systems for \~26 years, they'd seem like the obvious route to take for investigating the fate of the Congressional Bunker, especially given their frequent contact with new members who've gone through the automated promotion system there. Plus, MODUS has most likely made contact with them, given that he seems to make contact with new entities (example being the Army, who mentions his prior communications). While MODUS is unable to contact other Enclave facilities, his short-range comms do seem intact.
---
There are plenty of other games out there you can play with your friends. They can get new accounts like many of the cheaters have already done. Some people have been suspended unjustly and are waiting for their tickets to be processed so they can play again, so kindly don't clog up customer support tickets with this trollbait though
---
One of these tasty terror trucks scared the crap out of me at my last SBQ fight. Came out of nowhere.
---
OP is taking about the actual Resource Collector from the Munitions Factory Workshop. Players have found a way to build it at camps.
---
Seems extreme lol.
---
facts
---
Maybe I would make a camp with a sheepquash on a podium with flags while having plushies turned toward the podium waiting for the command to take over the wasteland.
---
scorched shouldn‚Äôt even have fucking guns. How the hell do they retain knowledge on firearm handling. but if they didn‚Äôt then i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd have crazy melees like ghouls
---
Wait... How is this game breaking?
---
 I know that if I was inclined, I too could look up the exploit and participate. But I respect the community, I respect the RNG and the grind for what it is, and I don't want to be banned. So I don't. 
---
I agree with the others: just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
---
Ok at first I hated this idea but I think I‚Äôm coming around to it. I really wish they‚Äôd implement more of a enchantment type system where you could pick the weapon and primary and the secondary and tertiary rolls were rng. I‚Äôve seen this on elder scrolls blades so it‚Äôs not foreign to Bethesda
---
I've gone higher charisma on my bloodied melee; S15 P3 E5 C8, etc. The reason is alcohol buffs. Adrenaline is seriously the best, you'll want nerd rage and serendipity. Blocker is the best defensive in strength. Maybe one  bostering armour and the option for sneak perk loadout in agility. Don't be afraid to use vats sometimes for molerats and others, it can be amazing in certain circumstances so luck shouldn't be totally ignored.
---
Mirelurk kings are by far the worst in my opinion.  If more than one of them is running towards me I just say screw it, not wasting a bunch of stimpacks and will take the death.
---
See you say this but history has shown time and again in this sub that people who complain about being wrongfully banned usually end up being rightfully banned. 
---
Remember 900 hours guy who made it to main stream games media? Scratch the surface a little and people quickly saw that dude was full of shit and deserved his ban.
---
It's no different with the vast majority of these bans.
---
Woo ya!! Squirrel scouts!!
---
You‚Äôre assuming way to much. How can you make critical assumptions about someone personally like that? You can‚Äôt. Lol I don‚Äôt even need to defend myself here you literally tried to compare slavery to an exploit in a video game. I think you need to rethink your thought process. I can 100% say I‚Äôm not surprised about the consequences. I didn‚Äôt know what they would be but am not surprised. I also have never said rules don‚Äôt apply to me. You‚Äôre literally making stuff up at this point lol. I definitely do not have entitlement issues. Big deal I used an exploit that hurt no one and didn‚Äôt cause I single person inability to play a game. Was it wrong? Sure it‚Äôs against the rules but it‚Äôs not morally wrong like you‚Äôre trying to idiotically make a comparison to slavery.
---
A few shots from an energy weapon could quickly change that. Or really any weapon. BoS just sucks at making armor to protect against energy weaponry.
---
Is there duping on Xbox?  The only thing I‚Äôve ever seen is 6 working vendors.
---
All hail king sheepsquatch
---
It means no sympathy where it is not deserved. 
---
 The cheaters knew exactly what they were doing.
---
Aw fuck does that work? Here's me wasting 0.50 bullets when I could just be using my explosive shotgun. I didn't think it's aoe would be large enough.
---
And that's your opinion and beliefs but understand not everyone has the same. It's easy to say your opinion is right but it's may be beneficial to attempt to understand all sides. Again not saying duping is good for the game or was the right thing to do.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of level &lt;10s
---
Lol I hated this grind. To each their own
---
wait what the actual fuck? well that explains why i was confused since ive never seen it done yet
---
You learn this lesson as a child on Halloween, what were you expecting to happen?
---
I know right lol. Then they go on using the aae lasers and handmades like nothing happened.. smh
---
All that matters is Bethesda shares my opinion. Whether you like it or not it happened.
---
 I personally am glad it happened.
---
If only Bethesda hired more QA testers, they might make good applicants. :)  
---
Instead, they're like... Sith.
---
Reminds me of counter strike back in the day,  we used to put a dot on the monitor so shooting from the hip was as accurate as aiming.
---
How do you get the pumpkin paint?!
---
I‚Äôll make pretty good bank off my vendors. I price my mags at 35 caps and I‚Äôll get a spree spender.
---
Ah that sucks man. Hope you get your problem solved fast and thanks for the help!
---
Not for me. But my friend had been bugged for a week we‚Äôre when he talks to Ward, the quest auto completes and he doesn‚Äôt have to actually go get the item. Lucky bastard!
---
They're never going to catch 100% of them, but if you check some of the cheating discords, there's definitely mass panic going on. Some of them got so comfortable with bethesda doing fuck all that they duped on their mains, and many of them got banned. It seems like pretty much all of the sales accounts got banned, and many of the mules/mains associated with them, but there are still more waves going out so maybe they will get caught too. It's true that the damage is already done, but if nothing else, such a strong handed approach will help deter more cheating in the future, which is something they should have done back in january 2019. Better late than never though. If they also delete a majority of the duped items after the ban wave, they can salvage the situation fairly well compared to past occurrences
---
He was trying to be witty but failed miserably lol
---
Oh it makes perfect sense my guy, ATOM SHOP$$$$$, if they just give us everything how would they make money ya know ! I will say I wish they're were more NEW in game plan drops for building sets n what not but you can pretty much guarantee 90% of anything that was a building asset in FO4 will eventually make it to 76 it's just gonna be a slow and painful process so they can filter it thru the atom shop and make them dolla's
---
nice find, would ya share the location?
---
A few months ago the speed up the gouls so they come in faster than you can aim often, and also enemies will randomly spawn behind you even after you have cleared that area...all kinda bs lazy mechanics to make it harder.
---
Again there was never a justification made claiming that you should because you could. Only a statement that I also believe the developers made a mistake allowing it to go on for so long. That's not me saying people should've duped because it was there. Just that mistakes were made on both sides. Also none of this was related to the OP which was how do you think bethesda will handle this, not do you believe duping is right lol.
---
There are areas of the Forest you could nuke such as Morgantown. I didn't know that until the other day, and you can actually get violet flux along the river from irradiated snaptail.
---
That looks like a legit gas station. I'd totally buy a burrito from you
---
I am in his circles. Me and a couple of my close friends did participate in the dupe. We have essentially every god roll in the game because we were huge traders. Yes I own up to my ban but it's sad that we risk it because of the static gameplay that exists in 76. Literally nothing to do in the game. Same reason people mod games. Bethesda knows their game is riddled with bugs and glitched and hasn't fixed even the ones that have been since beta .. fast travel bug trade glitch etc
---
Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about it's consumer, as long as they're selling atom shop skins ( oh btw half the skins they sell for money came from modders on PC ((cheaters to you))
---
I dont no man I made almost 20k in one day (also on xbox) it forced people to start buying legit items again
---
They have their hands full dealing with a massive ban wave right now. I don't think there has been any official announcement about it, but it's safe to assume they are pushing it back. They might also be waiting to fix the auto-complete issue before letting people buy tiers, it would look really predatory to let people buy the tiers that they were robbed of due to a bug
---
Raven Rock is empty save for a ZAX supercomputer who fancies presidential history and will remain so for another century and a half. Control Station ENCLAVE is still isolated by the time of Fallouy 2. So no.
---
Had the Bethesda account been banned before this, with any other Bethesda game?  
---
As funny as it is. . . It really sucks too!
---
Dupers prolly knew they were duping. I'd agree with that. I do however have sympathy with people who put days of time into a game and give in to temptation once to lose it all. It would be sad, and in my opinion I'd be sad to see so many people be forced out of the game. Again not defending the action of duping since so many ppl think that's what this is.
---
You posted so much over the past day or so saying you didn't dupe just to admit you duped when you got banned. Why lie, it's not like any normal person on here has the power to ban you.
---
Server lag. Log out and log back in
---
They just wanted to be raiders :(
---
It's also annoying when you bulk up a bunch of stuff to sell, then remember that you have to repair something and it breaks down the stuff you just spent plastic to bulk (despite the mats being available elsewhere). I keep catching myself w/that one.
---
I'm glad to see that Bethesda delivered.
---
Made almost 20k what? Caps? That‚Äôs not surprising if you‚Äôve got good stuff for sale. I have never had any trouble making caps at all. But if you‚Äôre on Xbox you can‚Äôt deny the servers are dead except for low levels who just got it on game pass.
---
it‚Äôs not healthy to blindly believe people either
---
Get both. Herd mentality needs a team, even of 1 so you get boost regardless. 
---
Empath you count as your own teammate (but you need a second teammate for it to trigger). Worst case on a team empath does nothing. Class freak/ strange in numbers gives 8% extra damage and 33% DR for net of 25% DR.
---
I haven‚Äôt really played with the converter, but can you only do 12 bullets at a time?  Then go through load screens?
---
Actually i just read the ToS, this is listed:
---
ZeniMax will not refund any fees or prorate fees for any Membership except where a refund is required by applicable law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1).
---
That means likely there are many places within the world, where they would have to provide a refund.
---
Hate to break it to you but that's really not all that matters, but go off.
---
Hop servers.  I had that message pop up a couple of months ago and om more than one occasion.  Hopping servers fixed it.  No idea what caused it though.
---
Pfft, and I thought us gamers were childish
---
No not that im aware of his only other bethsda game is on console
---
Noobs don‚Äôt go to stores though... I‚Äôm level 48 and I just discovered stores.
---
Its cheating not cheated, since it didnt stop.
---
I explained why and I dont care about ‚Äùbut‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs an event, wish I could remember the name, were you shoot down a Vertibot. I‚Äôm useless.
---
This breaks established lore, the Brotherhood in Appalachia is dead and if the Lost Hills Expedition is meant to not be wiped out or completely cut off from the Western Brotherhood by the "end" of Fallout 76 then they will not known of the Enclave's existance since Fallout 2 clearly states the Brotherhood had no clue of the Enclace's existance.
---
I want to be able to get more Tadpole badges. I completed the challenges and there are no ways to get more that I'm aware of. Possum, yes, not tadpole.
---
This sub doesn‚Äôt allow bartering posts.
---
Fly Swatter
---
Swat a fly or something like that. It‚Äôs not named that but close.
---
Yes thank you! I‚Äôve only done it once!
---
Try useing damage perk cards take me like 20 shots with a non legendary handmade
---
This is speculation not based on any actual lore.
---
Do those carry nuclear keycards as well? I‚Äôm just baffled as to how ridiculously resilient this thing is lmfao. What I assumed would be a quick quest has turned into a grinding chore. It‚Äôs unreal.
---
It's not an "in-game mechanic", it's an **exploit**. Call it what it is.
---
Fucking apologists, man.
---
I'm doing it right now on PS4 and came across this after Googling if it's supposed to be littered with corpses. It's definitely a bug. So far a handful of robots and a bunch of corpses with nothing to loot. I've only seen one random Blood Eagle.
---
This blows.
---
Also armor mods matter. I still prefer Secret Service as its easier to roll a good one as you can craft them yourself and choose which part you want. But other armor types can have shadowed armor mod for more stealth and deep pocket/ultralight for more carry weight.
---
Why do you asume pa is ment to be end game
---
Try a stealth build for extra damage
---
You killed me with the second line i‚Äôm crying
---
From ToS:
---
FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.
---
So other law trumps their TOS when it comes to refunds depending on where you live.
---
Postponed until a later date.
---
I have all commando perk cards and an exploding rifle.
---
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. 
---
But nice try.
---
What they said. Re-login to same server or hop.
---
Welcome. It's a nice one for "complete events" challenges too, as it only takes a few seconds to shoot it down. It's always in the Ash Heap.
---
I keep getting them from my gold dailies. I scrap them all but I dont think I have learned the "barbed" mod yet on any of my characters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è didnt even know it was a thing til I saw one in a vendor
---
It has been postponed.
---
Yes it definitely sucks for them that they lost so much time and energy. By doing something that's wrong and against the rules you take a risk of getting caught. There's consequences for your actions. The consequence in this case is your account being banned or suspended and/or stripped of all possessions.
---
 I am 100% confident my account will never be banned because I knowingly don't break any rules. I understand that my actions have consequences.
---
Now they hopefully will too and learn from their mistakes.
---
Bethesda being inconsistent with this game? Crazy.
---
The vats it boom dead
---
I‚Äôve never put a single point into stealth lol. Is there an easier way to get one without having to hunt it down?
---
Sounds like new players to me. You guys are all the same. New players coming in high and mighty like you all have never tested a game before.
---
 We have been around since the beginning and dealt with the glitched bugs and trash of a game 76 was throughout it's career.
---
  Bethesda literally told us to break the game back then LITERALLY. They ingrained in our heads to find exploits so of course people will take advantage of them. 
---
They took our most prided weapons away because they're too lazy to develop stable enough servers so their course of action is to remove explosive from tons of weapons.
---
You can say ruining the game all you want but it is the greed and laziness of Bethesda that is letting this game be ruined. Games that land in gamepass are trash games that couldn't handle being in a competitive market until they're old and shelved for discounts. 
---
After you get bored of 1000s of SBQ and encrypted and have all god roll armor and weapons you'll start to somewhat understand why people wanted to spread out all those je plasmas and lasers to people who would never afford one.
---
You guys are just egotistical white knights who pride themselves off the backs of the martyrs of an unjust greedy game company.
---
That‚Äôs where I get. 5000 caps and atom or something. 1000 caps a scrip.
---
What you're experiencing is a good thing. Shows that there are "legit" challenges in the game.
---
Though having said that, these "legit" challenges aren't challenges at all for a lot of people. They're an afterthought that barely registers since they can even blow through the toughest opponent in fractions of a second.
---
Trash
---
Well damn. I was making myself bananas trying to figure this out! Thank you so much for the snappy response!
---
I‚Äôve used lvl 50 missile launchers with max crit damage. I‚Äôm lost.
---
Does this work with other farmable like tatos and razorgrain?
---
Thanks for letting me know. I was going nuts trying to figure it out!
---
You can get in through a glitch but you can‚Äôt pick any of it up
---
Missile havent done damage in a fallout game since new vegas so you should have expected that
---
Have you specialized a certain build? Just being level 100 doesn‚Äôt prepare you for some of the games challenges. It really helps to go for a specific build that you prefer to play and maximize it.
---
How many items do you carry on your character? Like how many different weapons and armor pieces?
---
Very true. But with unyielding those things don't matter. You will have more than enough carry weight (+15 str) and you can sneak successfully even without sneak perk (because of high agility).
---
Yep! If you see a brahmin at a player camp milk it. You can get up to a total of 5 milk. Each milk is -25 rads. If your bloodied or trying to manage the amount of rads you carry, it's a great way to keep your health in check without going too crazy with the rad away. It pretty much offsets the rewards you get from food or collecting water or the occasional rad hit you might receive. If you're a low level, it's great bc itll help you to keep the rads away if you're running low on supplies.
---
You are right, but I wasn't replying to OP. I was replying to:
---
Game breaking exploit - it's so not, don't be dramatic
---
No excuse for leaving it in for 5 days - sure there is: A) avoiding disabling vendors or displays or whatever this dupe is and trusting the community not to abuse it. B) you don't just flip a switch and 'fix the code' these things take time.
---
Mistakes on both sides: sure, one side broke the TOS, and the other side didn't ban them fast enough.
---
YEAH! Seems like every time it comes up for me, I don't have to actually do anything; Ward always just thanks me for finding whatever was missing.
---
So uhh what part are we gonna mount though
---
Yes I love killing the sbq with my nuka paddle ball
---
You are right, critical thinking is very important in a time like this. 
---
Critical thinking time: do you think every person who was banned is a bad person? Do you think every person who wasn‚Äôt is innocent? 
---
A mob mentality suppresses the truth, and the truth of this situation is somewhere in the middle. Yes innocent people got banned, bad people got banned, bad people did not get banned. 
---
Everyone can put down their pitchforks and agree on one thing, bethesda Austin has had many problems with this project, and if they have an opportunity to fix a bug, they should take that opportunity. Look at how divisive this has been for the community. Surely there is a better way.
---
Do cheaters deserve to be punished? Sure! Should there be a sliding scale on punishment? Yeah! Not every person did the same crime, but everyone is facing the same uncertainty.
---
‚ÄúThey left it up for five days so it should be ok to dupe‚Äù
---
Completely random
---
They fly over pleasant valley quite often so you can go there and see if any are around.  If you see one, focus on the engines if you are able.  It slows down drastically for each engine lost, eventually coming to a near full stop.
---
A long time ago I used to use a two shot missle or a long single shot rifle that you can find in the crashed plane in the bog. 
---
They do the job with little ammo usage. The problem with missiles is that if you try to shoot at something far away with them with lock on they tend to do a lot less damage if you would shoot them when their close. 
---
That is my experience when I was a newb though.
---
All that matters to me*
---
 Forgot a couple words.
---
I'm never going to say intentional duping is okay or right. I'm just saying Bethesdas decision to ban the people who grew the game were told to break the game and now are losing 1000s of hours of game play and testing time for the company to just drop them. It's just pathetic business practice. They are hypocrites and deserve to branded as such.
---
Damn, so thats why i found like 1 legendary ghoul
---
Who knows. I guess we'll have to see what Bethesda does with the story they are trying to craft. As far as I can remember MODUS is cut off from the rest of the Enclave and between 2103 to 2172 there isn't, as far as I can find, anything related to the Enclave until they find the Mariposa Military Base.
---
So in theory Bethesda could write into the lore that The Enclave sent out expeditionary forces sometime after The Brotherhood did. 
---
Would be interesting to see.
---
First up, you are soft capped to level 50 so that's the point of comparison when it comes to enemy levels. Also this game shouldn't be compared to FO4, they are very different beasts. 76 is a lot more rigid in how well builds work. You mention power armor and a handmade, those are a bad combination. Rifles work better with vats, which is terrible to use with PA. Stealth and rifles is way stronger.
---
 Perks and effects play a far greater role in defense than DR. Ghouls do hit hard so you need to mitigate that with something like blocker or ghoul slayer armor or, better still, pop those sucker in the head before they get close.
---
 Totally agree about low level scorched. Pretty much any ranged enemy has far too much range and accuracy.
---
Okay so the issue is players in public groups who dc and come back into the same server.
---
The dc player does not pass the workshop to any other player since that's how the public groups work and instead retains it but during his time away his icon is removed.
---
And here I am, seeing a claimed workshop on the map, only to go there and find out that the player icon was just there but the owner left already.
---
Are we sure it's not the nightkin?
---
Don't know if it cause there are loads of new players taking up space, but yeah only bout 5 over level 70s on each map if lucky took quite a while to kill SBQ had to pull out bffr plasma just to finish her off
---
Can ya cripple the Snallygasters too, or do ya just kill em?
---
numbers are split between steam and bethesda.net also there are ps4 and xbox playerbases :V so 10k is unaccurate as fuck
---
The L E G
---
Does it have windows?
---
The A R M
---
Yeah it is random but I have noticed they can spawn similar magazines nearby.
---
I for one welcome our new teat overlords.
---
I‚Äôd like to remind them that as a trusted redditor I can easily help supply them with forced labour for their suckling facilities
---
Grew the game?  By flooding the economy with duped items?
---
I don‚Äôt see that as ‚Äògrowing the game‚Äô, at least not in any positive manner.
---
&gt;Wasn't defending duping. I was stating that I also think leaving this up for 5 days was a mistake on devs end. If they care enough to wipe a chunk of the player base they should've cared enough to do something when it got their attention on Thursday. There's two sides.
---
Just sitting here wondering where that quote came from. Simply said nothing but I thing the devs made a mistake leaving it over the weekend. Never defended duping actually. You probably also quote FB articles by the headline.
---
I also notice that with my lvl 10 pump shotgun that I can kill lvl 40 moleminers in one shot in VATS but takes 7 shots otherwise. (I am lvl 33 and get tired of repairing my lvl 25 legendary  shotty.)
---
Ooh okay that makes sense. Thanks for lmk. They should correct that
---
Better idea, wait for it an ARM chair
---
Stealth of any kind with just about any weapon is a one or two shot for ghouls even if unspec'd. In PA generally you can just ignore ghouls with a decent build and emergency protocols.
---
But any non stealth or one quick shot build is going to be harder. Just like IRL. Much quicker fight with surprise.
---
I do the same.
---
Crit does not work on explosive weapons. You only get the perfect accuracy you get from using it.
---
Two shot does 100% extra damage if only it‚Äôs on explosive weapons.
---
Edit: not explosive legendary effect.
---
I was banned. I didn‚Äôt dupe myself, but I‚Äôm damn positive that I received duped weapons. I‚Äôm pissed, and don‚Äôt want to lose my friends either. Stay strong bud.
---
Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
I think the cap bounty comes out of your pocket too.
---
I actually have a locked room in my camp with a bunch of display cases jammed in it, not to actually display stuff for others, but simply because it's the only way to prevent stuff getting scrapped, it's dumb.
---
Is this an exploit or working within the engine? Dont wanna get banned for exploits. And I'm only being 50% sarcastic....wheres the line?
---
I dont even know what to say other than i need it
---
Add endgame first.
---
It's insane that this hasn't been implemented yet. Collecting unique junk items has been a popular aspect of every Bethesda game since Morrowind, and Bethesda is surely aware of this. Maybe they figure it'll add longevity to the game if we all keep having to venture out on expeditions to collect our 100th gold tie Mr. Fuzzy that was auto-scrapped yet again.
---
Opportunists. You know, the ones that jack up the prices on natural resources, world pandemics, and toilet paper shortages. Karma...she‚Äôs my hero!
---
Right. So what you are saying is steam is not an accurate representation of the PC player base. I agree
---
I don't dupe myself cause I don't follow these vids and I don't even know how but I always failed to grasp people's motivation/ sense of satisfction in getting other people banned for duplicating items in a video game. I'm not talking about people capitalizing on massive dupes and earning RL currency , a completely different subject. I'm talking about people "cutting corners" as you put it.
---
Seems so petty. Is duping against TOS? F\*ck yeah. Do they do it at their own risk? Sure. Should they be banned? Honestly, I don't care. Should they accept the ban? Probably, if they did it with intent. I'm indifferent to it.
---
You contradicted yourself y in your statement, though. One one hand you say
---
"most people here find the game enjoyable"
---
and then you add
---
"Most people who play MMOs always want to find a shortcut to do shit faster"
---
So maybe the artificially prolonged grind isn't as enjoyable as one may think? If it was enjoyable people wouldn't find shortcut to skip a boring ball ache of a grind, right?  If you truly enjoy RNG in fo76 ie killing thousands upon thousands of enemies over and over again, you have every right to do so. Some people just enjoy the grind and that's fine with me. But trust me, most people have their limits in which a game starts to feel like a 2nd job and that's why duping is such a problem in fo76
---
I mean there were tons more from 4 to 76 but like it seems in general when the old creators of Fallout were gone there were definitely some things lost in adaptation (as expected)
---
I can accept this
---
I remember back at launch how much of a pita it was to get these plans.
---
Be nice if we had a decent display with more slots too
---
This has happened to me on occasion. Usually self resolves by hoping. I love burrows... My favorite place on the map and I go there a number of times a day.
---
That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.
---
Please list a few
---
This would definitely be handy.  
---
Currently, I have three blueprints I use as components that work across all workshops I activate:
---
1. Enclosed Fusion Generator 
---
2. Two turret guard tower with Large Electrical Connector
---
3. Two turret guard tower
---
But it sure would be nice to have an entire workshop blueprinted to just churn and burn.
---
I dont care what you use, as long as you didn't cheat to get it. It used to be amazing to meet someone with any explosive weapon. It became "i know how they got that" which is not as cool.
---
What a well rounded opinion. Oh wait it's not. Just the same statement made 10000 times. I understand y'all want dupers banned. That's why I didn't ask do you want them banned. And as for the dev thing it's a fair point you've made. But they've shut it down in the past due to duping was just wondering why not this time. But your right Bethesda does nothing wrong and never betrays it's player base.
---
Feel free to interpret damage how you wish. I‚Äôd be interested in hearing both.
---
61 as of last night
---
Crit damage works on my explosive handmade and fixers, have never had a problem with them.
---
Same here. So frustrating. I really need that helmet, too. It is the first one I have found so far.
---
The advantage is the player who dced won't see you claiming the workshop.
---
The dc player icon will come back if they manually visit the workshop
---
Excluding legendary effects
---
Most of the modern online games like this that I play have some kind of "lock" feature that flags the item not sellable/discardable. ESO even requires a type-in confirmation to make alterations like enchantments to a locked item.
---
On pc, push the caps lock button to talk.
---
There's no better time than right now to mass purge all legacy explosive energy weapons. They just alienated a large majority of folks who value them, by either banning them or their buddies. But they won't.
---
Same I'm literally doing 100 events a day all over  the map for the rewarded outfits got the Western out fits both of them and responders helmet so far but that is like over 3 month of every day hardcore grinding and not the good drops grr
---
What they should do is when season one ends you shouldn‚Äôt be able to earn score to advance, but when season two comes around the game board just keeps going and you start where you were in season one. Once you get to rank 100 in season one‚Äôs game board you go to rank one of season two. Maybe with the previous seasons rank up requirement lowered.
---
Finally think we are in agreement.
---
Oh whoops
---
Try resetting the world or different server
---
also try dying and respawning
---
I'm avoiding everything from player vendors with the exception of fusion cores and junk like Bulk Steel.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about that. Only missile, nukes and Grenade launchers
---
My Bloodied (and Mutated) Gunslinger is kicking, especially as I don't actually have any Bloodied pistols atm. My go-to is a Quad Suppressed Pipe Revolver but a surprise is just how effective a basic Suppressed Pipe Pistol can be, or a Recon 10mm. Can't wait to eventually get true Bloodied weapons for the build and see just how far I can push a 'useless' build.
---
Do you even play Fallout? 
---
I remember when you could get legendary loot off non legy enemies and Bethesda ripped that from us. 
---
I remember when you got 3 star loot from 3 star enemies. Bethesda ripped that from us.
---
I remember when you hit explosive on the best weapons in the game. Bethesda ripped that from us.
---
I can guarantee you use an item that is a preferred roll for a specific build. How often have you looked a weapon or armor that you actually used for more than a little trial period. The game is near impossible to have a specific armor set or weapon roll. 
---
I can already hear the, WeLl iTs sUpPoSeD tO bE hArD tO gEt gOoD sTuFf. 
---
They're selling level ups for legendary run.
---
They sold unstoppable outfits that gave HP buffs.
---
They sell scrap and repair kits.
---
They don't care about you anymore than you really feel good about using your own looted stuff. Drop the charade.
---
Bethesda did this to themselves.
---
XP boosters. Give you (and anyone nearby when you open it) a +25% boost in XP for an hour, plus a small "party favor" like +10 rad resist, +5% damage vs a creature type, etc. They stack, too, but the XP boost is bugged and reverts to 0% if you stack it more than four times.
---
It gives you a temporary boost to XP gain. Also applies to any player in close proximity.
---
I think they just give you an exp boost for a little bit and some random little effect like confetti kills. And using it near people gives them a bonus too
---
Things are still being scrapped out of display cases, just a warning.
---
Is ‚Äúyou dig‚Äù a garden pun? I think so! I laughed, anyway!
---
Gotcha, misunderstood when you said explosive I figured you meant all explosive since you didn't specify what explosives you were meaning.
---
You can read more in the next issue of Wasteland Homes and Gardens, where I discuss just who the hell Bethesda thinks they are not implementing my ideas.
---
When there are lots of people around you like when doing uranium fever, use one and everyone will like you
---
I‚Äôm saying broooo they have legit a 900mm cannon
---
Ty!
---
Most effective?
---
I'd say melee
---
Additional, I'd love to have a "Scrap All" feature for the workshop, to get rid of the last owner's plethora of randomly placed Level 1 turrets and small generators.
---
&gt; The reason for this message is Bethesda Games has stolen my friends from me with this recent ban wave 
---
Stolen? Please...
---
If your friends didn't dupe, they'd still be there.
---
This post equates to blaming a store for making it too easy for thieves to rob the place so the store should take responsibility for the thieves breaking the law. 
---
It's a ridiculous notion on the face of it. Bethesda didn't make the dupers dupe, they chose to.
---
As an aside to the above, in all seriousness if you're not doing so already, look into getting professional help to deal with your depression. Sinking your time mindlessly into any game (let alone this one) isn't healthy. 
---
Take it from someone who has been there before. You're not actually dealing with your depression issues, you're just avoiding them. Try and get some help if you're not already.
---
That's too specific and misses the point. Erase all the dupes, not just explosive energy weapons but the thousands of bloodied fire rate fixers too. Throw all the mass duped items into the fire. Ban all the RMT traders so they stop fetishizing the word "legacy" into what it currently is. And follow up on your patch notes from fucking january 2019 and fix explosive energy weapons already
---
Urgh, guess i better go check.
---
Hopefully my P2W FO1st scrap box is protecting me.
---
EDIT: Well i've lost something, no idea what, but one case has gone from four items to three. FFS.
---
Are you having trouble finding them, or destroying them?
---
In the Hide and Seek and Destroy missions, it's best to watch the blip on the map, then fast travel to cut it off. Sometimes they change course, so multiple fast travels might be necessary.
---
As long as you can land a shot on it, the cargo bot will begin to circle. If you can, shoot the propellers. When it starts to smoke, it will slow down, or just stop moving if it gets damaged enough.
---
One thing that really trips me up is when the cargo bot is going from a high elevation, like a mountain, and then a low elevation. The bot will still be flying super high up, even though I'm on the lower side of the hill. My bullets can't reach it when that happens, and the stupid thing will zip past me.
---
I want vault tech doors and walls
---
Love ya Leo. You're a good guy and a great courier. You've always cared about the community and your friends. Don't let these elitists down voted make ya feel any less of what you really are bud. ü§òüëç
---
It's just a game.
---
Amen
---
See I‚Äôve never been this salty. I don‚Äôt care what you have or how you got it. Doesn‚Äôt effect my gameplay. If I don‚Äôt have a legacy then so what. It‚Äôs jealousy and envy talking when you want other people punished for having something you don‚Äôt. 
---
I don‚Äôt lose one minutes thought worrying about how other people play or what they use. I‚Äôm focused on my game and my friends. This may be unpopular opinion but it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve played since beta. I‚Äôm 2700 hours in level 554 and no duper or anyone has stopped me from having a good time.
---
That‚Äôs terrifying!
---
And it has a 3 second timer before you can deconstruct the items before you do it
---
Anyone get hit today ? Or is Bethesda done for now ?
---
No. Just the ones from the enclave bunker. Yes, they can be tricky. A fast fire rate weapon and vats makes it much easier.
---
They make more if they squeak it out over time.
---
Nah man, thats a cash grab. Im good.
---
I know the cap but that doesn‚Äôt explain the damage output from the ghouls
---
If I'm unjustly suspended and my account is found not guilty will I be compensated for my lost potential SCORE?
---
Cuz I thought fish was a human
---
Certain shottys have "magic" effects in vats. +33% vats for one. They do obscene damage in vats.
---
Well either way stealth is going to be your friend. Vats crits plus stealth on a non legendary rifleman sniper can give up to 1500 (maybe even more) for a head shot. 
---
If you want damage per second I would go stealth commando.
---
Great XP. Great hoards.
---
No, it's just the players fault.
---
Ahaha I see thx
---
Also waiting for the Fallout 4 concrete building sets. üëç
---
No cuz Bethesda‚Äôs a b*tch
---
Yes please.
---
Also, shoot the ghouls legs and laugh as they drag themselves across the ground towards you.
---
How many is massive?
---
Buying cosmetics supports the game buying guns supports people breaking the game, but disconnect from that and the reality is both trades are money for time.  Before they removed atom grinding these were more related, you could grind dailies for atoms or grind legendaries for god rolls - or open your wallet.  The people buying either are just happy to trade work hours to save putting in game hours.  It's not cool I guess but doesn't make them idiots.
---
You just repeated what you first said.   
---
What aspects is it lacking?
---
I‚Äôve been playing Fallout for over 20 years. And been playing 76 since BETA. 
---
None of the weapons or armor I use are ‚Äògod-tier‚Äô. Currently I‚Äôm using only gear I crafted myself and doing quite well with it. 
---
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. I‚Äôm the first to criticize Bethesda on their failings. But I have absolutely zero sympathy for anyone that violated their ToS.
---
There are ways to ‚Äògrow the game‚Äô without violating the rules. So that‚Äôs a ridiculous excuse/justification.
---
Why not?
---
Yeah got one bolstering piece and 4 unyeilding. Have blocker, nerd rage and serendipity all at full points. Really impressed with the build, takes down SBs with one punch..
---
They hit hard. Also what level is your endurance? That makes quite a difference.
---
Honest question, why? You earn more than enough for every tadpole blueprint and outfit available, plus a couple extras.
---
Possibly a good work around. Mark them for 30,000 caps. Surely no one would buy it...
---
I try to do the same. After about fifty Fasnacht events, I put multiple masks in as well.
---
1200 hours, level 380. PC Beta player.  My buddy plays on ps4. He was level 120, had full unyielding ss, and a bloody everything. Made them for his whole crew. Now there is no crew.
---
I have good stuff, but I earned it. He did not. Now he can't play.
---
He messaged you so he could kill it, seems silly
---
What I meant with Beth fault was the fact they keep patching a wall with more holes you can count rather then replacing the wall in general. 
---
I know it‚Äôs to late for them to do that so that‚Äôs why I said their Partially at fault for using a wall like that.
---
What about the people who live under rocks and dont know about the presents? A newbie might just think HEY FREE STUFF
---
Yeah plus they don't even give you any good loot!
---
Unless they replace it. I‚Äôll milk, kill, repair, milk, kill and repair until I have the milk I wanted.
---
I hope your CAMP is in the Forest.
---
My best guess was to see who would use it and use that info for the ban wave to a point.
---
I have an explosive combat shotgun and 2 levels of enforcer just for leaving mobs laying around it's a great tool for my heavy build.
---
Do they not have a limb crippling system could it be that I destroyed the targeted limb?
---
yep. Bummer. it happened to me too. I lost all of my cool pics from beta, and release. I was so sad.
---
I want to build my tiny home inside one, just like in real life..
---
Wait you can reroll special stats after level 50? I thought you were stuck with it.
---
Lots of bullets and good aim
---
Absolutely I thought that too but the little ass just bashed me repeatedly while I walked around my camp until I locked the door and went afk for a bit
---
That‚Äôs the consequences for breaking the rules. But I don‚Äôt have any I‚Äôll will toward him or anyone else that duped. It just doesn‚Äôt matter to me one way or the other.
---
Recently just lost a papercutter and a food dehydrator. Before that lost a detonator, radio jammer, flight data recorder, and before that two clean mr. handy fuels. Also recently lost all the non crafted steins in the stein case. They really need to fix this shit.
---
I‚Äôd imagine you could create a ‚Äúvault‚Äù of sorts as well. Place a few un-powered vendors vendors in a locked room with the things you want to keep safe. 
---
We definitely should not have to go through these ridiculous measures to save our teddies though.
---
I sell alien cells at 20 per and they go like hotcakes
---
I'd think it would be an odd thing for a developer to do, but maybe.
---
What lamp? Pic?
---
Yea, all of the pics that I had were from the beginning. Sucks.
---
 Junk walls from Fallout 4? Finally.
---
What is the falloff after 350? I'd be happy to switch perks out if it were reasonable.
---
Angry Turtle on YouTube has tried this for us: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFpBqGWM40k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFpBqGWM40k). It looks like power armor is necessary for non-sneak bloodied builds.
---
How about a nocturnal lead pipe single star from a 3 star
---
What I don't understand why there is not a skin for every gun in cycling weekly in the shop, they would sell like hot cakes.
---
You gotta just shoot it when it's close, some of them have odd flight patterns and it's super infuriating and others will slow down near you and you should be able to burst it down. I recommend an LMG and target the boosters / engines. If it's too far away and never comes near I just give up.
---
&gt; I think you expect too much from people
---
Period.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers...
---
Not true.  All you need are 3 to 4 high levels with 50 Cals, mini-guns, or gatling plasma/laser and full heavy gunner perks.   In fact, I prefer the queen fight to last longer.  More XP, more spawns, more chances for legendaries.  
---
I rock my legendary 50 cals that I got as drops and never have any problem doing heavy damage.  I only run into problems when I'm the only high level and there are a bunch of players doing little damage.
---
Ditch the power armour except in nuke zones. Mod that handmade to full auto. Get a bunch of stealth perks. I have the same handmade and I can clear westek one or two shotting level 68 super mutants, some times I don‚Äôt even take any damage.
---
This is not critical thinking. It‚Äôs exactly what people have been talking about. The whole, yeah I duped/cheated but I shouldn‚Äôt be banned because someone innocent might get effected, and that means Bethesda is bad. 
---
And then all the stories of someone I know getting banned, who turns out only duped a little or only bought a couple weapons off of eBay that they didn‚Äôt realized were banned.
---
Think about it this way they left a really easy dupe that probably was easy to monitor who was using it in for a weekend then bam a ban wave
---
Player limit on a single server is 24. Nothing wrong with that, but by very definition, that isn't massive.
---
I think Jet is a reference to Meth.
---
Cows in the real world fart and belch methane     
---
and you can‚Äôt spell Methane without Meth  .
---
Random, but with so many magazines, getting one specific one is very rare. I finally got all the atom challenges for all the magazines at level 340 something, and I pretty much exclusively loot the same handful of spawns in the cranberry bog
---
IMO. It just depends on what you really prefer to use and what you are currently built for(in terms of Special points). I was in your same boat a while back, but ended up choosing a stealth shotgunner build. Its so much fun...with or without Vats and one shotting mobs. But I still have my hunting rifle on me at all times to use every now and then, even tho I don‚Äôt have perks into it. üòäüòäüòä
---
I'll just reiterate what others have said.
---
If you won't use it. Get rid of it. Scrap or sell. You can bulk up junk and sell it as well.
---
Watch your ammo. It adds up. Pretty quick. Toss missiles and mini nukes. No one needs any more of them. Most types are pretty easy to sell at 1c a piece.
---
Check your plans. Most are not worth anything. They only weigh .25 each, but it adds up if you're mindlessly grabbing every one you see.
---
Watch your aid. You really don't need 100 water or 300 stimpacks on you. Both are plentiful in the world. 
---
I kept legendaries for the longest time that I thought I would use, but in endgame I'm only using two pretty consistently. If it doesn't fit a build you're going for. And it's not worth much (bloodied or junkies primarily) it's not worth the storage.
---
If you're more keen on saving weapons, look into perks that reduce their weight, just be mindful that this only on your person, it returns to full weight when you drop it in your stash.
---
Also. Fallout 1st is nice. The scrap box did remove about half of the space from my stash. But I was managing just fine before that. So it is far from required. Just depends if you value your time or money more. Personally I like saving time not worrying about my stash space and micromanaging all my junk.
---
Bethesda isn't doing themselves any favours, sure. I'm sure we're agreed there. However, they're never at fault for people exploiting/duping/hacking their game.
---
You just did the equivalent of saying if that women didn't dress so slutty and revealing, that she wouldn't be raped, so it's partly her fault. Same deal. 
---
Cheaters don't have to cheat, no matter how easy Bethesda makes it for them to do so.
---
35
---
The chance to get three star items from SBQ is significantly buffed since latest patch. Quality wise it‚Äôs better but I still get lead pipe and wood armor, but hey as long as it‚Äôs three star lead pipe I‚Äôm happy.
---
It's been almost 2 years! Squeak faster!
---
If you afk it you dont have to kill anything. They will stop hitting the speaker when it's at half hp and stand there if they dont see you
---
All dupers and cheaters should be banned. Simple as that. Also, this idea that servers will be empty and game will die without them is so far from the truth. This game will strive and be rejuvenated once the trash is taken out. üëè
---
Some people are already receiving emails about their suspension being permanent. They said it can take up to a few weeks though, and since many people who clearly cheated are spamming up support tickets pretending to be innocent, it really might take months
---
Umm so you think the community liked having areas of the game disabled because of this kind of activity? I can't say I give two shits about a farcical story of *sharing gear* to people who 'cant afford it'. 
---
What about the sale of duped equipment in exchange for actual currency? You agree that exploiting a glitch should allow people to generate a personal profit off Beth's property? Do you recall acknowledging terms of service etc? 
---
Im sure this is the 'sharing' you're talking about. I don't see too many people *gifting* end game gear. I do see them selling it though in game from time to time. At exorbitant rates. 
---
Also, what about PvP where some clown uses limitless resources against you? Is he a valued addition to the community? I'm sure he's just sharing his love of being a total dickhead with everyone which we all appreciate. 
---
But yep, clearly Beth's fault. Totally.
---
Huh, thought you had to kill the first 2
---
Have mini-nukes ever been good in any Fallout? They're definitely fun but they're rather inaccurate and require you to shoot them very far away to not injure yourself.
---
Now with FO4/76, the nukes have weight so you can't just have a few dozen sitting in your pocket.
---
7
---
No. You just find the right garage door and it snaps into place. 
---
If it helps any, it's the garage door with the cartoon man on it. If it's not that, you've got the wrong door.
---
My wife and I just nuked it earlier today and didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs been nerfed as were coming back to the game from last summer. There was hardly any action, massive disappointment. So far everywhere we nuke has 10 or less enemies.
---
I found a weird looking shed out near deathclaw island. There was no camp sign on my map but it had a level 3 lock on the door. I just thought it was a locked shed, like so many locked things. No warning, insta wanted. It‚Äôs easy to become wanted accidentally, especially when lag, bugs,  or whatever prevent the game‚Äôs normal warning mechanism from working.
---
&gt;This in-game mechanic
---
Exploits are not in-game mechanics, they are malfunctions.  No one forced your friends to knowingly exploit the game for personal gain.  Fuck all the way off with this nonsense.
---
Only if we get the trailer build set too ;.;
---
An actual economy for starters.
---
Pete Hines even said its not. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Honestly that is the point, ghoul should be stealth killed most of the time since they have poor vision and only have good hearing.
---
You can try lure them away and use explosives or limb damage weapons since once they are crippled all they do is crawl or throw themselves.
---
Hmm, they also get lost easily so jumping a wall or fense really confuses them.
---
It‚Äôs in the walls section I believe mid way down. The power only lights up the rocket on top I think, maybe the lights inside. The door once placed you can just open and close it. I love the garage good luck
---
Why are you in PA &amp; using a handmade rifle? In order to get a lot of damage out of that weapon you‚Äôll need to be riflemen or commando built. Most, get a lot of damage from sneaking, which is done without Power Armor. 
---
In this game, no matter what level you are you technically u are only level 50. Because, you can‚Äôt stack on your specials like FO4. Take a deep look at your specials and perk cards, if you need help getting tanky and be able to take a punch. I can direct you in a right direction depending on what u like to use, have, etc. 
---
Ballistic Mr. Gutsy is annoying a bit as it does lot of damage - but ghouls all you need is one perk card and they become almost a no challenge.
---
Nope, would be awesome, but nope.
---
Nah, I activate the event, than hide on the roof with chameleon armor. Nothing else required
---
Ya I can see your reasoning. I should have worded it better. Didn‚Äôt mean to have it come across that way at all lol.
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking. Just invest in the shotgun. I mean, it can down a Mirelurk King in like 4-5 shots. Might as well put perks into it to make it even stronger, right?
---
Damn thats unfortunate, thanks for the response!
---
I havent even thought about using photomode, thanks.
---
All this plastic and I can't have see through walls, floors or ceilings
---
I get the logic but I think i'd be odd for a developer to want to ban their players.
---
There's a small number of locations that allow only 1 person at a time, Lowes Taxidermy another. You can wait or server hop.
---
It‚Äôs a nuclear winter reward
---
I‚Äôm going to do a new character because I‚Äôve been working and traveling around a lot so I haven‚Äôt sat down and really did a serious build but I just happened to run into some ghouls after a nuke and my handmade does good damage without any perks and it‚Äôs still a drag to kill them I mean come on. Just because I don‚Äôt have one perk card I can‚Äôt fight a certain enemy? Kinda silly
---
Do you remember what events were like? Needing to spam a quad ffr tesla for a chance at tagging a legendary? Power creep sucks, there is a reason it takes hundreds of hours to find 1 part.
---
I do middle mountain cabins for those dailies since it‚Äôs near white spring and has a level 0 lock and terminal
---
NGL out in the country we have a lot of old shipping containers.
---
Or maybe they should just make it a good weapon
---
They can be stunned really easily with most weapons to stop the ranged attack.
---
Well placed headshots and running behind cover confuses them.
---
I‚Äôm waiting patiently in hopes of the BoS update giving it to us.
---
I've learned that in the wasteland just like real life there are great people and then there are jerks like that... I just hopped off the server I was on. I did the Uranium fever event, used the taunt to let people know where the legendary was so they could pop in a shot we all got it, no issues. Then I saw Riding shotgun was going. Some dude kept going ahead of the group, when the captain spawned he almost instakilled him. Didn't even help with the rest of the event, just sat at the exit waiting for it to complete. I have many more instances of jerks in the wasteland but... why bother explaining. Some people suck...
---
The ‚Äútrash‚Äù IS taken out, and at least on Xbox, servers have been dead the past 1 or 2 days.
---
Or a one time 3 star roll at the Purveyor where you get to pick what the item is and what each of the 3 effects are. Not everyone would want a bloodied weapon but may jump at the chance for, say an AA 50/25 handmade. Or whatever else. Players choice.
---
Yea I've been in the same situation, but people just gotta be aware its part of the game (bugs and all)and not throw death threats when you lose your scrap.
---
I wonder if there are any places with power armor spawns that you can build around? It wouldn‚Äôt be your set but you could do the cosmetic aspects maybe.
---
I only ever kill them in them in the wild never at players camps. Witt the carnivore mutation and strange in numbers that's 50 carry weight from their tasty steaks. I ended up removing mine from camp because I got tired of replacing it
---
Always super rare in FO's  
---
3 and 4 both only had 2 each on the map I think.
---
I've seen 1 in 76 before but that's all.
---
Thinking the exact same thing.  Remember that guy who was posting weekly about how he wasn't actually duping but trading between accounts?  Turned out Bethesda looked into it and he was a total fraud.  Stopped his weekly whine after he was exposed
---
I'm good, someone helped me to get it done and I passed on the favour to someone else :)
---
Yes. 
---
Think of it as working your way up to a 3* Weapon because a good/perfect 3* Weapon isn't going to drop into your lap so I would rather have a 2* until I find that 3* Weapon that I'm seeking.
---
Not all and yes.
---
Yes and no. Key quest givers and certain groups are un attackable. Quests are same as fallouts now. Human NPCs. It's basically fallout 4. You can't kill players on sight without them hitting you back.
---
I'm not complaining. Only pointing something out that people get offended over it.
---
I don't believe you have to be bloodied or junkies to be viable. There's load of good builds and a bad build can do a lot. Though most will only care for the meta.  I don't know if you have tried your own build or anything but I seen load of powerful non meta builds.
---
Regardless I do agree with you. Buffing weaker builds would be a lot better than nerfering the top builds.
---
RPG part is level up get better gear until lvl 50 after that it‚Äôs to get better perks and start to finalize your build while looking for the best legendary weapons.
---
Get unique costumes and look the way you want if your into role play.
---
Pvp is only activated if you leave pacifist mode and shoot someone that‚Äôs also not in pacifist.
---
Workshops are PVP centered so if you take over someone workshop you enter pvp with that player or vice versa even if your in pacifist.
---
There are human npc and yes you can kill them all except for some of them.
---
ya you got banned for cheating!
---
They got nerfed in latest patch, their spit and slap don‚Äôt do much harm any more.
---
Most of the players probably haven‚Äôt spent any money on the game in a while. No money lost and it brings in new players because hey look some of the players who broke the game are gone
---
Unrelated, but do you join public teams? They give great advantages (XP) but you still can play on your own? I am a solo player but i always join public teams.
---
Enclave (human) Npcs are not yet in the game. However, settlers and raider NPCs were introduced a few months back and I believe you can attack/kill them on sight. As for RPG aspects, they are there, though not as prominently as in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The Settlers content update added some speech checks but again, not as critical as previous fallouts.
---
haha oh well, i didn't even think about not being able to build it. would understand with atomic shop stuff but didnt know it bled over to rewards.   
---
Thanks a ton for trying :)
---
You can fight them, I never said you couldn‚Äôt- you can fight anything you desire. I am just helping you not getting ran over by that enemy. 
---
Under STR special, if you have maxed out Blocker Perk Card [it gives %45 less damage] from melee attackers. The way percentages work in this game, it almost means you take no damage if you have Power Armor on. 
---
Again, it‚Äôs just an advice, you don‚Äôt have to take it.
---
That's why we need level locks on our vendor items.
---
My main was spared because I literally can‚Äôt use it right now, so I made a second account to try and buy/trade for some good stuff. That account I created was caught in the crossfire because it had a few legacies and a lot of mediocre non legacies that some dude I traded with gave me, which I ended up getting all of that in 2-3 days
---
I love how the loading screen comes up with the alien blaster being a powerful weapon that disintegrates enemies and yet it struggles to kill anything. Though it explains completely why they are so rare, I mean with weapons like that it's no wonder they are nearly extinct with dwindling numbers
---
My shotgun character feels your pain...but I cripple it super easy.
---
there‚Äôs 2 i know that are always there (if it hasn‚Äôt been killed already) near harpers ferry, there‚Äôs one on the bridge above the dam and one down the highway between the red rocket station and valley galleria
---
I will have to try this out, I just want the cosmetic aspect to it and never even thought of this.
---
Lol, alien blaster ammo could fall from the sky and people still aren't going to use the alien blaster or the vats unknown legendary.
---
They're fucking terrible and it's sad that there's a skin for it.
---
This is not a game for collectors.
---
Sadly, this game is very unlike any past Bethesda game. There's a lot you need to unlearn because it'll always hurt you in the end. Being a collector is one such thing that needs to be unlearned.
---
After that I screenshot all my pics just in case. I can‚Äôt add them back in to the game, but at least I can look at them.
---
I never had that issue. Like I said I‚Äôve played since beta and am 2700 hours in. I‚Äôve never had this issues that I see guys talking about with legendaries and all that. I get more than my share and most times am throwing legendaries on the ground for people to pick up just to make room or weight.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
How about we all just pitch our big expensive high quality tv‚Äôs in the trash. Buy fat bodied CRT displays that have real glass screens and just write directly on the glass with dry erase markers. It‚Äôs just as economical as putting tape on a QLED display.
---
Yeah this is werd but also good. The automatic combat shotgun is much better at free aiming while the double barrels are vats oriented.
---
Guass shotgun is a mix of both.
---
So when you say log off, do you mean press the menu button, access the profile in the top right corner and select leave world? Doesn't everyone do that anyway?
---
They were pretty fun and packed a good punch in fo3 and NV iirc. I rarely did explosives but remember having a alot of fun with mini nukes in 3
---
I loved big boy with a mirv in FO4. Carpet bombing is funnnn.
---
True he should be having an easy time power armor since you nullify the radiation damage.
---
After my experience, I either don‚Äôt target players who are wanted for only 5 caps or if they are a low level player I‚Äôll kill them quickly and leave a bunch of supplies. There‚Äôs no need to steal their junk.
---
Yeah! I managed to ruin everyone‚Äôs day even though I barely played the game after having acquired a bunch of good stuff from my friends! Also I probably don‚Äôt even know you!
---
There are also 3 level 0 locks all in one place behind the Vault Tec Agricultural center in the form of 3 green fertilizer storage containers.
---
Thanks, but why can't I hear people?
---
I've never joined a public team haha. My heart rate literally elevates when I bump into another player in game. 
---
Makes soloing events a little hard these days.
---
I've been top tier the whole time as well, I could always get mine. But at times even that was hard. It was impossible for lower levels to be involved at events at all. It was getting that way again (no queen loot etc.), so much that people justified cheating just so they could keep up with the cheaters.
---
100%.
---
But not his fault though it's his game and we all just live here.
---
You don't own the software, you just buy a license to use it.
---
There was a lot of bragging about duping or buying g duped weapons before the bans started. One guy was bragging how he buys duped flux because it‚Äôs to hard to get it in game. 
---
He gave prices and the site. Then got offended when I suggested he was the seller making a post to get customers. Started stalking me on the forums. 
---
I‚Äôm not ruling out a player took items they found or were given and got banned. But it would have to be quit a lot of those items.
---
Unless I missed a post, we don‚Äôt know what criteria Bethesda is using to decide if a person should be banned. 
---
If someone knows please post a link. Searching came up nothing.
---
Only way i could get past it was to log out and back in,it means starting outside again but tbh it doesnt take as long as you'd think
---
That's the idea
---
It's under the new white walls pieces.
---
Whoever took over the munitions factory while I was off doing events found one of those cuddly lil fellas guarding every doorway and standing watch by the ammo machine.
---
I had to flip mine multiple times before it snapped
---
A million upvotes yes!!
---
Either on launch or in one of the few updates after. By 2019 it was already gone from the loot pool
---
Double was legacied quite a while ago on many weapons. Can still drop on others but extremely rare.
---
aye. although razorgrain is rather large like mutifruit and blackberrys and you still struggle to get more than 4-6 on a tile.
---
Pretty sure the Enclave weren't indescriminate killers.... They had an agenda.
---
You're a raider my friend. They're in there too.
---
Read the TOS - it‚Äôs an online service.
---
I don't care just lemme at the fucker
---
I said how does it hurt Bethesda. They care about making money more than making a good game.
---
completely unintentional but i'll take it.
---
That‚Äôs like saying you payed for an mmo and your entitled to exploit it to ruin everyone else‚Äôs experience.
---
Exactly lol
---
If you barely play, your ban shouldn't bother you.
---
People will never understand or accept this truth.
---
No you're not! I'm having a blast doing all of the Possum ones for my endgame. Currently nearly have all of the cosmetics and camp stuff (stash box, banner, possum skirt and hat, just waiting on the backpack now) but i would like more.
---
Id like this for items, junk, and outfits I have almost scrapped my white powder js almost 10 times plus, literally one time only got saved by favourite wheel scrap message.
---
I guess if low levels had trouble it probably made them better players. I know there were times early on I didn‚Äôt get any loot from the Queen because I didn‚Äôt do enough damage and it made me make sure that I was using weapons that would next time. But that‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs fault that‚Äôs how most of these mmos are. You‚Äôre  not handed anything and it‚Äôs not the games job to hold your hand and make sure you get loot.
---
I‚Äôve had the same issue from day one. I still thinks it‚Äôs my computer. But asking how many weapons you means you think it might be related?? Do tell...
---
The Liberty Prime skin has been bugged since it released. Not the same bug you're experiencing, but the voice lines can overlap whenever you kill an enemy right as you detect them.
---
Did not realize that this happened I suppose, will need to test it out.  I did run across a few this morning that seemed pretty weak.
---
Sometimes I'm not too sure what the hell is the game design or weird server lag issues.  Had one server a few weeks back where everything was killing me in one hit and then the next server I was tanky as hell without changing anything.
---
My group and I were just talking about this! Not sure about it as a tenderizer skin as that's a unique enough weapon on its own, but to have them in the game would be awesome.
---
I started reading, saw how much you wrote and just knew it was a bunch of bull.
---
Naah people are cool. Join a public team (building teams are the best for xp bonus), equip your inspirational perk and look at the XP rolling in.
---
Strongly disagree.
---
Yup same here
---
Pix if you can make it happen! Good luck.
---
And the ones that can stealth need to go straight to hell lol.
---
You are narrowly focusing on the actual "slavery" thing when I'm talking about how it was ALLOWED through laws while not being moral. It's not "idiotic" to use an intentionally hyperbolic comparison to make a point... and I have no qualms with making that comparison. Just because something is accessible doesn't make it right to do it just because you can. And I can easily make the observations about a choice in how to respond and what you are responding about and come to conclusions that this is not the only time you (or any of the people trying to "mob" my use of intentional hyperbole) would try to bash people calling out pis-poor behaviors you engaged in. breaking the game and duping DOES hurt people... things like unlimited ammo or quantums directly affect gameplay and intended grinds and things like duping legacy weapons and spreading them around affect intended balance. Selfish notions of gain and making the game easier for you ARE entitlement issues, and you need to come to terms with that.
---
Considering over the weekend every single server I was on (Xbox) had people in pairs at vendors as one was leaving and rejoining, many had loads of dropped plans and other items nearby clearly from the presents being opened I'd be willing to bet that there are more guilty than innocent. But I've never seen so many level 2s in high level areas before so it was fun luring enemies towards the train stations
---
I think instead of bans remove legacy items remove the dupped items, nethier belong in the game. I dont blame duppers for cheating, bethsda doesnt want to fix a broken game. Real money sellers on another hand, they make these duplication glitched bad, why would 10 people want to buy a gun if 1 freind can dump them all 100 guns.
---
Wish is seen this when i was playing earlier. Noted for the next time.
---
xbox ? oh wooooo babycity3318
---
That and give me a two shot alien blaster with 50% vats damage increase.
---
There is also a magazine that makes it do 25% extra damage. Then it might match my plasma pistol.
---
No it can‚Äôt drop on any other weapons. It‚Äôs legacy.ü§°
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand, there is no experience ruining with duping Lmao. Also if there was an in game exploit that was in fact game breaking, the developers should fix it asap.
---
They give a boatload of xp buff plus a random buff (like slowed hunger)
---
Yeah use the 'rotate' to turn it 90' so it's sideways to the doorway and for some reason this works (PS4). If you try doing it 'flush' it stays red. I don't know why but I had trouble too at first.
---
Look all I‚Äôm saying is worlds strongest man more like worlds strongest ghoul and Tiger ghoul woods
---
Not sure about weapons but I know that carrying a ton of notes and holotapes in your inventory can slow the game down
---
I usually have a shop up by the legendary vendor or wayward and sell my plans that I have extra of for a cap or 2. For the "rare" ones I do like 10 caps or something. It's not much but that tiny bit allows me to get a few extra stim packs here and there.
---
&gt; let players play the way they want as long as everything they do is part of the game.
---
If you need to cheat or even use a third party hack to get it in, it's not part of the game lol
---
Insulting everybody who disagrees with you and trying some mental gymnastics to justify cheating doesn't change the fact that it's cheating and none of the real players want it here. You paid money for the privilege of getting to use their service, and then you abused it and lost that right. The fact that you paid no longer means anything, you consciously threw away those rights.
---
If you want to mess around with cheated fuckery, fallout 4 is the game you're looking for. This is an online game and it's not allowed. The fact that you were an uneducated consumer is nobody's fault but yours
---
Would honestly take me about 3 months to write a post this long
---
If they removed duped items, people who bought them or traded for them (legitimately) would be punished.
---
It‚Äôs not that bug, the bug I‚Äôm currently experiencing is the headlamp on T-65 doesn‚Äôt work but it still works on my excavator
---
are u from India?
---
I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt know how to read ü§™
---
I see.
---
what does the One Appalachia update do?
---
On my way
---
Incorrect. I got a double pipe pistol a few months ago clown
---
This is the part that i don‚Äôt understand, since beth can look at everyone‚Äôs stash on server‚Äôs end, how difficult is it for them to find the guy who has 50 legacy lasers? I understand they use mules and change ownerships etc, but in the end all those items have to sit somewhere in some mule‚Äôs stash and can‚Äôt beth run a script and single out those accounts for investigation? Also how difficult is it for beth to use an ebay account to make a purchase and find the seller? I even saw a person selling only hacked bs weapons he call ‚Äòqueen killer‚Äô such as 50 cals that shoot nukes. Can‚Äôt beth make a simple purchase and find out who they were?
---
I wouldn't bother with game pass right now, bethesda messed up and many people are plagued by a server bug that doesn't let you past the main menu. There are too many issues going on and possible "fixes" that it's not worth until they release a significant fix. Bethesda even reported that having the game on your OS drive is the main fix, which is ridiculous as it is increasingly common to have a smaller capacity ssd aside for the OS and no games.
---
TL;DR, don't bother right now, wait for fix.
---
control/entitlement issues with a lack of shame... dude, check your narcissism before it gets out of control
---
I once saw a post where a guy had a double double barrel shotgun.
---
It's okay but weird, the bullets travel so slowly so you have to fire just the right amount of bullet in vats to kill something.
---
It does lead to stupid amounts of vats crits due to overkilling.
---
But thats exactly what the duping was doing, handing them everything without the prerequisite learning. And it made crappy players. They learned nothing about cards, or buffs, spawn locations, even lucky hole,  nope, just bought unyielding bloody stuff.
---
on right now your a king
---
It ruins my experience. When I see a god roll legendary in a vendor for nothing I ignore it. I was tempted to buy it on some accounts and if I would do that then why the hell would I continue playing if I got the best gear so easily.
---
It completely ruins people joy when something they work so hard and long to get is just a piece of dirt on the ground.
---
Yeah they were always fun, they just were never very good as weapons.
---
They were fun, just not practical.
---
Have you tried punching them?
---
I should of gotten an achievement for it...
---
All those words, even big ones, and yet it all crashes down just because you stumble over the basic definition.
---
You do not buy the game, you pay for the service Beth provides. They provide the service within their terms... TOS... you should read them once and then redo your post.
---
Lol, having encounters with so many idiots through posts who just reply and comment with ‚Äúyou broke the game‚Äù, if we actually did, the entire game would‚Äôve been shut down. But it‚Äôs pretty dead now anyways, Bugthesda is awesome at killing the player base.
---
I think there are only 1-3 on The Mire main road. Pretty rare. 
---
Nightmare fuel though.
---
It's going let all enemies be your level. A level 50 sees level 50 enemies and a level 5 sees the same enemies as level 5.
---
It was prolly instigating and you read the description and stopped reading at double
---
It does
---
Yea the only time I ever took the scrap from someone is when I killed a guy who's bounty was 200 and actively harassing people, even then wasent  much.
---
Are you online?
---
Nope USA
---
You need ultra fusion cores, not plasma
---
A long time ago. It‚Äôs legacy now. Hasn‚Äôt dropped in some time.
---
private world wouldn‚Äôt let me join
---
Same here. I love it though, full interior lighting, an animated rocket flame, and two optional doors, one of the nicest atom shop things I‚Äôve ever purchased. There‚Äôs a weird glitch if you use the wide garage door where it starts closed even if you left it open when you log out, and it has that strange incorrect open/close prompt like some doors do in the world but it‚Äôs great.
---
DUPER.
---
Your best bet is out them in a vendor at max caps.
---
So let them. How they play or I guess played since they‚Äôre all banned didn‚Äôt effect me. I didn‚Äôt  not have fun because some person had a b2525 fixer or an explosive gat plasma. I literally couldn‚Äôt care less.
---
No you probably got a two-shot.
---
My new favorite one with Line in the Sand. Public teams and season really made those events much better.
---
So much for my master plan üòâ
---
I enjoyed reading this. Honestly, I‚Äôve gotten tired of all the people in this sub that act like they‚Äôre God‚Äôs gift to Reddit and have never done a single thing wrong. They‚Äôre the people that say ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt have thing, then nobody can have thing!‚Äù I have a TSE flamer. Was it duped? Yeah, ofc it was. I only bring it out for PvE stuff. I know that for the normal player that isn‚Äôt as fortunate as me to have a legacy, it just wouldn‚Äôt be fair to fight against. I use it on actual big enemies. And just like you said the Tesla is broken in regards to being overpowered when talking about legacies, we can mention another gun: A bloodied gauss minigun. One of the friends I commonly play with, almost every day, got lucky with that roll. And guess what? It‚Äôs *better* than my flamer. But it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlegit‚Äù weapon. 
---
Oh, let‚Äôs not forget about the people that are saying all the accounts that got banned this week were because they had a B2525 Fixer. I was going through my stash to trade in legendaries, and I saw I had one in there. Just completely forgot about it because I wasn‚Äôt a bloodied build when I got it, and after I became bloodied I used a handmade to really complete my Boone cosplay. Fact is, I have a B2525 Fixer, and I‚Äôm still here. 
---
I don‚Äôt even know why I mentioned that. I‚Äôm just rambling now. But OP, TL;DR: I support what you‚Äôre saying. As much hate as the self-righteous people are gonna give, I give you one upvote.
---
Then that‚Äôs not your experience, that‚Äôs just your ego. There‚Äôs a big difference.
---
its a game dawg cool the jets
---
I think you‚Äôre talking about yourself. I didn‚Äôt say I couldn‚Äôt read it. I said wouldn‚Äôt read it because it‚Äôs a bunch of bull. 
---
And I was right.
---
The problem is deciding who did it legitimately, this does stand to reckon the games grind is horrendous. If they didnt nerf rng maybe less people would need to cheat.
---
They have terms of service that you agree to when using their product..
---
It may be routine for you to exploit, most people don‚Äôt though. We don‚Äôt need to cheat.
---
Where you spawn in at your camp is a different spot from where everyone else spawns in at your camp. Barring glitches, visitors will spawn in at the same point.
---
I think Beth nerfed them because many players complained. Personally I like them what they were, the game gets very easy after you put together an effective build. Worthy enemies is needed.
---
I think it‚Äôs hard to hear people if they are far away and not looking at you. It could also be that someone just has a bad mike.
---
It‚Äôs possible you need to play with your volume settings. I think the master volume is now disconnected from chat volume, so you can edit them separately.
---
One like, one prayer. One round, one cap. Where rounds go one we go all. WRG1WGA.
---
Oh don‚Äôt remind me of that bug lol. The worst. 
---
But yeah it‚Äôs an absolutely steal for 500 atoms imo. 
---
Best Buy ever. 
---
The lighting is a little dull imo. But maybe that‚Äôs just my settings idk. But overall very satisfied with this one!
---
we‚Äôre in
---
No, it‚Äôs because of asshats like you and you‚Äôre holier-than-thou attitudes that people feel the need to add disclaimers
---
i've noticed with camp items.... they can get REAL screwy in very specific locations.
---
i once had a regular door... just refuse to shut.  it made the sound, the prompts were correct for the status it was "supposed" to be in... but the animation wouldn't play.
---
moving the foundation slightly fixed it.  switching the wall the door was on fixed it.  it was just this one spot, this one time, that it wigged out.
---
to be fair to bethesda... letting us build our camps anywhere, WILL lead to unforeseen circumstances.  there's simply no way to realistically test every camp object in every location.
---
i rail on them pretty hard for their bugs, and i'm not going to tell you to just put/try it elsewhere if you have your camp where you want it, but, it'd be worth a shot.
---
there have been fully legit camp glitches, and there's also a TON of factors to account for when objects get placed in the world.
---
good luck regardless
---
What score exploit? Some players scored a lot?
---
I know functioning armor displays exist in game because SH Games has a video up featuring hacked and/or unreleased camp items. PA displays I'm not sure, though.
---
Depends on build. I personally prefer secret service
---
Do the crime, do the time
---
All of those sound like reasonable solutions to the problem.... I actually wrote a personal message to the community manager regarding this exact dupe and was never responded to. That was a month ago
---
Nice. I‚Äôll have to check that out again too.
---
I had fun, but just not in public areas. Events just were not fun in those groups when the spread got too big. Last Halloween was pretty ridiculous.
---
Solar if your a team player, ss if you like to be tanky, and thorn if your a melee/sneak build
---
Meet me at vault 76
---
It was those... We got the workshop last week, did we get the kill giant creatures already? It wasn't all filled out either, it said I didn't kill a behemoth and one other that I can't remember
---
Thats correct. BUT you now essentially have X free perk points for however many legendary perk slots you have (which is Six I think).
---
So if you already have a SPECIAL point allocation of say...
---
15 4 4 4 6 13 10
---
Now you can move one perk point out of 6 separate SPECIAL slots and apply the legendary perks. 
---
Now if you want to buff charisma you can have a SPECIAL point allocation of 14 3 3 10 5 12 9 with a legendary perk card at one level in each slot other than charisma.
---
That sets your total (before armor or any other buffs) at 15 4 4 10 6 13 10.
---
Proper allocation allows you to maintain your current builds and add up to 6 additional perks without needing to actually change anything.
---
In theory anyway.
---
Seems pretty solid.
---
*edited to fix a mathematical typo
---
Using God mode and a bunch of cranberrys and leader bobble heads to get to rank 100 in the s.c.o.r.e battle pass
---
Coming
---
And I used their product, despite how many issues there were in the game, managed to get some fun out of it with some friends. You can‚Äôt expect to use the ToS as some sort of ultimate law that allows Bethesda to just suspend over half the player base, considering how they fail to sort through issues and fail to deliver what they promised. They even said they weren‚Äôt making it p2w yet here we are with scrap kits and repair kits in the atom shop.
---
I guess we‚Äôll just have to agree to disagree. It obviously matters to you how someone else plays a game they paid for. It doesn‚Äôt to me. Not my business or problem. If they cheated and got banned that‚Äôs on them. If they didn‚Äôt get banned I don‚Äôt care there either.
---
I'm sure there will be some implementation. Me and my wife really like the challenges.
---
They will probably include it in a Halloween update or something. They fixed alot of the dailies from the base game that just didn't work.
---
I can tell you have not played extremely Grindy mmo games. 
---
For example if I played for 2 years and got a super legendary gear from an super end game boss that requires hundreds of people to fight then suddenly someone finds a way to exploit and dupe it to the mass public then what about the experience of those players that worked hard for it.
---
They have nothing to show that they earned it. So yes, It does affect player experience no matter how you word it.
---
Of course you were right, your such a good boy aren‚Äôt you?
---
Flatwoods in the dinner. The fridge
---
Yeah, it was a hell of a time. As if the wasteland didn't have enough bugs flying around already
---
Yes please. Also radium rifle if it‚Äôs not too much trouble.
---
Do the crime, ban the Smurf
---
Enjoy
---
Same, small grinds between events.
---
Buttressed for SS
---
You used their service which you had a license to use which can be revoked. 
---
Not over half the player exploit the game. 
---
Most people are responsible.
---
that‚Äôll be amazing. i‚Äôll wait for that lol. thanks
---
https://imgur.com/a/K9tojj6
---
Line in the Sand is a good place for easy xp but not for legendary farming though. 
---
At least the scorched are less bullet spongy and dangerous than brown olympic runner ghouls.
---
You're the guy!  LOL.  Twice I have got great loot out of overseers boxes.  Weapons though, not plans.  When I was level 20-30ish I came across one that had two high level weapons in it, 3 star lvl 45 and 50 legendaries, both semi-auto style rifles which I use.  I held onto them til I was level 50 then started using them.  To this day they are still the most powerful weapons I have.
---
I love the f76 community but my nerves are on end when playing w/ ppl online unless I know them in real life. 
---
Plus I like that selfmade feeling- I'd be annoyed if I got random xp because a stranger made a kill.
---
Why do cheaters think people are hurt by their insults? Now excuse me, I‚Äôm going to finish my daily because I can play.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize this wasn‚Äôt the case for everyone.
---
What are the ultracite plasma cores for?
---
This has always been my go-to for atom shop challenges.
---
About time
---
Very Nice
---
I knew someone who did this irl, turned out great.  Great for what it was that is, but you wouldn‚Äôt really know from the inside.  Two together offset like the Tetris block.
---
This is good advice. Although, do *not* get solar if you‚Äôre a bloodied build.
---
Ummm...Plasma Gatling Gun
---
T.... O.... wait for it.... just a bit more.... aaaaaaannnnnndddd.... S!
---
My plan for this was to put my vendor along the way from Vault 76 to the Wayward but not power it. (Vending machines still dispense without power.) That way the new folk are bound to stumble upon it but I'm not advertised on the map. ;)
---
Wow good job broüëç
---
I share the world with others.  The quality and integrity of those I share the world with make a difference to me.  If it didn't I would just play on private servers. I did not enjoy the meat bombs at fashnaght either.
---
No there‚Äôs a difference in actual working MMO games versus FO76 lol, if you consider 76 as a legit/good MMO then you haven‚Äôt played MMO games at all. The grind is fun in all those other MMO games, paid/free. Those games are more polished/care about their player community. Do you like grinding in 76? If so, then good for you, but I can tell you right now that nobody likes the current legendary system.
---
Now thats funny. Its like seeing half a server show up to Death Blossoms
---
To answer your question Bethesda does 3 types of bans from what we have seen so far. 
---
Permanent ban: Self explanatory
---
Limited Van: Duped items taken away and  your Banned until the exploit you used to Duped is fixed
---
Suspension Ban: Your banned temporarly but not forever. How long? It varies from player to player.
---
I‚Äôd commission you to draw Lilith and Cindy....in what I sent you.
---
I always do that event. So simple and quick.
---
Yeah you are right, they are responsible for benefiting from exploits üëè
---
Meh I share the world with others but how they play their game has no effect on me or you for that matter. But if you want to stress about it go ahead.
---
Secret service... then grind for the jet pack
---
Ultracite plasma cores are for a Gatling plasma gun with a prime receiver.
---
Nah I have my camp in the forest for a reason
---
They can't track them since no player Id is ever assigned to a weapon the only unique Id they have is there legendary effects so they ban based on those.
---
I‚Äôve been solo for most of 1500 hrs and I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. Give the Building teams a try. We‚Äôre usually an anti social group doing our own thing for the intelligence boost. It‚Äôs also made me ditch lone wanderer for inspirational!
---
Unbelievable, who would have thought cranberries and bobbleheads can do wonders
---
Can you stop telling others that ‚Äûtheir experience is wrong‚Äú? Dupers/Exploiters *do* ruin the experience for many people. Not yours. Not mine (at least not after returning to FO. The first wave of duping actually made me quit for a year), but of many others. Those posting here for example. Accept it.
---
I can think of a few wastelanders that I would like to lock in a shipping container. I think we need the ability to put people in shipping containers then ACTUALLY SHIP THEM down the river and out of Appalachia. Anyone who uses punji boards to steal junk from people gets shipped to Louisiana, by way of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.
---
It‚Äôs not an insult lol, actually why do good two shoes think that everyone is a cheater? Oh you must be seeking approval from the almighty Todd the god Howard. 
---
Enjoy the game.
---
Some people just like to play the game... don‚Äôt need to exploit it to have fun. 
---
You broke the rules, live with the consequences.
---
So I‚Äôve got hunters long coat and the clean ranger outfit/hat from the rare vendor
---
Anything pared with stealth
---
Rad Burrito.
---
Yea kudos to Beth for cleaning up the infestation
---
Does cranberry relish do something different in god mode? Like not the timer doesn‚Äôt expire?
---
Did we ever figure out how to snap them together, so Super Mutants can't squeeze through the half inch gap between them?
---
I'd only seen them occasionally during Scorched Earth until the other day when I was walking down the road in the Mire and was like "hey, you don't fool me buddy. I remember you from Fallout 4"
---
Not yet. It will soon :)
---
None
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Not really lol, if you ever played modern warfare 2 that s*** was wild.
---
Above ground vault made entirely from shipping containers. WELCOME TO VAULT 666!
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for an actual log cabin building set. The style of building is everywhere, and I want it badly.
---
Also, the glass/greenhouse building pieces. Really need those.
---
You got banned for cheating! You got exactly what you deserve, the ToS clearly says no cheating or exploiting.
---
You did the crime, now do the time.
---
Lmao you literally defined what cheating is and also pretty much said that glitches/bugs aren‚Äôt cheats because they are in fact part of the game. I guess nearly every high level is running cheated gear then if you say every duped item is a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù.
---
Interesting, so you‚Äôre saying the players don‚Äôt really ‚Äòown‚Äô the weapon, they only have the rights to certain effects?
---
I'm not sure all I've heard was using God mode and cranberries and leader bobbles heads ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Grahm once killed my tamed mirelurk a few seconds after I tamed it üòî
---
Does it only work if you're scoping or does it work regardless? I added it but am not trying to understand its utility. You mentioned it as a SBQ benefit, but I have a hard time scoping her unless someone is cryo'ing her.
---
Shipping container + meat hook + Chain Saw. VERY Russian, Brighton Beach Russian.
---
Pretty much, unless you‚Äôre roaming the wastelands punching things.
---
Don't run it bloodied, vats pistol is burst damage.
---
Best legendary effect is two shot and vats crit damage since the two bullets have exponential crit damage.
---
I tried bloodied but is suites heavy weapons more since they can't use vats.
---
I would love that. That one is so boring solo.
---
Stims, radaways etc have never sold for me either. When I start to get too many now I offload them to the robots. They weigh too much in my stash anyway to hold onto them for too long
---
Judging by the down votes - Must still be some dupers/cheaters here who are following a game they can't play or are hopefully receiving an email from Bethesda soon.
---
Choices have consequences
---
Lorewise it's a powerfull weapon
---
That has not yet started, no. It's going to be helping build up ATLAS Observatory for the BoS, who are arriving in the Fall! It's going to be starting on August 8th, per this [Summer Season Roadmap!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/517392415024480259/728289077761409144/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.png)
---
Can you elaborate how duping weapons and armor isn't cheating?
---
It's up there, I cant link it or it gets removed.
---
If you looked around there are worser mmo then fallout 76. Saying fallout 76 is not an mmo because it has bugs is not correct. There are similar mmo games that you can play all the way through solo and there are ones that are much buggier then fallout.
---
I clearly don‚Äôt understand your anger on this. Just because the door was left open does not mean your entitled to steal from someone‚Äôs house. The rules were listed.
---
Video games all come from preference. You hate what I like. I hate what you like. It‚Äôs the way we all are.
---
It‚Äôs causing you window pain?
---
Tldr: I'm salty and entitled.
---
Heavy, especially ultracite laser or normal laser.
---
This would improve Workshops so much!
---
I literally have a description of what cheating is, using third party programs to give yourself unfair advantages in a game where other players cannot get those advantages unless they also cheat.
---
like kthers said, Terms of Service. You know, that thing you scrolled through without reading and clicked "agree" to when you first started up the game.
---
I have over 400 stimpacks and radaways each and over 400 healing salves, plus over 500 diffusers. My aid mule character has over 1000 of each and is full. At some point I'm just going to start server hopping and dropping then in Flatwoods.
---
That event actually gives a ton of Xp for some reason. I always do it.
---
So were you giving every rando in sight a JE plasma?
---
When you can dupe 1000s it really doesn't matter.
---
I was hoping there were more tiers, eventually ending in a Eagle scout or fallout world equiv.
---
I still have 3 more Possums left but dont want to finish them just yet
---
Please don't hate me but I still would rather solo traditionally ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
---
Damage
---
Agreed. I do miss going to the glowing sea and Nuking a deathclaw. I loved to imagine what went through its head as that shell sailed straight for its gullet.
---
I'm going to take a leap and guess your on PC?
---
Nope, I don‚Äôt even have that actually because I didn‚Äôt bother trading for one. But you are missing a key component, ‚Äúthird party‚Äù.
---
Ah, that is boring, thanks to your both though!
---
It‚Äôs aight man he is just pumping ammo, don‚Äôt hurt nobody.
---
Agricultural center in flatwoods: the wallsafe on the second floor
---
Inspection of code
---
Id link it to you if I could, sry pal.
---
Who says they can‚Äôt play it? Just because one account is banned doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt play the game still.
---
Toe-dipper here.  Yeah, I did the thing but I certainly wasn‚Äôt trying to gain financially from it.  Honestly, I saw the market as being stacked against me and 2 years into the game, trading to get a junkies ripper or some shit was kinda all I had left.  The second I saw people trading nukaquantum paddleballs (and this was a few days before the exploit was on Asylum‚Äôs channel), I knew some new shit was live.  Once the info went public and the train stations started reaching full capacity, I felt that if I wanted a chance at trading for the one gun I really wanted (J2525 Fixer... I‚Äôm too much the nervous type for a B2525.  Full health yo.), I had to play their game.  And I did.  One less grind to worry about, I thought.  And here I am left with nothing.  Toe-dipper.
---
lol üëçüëç
---
I would say either stealth, heavy or unarmed. But they all have their downsides. Stealth isn't good once detected, heavy is slow and requires lots of ammo and unarmed cant use PA and its got no range.
---
Due to the fact I dislike crafting ammo and low HP builds and I like faster gameplay I chose to main unarmed with a side of heavy for nukezones.  I 1 hit chared feral ghouls and the scorched. Glowing ghouls and supermurants take 2 or 3 hits.
---
People have the ability to farm lead and resources. I don't know if you recall but a guy was banned.for having 100000 ammo of a specific kind just because he crafted it all after farming for weeks of lead and steel. He legitimately got banned for legitimately farming resources and legitimately crafting ammo. 
---
You're clearly delusional that Bethesda is a greedy and unjustified machine that shits on its consumers and rips off it's community.
---
You have your mind made up you seem to be the dupe here. 
---
Good luck there.
---
And btw the duplication would leave an influx of those items selling for exorbitant prices. Leaving the market saturated and have the prices falling. People sell in game stuff in almost every game. The only reason 76s market was so crazily priced was because Bethesda retardedly made a decision to remove ite.s from a loot table but not to remove them from players. Again they shoot theirselves in the foot. Of course when a game is broke where people can duplicate non existent items they will.
---
Defend this dumpster fire all you want. I find you laughable to defend this evil machine of a shit show. 
---
Good luck fighting those teslas with your fall damage armor and stalkers walking kane grampa lol
---
Secret Service has the best resistances, but there's no guarantee how many stars it'll be, so prepare for a lot of frustration rolling wasting a legendary module and getting a 1 star ghoul slayers piece.
---
Solar and Thorn are guaranteed 3 star, but it takes a module plus 11 vault steel to craft a piece so you only get 1 roll per day.
---
Kind of so each item in Bethesda games have an item ID which you can use to spawn the item in. This could be the legendary effect ID too.
---
Then once spawned each item is given a reference ID that is tied to your save file. Every spawned in item once saved to the server has to be unique so dupped items will only have the same item ID but different reference ID.
---
So how is everyone benefitting from your duping if you weren't playing wasteland Santa?
---
Lol I never said it wasn‚Äôt an MMO, also 76 is by far one of the worst MMO‚Äôs there are, it‚Äôs more of a coop game where you can play with your friends. 76 is missing pretty much what makes MMO‚Äôs good, but they included all the worst parts of MMO features.
---
Place down ammo machine on floor blueprint then set.. just a guess haha
---
Any proof of/copy of this message? Kind of nosey/interested
---
I think they should add it back to the loot pool, BUT instead of making it a ballistic explosive, make the explosion on lasers red, ultracite lasers green, gauss weapons blue (like they already have) and remove the default explosive effect from gauss weapons, and plasma green.
---
0 need for keeping anything below level 50, unless its junk items
---
Lol some of these nerds think we  and bethesda should send them a thank you letter for their commitment to "break the game"
---
1. Ruined explosive because everyone had one then people were crying about them all the time
---
2. Ruined the economy completely, I come from PS4 into PC, and the Economy on PC sucks ass. nothing is worth anything anymore therefore trading is not even relevant anymore.
---
use the public teams. there is literally no downside. i play solo too but i join/form a public Building team the instant i join a server. the INT buff helps with the exp grind, and you dont HAVE to play with your team. you can all do your own thing. however if a big event comes up and you need help, throwing the "come here" emote sometimes brings your teammates over to help kill that damn wendigo colossus you accidentally found but now really wanna kill.
---
But my teddies :( they‚Äôre more precious to me than those b2525 fixers
---
Yup but it becomes way worse in terms of the over all gun. You sacrafices lower vats cost to have more durability basically.
---
I saw talk of it elsewhere today, some exploit to do with blueprinting. I guess this is the best they can do now since duping their ammo got their mains banned
---
good yes !  thinking about this again today while wandering around
---
So the disconnected player leaves the server, making the workshop claimable but if they come back within a certain timeframe the workshop is still theirs? That makes sense because I've accidentally disconnected the server before, came back, and it still was mine. Thanks
---
I did give stuff to people lmao, just not a JE plasma Mr. goody two shoes. Then can you explain how dupers ruined the game? How it‚Äôs so unplayable because of them? Oh I didn‚Äôt think so. Also did I say everyone benefited from me? No, I said duping itself, the glitch itself, it allowed players to share everything and make unobtainable items available to anyone who wanted one, either for free or a lot of people were selling for caps.
---
Ah, so this is why I was seeing nut jobs request 1,000 leader bobble heads on the market sub.
---
Save them for double xp weekend for a much bigger impact!
---
In my history I posted a step by step guide yesterday
---
This was at his camp.
---
Just check around different fo76 subs it's making it rounds
---
PS4.
---
Yes. Food stacks in God Mode, so cranberry relish gives 10% XP, in God Mode if you take 10 of those then you get 100%. And 100 INT if you have unyielding, therefore, every kill is around 4000XP points, which is the max XP u can get from a kill.
---
Don't disagree with that at all. I would bitch that they were the bane of my in game existence but never asked for them to be nerfed either. They were actually challenging without just being a total bullet sponge that does the same damage as a non bullet sponge variant....project paradise alphas come to mind here.
---
So what you're saying is making duplicate copies of God roll Fixers isn't cheating, even though the only want to get one is from the purveyor or trade your first born kid for one.
---
I had an empty Power Armor chassis glitch into a full raider one when I was sorting my stash. level 35 I think I‚Äôm not complaining, But the crashing servers which auto complete the challenges with no xp balance it out tbh.
---
Yeah you need to run up to it get your icon back I believe.
---
I've never seen Snallys down there, but anything can be crippled, really.  Idk about floaters, though, and I have seen them but like, in the last ten seconds.
---
Mw2 was the wild wild west of modern first person shooters..yes it was wild
---
You know I don‚Äôt care that if they ban people or not that‚Äôs none of my business. But you‚Äôd think that if a company banned someone from playing their game they‚Äôd have the decency to cancel their sub to that game. Low key Bethesda hoping someone forgets so they get paid still.
---
An IP ban will stop them from smurfing to another acc

---
Member Berries seem appropriate given the MAGA reference.
---
Ya I read that wrong so that‚Äôs on me. I can agree with you that the mmo aspect of fallout is not great. To me however the gameplay itself is good. There is enough content in the game that is worth the price you have paid for compared to most of the games released today.
---
Or actually you could‚Äôve gotten one from someone when this dupe glitch was announced, that‚Äôs how I got mine.
---
Technically the other way around. Far Harbor and all of FO4 takes place after this game
---
BETA player here who only used one character
---
My only Legacy is a 3* Instigating Dragon.
---
Same. ive got 700 hours but never cared. The few drops i got have carried me for the last 200 levels...and im sure someone would be like "lol u run a Mole Miner Gauntlet and a TS Fixer with no FFR? GIT GUD"
---
I can hold my own against everything in this game and i earned it thru my playtime
---
No exploits, glitches etc
---
I know many who do...a few of my PS4 ppl were banned yest and today. 
---
As much as i did enjoy the chat banter and experiences we had...i knew they were cheaters. But im not a gamer cop.
---
To each their own
---
My own was roamin the wasteland like every other fallout game...consequences for your actions
---
I'm with you man.  If you're on xbox we've probably ran the same events over and over together.
---
Zillions of emergency airdrops and people spinning around like helicopter gettong headshots across the map
---
Yeah but people who didn‚Äôt dupe are getting banned. What code was there?
---
Exact same scenario, except mines a pump.  I'd be upgrading if I could find a combat
---
Honestly, I think lore is a somewhat fluid concept to Bethesda at this point, but even if nothing in my reply comes to fruition, I just want them to do something with the countless elements they put into play for the Appalachian Enclave. They have the potential to make some epic questlines and story, but so far have kind of let the elements just lay to waste, aside from the flurry of nukes commonly seen flying into the map.
---
Wait I just looked at the picture closer... yeah no idea
---
I love how delusional people are about exploits and such when it comes to consoles vs pc.
---
I was pretty shocked to see i was carrying around over 300 ea stims &amp; radaways recently. They accumulate rather quickly from event/quest reward drops and Im doing more of them grinding for SCORE. No wonder I get overloaded
---
Bro at 500 hours I doubt youve experinced much how about this do you have any behemoth stomp explosives or frog bombs or snallygaster spits. Or how about chamelion deathclaws , stealth model sentry bots, or even ghoul Yao guis
---
No very they are dooker. Pretty much like songle shot rifles with alot of recoil and lower range and capacities.
---
Hey, bud! Hope you enjoyed the Bear Arm! Glad I could enrich your gaming experience, however fleeting it was :)
---
It was thinking since the Radium Rifle is based off a [Volkssturmgewehr](http://www.imfdb.org/images/thumb/b/bd/Volkssturmgewehr1-5left.jpg/400px-Volkssturmgewehr1-5left.jpg), a skin could be a modified STG-44.
---
i especially wont use VATS Unknown cuz i got screwed over with it. despite being level 100+ when i did the quest, i got a level 25 gun. yayyyy.
---
Same I have friends that I k ow have duped weapons or armor. None that I know of got banned but who cares. Like you said to each his own. If they are happier playing with them than without them so be it.
---
I guess you can pretend I said that if it makes you feel better. Many legitimate players avoid ever trading because of the cheaters, the others simply accept it as inevitable. Wouldn't be an issue if certain childish individuals didn't flood the entire game with cheated trash to satisfy that immediate gratification. Although the fact that you decided to write up this entire thesis instead of accepting responsibility for your actions kind of already shows it's pointless trying to talk any sense into you
---
You do know most dupers actually sell weapons for irl money from console right?
---
You're talking about PC like the USA talks about Eastern Europe, as if it was a battle royale with drunks everywhere, which is sooo far from the truth
---
I‚Äôd have to disagree with that, the lacklustre content and all these issues are a reason why the community is so small up to this point, not to mention after a lot of people got banned everyone pretty much started asking what happened because the servers were so dead. I won‚Äôt disagree with you that it was fun, only if you were playing with some friends and just goofing around. I can‚Äôt imagine how boring it‚Äôd be playing solo and pretty much repeating everything day after day.
---
If Bethesda actually used that stuff. Idk about other countries but here in the states a lot of internet services providers don‚Äôt give their clients static IP addresses so I‚Äôm not sure how effective an IP ban would be.
---
Scorched earth doctrine lol. (Like the fallout reference)
---
Still got it actually lol ;)
---
I‚Äôm ready for more scout ranks
---
So if I loot a weapon from a ghoul, and another with same exact effects from murmrgh, they will still have different item IDs, is that correct? Can‚Äôt beth just look at the accounts that have many items with the same item ID and know it belongs to a duper?
---
My man! Slay a few ghouls for me ;)
---
If your on Xbox ill buy it name your price
---
You definitely are one salty little peanut. 
---
Maybe if I loan you my fall armor you can take a running jump? Might save you. Hopefully won't.
---
I really liked the board, and the rewards could be fun and interesting (or massively disappointing. When they said "Clean water sink." I completely misinterpreted what that meant.) but the mechanics on the Ammo converter were horrible But the fact that the bad guy was placed like 20+ spaces above you turned it into a crazy grinder where you never felt like you could catch up. Cool idea, but terrible implementation. IDK what is wrong with the Development team on this but they've taken every cool idea they've come up with and botched the living hell of it for two years straight. I like FO76 as a story, I love the ideas in it, and it's got its share of cool memorable characters now and fun game mechanics.
---
But it is drowning in bad ones. It's a never ending grind in which you're constantly short of resources, can never produce or acquire enough of them,  and it punishes your mistakes to a level I haven't felt since EVE online. It's pretty much taken over my life at this point, I played F04 for similar insane hours but I've come to realise *I had a lot more fun doing so.* The Atom shop and vaulting is the worst thing since loot boxes, it's terrible for people with impulse spending problems and I've wasted way more money on it than I really should have.
---
Look, I've tried to be fair but two years is enough, this game isn't likely to get much better than it is and I'm starting to resent the treadmill.  I don't see this getting better without a massive change in leadership, people need to be fired over this, I'm sorry I gave it the old college try but it's pretty clear this has never risen potential and it never will. It's terminally flawed and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. 
---
I can't love this one, and believe me I tried really, really hard. But I'm burned as well, and it's just time to quit.
---
Yeah last time I did it there were glowing snallys. Only got lvl 2 prize, but was first time actually completing the event.
---
Yeah I played with my friends most of the time. I cant imagine how dreadful it would be by your self since the start.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you got the axe?
---
I‚Äôve got a bloodied ffr 10mm on my pistol build. Pretty much shreds everything. The big downfall however, is your 9 guerilla/gunslinger perks are in Agility. Makes for some tough choices.
---
lol yea i wish the alphas were somewhat different than their counterparts in the wild.
---
Thank you for an actual answer to my question. Appreciate the info.
---
What your saying is you want people to use what you consider cheating which is not the same as what the world calls cheating.
---
How very Cheater of you.
---
I personally have met a RMT duper from an old BOS clan and he‚Äôs still playing on the account he duped on. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs sold his dupes but he definitely still has them.
---
That is geographically an amazing post shout out to geographers/cartographers of the wasteland.
---
Lol I don‚Äôt need to come to terms with that. You‚Äôre trying to make this game out to be some huge life choice of right and wrong. I wasn‚Äôt selfish when I used this one exploit. By the way I didn‚Äôt use any of the ones in the past. You can choose to not believe me but I‚Äôm being open and honest about using this one. Me and my buddies and other people I played with in the world all did it to share our guns with each other. I also gave a few away. For the millionth time I see that it is wrong I broke a rule and now I‚Äôm dealing with the consequences. Comparing this exploit that did not hurt a single other players game to slavery on a moral scale is ridiculous. Take the hint and look at all your downvotes on that comment obviously it‚Äôs ridiculous lol. This exploit didn‚Äôt crash servers or inhibit anyone from playing like past exploits. Get off your high horse it‚Äôs a video game. I‚Äôve admitted that I broke a rule and it was wrong but quit acting like everyone that did it doesn‚Äôt know right from wrong or understand morals. God man I hope you live a perfect life. Next time you‚Äôre driving and you catch yourself speeding 5mph over the limit I hope you realize how morally wrong that is. (Sarcasm)üòÇ
---
Man and Riot games gets utterly destroyed for something as simple as releasing a schedule using AM/PM time in Europe.
---
But Bethesda is getting away with their game being unfinished a year after release.
---
Lol I already took responsibility for my actions, you just don‚Äôt understand what ‚Äúcheated‚Äù means and you also don‚Äôt understand how people like you, the self proclaimed goody two shoes, are pretty much vultures who like throwing other players under the bus despite having helped a lot of people get things the otherwise couldn‚Äôt get unless they spent real money (talking about players who never trade), because let‚Äôs be real, if it wasn‚Äôt for dupers, there wouldn‚Äôt be 99% of the fun high end items in the game (yes legacies are hella fun to play with, most people will admit that they‚Äôd want one to play around with even if it means they‚Äôll never touch it again since they might not like to use it)
---
Oh ok. That‚Äôs nuts. I‚Äôll stop sweating my farming run then. I kept hearing food stacking was a problem and was worried my cranberry relish and brain fungus soup was a problem. I think I‚Äôm good on that front then.
---
Ah so they got the scraps form the duped presents you were opening at train stations. If most players are at a SBQ event with duped weapons, she'll die faster and rob players who don't have them of a chance to get any rewards. So you are affecting their game. If you want to do what you want, play fallout 4.
---
Never gone through a refund process.  How does it work?
---
Equip the perk which drops a grenade on death.
---
Soon as they lift the bans they‚Äôll let you pay to rank up your score as planned
---
I received the suspension email, but no perma as of yet! I think I played it pretty smart compared to some so there's probably a slim chance I'll survive the culling üòÇ
---
Nah, I‚Äôm just defining what cheating actually means. But I guess you also support Bethesda for adding p2w features? Oh how just of you. I forgot that suck ups love to cheer on one side and forget about all the flaws/immoral issues they have.
---
Yeaaah... not so much. My wife found this out doing the whole Mistress of Mysteries thing she wanted to do. She had fun at low levels and was ok until she finally understood how crappy it was at higher levels
---
And much cheaper vats, also the best vats accuracy out of any weapon.
---
Not terribly endgame, although you can hold your own against things like super mutants, especially with the gauss pistol which can net you thousands of damage per shot with a sneak crit. The build works well with a cit build, although gauss pistols are bugged and always miss the first shot in VATS.
---
Yeah but we know that Bethesda doesn't really care about that as much. We have the Cryolator in 76, but in the lore the only one was sealed away in a vault near boston for 200 years.
---
It is super easy to install. It just works.
---
We don‚Äôt know, it was delayed
---
Those are plusee forgot those. Makes sens agility means more ap pistols AP friendly
---
I‚Äôm not talking about just dupes. I could care less about that. What I was referencing was players flying through the air and getting pin point head shots in nw.
---
When players were able to create 4 and 5 star legendary on PC they also created tons of 3 star which were not removed. This is worser then players just duping.
---
There was also that time during Christmas on PC that people who used a certain script was able to steal other players inventory although that got patched out quick.
---
Whose to say that such stuff would not happen on PC again? That‚Äôs why everyone hates it and fed up with the people who get off on that.
---
If you're not phased about dying then don't read my comment haha.
---
Assuming from your STR points you're running melee bloodied.
---
Also assuming your goal is to one hit everything.
---
So in that case I would get rid of suppressor
---
You'll want Iron Clad &amp; Radicool 
---
But because your +20% one hand melee cards takes up so much points you can't increase your DR.
---
I'm running 9 STR,  bloodied DCG build and I am dealing 2200 DMG with 500+ DMG resist.
---
Legacies should be removed like the radical mask.
---
The stacks from RP1
---
Its a glitch that came out recently on the glitch channels. Like someone mentioned earlier it has to do with blueprints.
---
Nw gives one
---
Me (level 450) and 6 others level 300-500 showed up for Tea Time a few days ago.
---
A bit overkill.
---
Unfortunately the arrows and bolts all become irradiated.
---
Perhaps there could be a perk card, once at level 5 arrows and bolts are never consumed so effectively infinite ammo.
---
I sell low level plans to help cover fast travel fees and make a lil money extra. So he prolly did it for that reason alone.
---
Try this:

---
I would recommend thorn/ss armor unyielding. If you can't get thorn/ss just get a full set of unyielding and you'll have enough sneak to go around 1 shooting things without being detected. The higher the agility, the higher the sneak.
---
If you have the fireplace you can get away with a wall on the inside being brick with a brick fireplace not the secret dore one but maybe that one too I don't have it yet
---
Well then you are literally defining how magic weapons are breaking the game then, see a lot of people like you are too simple minded to actually know what‚Äôs game breaking and what‚Äôs not. Also you can‚Äôt even kill the queen that fast unless you somehow get lucky enough to have it land and not take off rig away. Have you seen a magic gauss shotgun? A lot of people don‚Äôt know about it, but that thing can solo melt the Queen as fast as like everyone using B/J/AA explosive plasmas. Also the queen not landing or having weird buggy patterns is another fault on Bethesda, which they said they‚Äôll fix in the next update. They‚Äôll probably just introduce even more issues in that update like usual.
---
Dude. You cheated and now you think you can bullshit everyone into seeing it differently.
---
You‚Äôre a cheater.  Handed are you cheat at everything in your like. Go away.
---
My dream weapon is a explosive 25% fire rate pump action with whatever as the other perk. My combat is explosive anti armor with a vats perk, I need to actually give it to my character who uses shotgun perks but it's such a good utility for my main character.
---
Totally. Melee can really pack a punch when they are on the ground. Just need to get them to land. Jet packs wouldn‚Äôt work that well.
---
I literally pray for the grandpapie of all  assault rifles skin. I'd throw so many atoms at one
---
You didn't answer my question. Is making copies of  the same weapon via an exploit, cheating?
---
Ok so...you said "you just need one core"
---
I said *I need* 5-10 for SBQs
---
My point was you, like everyone else...should have them for emergencies. "May /May not use"  
---
Every single player will at one point have to use PA and extensively
---
Having 2-3 cores (100% hopefully) should be AS standard as having 20 Radx or RadAway.
---
I said you gave bad advice based on the "only one"  Do you know how quickly one runs out in PA and if you use a gatling laser at a low (under 75 to me) level?
---
Yes i do suggest people manage their inventory where you have space for at least 5 full cores.
---
Most SBQ fights are where you dont need PA...but if youre a lower level with say...a decent melee or rifle...youre not going to the get the damage you want and youll be waiting for the Heavy to carry you
---
Every true low level (non alts) should be prepared to carry cores an one heavy
---
Also tents are relatively new...depending on FO1 players to be in every server...thats...again bad advice
---
OP is correct. search Fallout76. No space between fallout 76
---
Sure they didn‚Äôt
---
Could you make it so it's not susceptible to massive PvP attacks to take them over?  I really really hate that.
---
The only pistol that is on par with the lever action rifle is the pipe revolver the thing if its a Bloodied does 620 damage with both the gunslinger and rifleman perks.
---
All you have to do to get the rifleman damage is put any rifle stock on the revolver. And you'll be one shotting every non boss type enemy, provided you're sneaking.
---
Hmm. It‚Äôs nowhere near as good as my commando, but I‚Äôm taking down scorchbeasts within 2 mags. Granted, I‚Äôm heavily invested in vats crits, but it‚Äôs still a blast.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with absolutely everything you said, in this and the rest of your comments.  Hats off.
---
Melee, especially unarmed melee is very effective. But flying with her isn‚Äôt. you may get a lucky shot in, but your main tactic will be to wait until she lands.
---
You‚Äôve always had to log into Microsoft to get stop the subscription. That‚Äôs not a Bethesda thing. That‚Äôs a Microsoft thing.
---
Lol I did answer your question, you just don‚Äôt seem to get it. No, doing something in the game that the game allows you to do + Bethesda let it go on for a week, is not cheating. Exploit = called an exploit for a reason, and cheat = called a cheat for a reason.
---
You can transfer one special point to another per level after 50. 
---
Arguably easier just to work on a build beforehand but it's an option for those of us who are wishy washy
---
Hmmm yes and no.
---
Most things are viable and the question you need to ask is do you like it. Nothing is super challenging in this game and its more a preference.
---
Pistols excel at burst damage, the vats damage will give you equal damage to bloodied builds but only for a short duration basicly the length of your ap meter.
---
You will then be vulnerable untill your ap comes back so bloodied builds are out of the question, maybe junkies.
---
I run mostly two shot pistols with 50% crit damage. Plasma and gauss pistols are the highest damage by far with these legendary effects.
---
You also need good hip fire accuracy and vats chance to make this work or you will miss most of your shot.
---
Not yet. Later this summer.
---
I havent lol
---
I only managed to get a perfect run ONCE and it was because I had a good team of randoms. We all got our animals to level 3 and took out the Alpha is record time. Got the Bear Arm plan and I was so happy! And one of them dropped me the heavy mod which made it better. All I need is the diffuser and puncturing mod and I'm good!!!
---
Those are bugged weapons that bethedsa hasn't patched. They can be obtained legit without using exploits.
---
Not a bad thought. I could see why they did such a mass ban then.
---
The dude literally wasn‚Äôt on all weekend so
---
NW gives and LMG Skin?
---
Theres a good chance that a new player wouldnt even know about player vendors.
---
PC = bad, console = perfect game with no exploits. Duh.
---
I think Morgantown bank has 1 of each level
---
Ahhh thanks but it's just not my cup of tea ‚ô°‚ô°
---
I have the Better Inventory mod so I can see I have 270-300 weight in my Aid tab at any time. I've been buying recall keycards just so I can sell more to the vendors without wasting caps entirely. I make at least 100 glowing meat steaks a day and those alone max out my daily caps.
---
So then why did you say you sell them at default if you don't sell any? Makes no sense at all
---
Bethesda can't cancel it. The sub is bought through xbox so its microsoft who would need to cancel it.
---
They arent hiding it either. You can only see it on the microsoft website.
---
