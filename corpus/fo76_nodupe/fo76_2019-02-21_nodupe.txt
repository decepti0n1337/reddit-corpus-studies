Idk I think they got Camden Park down. It's been a wasteland for years! I'm a Charleston native. Hehe

we can do 30 caps per 10 screws
---
Hey man a friend of mine just tamed a mirelurk king and it was only level 25 when he tamed it but once it it got to his base it's now level 50! I thought that was weird because mine always stay the same level. I took a picture of it if you wanna see for yourself. 
---
I think the basic defense is that they count "acquiring" an item as any transaction where it goes into your inventory, and doesn't pay attention to times when it leaves. So, if you pass your 10k ammo back and forth 26 times over the month, that's "acquiring" 260k ammo in that time.
---
I agree with you i think they are paying them or something because i cant understand how you defend a company that has screw over their player base over and over and over and over again. 
---
You don't understand. People who were caught hoarding mass amount got banned a long time ago. Is this really that difficult to understand? jesus christ
---
It'd be awesome to have it as a drop option!
---
Thanks man! I’ve got a bit of fiddly building skills from Ark under my belt so flipping the wall shouldn’t be too hard haha
---
"I exploited once and didn't do it again" excuse is honestly the most pathetic thing ever.  
---

---
You've admitted to abusing an exploit right here. You say you've been suspended - therefore, like it or not, that suspension is valid. It may state in the email that it for the incorrect reason, but that's like saying, "I got banned for toxic behaviour when all I did was hack".
---
Justice delivered imo.
---
Honestly banning him was probably in the best interest of his own health.
---
Just wanted to point out something, based on your results, you can only claim that the weapon does more damage, you cannot claim that it is more powerful because the idea of something being more powerful takes into account more than just damage
---
Then you are very bad at reading and should more than likely reread the email. It said he has that much ammo lass over his account in a 30 day period. In no way did it state he had 300k ammo at once. 
---
"Aquaried" doesnt mean he holds 260k  just that he has had 260k ultracite ammo in said 30 days. Meaning he could only have 5k in inventory, but have been registered that 260k of it has gone in and out of his inventory. Grammar is not in your side here.
---
Then there's me.
---
I made my PSN acc back when I was a cringey teen, and I've been unable to change it, at least for the time being. Everyone always assumes I'm a kid :P
---
No, this ban wave happened like 4 days ago.
---
How many do you need and how much? I have around 900 because of my hoarding problem. I would also trade for springs or a legendary
---
Picked one up around the 81/66 interchange when I was moving from TN to NJ. Interesting read.
---
One of my favorite steel spots is the lumber yard in the upper northwest. Level 5 super mutants drop a ton of shotguns and rifles and they are easy to kill. Plus, you can usually scrap all the tools and power armor pieces there for 150-250 steel.
---
Featurization Idea:

"Hunger Games" Mutation. Proc on Starvation. 1x-1.25x enhancement (sliding scale) based on hunger level, 1.5x when actually starving (HP Loss), on ALL damage buffs. Special Enhancement: x2 on ALL damage buffs when used with Adrenal Reaction and current status is Starving (HP Loss) And HP less than or equal to 10%.

I think you're really reaching. Not sure if you realize but you are pretty much feeding him avenues I'm quite certain he wasn't smart enough to explore. The way I see it one can most certainly dig a 12 foot trench around their house with a fork but the chances of getting it done in 30 days is quite slim. 
---
It’s quite easy to make friends in this game. Some people can be assholes but it feels like most would give  a hand to help you. 
---
Crosswalks are for people, crossings are for animals. 
---
How many?
---
I have the same problem. I recently got a confederate hat plan from a quest and went to learn it and it shows up as known however I have no headwear category at the armor bench so I can't craft it. 
---
If he was passing it between his main and alt account, it's very possible the number inflated. Say he had 5k  gave it to his alt then passed it back to his main. It would then count as if 10k of it had passed is inventory. Do this a few times, and you can understand how with only 5k ammo, it can be inflated too the hundreds of thousands.
---
Is Stalker’s any good? 
---
*heavy breathing intensifies*
---
good point
---
This is not a ban. It's a suspension. We ain't talking about mass amount of tses, it's just ammos and consumables so they get away with temp suspension. And no, I ain't talking about these suspensions that happened 4 days ago I'm talking about the ban that took effect more than a month ago when serious dupers got permabanned
---
 Your commitment to dying on this hill is just bizarre. Why do you care so much, bending over backwards to defend obvious shitty company that has lie more than 1.
---
You literally make up all these imaginary scenarios to try to defend a company that has screw over ppl with pre orders and lie, with the game and lie, with the nuka cola ron and guess what? they lie to, that's it. Why are you doing that?
---
You know, you've said the exact same thing to everyone who doesn't agree with you. So why is it everyone but you? How do you not realize you're the problem? Or better yet, how do you really try to blame the players for Bethesda being total fuck ups?
---
Here's a plain example, I played the demo for anthem and I thought it was pretty terrible.. the beta for this game was fine. But anthem had a ton of bugs, like nearly as bad and as many as this game had. But, their *day 1* patch fixes most of it. They have some new content for day 1, and more planned for the first month.
---
So yeah, they fucked up, but they fixed a large portion of it before launch, with not only more fixes planned, but features and content *as they fix it*. They're *actually trying*, that's what that actually looks like.
---
I've played this game since the beta, I've been pretty positive, but there's nothing left for me to do. My friends and I have been burnt out and bored for well over a month. Even though none of us really played in the last month, one of them were banned for duping, even though he couldn't dupe to save his life.
---
Yeah, you're the problem, for being completely blind. Players gave the developers plenty of time and good will. They have taken too long, this is not how a game is supposed to be, period.
---
Likely I'm not the only one, but I'll never buy another Bethesda product, not unless/until they show they are as competent as other developers.
---
On mute? Why would you mute it, let him know how worthless he is to you!
---
You say you haven't played in a while. As far as "rebalancing" the TSE, if the last time you played was when the effects would give you 200% extra damage to a gun(+100% for TS and +100% for E)  then yes, they did rebalance it. It now only does 45% damage extra to a gun (+25% for TS, and +20% for E).
---
If the last time you played however was after that nerf I mentioned above, then no. It's still at the 45% damage increase total. Not anything more
---
Everyone else here is talking about what happened 4 days ago, which is why we are in a thread about a guy who was suspended 4 days ago.
---
In some parts of the world people call crosswalks Zebra Crossings. Seriously try google sometime you'll like it. 
---
Ooh I think I ran across that place the other day. Northwest along the river there?
---
It worked before, now it doesn’t. That kids, is called broken. 🤣
---
You make a build optimizing damage, you log your mule on when you see a nuke launch at fissure prime, grab all your ultracite ammo, go kill queen then move the leftover ammo and any ammo you crafted back to the alt.
---
This would be a reasonable reason to move it often.
---
Again I'm not saying hes by default innocent, I'm simply saying that based on the way they have chosen to file out bans, some of those claiming to be wrongfully banned can be telling the truth, regardless I believe many of them claiming to be wrongfully banned are full of it, I think some of them are not and Bethesda should look at each appeal case by case (not state outright people can not appeal the decision).
---
They are claiming to be Infalliable but have proven countless times they screw up and refuse to change that. 
---
I was hopeful they would do well, I was even thankful they were trying to fix issues even tho it's probably to little to late.  But I dont think halfassing the fixes will save the game. 
---
The Ohio River Rafting store, life rings are good for springs and even has a work bench to break them down there. 
---
i bet this is the problem and they cant say shit because they are way to deep in shit already. Beside i doubt they can even implement a decent cheat detection, they cant patch bugs that mods patched. 
---
As someone who lives in New England and is super familiar with Boston. They did an amazing job. As I was playing the game, I kept saying "holy shit this is awesome." They even got streets down. If you go and look carefully the streets are named and line up with real life to a degree. It's awesome. I take so much pride wearing my 111 hoody in the area haha
---

I just started a new build and I'm always looking for higher level players to help a sister out, I know the pain being high level and overloaded all too well! 
---
Yup!
---
Hm I am level 70, how do people kill you if you are in pacifist mode and can not harm them?
---
I think I tried that once and did no damage iirc. Honest question, not trying to meme.
---
You’re on ps4 correct?
---
Oh did I say they are the good guys? 
---
No one ever reads that. It's definitely implicit.
---
Great.... now we're going to be deluged with folk sneaking up behind us &amp; heavy breathing.

[removed]
---
You have some serious problems. 
---
yea
---
 psn pinkrockz
---
If you walk into a grocery store with bad security and stole something your still stealing. Just because Bethesda has a shit anti cheat doesn't make you the good guy when you dupe in thousands of items.
---
T60 armor rules 
---
Wait, are you saying BSG hasn't lied about this game? Uh, did you forget about the whole "canvas bag" fiasco with the power armor edition? Where they said you would get a canvas bag with the game and instead they sent out cheap plastic bags?
---
Or how about how they lied in the Atomic shop with the christmas bundle being "on sale for 50% off" at 1800 atoms even though it was never for sale at full price, the 1800 WAS the full price, or the "oh the game won't ever be pay 2 win or have loot boxes, then the data miners found all those pay 2 win loot box/lunchboxes?
---
I am not sure where you got this idea that BSG has been nothing but truthful about this game, they haven't.

I had one climb though the window to get to me at that location.  The inside of the red rocket isn't necessarily safe from bears :)
---
You're right. We call them zebra crossings or pedestrian crossings in Australia
---
I know that. And i brought permaban up to help you understand how bans in this game works since you seemed to have no idea. You been playing long?
---
Ok... I still don't think we're on the same page here. If you have a weapon with a base damage of 100 and you add a mod that gives another 25 damage... if you made that weapon two shot, what would the total damage be on a single hit (where both bullets hit)?
---
Nah, seriously go read all your comments here, if you can't see that you need mental help, no one here can help you.
---
I see it no difference then normal zones its supposed to be a survival game all is fair game
---
I feel sorry for whoever is trying to fix this game, because they are clearly way over their heads.
---
NOT in patch notes, OR community patch notes. Shadow nerf.
---
One question: 
---
Why on earth would you want to do that? Who genuinely wants wood armor?
---
If you aren't in a team with them, and set the audio to team, you don't hear anyone but those on your team. 
---
This post has made me realize something: 
---
Bethesda sycophants are just helping Bethesda think their buggy mess and anti-consumer practices are OK. 
---
Please downvote  for hurt feel feels. 
---
Your better off bro. Take this as a sign. Tons of other games worth spending 900 hours on. 
---
I have a theory, because I have the same issue. As Bethesda plans on releasing more DLC, and since the overseer is wounded, but we find no body, then this must be an ongoing quest; one that'll never be finished.
---
You are giving to much credit to a developer that cant patch shit, had no cheat prevention at launch for an online game and they lie like no one business, and are overal incompetent. 
---
Umm I asked this 3 months ago but thank you for telling me that I think that could actually be it 
---
I didn't even know that was a legendary effect in the game lol. I've never seen it before. I'll have to be on the lookout for that now too

I've been playing since the beta, it seems you are the one that is confused as we have been talking about the 900 hour guy this entire time, at least I have. 
---
I am sorry that you struggle to stay on topic, I assumed you were able to maintain a conversation about a topic at hand. Sorry for overestimating you.
---
If it was all guns I’d say it might be the adrenal reaction fuckup (TBD if it’s a stealth nerf, a bug, or a mix of both) but otherwise, IDK. Card is equipped? Maybe remove and re-equip it? 
---
From what Ive experienced, the spoil filter works as it should. I just thing that some food has more durability than others so thats why it looks confusing. 
---
I.E. Steak has 5 min left but is at half condistion, but freshly picked flower has 4 min to spoil at full condition. 
---
Thank you I appreciate the back up on this.
---
Very unlikely. Also if you have 2 accounts, 2 systems, that's fishy as hell to start. 
---
&gt; Have they buffed a single thing since BETA? Seriously. All they want to do is nerf things left and right!
---
I think they buffed Fireproof to also resist explosive damage. That's the only one I really remember.
---
Then they nerfed the durability loss mitigation perks. Because of course.
---
Gazebo! I've seen some tiny ones in places..I want them. &gt;:O
---
Great place to visit. I’ve heard it can be difficult to live in. Grew up on the east coast and don’t remember hearing good things about WV very often. Perhaps something good WILL come from this game after all. WV has always needed a bit of an economic bump. This I can get behind.

Yes to this. A greenhouse set all-around would be great.

It is doable, for someone who devoted a month to it. People who are on 900 hours are most likely apart of the bottle cap sellers online.
---
You can say you find the game enjoyable. That's all fine and dandy, bit let's not pretend this was a "decent game", it's not. You can still have fun with shit in a bag if you set it on fire on your annoying neighbors lawn, doesnt change how it's still shit in a bag.
---
Yeas I agree everyone has the chance to be innocent but when a play comes on Reddit and says I have 900 hours all I do is farm and I just accidentally made 140,000 rounds of ultracite ammo. Also he has 3 different stories of why he got banned. He’s said on 3 different accounts that he was banned for being reported for his high level, switched ammo too much, or picked/made too much. So with the ungodly amount of ammo, the short amount of time and the story changes, I’d say he’s guilty but who am I to say it isn’t possible.
---
They just stealth nerfed melee.  This game is shit, I haven’t touched it in weeks but was about to until I heard they are stealth nerfing again.
---
Be upfront w/ your community in patch notes or you’ll end up pissing them off they’ll never come back. 
---
I’m almost inclined to record every gameplay session in case Bethesda decides to drop the ban hammer on me for this. 
---
You don't need teammates. I've done everything, and enjoyed everything, solo. Level 137 now.
---
Mine works perfectly I have both arms 
---
Looking at your commenting history shows signs of a very angry little person, just like in real life its survival of the fittest and in a apocalyptic scenario its more so. Just because someone doesn't play the way you like does not mean there is anything wrong with them. If games and other players make you so angry maybe a break is needed.
---
But if I find you in game, I will kill you and dieing doesn't bother me :)
---
I found a 2 shot broadsider on monday. Kept it to play around with, not sure why or what I'm expecting though.
---
I doubt that you were playing since beta. you are either lying or took a 3 month break. You being totally ignorant of past ban waves doesn't make sense
---
This is what the quality of all atom shop skins should be!
---
A bulletin board would be great, but is BGS gonna put a player hub in the game?
---
Let's not pretend you are a "reasonable person", or that you hold "opinions with merit".

My sister once fell in a puddle of oil at the bumper cars. Like a puddle so large it covered the entire front of her body. No amusement park should have an oil pool.

I hope not. I want the "Death" one in X-01.

Given all of the shelving for camps it has to be coming some time, right?
---
Has that been addressed by Beth? It would be pretty weird if all of the shelves were meant to be empty forever
---
I love this idea no one ever sees the freaking bag. And nobody uses headsets. So everytime I try and give away ammo or stimpacks I do the come over here emote then I'm jumping up and down shooting the bag and no one gets it. I'm just trying to give you stuff I don't need please don't run away.
---
Yeah. Ever since Patch 5, nukes have been rare. Also the servers have had small populations too, so I think its just people left after they nerfed TSEs.

I fast-travel to the event, not the school -- puts me in the school with the announcement starting.

Lever action reload being a bug that players had already fixed in fo4 because Beth wouldn't, yet it STILL persisted in 76 on release... that one'll stick with me
---
should be top post on this sub for all week.  11/10
---
Aw, that's kinda sad they were so excited and then disappointed. I had the same feeling about some parts. Especially Morgantown. The downtown is so cool in reality, and the game did a great job with Woodburn Circle, but that was about it. 
---
If you like RPGs and need a game with a big timesink, you could try Pathfinder:Kingmaker, there's a good 150-200hrs there easily 
---
Not as unlikely as you think. We already know based on how they cant punish dupe users directly, that they can not track were items come from. Meaning they track your inventory instead of the actual items. 
---
As for 2 accounts and 2 systems. Eh, to each their own. Smurf accounts are not unheard off. Its fishy yes, but let's not make dumb assumptions based on that alone without evidence.
---
I think you'll find it remarkably easy to make friends in-game. I have a half-dozen people I've met in the game that I've teamed up with, "clicked" with, and now whenever I see them online I send them a team request and adventure around with. Most of the people in this game are remarkably friendly and eager to cooperate. Give it a shot and I think you'll see that for yourself.

I am not ignorant of the previous ban waves, like the dev room ban, and such. I was just under the impression that we were talking about what the post were talking in is about. Do you not understand what staying on topic means?
---
I did this in reverse, made the game so much more interesting!
---
It is possible technically but difficult. 
---
Making 5mm with max Super Duper and Ammosmith requires \~1090 stable flux (840 glowing mass, 840 hardened mass, 8400 raw flux, 840 high radiation fluid), \~1090 ultracite (420 ore and acid or slightly less and some alternatives), \~8720 gunpowder, \~16350 lead and \~32700 steel.
---
Alternatively shotgun shells would be \~4510 stable  flux (\~3480 glowing mass, \~3480 hardened mass, \~45000 raw flux, \~3480 high radiation fluid), \~4510 ultracite (1740 ore and acid or slightly less and some alternatives), \~18000 gunpowder, \~18000 lead, \~45000 plastic, \~27000 steel.
---
This means, assuming this guy is very good (which he would have to be with this many hours) and reached endgame after about 20 hours (apparently 15 hours faster than average), with all crafting perks it would take gathering the following quantities of materials every hour without using any of them or spending any other time preparing for nuke zones or going through nuke launching:
---
1-3.5 glowing mass, hardened mass and high radiation fluid  
---
9-50 raw flux  
---
0.5-2 ultracite ore and acid  
---
10-22 gunpowder  
---
20 lead  
---
3-4 steel  
---
0-5 plastic
---
I am curious, were you making 350 STABLE or finding 350 RAW violet flux in a day?
---
It's there, converted my .50 back to standard ammo.
---
so 3 nocturnal wood armors instead of 1.  no f#cks to give.

So do the math, and prove him wrong.

Yo man you still selling screws

Thanks everyone I just did the whole get naked and close application and then Boom, light weight and strapped!

After reading both threads it seems your argument is that TS is more powerful but only when aiming down the sight?

That's great!

I'm a solo player, and want to be able to communicate with other people...just not with the downsides. haha

In game, or in general?

I get lonely

I appreciate you taking the time to reply. Some good thoughts there. As to the 1 month time frame, im a very active trader and i think most peoples caps were going to other players. 2k for a TSE here, 3k for a grog there type of thing. Those dupers and resellers would then fill up a regular players caps who rolled something unique and could sell it at a price that would buy several great weapons of equal value, but much lower rarity. That ebb and flow is gone now. For example, this week i tried to aquire a very common xbox dupe (supersledge). I bought one a month ago for 500 caps. Last week, i couldn't find one below 2k, this week, i was happy to pay 3k. Those prices are only going up. Here's the problem though; that guy i bought it off of won't be able to find any good new weapons for those caps i gave him. They're stuck in his inventory now. Trade only is obviously where the market is going. You see it as well as i do. I'm an active trader so i can see this market shift happening first, but others are catching up and within a month, everyone will know that they should not sell anything good for caps, because caps won't buy anything good. And then they've become useless. I have several weapons in my inventory that i would have sold for 2k or less a week ago. Today, i won't sell them at all, because that 2k won't get me anything. Yeah, 1 month is a guess, but that's my reasoning. 
---
I disagree. The market is going through a stabilization of sorts at the moment but the correction is coming.  
---
I have a combined 400 levels across my 5 characters, so you could imagine I’ve had thousands of drops, and you’re correct that roughly 98% of them are “vendor fare”. I’ve turned one of my characters into a stationary trader, with whom I transfer all my drops that pass the vendor check and set up a little shop outside whitespring train station and have been regularly trying to trade and sell items via discord, reddit and the old fashion way of just approaching/messaging randoms. After the TSE nerf this sub turned hyper toxic (to the point where I just couldn’t stomach it anymore) and I focused my attention on the available market subs, here are my observations-  
---
Pre duplication purge but post TSE nerf the marketplaces were absolutely flooded with nothing but TSE and Assasins/sentinel armor pieces that were almost certainly dupes, that has since been reigned in heavily, “top tier” armor pieces are still in high demand as everyone is trying to finish the various unyielding/assassins/vanguards/bolstering sentinel/cavalier sets but the supply is at *ahem all time low due to a certain event* and the same goes for the various anti armor and bloodied (although the supply of these was never duped at the extent of TSE weapons, so they were never as common to begin with) can fetch high amounts of caps but they are typically reserved for “trade only”. Eventually the remaining duplicated items will find permanent homes and the market will be organically driven again.  
---
Not everyone plays the same builds (I’d venture to say I’m in a micro minority of players who essentially have a build for each major weapon type) and good roll items will eventually start to resurface on the various trading hubs for reasonable prices and/or trades as you’ll frequently get solid roll items that just don’t fit your build (this is essentially what happened to me and each time I’d start a new character and tailor it).  
---
I do agree with you on having some sort of currency that can help you purchase weapons/armor from a vendor. I’m not a huge fan of static items, but maybe the ability to purchase say a combat shotgun (for example) with a random roll on it. A ton of frustration comes from taking down a three star on a rifle build to not only getting a one star item but it ends up being a rolling pin or something else dumb.  
---
Also, you’re power armor shop may not feel rewarding right now and that’s because this game is very light on endgame activities, when it starts to have more to do and it becomes a question of “what do I want to do with this session, farm materials and legendarys or go do a, b and c activity?” Right now all we really have to do is farm and craft. I’d still keep active doing that through the various means and try to carve out a “market presence” early before there is a need for such services but I wouldn’t get discouraged if it doesn’t feel super rewarding yet (honestly I think it will down the line.)  
---
Just my two cents.
---
Live and let live I reckon 
---
I thought the heavy breathing was fitting with power armor, or while wearing a gas mask.
---
You can't just server hop, there is a hidden aspect for it as well.  Farm them all, then go do something else at other POIs for a couple hours, then try again, if I just server hop I can only get four, if I go away from those 4 spots and do other things then hop I can usually grab them.

We've asked multiple times. He refuses to provide it. He just argues "No you're wrong" without contributing anything of his own to the discussion.
---
so is there a discord now for the mothman?
---
Warframe is really awesome.  I got sucked into it for a few months.
---
Why add content when you can stealth nerf and hinder players progression? 
---
I remit to ppl smarter than me that actually did the math and it was more than doable beside whe dont even know if he actually had that amount of ammo in is inventory if bethesda wanted to resolve this all they have to do is show the items he had in the inventory when they ban him. 
---
I did notice that after I looked at it again, its def not consistent. 
---
Let's assume 5mm, which is one of the the most common non-Shotgun ammo's and it can be easily collected in vanilla fashion so you'd never ever have to craft it yourself.    
---
  
---
Stable.  
---
Would be 8 hours of work +/- depending on luck and crashes, following a WhiteSprings day (6 to 9 hours) where I would collect between 250 and 500 Hardened masses etc.  
---
I have literally had more than 1,500 fluxes, all from harvesting on my mules pre-"Black Tuesday" Weight Nerf.    
---
Been shedding weight since the nerf, but was sitting an over 700,000 steel, over 100,000 gun powder.    
---
Currently have more than 1,400 Ultracite, a ?several? hundred Bulk steel, etc etc    
---
I agree with this post completely. In spite of being relatively "wealthy" I can't buy anything I actually want.
---
I have people approach me all the time for items I have but I'm not willing or even able to sell them because I'm capped on caps.
---
Then we should be talking about the legend 900 hours guy and ignorance of game journalists. Not about how the bans work or ammo counts and shiet. If you wanna stay on topic, be my guest and start deleting all the comments.
---
that's too much work when it comes to gaming, but kids these days can play for hours so 3 minutes to be a jerk is "reasonable." i think if i didnt trust a stranger i would just run away and not waste time. half the time i dont understand people's names as it is. 
---
I agree with you, which is why I am asking that Bethesda remedy the situation. 
---
BANHAMMER
---
Yes you are. 
---
So is vaccinating some cult you need to be beaten into?
---
I hate empath made me a feeble damage eater 
---
I don't know, man. I don't play anymore. 😐
---
Anyone downvoting this guy is blind, the engine, the management, the game, and the company is broken, and there needs to be change, anyone too blind to see this has gotta be lying to themselves about their faith in this company at this point.
---
Looks awesome. Great idea too. I get tired of the same 4x4 🏠 
---
I’m sure PvP would be more interesting without one shot encounters...
---
And in America, where all of Fallout takes place (minus Mothership Zeta, because I have a feeling you’ll bring that up up), they’re called just crosswalks. Maybe try Google yourself. 
---
Interesting. I will give this a try! 
---
nope.
---
Gotta get that MTO! 
---
&gt;...acquired over 100,000...within 30 days of game play.
---
Seriously... it's an amount over a duration... not a total.
---
I currently hold 2,000 or so 5.56mm rounds... but I can tell you've I've likely acquired 8k-10k in the last 30 days in my limited playtime.
---
Half of you would be silenced by Bethesda showing his current inventory totals, while the rest will need to wait and see if Bethesda can (dis)prove if he duped anything in acquiring the materials.
---
So the game has only been out 100 days by my count. How do you have 966 hours that's a solid 9 hours a day. How is that even possible? Does that include time afk but still in game?
---
There is no real advantage of the Tricentennial over the base game, so I'd go with the base game if it's even slightly cheaper. It's getting better despite the fact one new annoying bug is introduced each patch. I enjoy 76 more than 4, but not as much as I enjoyed 3 and NV when I played them. 
---
He doesn't know why hes banned, he wasn't saying why he was banned but why he thought he might have been.  Hes upset about loosing his account and thinking back what might have been the reason he was banned.
---
Out of all the people who are guilty of duplicating items, hes one case where I think Bethesda may have made a mistake.  He said he doesnt have that much ammo, that's the reason he is struggling to understand what it might have been that flagged that much ammo leading to the ban.
---
Out of all things to ban people for, I strongly believe that ammo which can be crafted in high amounts should not have been used to justify any bans.   Other items like nuka grenades or bobbleheads are far harder to get any any larger number by legitimate means.   If they would have replied to him saying he moved 10k bobble heads I'd say he duplicated the shirt out of them.
---
He put up the reply from Bethesda with the ammo numbers, someone does this to try to get traction in having Bethesda review their case because they honestly think they are innocent.
---
When someone says they were wrongfully banned and Bethesda sends them a reply showing they had 10k bobbleheads that person either disappears or tries to argue they were justified to duplicate them because of Bethesdas screwed up game, they dont keep trying to get back their account by looking for ways Bethesda might have came up with numbers far above what they actually have.
---
This guy is beating his head on a wall trying to figure it out, that's not what guilty people usually do.
---
&gt;For example you could drop and pick up the same stack of ammo for 1 day and would get banned based on the method they are using to ban people.
---
Nobody actually does this though. That's not a real example of actual player behavior.  Can you point to someone who actually got banned for picking up and dropping the same stack of ammo over and over again? I'll wait.
---
I think I spelled it out. 
---
The evening before the last patch someone on the server at level 52 was wandering around Whitespring wearing excavator armor and one shotting level 200 guys with a some sort of souped up super sledge and I decided to have a go at him with my gatling gun and it didn't seem to damage him at all.
---
So I died, which pissed me off. Then I respawned and thought hmm maybe I can snipe him if I'm careful. So I found him near the overseer's camp and I fast travelled near him and as I'm watching him through my scope AS HE'S RUNNING AWAY HOLDING A SUPER SLEDGE somehow he snipes me from behind a tree while I'm invisible.
---
I don't know what the hell was up with that after that and I just switched servers and I haven't seen anyone like that since. But it sure does seem like assholishness is on the rise.
---
&gt; Nearly all the Legendaries in Fallout 4 were garbage
---
Which was fine because it was a singleplayer game. Also on PC you could tailor legendary items using the command console.
---
It sure does feel lonely. I have to be up super early and log on for about 20-30 minutes around 3am est to do a lead and plastic run and 3-4 times in the last week the entire server was mine. It's actually pretty rad since I know all the goods won't be plundered but it's depressing at the same time.
---
I agree with the 900 hour guy I consider him innocent and think he was wrongfully suspended and I hope the journalists rake BSG over the fires for yet another screw up. Just like when they broke their entire end game for a week making nukes unlaunchable.
---
This is inspiring 
---
idk... i bought f76 for both my boys, watched them play it.  isnt playing fallout punishment enough, let alone 900 hours of it?
---
You mean?
---
But the time the server figures out the condition and applies the mitigation, you're ficked. Especially true given how quickly condition changes during "moments of truth".
---
Works for far western Appalacian foothills too. (Eastern edge of Ohio)
---
Exactly, it’s absolutely bullshit
---
To my understanding, what they fixed was making it so you can initiate a contest against the workshop from anywhere in the boundaries. That wouldn't change becoming wanted by picking a lock. It would just make it so you don't need to pick a lock to GET to the workbench.
---
The scenario I'm talking about is more like finding a random safe or toolbox that's locked, picking it, and ending up wanted because you didn't realize it was considered "owned."
---
Don't
---
Actually 3 weightless armor but if you dont care why stop to read the post?
---
Clearly they should be over it in a week or two??  It's not like they had personal or emotional investments! /s
---
I have been trying to do it again. But ive been only getting 1/1 maybe i just caught a glitch. 
---
I had a lethargic life in a vault, I can't help it if I am unfit.
---
Every time I'm at Uranium Fever the players always let everyone in on the bosses.
---
the only time the phrase "good guy Bethesda" should ever be said.
---
Yeah well.. that's not exactly what we were talking about and that tells us that you were WAY off topic to begin with. Live up to your words brah
---
Thank you for the clarification.
---
It would seem that the main content of the game is the drama created between those who enjoy a Fallout Fortnite type experience and those who wish to play without doing PvP. 
---
Personally my enjoyment comes from the grinding, building, assisting others, and creating community. I don't understand the mindset of destruction and griefing that I have witnessed. 
---
I guess you don't *need* teammates, it just makes it more fun on average. I've been solo for most of my playtime, but it always seems more fun to me when I have a second person to play along with
---
“We’re done shadow nerfing! We will be totally open and transparent with the community that’s left supporting the game!”
---
*instantly tries to shadow nerf the new viable build style post TSE without telling anyone*
---
Just...just wow, Bethesda. You deserve this. 
---
Sigh.... you make the rest of us Americans look like self centered assholes. Please stop 
---
They gave you a pip-boy.
---
This will do nothing to keep the PvP griefers from killing folks who just want to play the game coop.
---
Your arguments are completely illogical and only prove how weak your defense of Bethesda’s actions are. Why are you defending them so heavily? At the bottom I have rephrased my question, hopefully this wording will help you find an answer.
---
Mistress costume - your point about armor means that in order to have four full members your team then has to pay $40 ($10 each for the 1100 atom pack), don’t see how this really helps your argument. Yes inspector was glitched in the same way, but I believe that was patched yesterday and never intended.
---
Toys and Weight - can you buy extra carry weight with real world money, this is a clear red herring trying to distract from the fact that Bethesda is selling game buffs for rwm. Imagine being rewarded for inventory management, on top of that you could always choose to go over-encumbered. Maybe I can open up a line of credit in the atom shop and do challenges to pay it off?
---
Paid for costume, not boost - was the boost attainable through any other means? Did I miss were you could get the boost for changing your name to the silver shroud, grognak, or the inspector. Again, this faulty logic as the only way to obtain the boost was through purchasing the cosmetic. If holding issues of the comics counted, then yes this would be relevant.
---
Grind out the atoms - so your saying higher level players could have better stats? Gee if only normal progression was like that. You’re talking about the equivalent of grinding for legendaries, only this takes out the guessing game of the reward. And atoms become few and far between once you play for a few hundred hours. Between bugged challenges, impossible feats (7600 hrs played), and general player fatigue, the game doesn’t throw atoms at you other than the 10 daily for leveling up. For example, I have 480 hrs in game, it would guess it would take me two weeks to grind out 800 atoms. If you don’t have them saved up from before the event started, in order to gain extra benefits you were forced to purchase atom packs.
---
Allow me to rephrase the question, why should a team of four willing to spend $40 over the cost of the game, be given a 60 hp bonus each and all be able to wear full armor, when my team who paid full price for the game and is high level only given 15 hp each and one member has to be virtually naked?
---
Do you think it might have something to do with new content? Maybe a vault opens or some such and these guys come out as bosses?
---
It makes perfect sense to me. If you only look at an individuals items gained and don't balance the items lost you can easily count the same items every time they are moved. If I give you $10 and then you give it back to me, then we do that 10 times, did you gain $100?
---
They could track things like that if they were actually competent in making the game fair + actually built for multiplayer. (As well as an engine update but that's never going to happen.)
---
Looking for easy ballistic fiber? Lol
---
Maybe the SBQ's damage resistance should be calculated not by the # of players but by the sum of the players' levels...
---
OP isn't focused on 900 hours guy tho. He's rather focused on shittiness of game media nowadays. You should read more books
---

Honestly I kinda wish nuke zones were more crazy free for all's like this, makes them feel more dangerous
---
I remember that post, but didn't save it. Now want to know where it is lol
---
Good luck trying to argue that to get your account reinstated.
---
I have a 1070, good i5, 16 ram and it still slows. We need to find the post that commenter was talking about.
---
They banned the one person who actually cared about the game LMAOOOOOO
---
I can't believe this game keeps giving me things to laugh about
---
Actually just getting into the spirit of the week.  Seemed like a fun idea...not a very cost effective way to get BF lol
---
Which is weird considering it is on the "pestilence" skin and not the "plague" one. 
---
They are both buffs by definition. You are taking something and making better. 
---
By your logic buffing auto receivers would be nerfing ballistic armor
---
This worked.  Thank you.

No, that's not really it. What I see when I sort by spoiled is something like: Anything without a spoil meter which could be canned food or chems, then spoilable food (which does sort by condition), then some other nonsense like stimpaks. So I'm still scrolling through a huge list to find what I need, and basically examining specifics on every item.
---
What I don't see is spoiled food at the top of the list, which is the only way that it would really make sense to sort food if you wanted to see what needed to be used first.
---
So no new actual content? Cool
---
Ammo at that large amount not only would take forever to get if he made it all and if he didn't and it was a small amount it still doesn't make sense to switch it 100 times especially since he has bandoliers and that makes them practically weightless. And just because he makes a sob story on reddit about him getting banned doesn't mean anything. The best way to contact bethesda is through a support ticket. And yes it would suck for my account to be banned under false pretenses but without a 100% access to bethesda to see how they calculated it there is no way of knowing for sure, and it doesn't really help anyone's case when you bash on bethesda, yes they make mistakes but it doesn't give you the go ahead to bash them. 
---
That’s the rub. Until you finally get a response from Bethesda you don’t know. The initial email is generic.  I’m on day 4 waiting for a response. 
---
I purposely go after these people
---
Where the fuck are people finding these empty servers? I've had an empty server like once.
---
CONGRATULATIONS OMG
---
I don't like that I can't fully see it before I buy it. The Atom Shop pictures look  "cheap" to me 
---
He is saying the media is shitty because he doesn't believe the 900 hour guy while the media does. The fact I agree with the media that what BSG did to the 900 hour guy is utter shit and by pointing out that the 900 hour guy could easily reach those numbers legitimately IS on topic.
---
Sorry you don't understand that you can disagree with someone in a conversation while staying on topic.  
---
Well not really, Beteshda keeps fucking you up, so we got news like this, so since the saga got ruined for me since the day it became a first person shooter, at least now i can enjoy WACKY SHENANIGANS OF A SHITTY COMPANY, EYUP!
---
If you have to watch 40 minutes of insecure, unscripted rambling in order to seek and digest information....
---
Yeah.
---
You shouldn't try to argue it. It's common sense by now. Don't dupe, don't break the servers, don't spew hate speech.
---
I'm calling you, you a mouth breather.
---
Go watch another youtube video, maybe you'll get an opinion someone will respect from it.
---
Pretty much, this is just another day at the office for your internet news. People are bringing it up because they know the finer details to the story but this isn't a special case... this is just every second "news" report wanting those sweet clicks. Then you'll have your mighty news/drama youtubers swooping in to report this article but also give their own opinion that apparently matters, twisting the entire story even further from the truth. Welcome to 2019.
---
At least with Battlefield you get a polished PvP experience. PvP has no place in Fallout. Only bought this to play with my spouse. Would have rather had a local coop experience, but this is what we have to work with.
---
Wait...isn't that based on Nerd Rage?
---
Used to see frag grenades on the grafton town super mutants from 5-50 then the real loot pop in
---
I was saying that patches will not help more of, welp what's the word. "Polish" the game, if we really want improvement we must get a better PVP system, add single player, NPC's and better graphics (and a good plotline please) i was not in anyway saying that it's unacceptable i play it myself, in fact i am doing to right now, the game is a good concept and multiplayer is really fun but we still want a good, polished game like new vegas or 3, and please give more context to this i would like your thoughts on this and what you think about the game itself
---
Sounds like a cool community thing to do , I encounter him already 3 times today alone lol 
---
No not everything sorry, just the the excess things that got copied until you can build new things again 
---
Great job! I built one around the treehouse on the eastern-most road, it is absolute garbage in comparison. 
---
Uh, no, it is literally what this thread is about, the OP disagrees with the media and thinks the 900 hour guy isn't innocent and the number of ammo he reached is impossible, yet the math has been done and it could easily be reached in like a week of playing. 
---
So while he may be trying to act like "Oh the media is shitty because they don't agree with my preconceived notions." Pointing out that the 900 hour guy could easily get those number by playing the game and not exploiting IS on topic. 
---
Sorry you fail at understanding that.
---
They said a few weeks ago that they removed the duplicated items, the dupers, and the crafting glitch they used to dupe. Then they fixed the carry weight to prevent duplication in mass from happening again. The folks they are having now simply gather over a magic number over the course of a 30 day period. No indication they still had those items.  
---
Only the first patch was huge, most of the patches since have been 5-8 GB on console and slightly less on PC.
---
Just note that if you buy physical, you will probably need a 50 GB ish patch to catch up to the current game version.
---
Im not sure if a digital download version is the same as the current game version or if it requires an update, or if a digital download is an option for you.
---
I can tell you right now that they would definitely be willing to get test servers up, if they aren't already working on it. As for the second part: no way in hell. 
---
The real issue here is - with their PvP settings, no weapon should be powerful enough to one-shot *anyone* who isn't PvP enabled.  Period.
---
Its like they came up with the worst possible PvP solution.  Its mindboggling when there already has been a completely useful way to do this right from back in the days of WoW - a manual toggle where either you're immune from (and can't do) PvP damage or you're not.  No 'tapping' over and over again.  
---
Then, if you want open PvP - you just turn it on.  You can PvP with others doing the same and no one can screw with those not doing it.
---
This system has left juuuuuuust enough leeway for griefers to exploit while being totally inconvenient to the rest of the PvPers.
---
Full disclosure, I’ve not gone for any mutations, picked up a couple but rad away and they went away. How do you selectively keep one?
---
Oh boy do I have a list for you!
---
* Elevators like in Fallout 4  
---
* Raised dirt beds for indoor gardening  
---
* Hydroponic pods for advanced gardening  
---
* Small pet structures (radroach terrarium, molerat tube maze, etc)  
---
* A god damn bar to be able to "craft" alcoholic beverages and cocktails  
---
* Manufacturing plants like in Fallout 4 that can be hooked up to resource extractors; for example, if I have an acid extractor, I'd like to be able to drop all my ores in the Manufacturer and just have the system slowly process all my ore as the extractor generates acid.  
---
* Power armor launch pad: Put on power armor, step onto the launch pad, select a destination, then get fired out of a cannon hurtling toward your target like a human bullet!
---
Is marsupial nerfed or have they fixed it? 50% of the time, I stopped jumping like a kangaroo till I relogged
---
He mentioned 900 hours guy to support the idea of game medias being shitty. He did mention 900 hours guy yes, but just mentioning it does not make it a topic.
---
I’ll check out quick hands next level. Thanks!
---
standard version: yes (if you can get them cheap, below $40 of course)
---
tricen version: absolutely not (I bought this one..)
---
The AVR Medical Center in Charleston for plastic and meds - Charleston in general - lots of low level super mutants, some snallygasters and Grafton monsters - all sorts of junk in the capitol building 
---
My god why? I mean other than the groot deal? like .... why?
---
Whats this text mod? Is this only for PC?
---
A bunch of ppl that werent on our xbox server magically popped in to kill the sbq then dipped. Is there some mod that let's them know a nukes dropping on a different server?
---
I do shoot her. I get down up in her butt and blast away with a Prime shotty when she lands, as well as take shots from the roof when she's hovering/flying over. You extrapolated from my comment that I *never* do so because you just want to get salty about people not playing exactly the way you want them to.
---
Every update so far has had serious bugs and problems, some even requiring an emergency hot fix.  Why folks are still able to disbelieve Bethesda is capable of not getting this recent ban 100 percent right is beyond me.  
---
There isn’t - to my knowledge - any right or expectation of service that could be sued for. A TOS violation on a digital goods service basically gives most companies carte blanche to terminate their relationship with you and end all contact.
---
I think my dragon is like 365, that pistol sounds like fun!
---
Why would they do that?  All current servers are already test servers.
---
you're the ones trying to correct the record on a video game story lmfao
---
Honestly the first line of your post had me standing at attention, up in arms ready to fight for the good of my fellow soldier.
---
Only for PC, but essentially it's in game chat
---
You should definitely just play Warframe
---
Just read the starched genes perk...
---
I'm not disagreeing that the game or its management have very serious flaws. I just thought in this specific instance people in media seem to be rushing to defend a chap we aren't even sure is legit.
---
I suggested the med supply cabinets because they already exist at all current vendor locations, and are basically useless, since the vendors also sell aid supplies.
---
The Items should be available at any location, just as several vendors now have a shared cap pool.
---
I would also like a way to set up shop, preferably in a location that is PvP free and has a free FT point, maybe with vendor areas set up with Counters, Stash Boxes, and interchangeable signs.
---
Though I have noticed there are many players who simply don't want to interact with anyone, and vending machines would be great for them.
---
Aww someones having a bad day
---
Except he mentioned that the reason for coming up with post is coming from feeling overall sadness over the state of media today, which automatically makes it a topic lol
---
Submit a ticket if you haven’t already done so. And unfortunately the only thing we can do is wait for them to throw us a bone.  
---
This might actually work
---
When it is literally the only thing in the post title? LOL, okay.
---
AMERICA
---
Also I appreciate all the work you are putting in figuring this all out!
---
Great insight, thanks
---
How to unlock the recipe?
---
No I get it, I was just talking shit. I'm an old lady myself.
---
It's definitely frustrating. I don't really care for Adrenal even though I have it so this latest screw up doesn't really affect me, but I totally get why people are mad and they should be. 
---
If you're on PS4 I'd be happy to give you some mats/serums/what-have-you if that would help, but honestly I think the best thing we can do is wait this one out and hope they fix it. *Shrug*
---
It was funny to encounter this. Here I was looking for the mothman... Instead, I was fight against mother earth lol.
---
As of recently, I notice more guns working in VATS. Hopefully things are working more as intended. I hope.
---
Thanks, fixed ;)
---
@Bethesda, I was actually just thinking this today too!
---
I miss our college road trips to WV to buy grain alcohol. 
---
I did. Just waiting now I guess
---
Quality content is quality
---
Wow dude, I'm so sorry you got banned. Bethesda is desperate to tank their own game, it seems.
---
There's at least one in every bunch, I suppose. Now, I just donate to the flatwoods overseer's stash box, and bypass the fuss.
---
I doubt Im banned, but if I am I havent played for like 6 weeks so I dont care.
---
Www.cedit.com/r/fo76
---
So this 900hr guy gets called a duper and nobody gives a shit,ok.
---
Sounds like the community really dont like him.
---
So less nerfing the overall damage and more compressing its effective range so that it only actually starts applying when you're more seriously injured, making a build that relies on it more dangerous because you have to hover at a lower hp.
---
The servers are 24 players, not 12, but I dig your idea, and I don't think the server count would affect anything anyway.
---
I tend to get a bug where mutations lose their positive effects but not the negative one, this always happens because I either: Got rad worms recently and havent restarted yet or; I have Stranger in Numbers equipped after playing in a team and I am still alone in that team (seems to mess with the perk for some reason)
---
We are still way off topic just so you know, Live up to yo words
---
last night i was waving, flashing the pip boy..shooting next to the bag..but the level 5 just ran off
---
&gt; I am taking "acquire" to imply crafted, bought, looted, or picked up from a bag or container.
---
coming here looking into this issue from the outside and i have seen no proof that this is the definition that BSG is using for the word "acquire". I have seen no reason to think that it means anything other than "that item showing up in your inventory". If it was possible to track the source of an item then they would have the source of that item flagges somewhere in their database and would simply say "yeah we can track where that came from", and that does not appear to be the case.   
---
I have to deal with SQL databases all the time for work and inventory tracking is a big part of it. We have what are called RTA (receive transfer adjust) reports that tell us what inventory moved where and why, specifically to answer these kinds of questions. The press and community are making assumptions that SHOULD HAVE hard definitions on BSGs end that i cant seem to find them communicating. Please link me a source for that if i have missed it.
---
What about repairing the landing pad at the munitions factory, destroying the vertibot and fixing it over and over? 
---
Not sure what level you would need to reach but at some point you could have most cards available, at every card rank. So for example around level ~1260 (30x7x1 + 30x7x2 + 30x7x3), you would have 1-rank through 3-rankt of the currently known cards and the ability to un-equip and equip them in increments. My dirty math takes into account the levels required to combine perks into rank 2 and 3 but not beyond rank 3.
---
I don't think it's that. I play solo and the list is either fully checked or pristine depending on the server. I obviously killed all of them,and killed one of each again but the challenge doesn't work.
---
love seeing the tears of cheaters  
---
no sympathy for you whatsoever
---
World of Warcraft established industry precedent on people buying and using multiple accounts. Long story short, we in the game industry are generally a fan of people buying themselves multiple copies/ subscriptions. They guy who played fourWoW accounts simultaneously with a modded keyboard is a legend. 
---
Not to say I know Fallout 76 is upholding this, as I do not, but I would be very surprised. 
---
This is really great! I think it's the best build I've seen so far. I too love cozy builds more than gigantic mansions so there are plants pretty much everywhere lol. Also, your outside table area is to die for! I'm gonna have to incorporate something like it to my back porch at my lakeside house!
---
Yeah, I get angry at griefers, because they do evil, pathetic, psychotic shit.  Pardon me for being offended at inexcusable behavior by evil people. 
---
Lmfao this shit has to go viral for this to make any progress. Fuckin you dumb fucks. The one guy actually enjoying this game gets fucking banned. You're fucking laughable 
---
Shhh, let him look through the notes first. I want to hear that dirty little mouth say it ;)
---
 Yes it does. Its just interesting that happens. I'm not about to take off my armor to do this, just as I won't be doing bloodied low health stuff. Well maybe for the jollies but its not how I operate.
---
We call them zebra crossings in Washington... I think this guy is a little bit angry.
---
&gt;How is Metro?
---
It won't be in GOTY contention, but should be
---
I bought it at full price before the beta and have no regrets. 
---
Yeah you keep dragging it off topic for some reason, probably because I already proved you wrong about the 900 hour guy. Yet here you are still going off topic.
---
I also bet you are going to reply with more off topic stuff after this right? LOL
---
Ill give you a better answer than ‘yes the economy sucks but Bethesda is guaranteed to make it worse because their varsity team is working on Starfiele.’
---
Drop rates change a lot of balance, so that’s not a great idea unless you want every player on the server wearing sentinel assassin gear.
---
May I suggest actually making unique items useful?   Most of them are really bleh, horribly underpowered when compared to most random legendaries, and are only useful as vendor not fodder.   Which is disappointing, as they had some decent gear in fallout 4.  
---
So enhance the uniques, maybe even creating set items that players must grind for.  Make tali’s uniques super rare, and only available for purchase (with CAPS!) after epic raids.   And lock them down so they must be earned, not traded for.  True prestige gear, which the dupers can never touch.  This change results in more content, yielding better items, while making caps useful again.  Easy-peezy.
---
You realize I sill like this game, despite Bethesda’s constant screwups.  I’m really hoping they turn it over to private servers soon, so modders who understand what makes Fallout great can have a whack at achieving its real potential.
---
I want it so I can wear it. I genuinely want it, give it to me.
---
Tricentennial isn't worth the extra price IMO. The Tricentennial paint is only available for like 3 weapons, and Power Armor. 
---
FYI, I got the Tricentennial edition for $30 at my local Costco
---
Sounds like New Jersey
---
Do you think it might be possible that Bethesda maybe fucked something up?
---
What?
---
I am on PC, but a bit of a loner. Haha.  I kind of live for those random, two-passing-ships-in-the-night friendly encounters with other players, though!
---
if you've been duplicating I wouldn't bother.
---
So I can wear it! I have enough max level Heavy Combat Sentinel/Cavalier w/ reduced weapon/ammo weight. I want to get primal. Give me your wood.
---
the -11 strength with none helping offset this reduction of strength makes me not want all mutations. i am melee. what is your strength at with 17 mutations?
---
 Which is cheating but for a single player game that's not really a problem. I confined myself to noclip.
---
Your terrible trench analogy aside.. I think someone who played this game for 900 hours knows about trading but hey maybe you’re right, doubt it tho. I’m responding to the scrubs who say it can’t be done but it’s a big wasteland out there and I’ve traded a god roll shiskebab for 70k ultracite ammo so I just think you’re misinformed  on what goes on. Make sure you wash that fork before you serve up some more BS
---
Yeah, that's why I was thinking stimpacks would be a good idea. Just load up on them and be a makeshift field medic, haha
---
But I am just looking at ultracite ammo, standard ammo is easy to obtain high amounts, I have had almost 40k of some ammo and I play casually. Keep in mind, crafting ultracite 5mm requires luck of the draw as well in obtaining a prime receiver for either the minigun or gatling gun. These calculations also assume focusing your entire playstyle around crafting ammo for that gun without ever using it.
---
Finally something worth money
---
Anythingto set on things! Other than plants n lamps.... give me fun items like pool balls for my table 
---
Isn't that intentional?  You know, forcing you to play the game instead of camping on whatever the best loot drop is and just sitting there looting the same spot again and again?
---
1250 atoma
---
I usually hit them with the "follow me" emote, then aim at and shoot the bag until they catch on. Sometimes I blink the pip boy light too, lol.
---
Yeah. I mean at least you should try to stay on topic right? I don't see you even trying
---
Guy was a real douche canoe to play on a team with. 
---
Haven't played in a few weeks, been playing KH3, but I've been keeping up with patch notes and there are definitely some welcomed changes here. Also an improvement on the dev notes side to explain some of the fixes. I really hope you guys keep it up and I think I might return once some new content starts rolling out.
---
I play mostly solo, but lately have joined a couple of teams, and occasionally I have followers, because I often give things away. My point is that even if you don't know anyone else who plays, you can enjoy it solo, or make online friends. 
---
Except for the fact that people in this subreddit did the math afterwrd and it turns out if he was multiboxing it would be trivial for him to get that much ammo over a 30 day period. It was figured out it could actually be done in a week:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aset43/ammo_crafting_math_re_is_it_possible_to_craft/egwlui5/
---
They tell us in patch notes that the duplicated items are removed, the worst duper’s are removed and that the carry weight limit has been set to prevent any future mass duping if new exploits are found. Then why continue to go after folks who may have had big numbers of items in their inventory?  They’ve got so many problems with the content that’s been out for 3 months. Why not dedicate time to fixing that mess instead of harassing the paying customers?
---
is this some weird British shit?
---
I played Skyrim for literally every waking hour for the first week it was out.
---
Yeah...my OCD is going to be warring with my min-maxing on this one.
---
Well thats what my X01 atom shop camo paint job looks like right now. It either goes to a neon pink with robot vandalisms or goes full chameleon even when not on sneak. And yes the yao guai can still detect you from a mile away and would beat you blue for wearing that obnoxious looking PA.
---
True, but against those mobs your weapon regardless AA or TS is an overkill. The focus should be on high DR mobs like SM Warlords with 200+ resistance or SBQ will 400+. 
---
No, I'm from Canada, so technically yes.
---
Wouldn't that make the game pay to win? If people can just pump money into atoms for the best guns then we'll still have a supply and demand problem.
---
Sneak vats critical 
---
Why does this sound like the Zyborne Clock theory?
---
My Bethesda account was closed too. I can’t submit a ticket to find out why. 
---
Depends also on other factors, as you know. Not online now, but will chech the impact and let you know.
---
So you wanna sell them? 
---
No. No duping for me. I don't roll like that.
---
Unfortunately, though, the lockpicking boost was merely visual. With two perk cards equipped, it would tell you you had lvl 3 lockpicking, but you couldn't open a lvl 3 lock, just lvl 2 ones.
---
But I would have loved if lvl 4 actually enabled you to walk right through locked doors, Matrix style.
---
Get a friend/nuke partner and have them anchor the server. I stopped doing it alone.
---
Banned from a garbage game. Sounds like you were done a favour. 
---
Me and my brother and our friends all built our camps near the nuka factory and not super close but close enough to see each other you know? I know the orange borders don't intersect for a fact. But nope, not allowed. Wtf
---
“Lazy and not helpful at all” pretty much sums up 95% of the mods around Reddit. 
---
Use the "no" emote maybe?
---
Thanks Bethesda, for literally banning the only fucking people that are left who play your newest game, and ruining the experience for everyone else, great incentive. The die-hard fans who have been playing for 10+ years. Great strategy. Good luck with Elder Scrolls 6 by the way, I'm sure it will be a hit
---
oof 
---
Bethesda is trying to get me to buy Juuls idk
---
Eh. Non issue mostly. 
---
See, if I enjoy something, I have no problem with premium options. Fuck stuff like division and overwatch and phone games where it’s 100$ for garbage. But I’d pay 5$ a month for them to pay for extra server space and give me 1000 carry weight. QoL is a premium just like in real life. 5$ is nothing
---
Yes this exact situation has happened to me!
---
PS4?
---
You can try a database rebuild from safe mode.
---
I believe this is more an issue with the PS4 than the game.  I got several of these crashes playing Spider-Man.
---
A week is not enough time to turn that around but a public test realm would be helpful. 
---
So each set only has one camo then it seems? Which is a tad disappointing.
---
Also imo, these are too... 'Skyrim-y' for '76
---
Probably just take it and run. 
---
Must have taken time to come up with "witty" closing line. I wasn't trying to come off aggressive, I was merely using the analogy to make a point that there are many things possible but the chances of achieving it is highly unlikely. For example, there's a possibility you COULD quit being an apologist cunt for cheaters but once again, the chances are unlikely.
---
Yeah, and people have done the math in this subreddit already and that is easily reachable in 30 days if he was multiboxing like he said he was. They did the math and it turns out multiboxing he would be able to get that much in roughly a week of hard grinding.
---
Oh, absolutely this. I was gifted a pair of sweet guns at the start of my game and I used the hunting rifle (with minor tweaks) for almost 20 levels. I was so appreciative of the gift and at this point I have so much extra stuff so I try to pay it forward whenever I can by giving little gifts of guns, ammo, plans, etc. to new players when I see them. I've encountered more than one new player who didn't seem to get what I was trying to do (or actively avoided me). It'd be nice to at least be able to emote my intentions!
---
Fuckin hell yes 
---
Bruh, there are 4 Chainsaws in the entirely of the game. They reset every thirty-six hours. That is a little intense.
---
Issued date 2011 ?
---
I'm sure he means 2k+ paper damage.
---
Wow so many great ideas in one post!!! I wonder which Bethesda will implement first. 
---
If harpoon gun can equip with a silencer, yes.
---
Have fun in Warframe fam. Much better game.
---
I actually enjoyed the rad worms, it gave me an extra 200 lbs carry weight!!!! Lol
---
Not sure of it intentional or a glitch but it didnt take any special duping or anything to get. 
---
But its either got a really rare spawn on it or more likely its a glitch as people tend to find them on the ground (as if someone who was doing the event left with it on and the system dropped it on the ground) as its the actual mask and not a player bag.
---
I could be wrong as ive only seen a couple posts on it but the ones that ive read have found it laying on the ground around watoga
---
People just wont admit that the game is insanely flawed. But theres enjoyment somewhere in it even I can say that. I just dont like playing it much anymore because I keep asking myself how the game could have gone if Beth hadnt done the inane things they went with in its design.
---
Again I’ll say it AGAIN, this man did not need to grind all those mats himself. You are forgetting that there is a huge trading community. Bet you won’t respond to that tho because you wanna act like it’s impossible, it’s not. I’ve personally traded a godroll shiskebab for 70k ultracite ammo so just goes to show ammo is obtainable in mass quantities. 
---
I’m not gonna talk about how shitty your luck may or may not be, personally I think karma has a lot to do with that so just keep it in mind, but yeah I was able to one shot SB easily before the TSE patch and can still kill them in about 3-5 hits. One of my characters is based right on a fissure and all I do is farm ultracite. I could easily gather 2500 ultracite in a matter of 20 hours. Then guess what I do with it all? I sell it to traders.. it’s funny to me you refuse to accept there’s a huge marketplace for these materials in game.
---
yes PS4. Unfamiliar with a DB rebuild.  Will look it up.  is there any potential negative consequences?
---
Notice we can't see how many upvotes a post gets now? I guess when that guy gets more upvotes than the patch notes, or just about any other post on this subreddit ever, it makes the shills a little uneasy and feeling like they need to change the system to take back control from the uprising.
---
No it doesn’t hurt the consumer. Life is not F2P. If anything, it teaches you life lessons early lol. 
---
Have you not played SWTOR? WOW? Paid for XBOX Live? Those are pay to play subscriptions. And they are arguable much better  hen any F2P game. 
---
A few bucks here and there is nothing. I’ve got an awesome corporate job, benefits, and I can afford it o enjoy my games.
---
The outer ring of people interested in '76 but not playing it are still finding great joy and reassurance by reading "how terrible this fucked up trash dlc is".
---
The writers and YouTubers are pandering to that
---
I've actually experienced this bug before this patch. I think it's gone unnoticed for the most part, and it was the worst glitch I've experienced to date. I think I noticed it about 2 months ago, and I just had to revert a save (not sure how far back) to fix it.
---
Yeah, fuck trying to spread false news getting spread about something you enjoy! It's so much easier to just let everyone hate a company you love over nothing!
---
I did tho, had 3 friends they all got kicked too and none of us could join back in on other people we kept getting kicked. I think it has to do with the new server feature where if it’s old it just kicks players, I think it’s bugged somehow. sorry I’ll edit the OP to reflect that I was in a team and had anchors 
---
I mean it does make sense. Just to expand on that a bit, go take a legendary item you have on your character and put it in a container and close the container and then open the container back up and take your legendary back out of the container. You will get the pop up like it is the first time you ever picked that legendary item up.
---
So, that shows that the game does not keep track of what items you've already had in your inventory and treats them as a new item every time you pick the item up.
---
I’m mostly just here from a link to this story but I actually did something similar when I was made unemployed over a decade ago. I lived in a one horse town and I couldn’t find a job for weeks, so what I did for those weeks was Oblivion. All day every day with quest mods and random completionist crud afterwards.
---
My Oblivion binge wasn’t even too bad or too long. Compared to WoW, Second Life or RuneScape junkies those are rookie numbers. 900 hours is shockingly doable.
---
&gt; 'cure mutations and reapply' in my eyes is not a fix. 
---
All of this right here. It's just kinda insane because there's either a lot of work/luck, a lot of caps, or taking to the third-party market to find hopefully a reputable serum source, that if you're running a lot of mutations could STILL cost you a couple thousand caps easily.
---
*hits vape*
---
Aw yea had that happen a few times. :/
---
I barely know you! lol 
---
Hahahahaha
---
If I see someone's camp and like it I'd totally leave a message for them complimenting their build.
---
That being said for every one of me I'm sure there's 2 other people who would just leave a recording of them eating their mic and then burping or some shit. 
---
It’s possible but that much? Do you think it’s possible people are lying and know damn well they dupped or a friend did it for them but are lying?
---
They ain't gonna ban you for that don't be ridiculous.
---
Considering it can be life or death for a child or children plural if you let some internet personality convince you they're a government experiment to make our children weak to subscribe to a lifetime of medical fees, yeah it kind of should be. 
---
Maybe you were.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ dude, I don't know what's up your ass but maybe you should have taken a second to notice I'm not whoever you've been fucking arguing with this about.  So maybe instead of lashing out at every single person who dare disagree with you you can take your inflated opinion of yourself and shove it straight up your own ass.
---
It doesn't mention silencers or suppressors, only silenced weapons.
---
The crossbow and harpoon gun are "silent" (FYI in my testing the harpoon gun also has 100% armor penetration by default).
---
Haven't gotten the card yet though to test.
---
So it's weird French shit?
---
No I was merely going by your own words. 
---
They fixed those. I was giving away unneeded stuff to some lower levels and they got excited and started hitting the pie machine in a red rocket. I went to join in the fun them and one of them accidentally hit me and triggered both it didn't trigger pvp but they didn't know what was going on and they just ran out of there.
---
Honestly, with the amount of changes that bethesda makes without putting them in change notes, and the amount of bugs they re-add... Who is able to say it is working properly, and people are not understanding vs it got broken by accident.
---
But realistically, if there is a game mechanic that is so poorly understood that most people believe it is a bug, bethesda probably should tweak it, or actually come clean about how it is *meant* to work.
---
&gt; your choices in response are to either stop playing video games, or try your hardest to convince the entire industry to change
---
Or.. You know.. Stop buying shoddily made, half assed, cash grab games. Vote with your wallet kiddo.
---
Elevators,Weapon/Armor displays, Shelves, Bobble Head Displays, and other display items to show off my Teddy Bear collection. Oh also dirt plots for indoor farming
---
I mean look at it from the guys perspective that got banned, if he truly was innocent wouldn't he be grasping as straws and trying to wonder WTF caused your character to be banned if you never cheated? 
---
Also, it is pretty much guaranteed what you said is how it happened. You can even see this yourself by putting a legendary you have in a container, closing the container and then opening the container back up and taking out the legendary, you'll get the pop up like you did when you first got the legendary. Which shows that the game has no flag to see if the item you pick up is an item you had already had previously, like a large stack of ammo...
---
Looks like Warhammer 40k
---
https://youtu.be/atauz0lytyY
---
That's because TS is applied to base damage (before perks). 
---
PVP needs it's own server. Shouldn't be on the community server. Because higher lvl players rob lower players. 
---
I think that this must be a strange bug. Damage was scaling with hunger for me earlier today (for some of my weapons) but now it is not. bugzilla.
---
Honestly I think both are more than possible, cheaters lie but Bethesda have well documented problems throughout most of their game histories and a track record of breaking stuff in patches. Add in little to no multiplayer experience and a sudden need to mod an MMO and I wouldn’t rule out there being a mistake 
---
As far as I’m concerned, the last few fallout games gave me like 200+ hours of enjoyment. So I consider the cost well spent. 76 has me almost to that mark, yeah it’s kinda buggy, and I’ve lost a bunch of things, but at least they are trying. I still enjoy it. And when it crashes and I have to restart, I just use that as an excuse to piss and get a snack. 
---
Nah my parents locked me in the basement as a kid and all I could do was read thesauruses  so wordplays second nature to me.. I’m not apologizing for anybody I just think it’s stupid people don’t realize there’s other playstyles and that crafting/looting this much ammo is doable. Do I think everyone is crafting this much? No, but you said it yourself it’s possible and just maybe the guy who’s played the game longer than most is part of that small percentage.. anyways I wanna lyk cunt is so 2018, gotta catch up with the times their old timer, love ya! 
---
I was on topic, you were the one that kept trying to drag me away from being on topic for some reason, and yet you continue now to try to drag me away from being on topic. Are you lonely? Do you need a friend to talk to?
---
I had that happen last week it was weird and annoying
---
I play solo.  I enjoy it quite a bit now.  First 30 levels made it frustrating, but I got the hang of it now.
---
Dude said he was basically bed ridden due to an injury that took him off work and basically trapped him in the house. He said he was using FO76 as an escape from the crushing boredom.
---
Damage was scaling with hunger for me earlier today (for some of my weapons, not all), but now it is not. bugzilla. I'm not sure that it will say this way, just commenting to see if anyone else is experiencing it as well. 
---
So what? It's in the game so people are gonna shoot at you. I get killed all the time and I've played like 65 hours total. 
---
I would imagine "silenced" weapons are different from "silent" weapons and it wouldn't be affected. One implies it made noise at one point.
---
I can confirm that TS doesn't add 25% on pipboy damage. 
---
Another thing I love about it is they identify the subject by their reddit handle.  They just assume it’s a man, and that he played the game 900 hours, etc.  that’s probably the case but for all this guy knows that could fifty year old duping woman who’s played the game 100 hours.  The one I read he just blindly accepts a reddit post and reports on it and makes firm judgments.  It’s not only irresponsible it’s lazy and desperate.
---
None
---
100% more would be great but a little much. The stuff I can build now can get real large I think twice the size would crash servers for sure
---
Ok cool. Thanks.
---
*Screaming child intensified*
---
\^\^This
---
Like I said, won’t respond to the fact that there’s other ways to get these mats then grind so...
---
Not tying to be a dick but I’ve restated myself a lot so just gets old when people argue and don’t care to take into account my main premise.. there’s a lot of people trading in this game, you don’t have to craft/loot everything yourself. Anyways sorry if I came off rude, not my intention but please don’t hmu unless you’re gonna take my whole premise into account 
---
Aww..
---
Yea, and loses a big dps chunk from critical shots
---
Theres your endgame lol
---
They only have two employees, and both of them are kept chained up in the basement.
---
So... Basically not even Bethesda believes someone likes the game that much....
---
I just finally got a chance to test this in-game... 
---
Level 45 lever action rifle:
---
75 damage with no mods  
---
93 damage with hardened receiver
---
(+18 dmg added by the receiver)
---
Two shot level 45 lever action rifle:
---
93 damage with no mods  
---
111 damage with hardened receiver  
---
(+18 dmg added by receiver)
---
The two shot rifle only gets 25% of the base weapon damage. So the way the damage is calculated is (75x1.25)+18, not (75+18)x1.25.  
---
That means when you factor in the mod TS isn't giving a flat %25. It's just a flat %25 on the base weapon damage, nothing else. Otherwise the damage with the receiver would be 116.  
---
Another way to look at it, if a regular lever action with the mod does 93 damage, if TS added %25 to that it would be  116 not 111.
---
But most of those upvotes were given before he revealed that he had 400k ultracite ammos 
---
You'd probably need silicone rubber instead for that kind of thing.
---
Hahaha my buddy is constantly either vaping or slurping , I honestly don’t mind.
---
Sometimes when I don’t want to hear anybody I just won’t wear a headset and do it good ole fashioned mute everyone 
---
That only works if he had one character and his mule, he had 3 characters he played that the mule held the items for. 
---
Not to mention that people in this sub have already done the math and the amount of ammo he had would easily be obtainable by someone multiboxing in about 5 days, let alone 30:
---
Yeah I honestly find myself kind of annoying for even posting this, but sometimes you just gotta vent and my ex told me to stop texting her about FO76 at 2am so y’all are all I got 
---
hunting rifles are amazing..even at low-level they are super effective
---
Wrong sub. This is FO76 not TES. Though I thank you for the redfall info I had to google it but very interesting.
---
No one else is saddened that the coolest stuff has to be bought and not found or earned in game?
---
"loving" any company will leave you disappointed. They only want more profit. 
---
We'd have to have new items in the game for that though
---
Revert a save?
---
Saw around 6 players or 7 in the area of Solomon pond , house was ugly tough lol 
---
The mod? I thought it crashes to desktop several patches ago? 
---
Tbh no 
---
&gt; Servers - there should have been structured servers. And there should have been PvP, PvE and even PvE-RP servers. Your community is literally from a single player PvE game, why would you force PvP on them? And the measures you took to prevent griefing and player killing just ended up punishing the community who may have joined because of the PvP. Also i felt like there should have been at least 25 people per server.
---
this so fucking much. literally would have made all the difference for a lot of people and so many parts of the game.
---
Uh, actually people in this subreddit did the math and not only is it actually obtainable, it could be done in a week. Not even needing 30 days:
---
Hahahaha
---
I don't care.
---
How tf are you getting 120 stable flux from a nuke run? 
---
I wouldn't really say "all" journalists strive to be objective any more, with the larger number of gaming articles that are becoming opinion based these days. They SHOULD all strive to be objective, but that just is not the case any more
---
Were you with me on XBox...where that dang scorch beast was there also
---
That might have been me u on xboxm
---
Literally asked for every week since launch it seems and has yet to be added to the game. 
---
In American standards mothership zeta is ‘Murica as well 
---
Only to him. Most team members could only handle him for small periods of time. 
---
I think most of us expected more. I still have a hard time understanding why there isn't server text chat and guilds. Social games need social tools.
---
Same here!
---
it's a pretty well thought out post , have a upvote .
---
Fallout 4 + DLC
---
O-K,...well I'm relieved. You just clarified I was about to waste time debating someone with an obvious limited mental capacity (a fuckin' moron). Godspeed and remember the Alamo...
---
😂😂😂
---
Well my player tag is the same as my username here, if you need help doing anything, feel free to friend me and let me know!
---
classical music is cool but I really want to bump "country roads" in my shack
---
Dude if you can just buy a different game The Division is on sale with all expansions at like under 20 bucks. Its very solid rn.
---
I don't think it's that big of a deal. It's an online game and people are going to play how they want to play. Would I be frustrated if it happened to me? Yeah probably. But I wouldn't try to dictate how other people play the game because of it. Part of what makes this game good is that it's an open server and people can have any play style they want to. 
---
Oh no i've hurt the feelings of a hardcore fallout fan, what ever will i do 
---
also steel wall keypad doors that allow me to place the keypad wherever I want
---
My grandma could do a better job modding, not to mention me, compared to these guys. Move over.
---
I agree 100% about stocks, EA is worth over 40 billion and Activision over 30 billion. 1 bad year is hardly a dent for them. For me personally I was annoyed at how we were given an unfinished product,  they use an outdated engine that carries the same bugs from f04 which they never fixed and a game that lacks their sense of world building. If you enjoy it awesome more power to you. I dont think there was malicious intent from bethesda or Todd. But I do feel they rushed this out to meet a quota. I feel it's okay for people to rave bc it shouldn't be something we consider normal.
---
i am there with you man i feel for you i had a lot of things given to me by friends who quit the game and gave me all their stuff its lame i do not have 900 hours but i am at 500+ it sucks bethesda will take no blame for what is happening 
---
Nah he didn't "reveal" that. He revealed an email that said that, and disputed it. But of course you shills will say, twist and spin anything to twist the narrative. Shilling here was a big mistake, and that's the next big story.
---
How is he full of shit? People have done the math and its doable in well under 30 days. The math shows it would be doable in about a week of grinding:
---
For me it doesn't trigger pvp but it does damage them and if they die I become wanted because we weren't in pvp
---
Well, glass and certain metals are viable. Plastic would be too unsanitary.
---
Totally didn't work 
---
I went to 0% food 0% water and 20 HP and it didn't work :( 
---
I mean a lot of these things will be added , such as the servers you were talking about, Just kinda skim read that but I think something you missed or may not know is that rare and unique gear is dropped/ won by completing events , and some of this unique clothing is so rare most people don’t even know it’s in the game, once again not sure if you touched on it or not.
---
He is bedridden due to an injury that made him not able to work and basically be stuck in bed all day. He was using FO76 as an escape from being stuck in bed all day. Not sure how that is a waste.
---
Horsemens been planned for awhile and is not a reaction to fans not wanting "cute" stuff. 
---
Straight the fuck up dude, like excuse my French but I try to look at it more of single person logic like fallout 4. If you put 700+ hours into fallout 4 and literally just grind you would have everything, god roll or not it wouldn’t matter cause you would literally have everything. Like I get it they want you to keep playing and get those stupid 7600 hours in but come on. Literally watched a YouTube video where a guy literally did the math and tested it and people are seeded to get certain stuff, not just from the server, or who’s there or what not, literally every character is seeded to get a better god roll or so then others, like his example one account was predominantly getting sentinel where the other was cavalier? Like why? If it’s basic rng bullshit then why the fuck does this shit exists in the coding? Literally makes no sense. Like wake the fuck Bethesda, no wonder everyone was god damn duping, cause there ain’t no other way to get this unless you are literally the single 76 god who got a TSE drop.
---
Well thing is you didn’t debate me you just refused to acknowledge my main premise that trading can take the place of crafting/looting so yeah.. if you could just get me that TPS report by Friday that would be great. Btw what’s for dinner Dad?
---
If they would just clarify “acquired” it would certainly sway many opinions.  I totally buy that you could easily have moved that much ammo in between accounts in a month.  Not sure what they’re waiting for.
---
good work
---
I've done that too!
---
I've posted 2 great Mothman encounters, first with Grahm and the Mothman was invisible, then in the middle of showing off a camp build a low level dude drags one into my camp. 600+ hrs haven't seen one outside the lighthouse event, then 2 in one day.
---
No-one still talks about 76
---
Bro chill
---
Not only do i not know but they said post patch theyd let us bacl but i guess they choose which patch it is
---
Ps4
---
Killed two vengeful mothman within an hour today, both times next to my camp in Cranberryborg. Weird thing is there was no body left just a pile of lootable ash of some sort. I killed mothman in the past and took selfies with their bodies, not any more I guess 🙀
---
TES3 had a "dispose of body" option that would be nice as long as it only removes it for you. 
---
Would be nice for when you've got piles of meat piles too. The top ones get looted but unless you find an uncovered edge you might miss something good in a lower one. 
---
Maybe you followed him around like a weirdo stalker.
---
I dig this idea. Let me sell you stuff for atoms? yeah sounds great
---
Damn that's complicated.
---
My point was more simple. That picture can be interpeted in two fairly opposite ways.
---
Does this life or death also apply to bicycle helmets? Pre-birth insurances? Life jackets on rowing boat? 
---
All supposed things are so good, that if you reject them, you should be beaten.
---
Just fucking wait and see.
---
Sneak builds can get good damage by constant critical hits and sneak damage, but stealth is a bit bugged at the moment. Bloodied builds give you lots of damage at the cost of low health, so they probably will buff enemy damage or give more enemies armor penetration/poison damage to compensate. If a colonel gusty spots you with a bloodied build, your basically dead.
---
I could get behind this. I've played many games with premium currency that could be traded. I'd definitely want to see a way to trade for less than 1 atom per unit , as well as less than 1 cap per unit to make trading ammunition at fair prices safer.
---
Had it happen twice under ground and once with just the head of a scorched above the ground. The later i was able to kill.
---
Word , I don’t know why burnt books / burnt magazines are in the game , would make more sense to have them as static items , unless there’s some unspoken use for them nobody knows yet.
---
I didn't notice if it damaged them or not. That would suck if someone had like 20hp and died from that!
---
Open mics let me know where the SB are I just follow the cuss words
---
Nope.
---
Is it anything like the old explosive bug where if you did too much damage to something in a single hit all ranged attacks stopped dealing damage and you have to switch to melee until log out?
---
And you thought the unstoppables event had people fired up about P2W.....
---
I have some of the rare under armor but i don't know if that's what you're speaking about.
---
!Remind me 2 days
---
Yeah I heard they just added a super soaker and slip and slides in the atomic shop, bout time this wasteland had some fun 
---
They can take there pick...
---
You're GOD DAMN right I am, but still not enough of a dumbass to buy Fallout 76
---
Think upon this
---
Power cycle router + device.
---
To be honest if it's not something to be worried about; you should try it and test the results.
---
It stops YOU.  Not the jackasses out there who will sit and widdle away at your health.  Steal your junk, and move on to next victum.
---
Good to know. I will test with my primary account tonight and report results as well, after work.
---
how can you genuinely enjoy this game? You must be the most boring person on earth
---
I use it because I think of myself as a builder/plan collector
---
Remind me! 2 days
---
Don't waste your time with that dude, he has his mind made up that no matter what 900 hour dude was in the wrong. I tried explaining to him multiple times how BSG could easily have screwed up and banned some innocent people, just like they screw up on every single patch. Yet he somehow thinks that bans are somehow different and BSG couldn't get any of those wrong. Just ignore every single other thing they have done wrong since this game launched.
---
Dam I would have given u one
---
it's likely not stealth nerf so much as someone not documenting their code properly, i'll blame Allen. 
---
farming for things that have no used for the entire time?
---
i called that bullcrap
---
I mean theres people who speed run games and play said games for a majority of the day for no reason or actual benefit. Or theres people who like to do certain things such as playing one level or and over just because they like it or even fighting the same bosses over and over 
---
Or people who do challenge runs for no benefit or actual reason.
---
Saying you understand all of human behaviour or have a complete understanding of why people do things is a tad sillyme
---
Remindme! 2 days
---
No french/british hybrid with a bit of American to keep us not too fucking heat
---
What do you mean monster mask? 
---
Maybe he invited me every single time I logged on and constantly gas lit everyone until no one wanted to play with him?
---
It's gonna be crap, and we'll buy it, just for the variety and hoping Bethesda will see the sales numbers and produce us something better down the line.

---
Fillable shelf, like it could literally work as a bobble head rack in fallout 3, except this would just change its model depending on how many of the set food/drink items you’ve collected
---
Damn.... this game just continues to disappoint
---
When you said that “76 missed an opportunity to add unique gear to the game” it would imply that 76 doesn’t have unique rare gear , and when you said that it could “be dropped by end game monsters” that’s something I could get onboard with but it doesn’t really make a difference wether it’s an event reward or a monster drop.
---
Wouldent take long to make but not seen one on here
---
What do you mean farming for things that have no use for? The things he farmed for could be used to create ultracite ammo and if you look on most trading forums ammo is a very commonly used currency, so it would be like farming for caps.
---
Unless I misunderstood what you mean, could you elaborate?
---
It does work! Crossbow 3.13x with one 🌟 Mr. Sandman and max Covert Ops. Before night time, I was doing 2.5x. I'm not sure, like I said, about the harpoon gun, but if you're sure it's silent, I'd wager it works too.
---
That's how I read it, could be wrong though
---
Bethesda should indicate to players to use the different icons to show play style,  especially with the new icons on the map update. You don't need a camp (trader) marker if all you have to do is set your player icon to caps or whatever they decide is what. Sounds cool though I like the idea even though I use the plans icon myself but I'm not a trader.
---
I'm not sure people can be expected to spend their hard-earned money on something they "haven't played" just on the off-chance that everyone else has been wrong about the game.
---
People aren't complaining because they've "heard the game was bad", they're complaining because everything they've heard/seen about the gameplay clearly doesn't align with their interests.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I don't have to try a turd to know it tastes bad.
---
Your team mate can shoot someone which would flag you for pvp despite you personally having pacifist on.  Additionally, some mutations have been known to disrespect pacifist mode. Not sure which, but plague walker, electrically charged, etc.   would be among the usual suspects if that's still a thing.
---
Moral of the story is pacifist mode is only supposed to make your damage be zero when you shoot at players.  Personally I wish it would turn off temporarily and automatically once you're   wanted because as it stands you're a sitting duck when this happens.
---
Or maybe people just have different opinions man.
---
Lol he means the plans not the pieces 
---
Boo. Your humor is about as lame as your "trade" excuse. Keep trying to line up stars to create a perfect scenario for this dude. You're doing a wonderful job so far. 
---
Uh, no that’s actually using your faulty logic, which I pointed out already. Wow, you seriously are trolling. Goodbye.

i wish i can blacklist those youtuber like yongyea and the like

i got pissed everytime seeing them in my recommended

Good Lord, why can't we build the mouth harp jug band stuff?

Too bad my Black diamond isnt actually...black.

Now I'm trying it with 0 Rads cross your toes
---
The Mothman looks great man, I don't think you wasted your money there 
---
I would like a polite "No" or "No, thank you." I never use the thumbs down.
---
That was my point,  you said you "accidentally" hit another player, if YOU would have had it on nothing would have happened. You wouldn't need to apologize for accidentally initiating PvP if you had that mode turned on, it takes about 4 seconds to run back through options and take it off, hit a stimpack and return fire if you want to do PvP or block and fast travel away or change servers.
---
Lovely. Ghouls and super mutants will be running away from me when they see me in my pale armor 👏 Hope they also have some ‘lighter’ versions of new paints though, those are very ornate and one for each PA type isn’t enough to give people identity when everyone wears the same horseman. A large variety of different plain color ones will be great. 
---
Nuke a zone, one animal in that zone becomes giant. 
---
I want giant ants! 
---
lol this isnt about mules, and you know it. also, you are putting up a straw man with the past fallouts point. if you want to go there though, nobody ever got kicked for hoarding massive amounts of items in past fallouts either, now did they? why? bc, the same reason that we could pass items to lower characters... the game WASNT online.
---
tell me... where has Bethesda ever said that mules that meet the weight cap are outlawed or are against the rules of the game? go ahead, show me where they have said anything at all about mules even being discouraged! lol Go ahead, I'll be here waiting... forever lol. they put the 1500 cap on mules so that mules would be reasonable and acceptable to the needs of the servers.
---
speaking of false equivalences... you somehow believe that mules circumvent inventory restrictions LOL... well, yet again, if they didnt intend them to be used as banks, they wouldnt have left a limit of 1500 OVER original carry. they dont give a fuck. you are the ONLY one that does... you and those like you. if they didnt intend for items to be traded back and forth, even from one character to another, they would never have allowed trading or dropping of items to begin with. i suppose by your logic that accepting items from others players is "cheating" too?
---
id like to see you prove any of the things you are saying about bethesdas intent... because frankly, having been in MMOs since the very first one, I know that mules are accepted and standard practice... but duping is ALWAYS, and rightfully so, a banable offense.
---
1500 items wont lag or effect the server in any way, btw... ive loaded in and out many times.
---
seriously man... lol... they arent establishing consequences for using mules, what theyre doing is trying to get rid of dupers and accidentally fucking with the most hardcore and loyal part of their playerbase. if you played games for a living, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week... you would probably be banned too. 
---
Nice post.  I should point out that Fallout 76 does have unique items, but those unique items all suck.  Most end up getting sold to vendor bots—though a few poorer players keep a level 50 all rise for backup melee on their rifle or shotgun builds.  
---
So boost the unique items to make them actually useful, comparable to the top tier random legendaries.  But no more ‘here’s a free legendary sledge for being mayor of watoga’ business.  Make these uniques rare drops from epic quests, and turn them into prestige items which can never be traded, but can be scrapped — so no duping.  Also, a new interactive display case for your camp, so you can show off your epic prestige gear to all your friends!
---
Did I mention epic raids?  Epic Raids!  The SBQ is a giant letdown for a final boss. and farming either there or whitesprings is mind-numbingly repetitive.
---
A Top of the World camp might be a cool base location, I’m not sure where you could build tho cause there’s a few different map markers close together there... also one by the horn Wright place where you get excavator PA, and just sell springs and screws for the mission cause most people never have enough to make it right away 
---
Yeah, I don't know what you're doing wrong then because I've def used a powerfist, buzz saw blade, and a DCG on the queen and kept stealth. 
---
start stabbing the water immediately
---
I've built a few nice camps in comparison to those Ive seen around the world, however the build system does kind of suck and requires alot of knowledge of tricks to get the best stuff to work out. Building is probably my favorite thing so far though, but I love building in any game so do with that as you want.
---
Don't worry. Bethesda will make it a priority to fix this "bug" because it benefits the players. Even though there are plenty of other important bugs to fix, like being in "Caution" or "Danger" all the time and not able to stealth.
---
Every patch that comes out always includes a nerf to a weapon or some other mechanic to slow down player progression. It's frustrating to see weapons or perks that you use regularly become diluted and nerfed to useless levels. 
---
Now, they are not even telling people about these hidden nerfs. 
---
We get it. You work for Bethesda
---
Oh no fucking way, really? Is this new with the patch or something or have people just not tried that before? There goes the strategy people recommend of burying the bench in crates.
---
So you think that's why it wasn't included in the patch notes? Seems like a super major thing to just be forgotten.
---
Depending on your browser there are plugins that can blacklist channels.  I Grabbed one at the height of the bullshit when watching any 76 related video meant the next time my recommended were nothing but people screaming about canvas bags.
---
Nah it's pretty toxic I've been here like 30 minutes over like three days this week and I've seen people literally telling others to destroy bases cause tjey think their farm spot is cheap and they fuckinf hate everyone who does it and how they will gladly destroy everything they own every chance they get over it. 
---
Then today I check in and a good 70% of the post I've seen are basically telling overs to suck theirdick and get over being banned or arguing wkth others who arent banned that they eouldnt be banned if they didnt cheat even though the other person is just saying ways this could happen or that false bans and flags have happened in the past. 
---
Like theres good post but let's not pretend that the shit currently at the head is pretty toxic.
---
I dumped all my ammo at it.
---
The screenshots almost make me want to start using power armor.
---
Sounds like it’s a meatloaf night.. damn. Yous an ignoramus and a hater but dammit family’s family, good thing I didn’t inherit your cynicism must make life so dreary
---
Nice spot. I built on and under the bridge
---
Yep 
---
Sterling cherry picking info? That doesn't sound like him /s
---
This is actually a pvp Easter egg about Flint, Michigan
---
so all the more reason to dupe i see
---
i called bullshit if people that have mule account, learn to trade dont know how to dupe that just acting stupid if anything
---
exactly. We even paid money to be a test dummy.
---
You again? how bout you stay on topic for once?
---
Super late to this but isn't this policy super weird?
---
"Yeah we're banning you for taking advantage of our sloppiness. When we fix our sloppiness maybe you can play again." 
---
What? 
---
There is one here I’ve seen. Google Docs sheet. Not totally populated but haven’t looked at it in a while. I’m sure you can find it.
---
Wtf does chaunced domers mean
---
Happens alot Very annoying
---
Tl:dr
---
Guy on our server was about 275.  He had a wanted of nearly 3k!  So I was not going to mess with him till suddenly there he is at Charleston station destroying this player home.  
---
Started taking a few shots at him.  A few others joined in.  Wasted us all.  More kept coming, and we all kept getting wrecked.  Finally 20 high levels and a scattering of lows are attacking him.  
---
He alt-f4s leaving us all in the dust.... 
---
pussy.
---
How so? Maybe if you're a younger gamer living at home with non-gamer parents it might seem unusual (no shade, just trying to figure out who would think it odd to have more than 1 machine.) 
---
People would 2-box in EverQuest, and that was over a decade ago (close to two decades!) Having 2 PCs or a desktop and laptop is no doubt MUCH more common in 2019. My wife and I play games together. We both have desktops, we both have work laptops, and we've got our own laptop. How much is a game? How much has something like F76 been discounted?
---
Consoles? We have several of each, again for playing together and different locations in the house. Fishy? Nah. Not especially unusual if you have more than 1 person who plays games in the house. We know plenty of other people who have more than 1 pc or console (or both) in the same household.
---
I find it fluctuates with different  servers based on which players are grinding events or not. There have been alot of times where I wished the server I was on had more events so I wouldn't have to hop and lose my effort put into workshops, or replace my super popular camp location.
---
It didn't work. Thank you for the advice though.
---
At the end of the day he's still banned and you suck. Stay classy.
---
Yes it would. It would be what a major part of community would go ballistic about. Playing real money for ingame weapons a armor.

---
Maybe you are making it all up?
---
It’s the obsession with power levelling and getting the best gear that I don’t get. IMO fallout never was a looter shooter like destiny. It’s a game where the environment is the main character and exploring is the name of the game. I agree, I wouldn’t want to play this game if getting gear was all I cared about. Good thing it’s got other things to offer. 
---
I have a bug pretty often that I can't fast travel unless I server hop or kill myself. Usually I take off my armor and kill myself. Last 3 times I tried it gave me an option to seek revenge. On myself...
---
I'm really sorry to hear this. Thanks for the heads up as I will steer well clear of Bethesda products. My brother is a huge fallout fan and he's livid at what is happening to the franchise and the company that was its supposed steward. Bethesda, get your fucking shit together already.
---
Buddy do I look like a Swedish berry to you? Chauncey domers are entirely English words, google it. Did you go to English class in grade 8?
---
I believe you man
---
Thanks!
---
Then why are you here? If you don’t have the game then you have no business shitting on it since you don’t understand it. 
---
That is not english, ur school was drunk so you need to go home.
---
Daddy no don’t leave 
---
Good Luck!
---
in my experience something has changed with the latest update(s). i have server hopped over a dozen times today and each time the safe is locked but opening produces no stimpaks. anyone else notice this?
---
Lol that's your faulty logic. I'm glad you see how badly you are failing to defend your point and giving up already.
---
You can't say a buff to defense is a Nerf to another attack type without the inverse being true.
---
Hey can you guys over at Bethesda kindly try to unfuck yourselves?
---
You have an eye for detail, Unlike **some** people involved with this game
---
It's still not fair or reasonable... especially being that he is the one having something taken from him, see what I mean? I believe him but then again, I also was banned erroneously. my crime? playing 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and hoarding every single thing i could find... shit... i have 8k steel scrap, for instance, and thousands of legitimately attained ammo i hoarded even though I am melee. yeah... i should be ashamed, but jesus... i didnt deserve to be banned.
---
I could see travel costs scaling with level until 50. Somthing like 90%reduced costs at &gt;Lvl 10, 60% lvls 20-50, 40% 30-40, 20% 40-50, and at lvl 50 0% reduction except for perk cards.

The jist of that performance guide was put settings to medium (this is to adjust the lower distance sliders) then set all the low/medium/high/ultra settings to your liking.  A 2060 should have no issues running at ultra @1080p, but do the above if you gotta have more fps.
---
It's the new patch, they did it to fix that problem.

I have commented. I've been commenting. I have tried to follow the concept that I don't need to make a lot of sound, just keep making the sound, but they aren't doing well. 
---
I've been posting the biggest most important items and commenting on people's front page making things that are addressed in those posts and past comments. 
---
They don't seem to have the ability to hear these items. What's happening Inside The Vault is nonsensical. The updates going out are broken and lack the full kapow that our players and fallout itself deserve. 
---
Opinions on video games are subjective.  You’re stating your opinion as an absolute.  I know that’s commonplace on the internet these and with the youtube chuds, but it doesn’t make opinions facts.  The facts are this game was released with tons of flaws,  but whether it’s decent is an opinion— regardless how influenced you are by your favorite influencers.
---
And flaming shit bags are hilarious,  that’s my opinion.
---
Maybe you should try googling "chaunced domers" it doesn't come up with anything
---
Wonder why we can't see how many upvotes a post gets now?
---
Maybe has something to do with 900 hour guy having the 5th highest rated post on this subreddit?
---
With the top one being about the Nylon "Canvas" bag.
---
Hmm wonder who is really butthurt. Seems like the shills in damage control mode are the ones hurting most.
---
Gauss rifle at enclave armory, around 3500 caps, radium at watoga, 1000, Tesla rifle at Phoenix or watoga, 2000, 50 cal at Phoenix, 3500, Gatling gun at Phoenix, 3500, western revolver at Phoenix, 1000, lever action at lewisburg station, 1500.
---
At the same time it seems like it'd cause other problems. Like having someone hiding in stealth mode in some hard to see or obscure corner of the workshop zone. At least if they have to get to bench you know where to look for them. I can see a new avenue of workshop griefing with chameleon, stealth, and finding out of the way spots in large workshops.
---
if you have 2 account and know trading i called bullshit if you dont know how to dupe
---
It’s going to take A LOT for me to ever spend money on another Bethesda game. I didn’t even purchase FO76 (almost did), I can’t imagine how all the people that actually spent money on the game feel after being bent over and screwed by Bethesda.
---
This is coming from someone who has bought all your games, day one, for the last 15+ years (minus FO76). I really hope you can recover from this, but it’s gonna take a miracle. I honestly don’t see it happening at this point.
---
Ah, the ol "last word means I win" schtick. Incredibly effective tactic amongst women, male bitches and youngsters right before their balls drop. You absolutely got me. I'll give you time to wind up for your final pitch. 
---
Yes but they only show up to do damage control shilling.
---
I think 100 this time around, 50 on Xbox. The lvl 100 playthrough took half the time.

Or just increase the capacity of the resource extractors in workshops but not camps

Fuck man 5mm ammo discharges like a Pez dispenser. You can go through this amount in a flash

This is a legitimate point. Game journalists aren’t real journalists. They just skim social media for filler crap articles between the times their ad deals get them invitations by developers to their PR departments for a little collaborative work.

I have gotten to the point where I’ve given up trying to just drop things. I set a base up with a concrete block with a stash, stove, and sleeping bag. I positioned a huge street light over it(hard to miss) and I leave “gift bags” for whomever might be around. Then I usually patrol and help out people around and have them follow me back so they can partake!

---
It's OK you don't need to sort for your intelligence level. I spelled it out very simply for you to understand. 
---
I think a respec should be available, but be very expensive, at 10,000-15000 caps. Respec is very powerful, as people will change their build whenever something gets nerfed. Currently, after you get the plans you want, caps don’t have a purpose, so it would be nice to have an additional use for them.
---
Big yikes
---
Lol never mind 
---
can confirm, am casual player who isn't interested in pvp and the handful of legendary weapons and armor that has dropped for me mostly give pvp buffs. . . and anything with a useful bonus is on something either low level or a weapon my character isn't built to use effectively.  Sad times!
---
That is the one of the most ridiculous explanations I've ever heard... wow, you're really going all in on that bluff aren't ya. Enjoy the fame (infamy?).
---
So then I should keep the lowbie character I have that has found multiple chameleon armor pieces and explosive medics less VATS cost combat shotgun on?
---
Like when the character is created that is when the "drop chances" for the character are decided?
---
I hope you kicked it's bass.
---
That's a fish. You know. Because water? Sorry if this isn't the plaice for fish puns. I've just about haddock with a lot of the serious posts and having a whale of a time with these.
---
I could do this for hours. But I won't. Not on that scale. Even though I have some kraken puns.
---
You're getting paid to be injured? Honestly I would trade places with you instantly. Free money sounds awesome.

they are pretty pointless come to think of it
---
Because if you can’t follow the formula above then it is not worth my time trying to explain anything to you, it’s very well laid out and clearly worded, it’s not my fault you are incapable of understanding, I’ve yet to hear anything of substance from YOU.
---
Def. Workshops really aren't worth it ATM. They have to be babysat too closely to get much value out of them. If you aren't taking the munitions factory or a plant yard it's just not worth the trouble unless you take about 5-6 workshops and constantly travel between them doing almost back to back defense events. I do that every once in awhile and it's not too bad, but it completely changes how I play for the duration
---
Ragrets?
---
What is even the more reason to dupe? You've lost me there. The guy had no problem grinding out the mats to create that ammo if he wanted, as the math has shown he could have easily reached those numbers in a week of grinding, so it would be a joke for him to reach it over 4 times that long.
---
I think that hazmat should have some mods for protection, like armor plating or something, perhaps capping out at 100 DR/ER with the best mod. Also, can we get legendary Hazmat suits?
---
I can totally understand what you are saying. Everyone plays a different way. I did explore the map and did enjoy all the elements but after you found them once there is no new. You then need to find a new new.. Thats where the gear collection comes in for me.
---
To preface is I own my own buisness and live in Canada so I shut down for the winter. This is my big game time. I get to play 8-12 hours a day if i want everyday. I also pay myself for 4 months off.
---
I'm not a casual gamer in the winter months. In the summer when its 16 hour days, thats different.
---
Nah.
---
Like me a guildwars 2 when it came out. 
---
Continental shift, 16hrs playing for 2 days then 2 days working and playing for 6hrs. 16hrs playing for 3 days then repeat. 
---
About 60hrs a week, just play time
---
I agree, but certain weapons will hit that ratio even against those enemies.
---
I guess sponsoring a ufc fight didn’t work out.
---
If you don't feel like you can contribute much damage-wise, I recommend getting a Cryolator. Dumping enough cryo shots into her will slow her down, making her move a lot slower (even when flying) which helps everyone out when aiming. Just keep in mind its small range!
---
That's really cool, I didn't know that.
---
Their outfits in Tactics look a lot less lore-breaking though. I still feel like some of the power armors in OP's screenshot (mainly the red and black ones) look a little too "fancy" to have been built/modified by vault dwellers right after the apocalypse, but I suppose it wouldn't be impossible.
---
It sucks when your build gets ruined, I haven't used explosives in weeks and dropped my auto launcher. I took a break hoping somthing would be changed back but I don't think anything will be so I switched back to melee, hope you can keep your build.
---
Yes I had a general idea of what you would have said.  Part of that irony is patches are actually able to address most of those problems. 
---
Hmm. Have you tried thinking ironically and tried killing a huge... ant?
---
Nobody wants a cryolator. Sorry
---
Stop playing the game, you have the dedication to do very well in a game like Warframe.
---
Why not?
---
That is your preferred way to play.   I like to build my camp, explore, and only do PVE.   I don’t like melee, and this game was a real trashfire after level 30 as someone who wanted to stealth snipe.   By the time you finally killed the first enemy, you were overrun / couldn’t just enter a building...
---
Readings hard eh...
---
Want a cap sink?  Vendors sell a random legendary.  Low level areas have low level legendary on sale.  High level areas have high level legendaries on sale.  Very low level chance to sell a 3 star.
---
First time a skin in 76 that made me say out loud 'WHOAAA'
---
I’m Not here to help them except in the help me help you sense. I’m
---
Here to help fallout and its awesome community. My favorite players and podcasters have been on this since the beginning. I want to help them. I’ve been vocal with the ideas that I hear all the players raising and my analysis of the core gameplay visions, my suggestions are concentrated like VATS fire in the core game vision components that can be iterated to fix the frustrations everyone is raising - efficiently and in line with how the game is already assembled. 
---
Did you mean "Chauncey Adams"?
---
mine switches from having all checked off to not accepting kills when they aren't, depends on login but same result, broken challenge. PC
---
i saw an instagram post with all the comments as "this is why the games bad"  
---
"dead game" "why are they trying" and all the post said was "Bethesda bans a man with 900+ hours for having too many items 😂😂😂"
---
If you could build actitive a  server event that allows for things like pvp or pvm would be cool
---
This wouldn't happen be for the cover of the Beat'ems upcoming album, Appal Road?
---
As much as I like the band, Bongo on the Wardrum is so overrated.
---
9 days and a major patch later... you and this post are still on my mind.   
---
Hope you're back among us, the community needs each and every one of us, from cranky trolls to quiet contributors. 
---
Yea I guess I would have to go with that explanation. At least the green and white ones look a little more organic, like something weird grew on top of the armor/fused with it. The black one bothers me the most, but I think they could help this by "dinging it up a bit" with some dents/scratches.
---
I apologize for my lack of knowledge but, yes i get the basic concept. But a new server system is what i was implying, like PVE and PVP
---
Would you genuinely say you read and followed along with notes and terminals you came across?  I notice a lot of you item oriented players skip out on a lot of that part of the game. I wish it wasn’t the only way that they added story, but it’s some good content that adds a lot to the game. 
---
kinda a stalemate, but I'm gonna orbital strike that smug fuck's CAMP next time I see him
---
Damage, it's a week gun. Handmade or gauss is better.
---
It is not breaking rule 6.
---
Who's that? I meant chaunce domers, it's not fucking rocket appriances
---
I prefer to think of it as RNGesus having a jekyll/hyde personailty. Loot too good- NOOOOO take it back! They must be punished, thats the only way they will love us!
---
Let us know, good to know the harpoon gun ignores armor.  I just sold one but with the new increased stash limit, can keep some of the cool guns.
---
Why would u even use a flamer
---
Nerfs and buffs are about preserving game balance. If something gets nerfed or buffed, it means the creators (Bethesda) believe that it is incorrect for the game. I currently like the difficulty of the game, and think it is fairly balanced, with a few exceptions( Sentinels, adrenal reaction+bloodied+unyielding, energy gun durability, lmg that burns .308). In regards to your claim about no buffs, there have been several intentional buffs. These were the automatic weapon damage boost, fireproof perk buff, stash buffs, and buffs to server stability.
---
900 hours guy is the Jussie Smollett of Fallout 😂😂
---
Any legendaries you wanna sell?
---
There’s also a new duplication glitch where if you get all the junk from your stash and jump in a fissure site you respawn with all your junk and a bag full of all your junk spawns by fissure site as well. You gotta have over 200 pounds of junk or so if I recall correctly. 
---
The thing is it's fair and reasonable considering the company states that with their calculation which We have no idea what that is based on found him guilty. It was based only on a 30 days of play and not the entire 90 days. 
---
 Not only was some of the things he did and said was contradictory I.E he posted a guide of how he accumulated and crafted things and actually admitted he got banned before the duping ban wave that he said he got caught in. He stated that he finally had time to write the guide because he could not play anymore and that was at least a day before the ban wave happened.  
---
 He also admitted to using a macro in that guide to harvest  because it duped the amount you were supposed to be able to harvest which Ironically is almost the same way to dupe your weapons and ammo and what not.  
---
Not to mention the ammo he has at least the Ultracite is rare and takes a lot to harvest the items required to make. Some perks like green thumb and a few others might make harvesting those items faster and easier but the only perks he talked about in his guide were super duper and ammo-smith and he noted nothing about how he went about with the  Nukes that are required for some of the ultracite stuff as well.
---
 
---
Also a side note to your banning. You may have been banned for the use of the glitch for weight that made everything weightless basically.  as you said you are a hoarder and kept everything. I know a few people that were banned for the weight glitch. where they could carry anything they wanted and never be over weight. 
---
My user should be the same as it is here, as well, feel free to friend me.  What I'm most annoyed about now, is ever since the last couple of patches my hunger and thirst grow way too fast, if I wanted to babysit something that needed feeding and watering every five minutes, I'd play the Sims again -_-
---
I’m only complaining because I want free food from sunshine meadows 
---
This is definitely been an issue for a while but, at least for me, it seems to only affect certain workshops. Like Billings homestead I've had liberators spawn underground and Sunshine farms I've had ghouls underground for taking it in a couple times mole rats underground during a defend event that wouldnt pop up.
---
Most of the other workshops seem to have been fixed that I've tried.  If it is still happening take a screenshot and send a bug report.  I know they have fixed some and in one of the patch notes they specifically said which workshops were fixed in that patch leads me to believe they are fixing them individually.
---
I’m playing FFXIV currently. There’s a person in my group who plays about 15 hours a day and has been doing so for 9 months, with the primary goal of killing a rare type of mob 2000 times to get 1 item. I don’t understand it at all. 
---
No, hell no.
---
After the patch, sbq disappeared and became a meat pile before you finished loot loading.
---
I think I can loot nothing now with this
---
ARE YOU WIMBLY FOURS MATE!? IM CRIMBO NINAN SAX APPLE SMIBBLY DIN BIBBLY CHAP 
---
They're super important to the young people, but if you didn't grow up watching randos on YouTube tell you what to think, you may not ever really be able to understand. I sure don't.
---
They are worth a cap a piece so I only tend to grab them near a vendor n sell them immediately. But I do agree that they could delete them all and I doubt anyone would mind if it would improve stability. 
---
They have a PvP only game mode in development. 
---
They don’t launch the nuke, they run to the blast zone after one is launched, damage the scorchbeast queen once or twice, and then camp out in a safe location in the blast zone until the nuke ends.
---
The song at the title screen?
---
As long as you have high perception you can see their pip very easily.  Besides burying a bench isn't effective as a wanted level won't stop someone who wants to pvp.  Being wanted can actually be considered less risky.  Also with marsupial claiming workshops in cheeky spots was easy.  You could claim from fairly high up, and most had hiding places out of view up above, but still in the zone.  If there is no spot people would sit on the antenna of the workshop chameleoned. 
---
The one-day sale strategy, and the long quiet between cool skins on the market, are tried-and-true microtransaction strategies for maximizing cash payments from the player base. The longer Bethesda holds out, the more you'll want this power armor skin and the more you'll be willing to pay real money when it comes out. This isn't just a matter of Bethesda not realizing you want this skin. Of course you do. Posting here doesn't make them bring it back sooner, it lets them know their withholding strategy is working.

Terminator 
---
It was 350 stable fluxes after 8 hours of server hopping SBQ Location.  
---
Farming upto 360 raw fluxes every 20;ish minutes, getting enough raw, before they instanced plants, to make upto 350 stables.
---
If you were talking to me i would say i read all the notes i found... Some of the terminals i skipped over once in as i didnt care about betty's story of her last dinner... You know the ones where you had 6 journal entries that had no real use other than to make you feel sad for the dead person. I would skim them ..
---
Yeah what's going on?
---
When devs wanvto surprise fanbase with new stuff, but people want to datamine everything
---
Anything Brotherhood of Steel related. No posters, flags, logos, nothing. Come on Bethesda.
---
I agree.  Well thought out post.  The bones of a great game are here, let’s hope they keep working towards it.
---
If I could get a decent amount of blamco Mac n cheese I might go after that place more often. Not a big fan of instamash though. 
---
thumbs downing a youtube video still helps it in the youtube algorithm, it is seen as viewer interaction. Same with commenting. By doing those 2 things you are actually helping the video more than a single view would because you interacting with the video increases its "value" to the algorithm so it will be recommended more often.
---
Dang.  I thought it was annoying when ppl had to actually come up and take it.
---
What a shame. I guess it's the same bug like the  "pick flowers" challenge few updates ago.
---
You, sir, are a FISH
---
If your not participating, you should not be rewarded. People need to pull their weight.

Fasnacht mask
---
Oh ya the green cracks in the scorched earth area? Me and a buddy made tons of ultracite scraps &amp; lead for ammo doing this. 
---
10/10 would recommend, it just works. 
---
Post history checks can help discern whether someone's trolling you or serious sometimes. I have to agree though it would be weird if someone came at me with somthing I said x months ago on y subreddit.
---
I want custom signs.  My friend and I had a dream of creating a restaurant called Send Nukes bar and grille, and a neon sign on the outside would really bring it together.
---
Welcome to the club.   Sorry bud.
---
The game physically warns you with a pop up, saying this item will be destroyed if you drop it. Blaming Bethesda for something you did is moronic. See ya.
---
NOW you're making me want Green Pyramid Headgear. :D
---
Lol I'm saying if u see me in there it means I'm using the bathroom and then I go back out..wow u didn't read what I wrote I do not hide from the queen
---
Do you give a fuck? 
---
Literally what
---
Crafting flamer fuel with super duper and ammosmith gives, on average, enough fuel to fire the flamer for 1.2 seconds. The file should craft in batches of 50, instead of 5.
---
I’m not blaming Bethesda I’m just saying it would be a good feature
---
So frustrating.  And it takes sooo long to clear out the silo of robots (not that I had to tell you that).
---
Like, literally? 
---
I’ve come across some players maybe with very high perception &amp; good graphics who have seen me coming as an invisible silhouette 👤.  If I am fast/sneaky enough, I can kill them by running at them diagonally as they try to pinpoint my location. 
---
When in doubt, fat-man there possible location.
---
Isn’t there thermal scopes in the game for this though?
---
shadow nerf is intended. shadow buff is not intended.
---
I think he said he was off work with an injury and had nothing else to do? 
---
For broadsiders, double is a better modifier for damage. You fire 2 cannonballs very quickly, and get the reload animation for one. It may cost twice as much ammo, but has a much better dps.
---
 I hate VATS. We should not have it in the game. ;) I would much rather deal with the world directly, and it is a good enough shooter that I can. I am willing to stand on my skill and I'm 72.  Should certainly not work for PvP at all. I understand this is not a popular opinion but VATS was to make crappy shooters, Fallout 3 and NV work for RP players. I never used VATS there either.
---
 I doubt that you have much outside enthusiasm to offer.  Still the ESO test server was it's own world, and did help test things, so I don't disagree that its a good idea.
---
The trade window only accepts caps. There is no text chat or player hub. 
---
I’m not disagreeing with you as to their intentions. I have no idea what their intentions were. But if it’s as you say, it seems like it should have been thought through a little better. 
---
😂 basically everything in fallout are huge. We've got huge roaches, flies, mecoptera (called stingwing in game)...... . And they all looks disgusting :(
---
But be able to fire without breaking stealth, come on, there really is no counter to it that I've seen.
---
Normal stimpacks seem to heal for half what they used to and the other half now takes aaaaages to fill if it fills. Anyone else notice this change after patch 6?
---
I had this happen to me just today.  Ended up tracking the player back to their camp and put them down.  They turned around and stole a Workshop I had used to gather some concrete for a Mothman statue I wanted to build.  It didn’t bother me because I was already done using the workshop.  I decided the amusement I gained from the encounter made it a fair trade for stealing my drop.
---
5 caps is a worthless bounty though.  It should be at least 10 or more to drive home that stealing someone else’s drop is a no no.  Otherwise, there’s no incentive to stay away.
---
Paint is only for metal armor. 
---
You wont ever see them specifically forbid mules, why you ask? because the most convenient way to use them is to....BUY a 2nd account.
---
Sorry Brit tart I don't speak Russell Brand
---
Oh, man. Jesus has a lot of explaining to do, not starting Christianity until a point in history where a bajillion souls were already damned for following other gods.
---
Okay so I love PvP in this game.  When I find out someone is taking my workshop my heart races and I immediately defend it.  These situations and lengthy battles are the most tense and exhilarating parts of the game for me.  Why does it seem like a majority of players not only get no excitement by this but actually get frustrated and annoyed?
---
If you have any legendaries on you when you jump in it won’t work. That’s why people are leaving their legendaries in a bag outside the fissure and then jumping in. Pro strat.
---
You really are out of touch aren't you?
---

---
Same I'm playing on pc. Really hope there's a solution to fix this problem bc I really wants those mothman stuff !
---
I dunno, I'd believe that the team lead is so incompetent that they aren't making sure they know every change that's made, wouldn't you? 
---
Heard there one in fort defiance 
---
How many servers do you usually have to hop before finding one where fissure prime is nuked?
---
Periods. Use periods.
---
It’s all good at least I’ve still got my friend Wilson here with me.. Wilson? WIILLSOON 
---
Nvm
---
lol, though it sounds like it is the opposite because the money is flowing in the opposite direction.
---
In the parents posts, the company is trying to stop you from no longer giving them money.  With warranties, the company wants to not shell out any money to the customer.  Unless I misunderstood and the company was in the business of selling warranties all day, and the thing I referenced was yet another company.
---
I would love an option that is a legendary weapon or piece or armor, that randomly assigns legendary \*'s whenever you purchase it. Needs to be fairly expensive so people can only do it a few times with maxed caps.   
---
I think of it like Gheed from Diablo 2. Your just gambling with the rng gods in hopes of getting something good. Usually the items suck, but every once in a while you get something good and feel like all the gambling runs were worth it, and continue doing it. Just an idea! :) 
---
I completely agree that caps become obsolete but what Bethesda game have you played where you haven’t had a vault load of currency left over during end game?
---
10,000+ caps is a massive ask (in my opinion) for casual players and I think the game should be taken as a ‘be whatever character you want to be’ sort of game like the fallout predecessors in order to preserve its longevity for the next few years.
---
Any mechanics that got nerfed in fo4 or Skyrim would result in players adapting their loadout and I just feel that a game like fo76 shouldn’t be so restrictive because it’s online, it just seems pointless in having all these different perks and then Bethesda making it so hard to really play around with these various play styles.
---
No thermals unfortunately, and fatmans can't really kill anything, I can't seem to find a counter to this build at all, just seems op. 
---
Some of the ghouls (rotting, gangrenous) deal poison damage, you can tell by a unique sound effect. They may have buffed their poison damage, which is unaffected by power armor.
---
RIP
---
...
---
Only mega boring whining. Puts me to sleep. 
---
Well, that’s very cynical! ( takes one to know one 😝 )
---
I see your point, but I don’t think that’s what is going on. I have two characters and a friend, it really wouldn’t be that inconvenient. 
---
except it turns out he actually cheated and is now a meme
---
You caused this problem. I don't got much sympathy for you. 
---
I honestly feel it should work like the automatic forms of the cloaking ability.
---
What is POV? if I may ask?
---
I know the feeling, my explosive handmade rifle glitched out of my inventory during a queen fight last Sunday. it was just laying on the ground next to me not in a bag and it wouldn't allow me to pick it up. After a moment of silence and mourning I walked away from it and moved on. It's just a game after all and shit happens. At least it's a virtual loss...
---
Tldr; my advice have a beer or hit a bowl and move on. 
---
Point of View, whatever command makes you go into 1st/3rd  person.
---
Meh. I see a paraplegic in my bar all the time. Fucker leaves his damn catheters everywhere.
---
Haha.  That’s another good gripe.  Would be fun if we could all have dogs again, or cats or volleyballs.
---
Just kidding...no one would want a cat. 
---
No need for rudeness just trying to keep it light hearted while we discuss. just read it and thanks for the information 
---
But but but open miccing is so fun? How else will you know which song is on Appalachia radio if you don't here me singing it everywhere you go? 
---
Maybe they need to conceal things in the code because people are looking at it and dissecting it on reddit.
---
That's so strange. I'm on PC and it hasn't crashed in a while. The servers and the game are really stable now.
---
So strange that a console is more buggy than the PC.
---
I doubt having to scrap extra building junk is a bad thing.
---
If Game makers had to refund to banned players there would be no banned players.
---
It's what a lot of people were running anyway, hense why I assumed they messed with it at all.  Nerf batting everything is so much easier than going through and actually buffing everything else to be equally viable... 
---
Scorchbeasts are giant bats lol 
---
That’s were I opened up my Bbq restaurant 
---
Also what platform are you on? I'll build you new X-01 if your on PS4 (I'm gonna try to play after work tonight but it might be late)
---
So the ban is permanent?
---
Why do you think we're repeatedly nuking the earth? Vault-Tec knew! The planet was against us, so they created the scorched as a reason to create a never ending supply of nukes to fight the planet itself!
---
Solo/co-op campaign is nearly perfect.  PvP stuff is coming along, probably a month or two out from a good experience.
---
thx alot
---
OK it's not just me. Read the patch notes said all this stuff was "fixed" I'm not seeing it if anything it's worse.
---
Maybe there's an issue with your system or files are corrupted
---
Are you on PC.
---
Yeah , I agree, your C.A.M.P Should say "look where I've been / Done . And imagining the trading economy for little collectible do dads
---
Here in the eastern panhandle of WV we have a few interesting landmarks if you like history. 
---
Harper's Ferry was an industrial town overlooking the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers and is now a national park. 
---
Also, there are many civil war battlefields close by, and if you are interested in the civil war, there is a man in Berkeley Springs that is descended from Abe Lincoln, looks like him, and even dresses up as him on Sundays. Oh, there's also a real castle there too.
---
Yes.
---
My wife hates it when I vape when talking to her on the phone, drives her up a wall.
---
Share your pain..do you know if the dense mod can be learned by scrapping?
---
The story there about the couple is so sweet and sad please take care of there garden
---
I’m on PS4 u don’t need to though 
---
Do you mean like the chameleon perk? If so, I agree.
---
But does normal Virginia have a song about it that literally starts with “Almost Heaven, Virginia”? No? That’s what I thought.
---
Bruh. They even warn you before you drop it. Stop putting the blame on others. 
---
I haven't been able to figure this out. I have a delete option in Blueprints but not in stored
---
I get annoyed because the ppl trying to take my workshops are generally in tandem or more, and are much higher level.
---
I’ve never had a battle like those you speak of....which does sound quite fun.
---
Now that I’m lvl 62 and TSE have been nerfed I’ll probably have a better chance.
---
Is blamco the best choice?
---
When I first came to warm my hands by the dumpster fire that is Fallout 76, I didn’t think it would last long. Surely the fire would burn out eventually, right? Nooppe.
---
You and I are having fun playing it together. Don't leave me out. 🤣
---
be happy, you will get 500 atmos for free!
---
Mac and cheese is always the best choice
---
The warranties in question were essentially protection plans for cell phones, tablets and PCs. They generally ran a 1-2 year contract. 
---
There was almost zero cases in which it was a good value.
---
Dude! Me too!!! We're so awesome.
---
High five!
---
What about Salisbury steak?
---
Range weapon? 
---
Take all the workshops!!!
---
Great idea.  I’d like to see that as well.
---
Anyone know where X01 jet packs are now?
---
This is so true.  
---
yeh this usually only happens to me when i spawn at whitesprings golf course....usually takes about 30 seconds sometimes longer for everything to render and im able to open pipboy..i can walk around but nothing else
---
 i just walk behind the bus and wait there where its relatively safe...but yeh it hasnt gotten any better since patch
---
Salisbury steak is good, but Mac n cheese usually tastes better
---
Now that is something I have been looking for myself for a long time to troll people with explosive god-guns. I would like to know that as much as you...I have no idea. 
---
My camp has been in the woods by the lumber mill over by vault 76 since I started the game 64 levels ago and have had a few new players in there. It's just wood fences with 5 turrets and everything's accessable.  That's why my base has only been attacked by players once, because it looks like a hillbilly's farm.
---
Ok
---
It cannot, although Padded is unlockable and is still pretty good. You used to be able to find the Dense plans at vendors sometimes. Now you need to get very lucky.
---
Or just cost you food and water. Pretty dumb to charge money to travel. Why is that even a thing
---
It's your fault for dropping it.
---
Works fine for me
---
Or just make fist weapons wearable with power armor.  
---
It'll nerf fist weapons a bit, since any decent build is losing strength by entering PA, but it'll be a better balance tradeoff than letting hazmat suits stack with armor.
---
You damn right
---
&gt; Structured servers - like other survival games you pick a server and it  becomes the server you can always log back into. I don't like 76 current  servers. This becomes an even bigger issue with how basebuilding - and  even though they've made improvements it's still quite annoying. 
---
Your progress is also often tied to those servers. And my experiences with ARK says this can hurt you if a group of players take over a server and kill you over and over again. You have no way to escape and jumping to a new server means resetting your progress.  The fact I can server hop to get away from someone being an ass hole is wonderful.  
---
&gt; NPCS - yeah i expected NPCs, i think this would have been a totally  different game (for the better) if there were NPCs. But it's not too  late - or at least i think so.. 
---
They really aren't needed. This game differs because you are actually exploring and learning about what happened.  Really helps with the exploration part as you learn about past events and what happened. I think it is much better then an NPC just telling you all relevant information.
---
&gt; Player hubs - this was another big sell point for me that i was  disappointed in. I guess in the back of my head i envisioned a world  where i would have my house and my friends could build theirs next to  mine. And then maybe people would settle close and we would have these  impromptu towns. But i also expected regular towns as well with NPCs  that others can meet up. 
---
Player hubs would be nice if they set it up so you can buy and sell from other players though the game.  The grand exchange on Runescape was wonderful because if I wanted a rune sword I could buy one and I didn't have to stand around for 2 hours spaming "Buying Rune 2hd" across 10 worlds to finally get one. 
---
18k nuka colas is impossible, 50k rounds of 308 is fucking nothing.
---
Junkies is an alternative. Bloodied comes at great risk so it will naturally be the most powerful. 
---
I have a theory, mind you it's just an idea. I am not saying this happened, but imagine a person or company wanting 76 to fail. Now imagine that person/company constructing a plan to tank 76 at launch. If you consider how easy it would be to send info to a few streamers that willingly stream exploits. Essentially making the masses unknowing co-conspirators. Duping caused so many issues, too many to list. The server stability that came along with those exploits ruined the experience for early 76 fans. My idea sounds crazy I know. But if you think about it, a single disgruntled employee could have caused a domino effect of problems. Even worst if this was done by another game company. 
---
Thing is I'm no fuckin duper. So fall back and hit your head on something sharp
---
Epicccc because my friend had 30k ammo and didn’t get banned 
---
I mean I've seen peoples camps who used the camp dupe glitch and had like 50 turrets and the server was fine, though I've had a much more stable connection than most with fo76. So I think they could probably handle more. I definitely feel like the houses that are real large, are bare bones. 
---
Sorry, I've been busy.
---
Holy shit, I guess it really does do unmodded damage? I'll note that in my post.
---
I've had enemies die with a little bit of health still shown on the bar. And enemies stay alive and need one more punch to finish them off. I always chalk it up to server delays on hits. 
---
Is this.... a troll post?!?!?! 
---
 my cryolator kills max lvl ghouls in 2 seconds
---
Does this take into account of explosive damage from TSE guns? Because let’s be honest most people even using a Two Shot legendary also has the explosive mod even after the damage nerf. Does it also 25% the explosive damage from the second shot?
---
Don't worry buddy, I have no friends either, it's still fun.  You bump into other solo players out there.
---
&gt;xhilarating parts of the game for me.  Why does it seem like a majority of players not only get no excitement from this, but actually get frustrated and annoyed?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;ReplyshareSaveedit

I've had several battles that last over 3 hours.  One battle my friend and I destroyed a team of TSE shottys with our non-legendary black powders.  You should try it, you stand a better chance than you may think.  Level also doesn't matter. I've battled level 400's that were nothing and level 35's that killed me numerous times.  Sometimes being a low level is easier as the enemy becomes more confident than they should.
---
works fune for me..thers probably an enemy hiding somewhere you just havent found it
---
Save worthy :D
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying. You apply a 1.25 for damage in equation for TS.
---
I love how many people in here didn't bother to read the email the dude posted. It says, right in the email many of you can't bothered to read, that the ammo was only acquired, **NOT** in stacks in his inventory. Here's what it said:
---
&gt; We have determined that this account has acquired over 100,000 (one hundred thousand) of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of game play.
---
**ACQUIRED**
---
Read that again, get it into your head.
---
Not **IN POSSESSION OF**. Not **IN INVENTORY**. **ACQUIRED**. Which means, that in a 30 day period, he acquired the ammo. Not that it was large stacks in his possession when he was banned. What part of this are you guys missing?
---
What does acquired mean? We **DON'T KNOW**. It could mean you drop it and pick it up again. It could mean you found it when killing another player. It could mean, well anything really since Beth won't tell us. If he crafts 10k ammo, and between mules and such drops it and picks it up 4 times, has he acquired 50k ammo now? We just **DON'T KNOW**.
---
And, as several people have pointed out, yes, you **CAN** craft that much ammo. Even the rare stuff. Many different people have done the calculations and shown that you can craft that much ammo. And yes, that includes resource gathering.
---
I'm not saying whether he duped or not. For his part, he's been honest, and even posted that email you guys keep ragging on him about. Which says a lot to me. But the fact is that it is possible to craft this much ammo. And there's a large difference between "acquired over 30 days" and "in stacks in inventory". And you guys need to get that into your head. And if it turns out this guy was telling the truth, and Beth apologizes (yeah right), I hope you guys all post pics to this sub with a big fat crow on your plate.
---
Also. The only thing super sad is this fucking sub. Jesus christ is it toxic. A little over a month ago this whole sub was aflame with how "this game is going down" and "bethesda is shit" and whatever else. A whole front page of posts of people leaving the game. You talked about how all the bad press (that you shit on the month before) was true. How this game is seeing no improvement. Blah. Blah. Blah. And I guarantee some of you guys in this thread right now were in on that shit train too. Now it's what, back to defending the game against people you have no actual proof were duping? You guys flip flop like a fish, back and forth on love and hate of this game. This whole sub has just become a toxic shit pile of "who/what do we drag next!".
---
And you wonder why the game is "struggling" if this is the player base.
---
The math is correct... Look up the formula.
---
Try removing any targeting hud effect. 
---
Anthem's going through it now.
---
Or increase the frequency of events but give them all a personal cooldown to deter server hopping to farm specific ones
---
most of the challenges are broken..iv completed many of them and they dont register
---
Second group here. I found Rivers during the MoM quest line, but I didn't want to do it dressed like I was. I put on the full outfit, took off my ranger hat, switched my two weapons to the BoB and VoS, and took my time listening to the holotapes. The lore, when you find it, can be so great. It makes you crave more. I've spent several hours, going through things and coming up with theories, it'd make Oxhorn proud lol. That and I swear there's something else. Something hidden. I can't put my finger on it yet, but I think there's something hidden in game that adds up to a big secret...
---
I just wish there was more though. Like, what's with all the shrines? Especially the one in hvelta, with the mega sloth claws...? There's so many things that I want to see explored, but it just feels...lacking?
---
Throw a molotov or two. Setting a player on fire breaks their invisibility. 
---
Theory: Bloodied, per the name, also works if you cover the weapon with gore first.
---
The experiment: jammed a Bloodied Laser Rifle up a squirrel’s butt and pull the trigger. Gore on gun, then shoot something else and note the damage.
---
Results: Failure. Laser rifle only fried the squirrel, no gore acquired, and neither were damage buffs...at measurable quantities, at least.
---
Conclusion: Squirrels smell really bad when you deep fry them butt-first.
---
Look for dead trick or treaters on the highway north of Harpers Ferry - the plans should be on one.
---
+1.
---
"The square root of 2 is not rational" is one of the classic introductory proofs!
---
You are blaming them. You said this is icing on the cake and you are quitting. Even though there is a feature to warn against dropping the item. Sorry, that's as blatant as it gets.
---
Oooh, thank you for this! Will def carry some spares.
---
afaik squirrel food in past fallout games is just a nice way of saying cannibalism
---
Omg I didn't get banned either. We should start a club. We'll call it active players. You automatically join by playing the game. Can't join if you've been banned!
---
Awesome writeup. Even better with clear concise follow up edit correcting mistakes. Excellent example of proper ethics. 
---
Golly gee, that has to be one of the coolest things I ever have seen. Word to your mother.
---
How can you geniuses have to *look into* what was an intended change in any given patch?
---
Fuck that. People get wrongly banned all the time. Decent companies look into it. Bethesda acts like they don't exist.
---
Can you describe your activity leading up to the bounty. Maybe that will shed some light. 
---
With perk cards ammo can weigh next to nothing, however if you put that ammo in you're stash it will revert to its normal weight. It can't gain the benefit of the perk cards due to if you swap the cards out your weight limit in the stash, may go over the cap.
---
Thanks - are you on PC?
---
And this is why the content is drip-fed to you. Don't support it.
---
Enclave bunker, military wing, they're rare. 
---
Xbox actually. I had this issue but it was fixed like 2 patches ago for me
---
Excavator is one of the weakest Power Armors. But it wouldn't have mattered even if you had X-01 or T-51b. If they have a good build they're still going to one shot you. Excavator is just easier.
---
Given access to the evidence, in certain circumstances, it is possible. If, for example, they say you did something at a certain date and time, and you had a solid alibi.
---
I don't think it's really fair to hold companies to the same standards as the criminal justice system (that they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt), but it is fair to expect them to give their customers a chance to defend themselves and access to the evidence against them.
---
Excavator armor sucks for PVP
---
If you dont want pvp you can turn on pacifist mode I’ve heard they can possibly kill you but it’s a lot harder
---
There could have been another pop up, and then maybe a couple more after that
---
There is logic behind wanting a decent ban system instead of letting companies randomly ban people hoping that they'll buy another copy of the game.
---
Wait I thought the stealth boy PA mod wasn't in 76, only in 4???
---
Elevators. And vertical half walls, and half roofs
---
Thanks, I checked everywhere (I literally ran in a spiral pattern (as far as possible, anyway) to make sure I would cover the available area). Wondering if this is an issue of enemies spawning underground or something else. I'm on PC, so it could be platform-version related.
---
They could fix this easily by increasing decent level 3 drops and finally add super rare level 4 or 5 drops. Haven’t played for a while but from the sound of things there isn’t any new decent content being released any time soon 
---
LOL what did you think would happen ahahah
---
Gt GrumpyDude 
---
Too high of expectations. What do you want next, a new engine?
---
Dude, two words, "canvas bag"...
---
I swear i've actually lost learned mods, too...the system for armor, melee weapons, and revolvers in this game is completely unlike the system for most ballistic weapons.   
---
Getting most of the blueprints for, say, a combat rifle or pump shotgun or whatever is...easy. Getting the blueprints for armor is fucking impossible. 
---
Still though? It just seems really unfair. Don’t get the point in tormenting random lower levels. Hope when PvP servers come out people don’t do this. PvP is fun when it’s not just getting fucked over.
---
It's like the boxcar children's house in fallout!
---
This.  
---
In pacifist. 
---
hmm i really sure u never played any mmo, like wow or eso. 
---
Turns out the Dupers were the only thing keeping the economy afloat all along.
---
Oh the irony.
---
The subreddit wanted them publically changed so bad and now they are lamenting them all being gone lol
---
Lying is lame, but cheating in non-PvP scenarios isn't nearly as shitty as cheating in PvP. Most of the time in MMOs you might be slightly inflating the economy or slightly reducing the availability of mobs/loot, not really a horrible thing to do to the rest of the players.
---
That being said, distributing hacks (and major exploits like duping or server crashes) can really fuck up the experience of the other players.
---
hmm yeh i have found enemies stuck inside walls before...and those pesky mole rats could be hiding underground? not sure. does this happen to you every single time at sunshine meadows?
---
They can still kill you if you own a workshop
---
The CMs aren't the Dev team.  I doubt they have access to the  source code or changeList comments where this would have been documented.  So they have to ask the Dev team, i.e., look into it.
---
Mmmmmmm, your mother...
---
Thanks. I'll try it again tomorrow and if it reoccurs, I'll report it as a bug.
---
It’s what at I had on me. wasn’t prepared for it since it’s not a normal occurrence 
---
You have to love the music that goes along with it too, letting you know ow something is about to attack you.  I heard the music when running through  the woods, turned around and a glowing wendigo was crawling up behind me, made my heart jump. 
---
I feel like there should be a law that says if you get banned then you get your money back. Then companies would actually have to make sure their hands are legit.
---
I had 200 duped guns and didn't get banned ahahahahah 1k stimpacks the lot LOL 
---
Yep that’s true before you claim a workshop it says that players may engage in pvp 
---
Why would they, we are the sets server AND we buy the atoms 😂
---
You're welcome and good luck
---
That's why I said the script :) You need to extract the HealthMeter script from the mod and then add it into hudmenu.swf.  The author showed me how.
---
First thing you do is always stash your junk. So you don't lose anything except some caps. Next there is a welcome mat in Misc. way over to the far right of the build menu. Wherever you put that is where you will spawn in. You can put it in a good strategic tactical position so you can respawn there if you die to fight back. Then you need a good build and a good weapon, to fight back. Do you have those things?
---
Pacifist mode gets turned off when you cap a workshop 
---
I had thought the PvP was only while claiming. Not just whenever even outside the zone
---
If you can do it in the game without any additional software then is it really cheating?
---
I'm going to try it again tomorrow and if it does happen again, I'll post back!
---
That's the catch.  That's a privacy issue. And we aren't involved.  It doesn't matter.  I don't know of anyone banned who was legit and just playing.
---
You either believe that a company can access the data they own and doesn't want to ban people.
---
Or you believe random people on the Internet making claims without data. That a company would risk further issue by banning a legit player.
---
It was a ridiculous example to show how flawed the system to ban is, no one would do that usually. 
---
However someone would pass ammo to their alt then back to their main everytime they were going to fight a SBQ if they had the easy means to do so.
---
Someone would pick up a random brown bag that someone may have dropped and end up with 500k bobbleheads, and even dropping them right after wouldnt stop them from getting banned.
---
They created a ban system that is seriously screwed up, because it's based on code that was written for a single player game not online tracking.
---
"Evil" lol it's a game bro you really need to lighten up for your own health
---
Flamers work too! Good for cqc panic fire if you know someone is around but can't target them. There are probably some other things i'm forgetting about...
---
excavator has poor damage resistance compared to the others. You could also get the same damage resistance with non power armor.
---
Before "Black Tuesday"? (Jan 11th patch)... maybe 2 at most, if I found a WhiteSprings nuked I'd head there
---
I've seen this, and it's really cool. But I wish they had added more locations, though. 
---
cool  good luck also have you searched everywhere inside ? upstairs and stuff?
---
"you can't fire me, I quit" is better expressed by just walking away. 
---
Nope if you own the workshop at anytime someone can shoot your workshop triggering a defend workshop quest and they bait you into the pvp area. It could also be that it doesn’t matter where you are if you claim a workshop pvp is a go
---
Same here almost all the time , yet again I don’t try I just happen to be in the skirmish 
---
I appreciate that, if you have any other methods, please let me know!
---
If you could somehow salvage legendary mods and then reapply them to a crafted item or another legendary that would open up a lot of possibilities.  
---
It would be fine if it required a large grind to do the above and/or a lot of rare mats like stable flux.
---
First time I've tried it, but it's also the first time I've seen this error message. I checked the subreddit to see if anyone had reported this bug previously and it was definitely an issue at launch.
---
If you're in the EU then you may be able to do a charge back if you can prove to your bank that the game is inaccessible.
---
deffinetly not. they just ruined the mutations with a radworm "bugfix". and the servers a real wastelands now.
---
Actually there was no battle music. Just the regular music. That probably didn't help
---
Didnt think of that. Normally I store junk as I tend to stay wanted
---
&gt; including one theoretical free caps glitch that I won’t share or even test in game
---
why mention it then?
---
Welp, there goes all of my Atom points...
---
I just get annoyed by people who bitch about Bethseda not doing or telling anyone anything. When they literally have an entire update page on their website that tells people what they are doing, planning, etc.  
---
Not you specifically but other people have kind of set me on a short fuse with this whole thing. 
---
TY for the followup update.  We appreciate it.
---
The best mod. Bethesda needs to help Keretus fix it after the Feb 19 patch. I will not play without it. Really, I quit until it works again.
---
Why deter them? I don't like limits on my fun. 
---
Went over it three times. Also killed the  enemies in the power substation just to make sure they weren't causing the error.
---
See if you can do a chargeback.
---
those welcome mats dont always work. i have one in my camp but never spawn on or even near it
---
It doesn't. Contact them, if they don't respond, call your bank and see if you can do a charge back.
---
ok..well.. happy hunting.
---
Thank you for making this! As unpopular as it seems right now, I believe the 900 hours guy and don't think he duped the ammo or mats. I looked in my own inventory after reading about it all and realized that I had enough ultracite built up to make like 50k 5mm bullets and that is with **zero** intentional farming for it. I might kill a Scorchbeast every once in a while and I've only killed the queen like 3 times. I have been known to tool around in a nuke site or 2 collecting legendaries and raw flux, mostly just to sell for caps. And I almost never collect ore let alone smelt it.
---
My point is that if I feel confident that I could legitimately and easily farm the mats to make 50k ultracite ammo if i so chose to with only minimal effort, then I could have very likely amassed enough "rare items" to get myself banned. Given that, it is very easy for me to assume that at least *some* of the people complaining of unjust bans have a case.
---
Besides all that, I have one other point that leads me to believe that 900 hours guy is innocent. Simply put, I have used exploits on games before. Not regularly, but if I discover one, i have a hard time not taking advantage of it. Now while it definitely gives me a short term pleasure to do so, it also kind of ruins the regular game for me. I find that I seldomly finish games that I have used exploits in. In fact, i often stop playing completely after using them depending on how much impact they have on the game.
---
My point is this, why would the guy play for 900 fucking hours if he was just cheating the whole time?! That's not fun. Also, it's almost like they got him on a technicality. I mean, he had a bunch of ammo...who doesn't? Yet he received the exact same punishment as someone that had millions of copies of game breaking weapons that a normal player would be lucky to ever find one of. How is that fair? The penalty should fit the crime, not just come up with one arbitrary number and make sweeping bans based upon that number without factoring in actual rarity of individual items or total hours played by individual players.
---
I think the real story is that Bethesda *really* doesn't want even more bad press, so they are just going to stick to their verdict of guilty without really considering factors like the ones you have pointed out here. :(
---
Sounds like you hit the jackpot.
---
It always works at a Workshops.
---
They are the definition of raiders.
---
Well Bethesda made a big oof i argue that it deserves this type of treatment. Look at some over companys Activision is so trash because the community has not gave backlash 
---
ok..
---
This makes me glad that the EU has my back in cases like this and lets us charge back.
---
Yes, this is correct. My bad. AA becomes better with Hardened Receivers.
---
The difference in damage, however, never exceededs more than 2.
---
Non-Hardened, TS has a much healthier gap in being bettrr.
---
This is a description of IGN but not Kotaku, yet people lose their shit over one but not the other
---
Have you opened up a government supply drop that you didn’t call in? That gets you wanted since like 2 patches ago. Did you lockpick a container in workshop? Even if the container is not a stash box but is by default locked but then claimed as part of a workshop, that could get you wanted. Did you kill a creature wandering around a players home? It might have been tamed and that would get you wanted too 
---
Maybe read the thread that you are commenting in? People are getting banned for picking up bags.
---
" How Two Shot used to behave is that it would cause both bullets to deal 100% damage "
---
no. the original one made a 100% base damage+modifiers like perk cards and 100% base weapon damage without any buff.
---
Already did, I'm the OP of the post this is referenced too.
---
The year is 2024. Excavator finally gets a skin. It's neon pink. People buy it anyway.
---
My biggest issue is since patch my gun unequipped itself, says it’s either out of ammo or broken when it’s not, can’t keep two weapons equipped. Legendaries are glitching more then before the patch I’ve lost at least 20+ 3* legendary loot opportunities 
---
Will hold for 10 minutes or until someone can take over
---
Sounds like now is a good time to buy the game and get on since all the high level cheaters will be gone!
---
That's the thing, I don't want a refund. I want my character back. I've worked too fucking hard to get him to where he's at, and getting a full Cav's set legit. I love this game. I'm just upset because of the way these false positives been handled, because I still know plenty of dupers who are still playing.
---
No, only when both projectiles hit; I'm simply mentioning ADS because in ADS that's a guarantee.
---
Their countless mistakes and lies and disregard for the playerbase does indeed give me the right to bash them.  Why should they not be held accountable.
---
They should have done dam near everything different.  You don't see the point, this isnt a bath on Bethesda thread regardless of what they have done, it's a post showing the possibility they screwed up yet again, so people stop witch hunting every single person who says they got wrong fully banned.
---
Everyone jumps on the wagon, oh screw that guy he was obviously a duper, so I provided a counter argument with evidence from Bethesda showing that someone may not be.
---
Are you having similar problems? What kind of video card do you have? I have an RX570.
---
NERF HUNGER AND THIRST ITS OP!!!!!!
---
Pretty loaded for me.
---
FYI, most banned players started new accounts and they are leveling them up pretty fast. 
---
To be fair I’m not trying to blame others I was going through spamming the drop button because I was over encumbered like I normally do this was my first Atom Shop item 
---
Both sentences in your comment are wrong.
---
Being banned doesn't make you guilty and if you live in the EU then they owe you a refund if you bought the game within 3 months.
---
*10 atoms have been deposited into your account*
---
It does, just not mods.
---
This allows AA to be better only when using a Hardened Receiver. Yet even with Hardened, the biggest gap AA can ever have over TS is no more than 2 damage.
---
It could be that. It was working earlier, but you never know.
---
Good way to end up getting banned
---
also now slap damage can kill you..i was at a vendor selling stuff and someone got impatient and started shooting me..i ignored it because i knew he couldnt kill me anyway after about 30 or 40 shots...i died..i spawned back and asked him how TF did he kill me? he said since latest update he has been able to kill people from slap damage.. dayum
---
I replied to another of your comments a few minutes ago. My bad, I addressed it.
---
Does it ever start working correctly?
---
Its the pet dog that grinds my gears. 
---
ummmm what?
---
I'm the one who showed the equation he's using... I *literally* did the math, check my post history.
---
They both came in a set together on the Atom shop in December, yeah.
---
Why not crash the entire OS just to make sure. And then once everything gets running again if it gets dropped, then it’s final? 
---
Yeah but some of us are filthy casuals. They gotta think for us, although it's unlikely 
---
Take a picture with him too!  Some quick Atoms this week.
---
That’s the same as duping if you’re using a glitch to duplicate any junk item in game
---
 I understand that  I never said it wasn’t 
---
&gt; Stone steps trap mobs like no ones business.
---
It's not mobs man. The stairs are metallic, almost transparent, and far away from me anyway. NO mobs can be trapped in those without me seeing them.
---
People just suck? What’s satisfaction do they get from just tormenting the same player half their level? 
---
Munition factory. I like to farm attackers trying to claim it. They come with junk and caps on kill.
---
Cone to think of it, I did lose a combat shotgun. It just disappeared from my inventory.
---
Well for one if everything should be done differently why don’t you go and fix it? And besides it’s only a temp ban so I don’t understand the crying to begin with. Yes they should be held accountable but calling them stupid doesn’t help any. Constructive criticism is what they need not 1000 people crying online because something is messed up.
---
Sorry thought I was commenting on a different post where they were talking about jumping in a fissure site with 200lbs of junk and it duplicates the junk
---
I think its a troll to get people to jump into a fissure with all of their junk on them. . . 
---
Okay, after further testing, even with a whopping 400 base damage (which no bullet weapon can reach by default with no bonuses, not even Dragon or Gauss), the difference is still less than 2 damage better.
---
I'm going to note this in my post, and I think you should update as well saying that AA is only stronger when Hardened, and never by more than 2 damage per hit.
---
They're taking this apocalypse thing literally.
---
I've never seen such an overly pretentious sub.
---
Meanwhile theres a thread on the front page lamenting the state of the economy and wishing the DuPeRs were still here lmfao.
---
at whitesprings sometimes i need to close the game but most times it comes.good after  30 seconds to a minute.
---
Oh ok gotcha my bad
---
Nope.  Still not possible.  You need hardened mass, glowing mass to make pure Flux.   I never have enough of those to use all of the Raw Flux I get in a nuke zone.
---
They didn't even look at all of the ingredients...  because you need pure violet Flux,  not raw.
---
I'm on PS4 and I see a decent number of players still. Honestly, it's not as empty as I would like my servers to be.
---
&gt;making a build that relies on it more dangerous because you have to hover at a lower hp.
---
healing factor just dont work from the last patch.
---
I like the rustic, adventurous tone of the main theme too.
---
Like what you like, hate what you hate.
---
People nowadays are to easily lead to pitchforks and care too much about shit that just doesn’t matter.
---
The internet is a fucking circlejerk echo chamber.
---
I wanna get unbanned :CCC
---
&gt;  sucking an exploiters dick, 
---
Why should I belive Bethesda over some random internet commenter? At this point, the latter has more credibility.
---
can you get banned if you bought a duped item from reddit?
---
One option that would actually be really freaking handy is a system where after a set period of time, say five minutes, a mr-handy "tidies up the corpse" and all of "your" loot ends up in a set central bin location for a once over before you log out.   
---
Because let's be real, I'm sure server stability is a big issue, but there's another one...corpses teleport \_all the fucking time\_ after death. I can't count how many legendary items I've lost due to the buggy way this game handles corpses.   
---
Hell, have a access fee to this repository, say 10% of the cap value of any items removed. 
---
Honestly I think it will be dead by October 
---
wtf
---
I spent a good part of a server run trying to make one.  I picked up large right and left antlers and the fruitless journey began there...
---
I've noticed since the last patch people attacking me for no reason a lot more. Maybe this is why?
---
&gt; Occam's razor answer
---
The Occam's razor answer is that Bethesda screwed up like they've screwed everything else up.
---
Yes because players declaring that Bethseda isn't telling them as justification for complaining. Then once you link them inside the vault they complain that each individual one isn't a full recap of everything they have said previously.  Moving that goal post each time to complain about something. 
---
Yeah, I have this issue there often. An invisible enemy where the diamond marker shows, but there is no enemy there. 😣
---
My brother is super dependent on the internet for his opinions, he was convinced 76 was going to be terrible and of course I was a big nervous but now I love it! And of course now that he’s seen me play it and talk about it he’s considering buying it 
---
Same. I just started seriously using power armor so I thought it was the PA. Very annoying when you need to switch between a gun and a sledge hammer lol
---
Yeah I saw that but then it didnt count any damage done
---
I've launched the game twice in the past month, but I'm not banned. I guess you need to log in consistently for them to track your tens of thousands of duped ammo and nukas
---
Oh wait, I just don't have any of those. never mind
---
I actually agree with that
---
They used an arbitrary and irrelevant indicator of amassed items and illogically correlated it to cheats because they have no legitimate means of identifying cheaters. 
---
could be...people.are getting bored so they turn to pvp
---
Maybe it's the subreddit that's spent. 
---
Rare as in they are not there all the time?
---
what are nuka grapes?
---
You can get these via the game regularly 
---
Stop having a panic attack. Everything is fine. They announced content coming out next month (or was is April). Just b cause some loonys spam all over about garbage 24/7 doesn’t mean 95% or the players aren’t just ignoring Reddit and YouTube. These places are not life. Neither are these games
---
Bloodied synergies so well with game mechanics. You've got armor that gives you better stats the lower your health, so better melee damage...but also better across the board, so even non-melee builds benefit from them. You have a perk card that gives you up to a bonus 5 str if you use radiation to maintain your low health, as well.  I mean, it's the ultimate glass cannon build, but you hit like a truck.   
---
Junkies relies on mechanics that lower your stats. This means that even when you start doing better damage, your over-all performance is affected. Same for the one which requires you to not have armor. They can do some pretty amazing damage, but not nearly the fucking insane amount of Melee damage a bloodied/unyielding armor build combo can do.   
---
You can do pretty fucking great with a sneak crit instigating build, though. 
---
I’m more concerned about the life someone like this leads, maybe this is a blessing in disguise.
---
After not being able to loot SBQ and long load time for a fucking loot to load in whitesprings, I quit the game and it was worth it
---
So...... cheating? I'll wait til they start banning for this exploit and laugh at you.
---
I carry level action and sledge and the issue happens with and without PA.
---
Yip 
---
Jesus they’re all gorgeous. Now THIS is what we should have had from the beginning.
---
Yeah, I don't know what triggers it disarming. 
---
Well I logged on today for the first time in months, and remembered that right before I stopped playing, a kind stranger dropped over 5000 Nuka Colas in a suitcase in front of me. So I had all of them still today, and proceeded to drink  each and every one with no delays, and Bethesda didnt ban me or warn me. I think the issue was that he made a video showing the number of ammo he had. Bethesda is not an all knowing force, and are using this story to scare people into playing legitimately. Which is great, I stopped playing because of people with duped stuff. But there will always be exploiters, and with a game as fucked up as this one; Bethesda will always be playing catch up with all their bugs and least of all exploiters. 
---
He has the mods not armour
---
Thanks man. Appreciate that advice. 
---
Hahaha get it kind stranger thanks for the gold KiNd StRaNgEr!!!1!1111!
---
"it's a game bro" yeah. And you, a human in the real world, have made the conscious decision that your enjoyment at the expense of others is a valid choice.
---
That's fucking evil, dude. 
---
Having played quite a few online games I understand that disconnections happen and it’s part of the process.. but I feel your pain, it seems to happen most during SBQ fights especially after multiple nukes on a single server. There really should be some way to have the SBQ’s loot go automatically into your inventory if you were fighting her, you get disconnected and she gets killed. 
---
I no literally nothing about coding tho so that’s probably harder than it sounds, just sucks to put all that effort in and get slapped in the face like that. If you’re on xb1 next time hmu and I’ll be your server anchor 
---
Was published by Bethesda Softworks but not created by Bethesda Studios... Come on man everybody knows that
---
Cool cool
---
How is playing whack-a-mole on another player any less boring than whatever else they were doing?
---
Step one: count stuff (summaries saved: this is Time 1 - congrats! You now have 'how many of each item you have at a given time')
---
Step two: wait
---
Step three: count stuff again (given time 2)
---
Step four: subtract..  T2 count minus T1 count 
---
It would be really hard to mess that up.  The implementation could be different, like they could be logging every event and only looking at the incoming transfers, which would be like what you're getting from their statement. However, this would be pretty bad as it wouldn't track your losses.  What if people in accounting, banking, inventory management, etc. did this?  
---
And also, why aren't people who ran ammo shops crawling out of the wood works complaining?
---
More people post in the filthy casuals subreddit. 
---
Sucks to your ASSmar
---
I’ll upvote you if you can tell me what book that’s from
---
Could a dweller not have just take a regular suit of power armor and made the modifications themselves?
---
They all look like something a scavver could cobble together.
---
I took over as Grumpy had to run. I’m holding Grahm now. Near Flatwoods. GT PRL867
---
THIS! I'm in a clan who has at least 12+ ppl on a day. It's extremely easy to fill the gaps you would lack if you were solo. It also makes it easier to get flagged for trading, see as at least 4 of us in my clan got banned. Only one of the ppl being a legit duper, the other 3 I guess just got caught up cuz we're his friend.
---
Dude's apparently injured and can't do much of anything. So he plays games.
---
You’ve gotta be kidding me.. I can’t even with you Stan. 
---
I've only had that gun aiming issue once.  I'm not sure what caused it, but it did work itself out within the same session.  I think I needed to switch to another gun and reload it.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if it's linked to my melee sporadically locking up, where I just can't stab for some reason.
---
+karma 
---
War Rider is Shredder? Or a robot amurai? 
---
It is possible. I have unlocked all armor mods that can be from scrapping and found all plans for the others that cannot, except one: Plan: Dense Leather Torso. See my spreadsheet for more info on all mods and how they are unlocked:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Stick with it. It is possible! I crafted and/or scrapped thousands of armor pieces and hunted and traded daily to get them all.
---
It did for me idk must just be part of the bug tho 
---
Looks too cool to be true..
---
YeH happened to me with BoS. Thought I got the legs. Got the helmet
---
Yea, usually there's 2 maybe 3 mods at a time. You can server hop to get them but might take some time. Might as well keep an eye out for calibrated shocks if you do 
---
Was it Lord of the Flies?
---
Lmk if you’re there. I’m on trade screen. 
---
Player populations have decreased a bit. People are mentioning how they're playing on empty servers, but they also add how much they like that (no griefers, easy to claim workshops, more resources).
---
Also, it seems like PS4 is not as stable as PC. Currently PC is incredibly stable.
---
Oh man. Do you think he'll update the mod in the future? Can the script method be shared? 
---
&gt; Ive farmed harpers ferry
---
I used to live there.  I wonder how much it resembles the real place.  
---
🙄
---
Dozens!
---
Dude says he's injured and can't physically do much. So he plays video games.
---
Maybe you shouldn't assume things like an asshole?
---
But hey man. You do you.
---
How do you not know? 
---
I don't believe it's just boredom, but frustration and anger against the game.
---
Regardless of possible sarcasm, Bethesda's already aware of Fallout 4's See Through Scopes mod ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9476), [BethPC](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/752993), [XB1](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/969715)), [and even interviewed the creator](https://bethesda.net/en/article/1iLLjV1CHMQUi4Qc8ce8Sm/fallout-4-my-creation-interview-henkspamadres) after including the mod in their first [Feature Mods article](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4a2slrkNmUW4aOCACY6KKo/fallout-4-and-skyrim-special-edition-introducing-featured-mods) two years ago.
---
Adapting the mod's concept for 76 would definitely be welcome.
---
I LOL'd at work again! :D
---
"Decent"
---
Maybe you're the one in the wrong?
---
Have you ever thought about that?
---
They can't do server browsers, because then people can watch the game numbers dwindle.
---
&gt; sometimes enemies literally bump against me and I'll still be [HIDDEN]... 
---
a diseased mutant dog gave me rad worms that way lol
---
&gt; chameleon armor 
---
my experience with this is that the AI completely ignores my invisibility, as in they can see me anyway
---
I don't care what you believe what does that have to do with shilling?
---
Might be that hunger and thirst are buffing different, already extant perks. 
---
I've seen plenty of new videos in the last 2 weeks, I can assure you that a few still do.
---
Yes. 
---
Yeah, I can't change the title at this point, but I've already updated the OP to as closely reflect that as possible. It shows less than a 2% improvement as expected. I'll do some extra work now to make sure it's clear. Thanks for working with me here on this!
---
I was just in Camden park and The bot had EVERY excavator mod. But FML, 5880 for calibrated shocks. ??? That’s with lvl 3 perk and grape mentats. 
---
Yeah, they mention Warframe, but there's a pretty massive difference in what atoms would be traded for vs platinum in Warframe.  
---
The closest comparison would be the Riven market for Warframe. And the active online communities are split like 50/50 on it being good or bad, meanwhile the majority of players probably don't even know it exists.  
---
But, that specific section isn't exactly something you'd want to use as an example of how it should be done...  
---
For context, Rivens are randomized weapon mods that are for specific weapons and are basically the most powerful things in the game.  
---
Great Rivens are highly inaccessible to the vast majority of players, because of just how expensive they get valued by the sellers.  
---
So, as far as Fallout 76 goes.... it'd likely go from the trader holding out for a super specific trade to them additionally accepting a ludicrous amount of atoms.
---
Maybe people don't actaully want to ril on it, but it's such a fuck up that they have to.
---
speaking about macros... you are aware of the fact that a bethesda employee saw that post and congratulated him on such a great post, and that they praised him for those tactics, macros included? im pretty sure they wouldnt have said that if they had thought it was ban worthy.
---
Will do.  Thanks 
---
Yes, it's this irritating bug where if you have two of the same type of weapon on the select wheel, it only recognizes one.  And it breaks every time you change servers.  So, if you have an Instigating Combat Knife in one slot, and an Anti-Armor Combat Knife in the other, the Instigating one will be empty.
---
Bethesda is aware of it, and they know the circumstances behind it, but it (surprisingly?) wasn't fixed in Patch 6.
---
She lived as an adult with her parents?
---
Are you on PC? I don't even get a marker, just the error message. 
---
I have heard that it can’t...but I also can’t buy or find it so there’s that lol
---
This happened to me a couple of months ago before I knew there was a pacifist mode. I was just outside of the Overseers camp and had just hit lvl5, standing in the road, looking at my pip boy, not really paying attention to anything else, and I started getting hit with slap damage. I wasn’t going to retaliate because I did not want to fight and didn’t have anything that would be effective dealing damage. Dude followed me for about five minutes and finally killed me. After I respawned, I tried to find him and he had left the server. It was a stupid waste of time and I don’t know why anybody would do it. 
---
Gotcha and padded is like a crappier explosion resistance ?
---
This has been a bug since launch. Weapon weight reduce armor doesn’t always work. Have load another server to trigger. 
---
The game has not improved at all. Every patch breaks more than what they attempted to fix. Now they are banning everyone as well. Good luck playing, but I would just accept the monetary loss as so many have already.
---
Honestly, there are very few of the "bigger" channels that are decent in my experience. Most of the popular ones are pretty garbage, and largely traffic in outrage-bait and *very* bad information.
---
Half the time I'm discussing FO76 or Anthem or any other big controversial/"controversial" elsewhere the threads just get muddied up with Quartering, Yongyea, and other dogshit tier channels that just spout off idiotic bullshit that plays to folks existing opinions rather than delivering any interesting, insightful, or informative information.
---
I am here but could give a shit bout u.
---
If only consumer rights were more valuable the TOS's... alas
---
use of a macro may not be ban worthy for harvesting but when you  Considering it's also almost the same way to dupe ammo and other things that is where you get into trouble. 
---
ooooh Somebody is salty!
---
Sure, they might have accounted for items in a terribly naive way.  However, what if they checked counts every day (or every few hours) against their data store to make their naughty list and banned anyone who had too much two weeks (or other arbitrary time) later?  You wouldn't be able to connect the dots like those dupers you mention who all dumped too late (after the initial bans happened).
---
For the life of me, I have no idea why Slap Damage isn't some fixed, tiny value (or zero) rather than some strange percentage-based thing.  I've had people come up to slap me and take off a good 1/8th of my HP.
---
Still don't believe it
---
I agree as the 5 it's giving right now is completely too much..  considering gunpowder for normal guns.
---
Don't worry, it's just the bounty for shill trolls.
---
Fallout Good &gt; :^(
---
Most if not all of these issues stem from trying to make an aged engine do things it was never intended to do. It was never meant to be MMO, and does not have the scaling capacity to do it. A lot of kludges, workarounds, and shortcuts make it sort of work, but not really.
---
Add to that a fan base that has always loved single player and wished for small group co-op play (borderlands style, in my case). So the MMO style expectations simply arent a reasonable expectation from the fan base.
---
Guess what op
---
I keep 100 of all junk, except for screws, gear and springs, which I keep 200 of and steel I keep 300 of.  I have bandolier, traveling pharmacy, Ordnance Express and batteries included cards x3 and then 2 cards that reduce weight of food and drinks so keep most of all that on my person instead of in the stash.  
---
If you have multiple sets of power armor, if you put the pieces on the chassis first, they only weigh 10 lbs each.  All the rest is guns glorious guns.  I haven't played since the patch so can keep even more guns now!
---
ACOG is 4x, not a scope.
---
You got a Jim Sterling video made about you! [Here](https://youtu.be/bT8STHunM8k)
---
I assume they are referring to the legendary drops rather than the "unique" weapons in the game.
---
I honestly think this game is worth it - but not for full price. $20 is what I'd value it at imo. 
---
coming now if still there
---
so true. I have been searching for a bloodied explosive hunting rifle, which its average price on the market is around 15k if someone ever sold for caps. I had 15k when I hit the market76, 2 weeks later and after alot of other small trades here and there. I was sitting at 25k. I literally posted that I am willing to pay all my caps for this weapon.
---
No one gave 2 shits. Cuz they wanted trades only. So I managed to find someone selling sentinel assasin pieces. I bought them both for 15k and began posting to trade them in for a bloodied hunting rifle. Only today, I managed to successfully do a trade with those two pieces for a hunting rifle. 
---
Although, while I do agree with your analogy on how the dupers influenced the market, they also destroyed the value of the less rarer items in an average players possession. Making as you said everything an average player could loot, utterly priceless.
---
Keep in mind, dupers have unlimited caps due to duping of nuka colas, which give you cap on consumption. 25,000 nuka colas would mean 25k caps, so they buy out the valuable items and monopolize over the market. No player should have the ability to monopolize over an economy with an exploit. 
---
One misconception that you missed... dupers stopped returning duped copies to the market, on the contrary, they began selling them straight for real life cash on websites, for example the sentinel assassin armor wasn't ever thrown wildly into the market, while being over duped from what I heard. Which is why you could never find anyone selling them for caps. 
---
Just a nuka flavor that is basically a super rad away.  Video here that another redditor made:
---
https://youtu.be/6-Y_O2olLCY
---
Are they rare? I've had one for months
---
Yes I can confirm for sure
---
So you could so you have a shit to give. 
---
Do we know why bethesda banned him ?
---
Is there an official source ?
---
They seem to ban randomly...
---
Nothing anime or cutesy please. Red, black, maybe a rusty brown
---
So?
---
Avoid the targeting hud effect and see if it helps. 
---
I don’t know how engines affect this sort of thing
---
because they are looking for a reaction..some players would rage and get all pissed off and the griefer gets a laugh out of it..me i just take things in my stride..i dont get pissed off over something that happens in a game..i just spawned back and laughed and asked him how the hell was he able kill me with slap damage lol
---
If you don't mind me asking, what do you work as?
---
Great post btw, much appreciated!
---
He has a name.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
You are living every retails workers dream , my man
---
I’ve gotten more than 60 hours out of it, and most people complaining or complimenting have as well
---
&gt;Banned (Suspended) Don't care
---
K, bye
---
i guess your one of those guys that like to grief
---
Still here, Felicia? Thought you said bye.
---
Wow, Felicia, just go away.
---
Bye!
---
I spent $80 on the Tricentennial Edition, 300+ hours in the game...It was money well spent. I got the platinum trophy 5 days ago and I am taking a break from it now until Bethesda finally drops some more worthwhile content, PVE content.
---
This isn't a new thing. Griefers have been toxic assholes the entire time. 
---
I only play solo. Did you enjoy Fallout 4? Do you think you would like a slightly more buggy version of Fallout 4 that has pretty much no NPCs, but has probably 100+ hours of good content before things get stale (and apparently free DLC is coming)? If that sounds like something you would enjoy, go for it. If you can get it for $40 or less, I think it is a great buy... But that's just my opinion, of course.
---
&gt; where this would have been documented. 
---
Know where this would have been documented? The fucking patch notes. Oh, wait, we have to wait for someone to datamine the patch to get anything even approximating those.
---
JFC Felicia, are you STILL here?
---
Yes indeed!
---
To me this Fallout is more of an open world shooter, you can still have a lot of fun exploring but imo it’s hard to stay engaged with the story. Don’t get me wrong there’s a lot of great voice actors and compelling plot lines, I just never felt like they really tied it all together in the way I would’ve liked. That being said, if you like past fallout games then there’s a lot this game does better than the other ones and is definitely worth a chance. 
---
Yup, also caught a bullshit ban. 700 hours of gameplay, every achievement, main character 248 second one 123 but you know all that crap I had was clearly duped and not earned by playing their damn game. They didn't even list what I had in my inventory they just said it was over 100,000 which is crap cause both my guys could still move. I dont even use a mule. :/
---
So I tested it out. Placed the camp assembly within various rocks and it all loaded fine. Then I placed the camp on a foundation and placed the foundation underwater. Twenty tries later... Still unable to load camp. So I do think this error happens when the camp and the terrain are not in agreement (also you can use this to move your camp for free at any time(
---
Chaun Demars?
---
yeh iv been griefed before but never been killed by slap damage.. till now
---
That bot and the one in Grafton (not the train station) have the excavator mods, but those ones are pricy because you need flux to craft em
---
Yeah and what's sad is they get tons of views and comments, which means that they would rather spend their time bitching about a game instead of playing.  Most comments are from people who have never played the game but are just jumping on the hate train.  I personally love the game, despite all the bugs.
---
How much camp budget is needed for a pet I never get the tame option only pacify. I’m thinking I don’t have enough budget? I have both max rank wild wasteland and animal friend perks. And have tried on numerous animals of all levels and types all random encounters as well I’m level 200 and can’t seem to tame anything.
---
So what’s the point of level 3 perk?
---
I'm Spartacus!
---
9th grade was a long ass time ago lol but I knew I recognized it from somewhere lol
---
Not worth the frustration. Spend your money on a game that isn't still in a beta state. There has been a lot of shilling and manipulation on this subreddit to keep selling copies. I could have been ok with the state of the game, but what they have done here is the worst. Their reputation to me is in the gutter now.
---
All right, I’m letting him go. 👍🏻
---
Wow, bring out the tag-team shills. What company do y'all represent?
---
&gt; ...and ask me if you think I’m cheating. 
---
Okay. Do I think you’re cheating?
---
Boxcar Children same thing I thought! Cool place.
---
Respect for being able to just admit it and not lie about it like others.  It's just a video game after all.  Different people will have fun in different ways.
---
Some traders were saying they got banned and warned others. More obviously on trading sub. This sub is pretty high traffic so you ever see mostly the most popular thread.
---
You must be very sheltered.
---
I don't blame you for not taking your armor off lol. I've always thought that's a ridiculous requirement for a legendary. Why would anyone want to not have armor on, and get one shot by basically anything higher than level 10?
---
10% and can only be animals that show up at the "random event" spots and I only have 3 in charisma and just animal friend rank 3 and can tame stuff
---
Just hit level 101 with my 2nd character which I used Monster Mash from the time I was level 30 to 100, trophy still did not pop up.
---
I wouldn't bother they just keep breaking more than they are fixing. And the servers are empty since they banned a large percentage of players. 
---
That mod is amazing I really hope they add it 
---
That sucks, I wonder why it did for me and not for you. 
---
It is scary how probable this theory sounds, only because how unregulated the streaming/YouTube market is and how profitable it has become in recent years. I believe for the vast majority of industries if there is no law saying they can’t do most corporations will at least try it if it means more money
---
I never said he didn't know how to dupe.
---
Yes.  Not in patch notes but it was in the code pulled by a member here.  Another box was effected as well.
---
Prob 1-1.5?
---
I’ve searched all over random spawns that I’ve looked up and have seen videos of people taming pets in the same spots I just never get the option only x to pacify or y to pacify no tame option. I’ve had 25% available and still no go. Maybe I’m just unlucky I’d take anything even a mole rat at this rat lol 
---
Sorry, can't bind it to controller on pc. 🤷‍♂️
---
Poopy NoNo
---
Meh, 60-80 hours of ok exploring, more if you like reading every note and every terminal. Loot system sucks. Lots of weird bugs and sometimes even the CMs don't know if they are features or mistakes. Next to no endgame to speak of. Worth $20-30.
---
Ok, I think I saw one post a while ago (which I couldnt find again before asking) that said that.
---
Thank you
---
Nice armor (paintjobs?), but umm..
---
I S  I T  L O R E  F R I E N D L Y

Guess at this point it doesnt matter.
---
Oh man I want pies &amp; pints now..
---
i found that depending on where you build, bridges can be done quite easily, see this postcard of mine as an example [https://imgur.com/a/A2VEasz](https://imgur.com/a/A2VEasz)
---
Can't think of anything else I'd like build rn though, only maybe a robot workstation so i could make me a robot companion or even a freaking mount. that would be dope af.
---
Not sure. Either way I'm just going to uninstall so it's not even a problem for me any more. I've got 100s of games I can (and should) play besides this. Maybe if I decide to come back to this it will have had tons of patches and that will hopefully be one of them.
---
Someone help me figure out who to hate more:  crybabies or sanctimonious assclowns?
---
Using Occam's Razor would more push this towards him being unfairly banned.  There is much more real-world evidence of Bethesda's inability to do things correctly, then theorizing over how much ammo this bed ridden guy who only played fallout 76 practically every moment could have made.  
---
Wtf. Sad face.... I'm sure it's been said in another thread, but why doesn't Beth just post these things?
---
1.5k all day. I sell them every day at that price with no complaints.
---
A short walk south west or thereabouts from Vault 76
---
Slap damage could always eventually kill.i personally keep a rank of born surviver on.
---
That’s a shame, I’d be pissed too if I were you to be stuck at 99%
---
I remember when I got all the trophies for destiny 1 and was one trophy away from getting platinum and could never manage to get that last trophy. I tried for months and it almost ruined the game for me
---
Would you get banned if you duped the legendary butthurt though?
---
Opinions are opinions. What isnt an opinion is Fallout76 being a broken game. Not because people dont like it, no, because it's literally an online game built on a foundation made for single player which has caused hundreds upon thousands of technical issues and limitations. 
---
Not too mention how anyone with a keen eye can see how FO76 is just a massive asset re-use from ripping off Skyrim dragon combat for scietchbeats, too everything from Fallout 4. And this without mentioning how bugs from previous Fallouts which were never fixed, made their way into FO76. Bugs which were mild inconveniences in a single player setting, cause big dispersal in an online one. 
---
The game is built badly. This isnt an opinion, but an objective fact we can measure based on quality measurement. Calling g something so functionally broken "decent" because you lile it is just blind fanboyism. You can like this and still accept their bad. Hell right now I like Anthem and I can still say it's bad and not worth 60 bucks. 
---
Flaming shit bags are always hilarious  but their hilarious because they are a literal bag of shit on fire. It's ok to find enjoyment in bad things is my point.
---
Thank you so much :)
---
Are these people speedrunners? Challenge runners? No? Then it's not really relevant is it?
---
Able to tame bigger animals like deathclaw and megasloth
---
Wow, you really are a piece of shit, you know that? You might want to try to learn empathy at some point, you psychopathic asshat. 
---
I've been gaming since I was old enough to hold a controller. If this game was really as bad as these YouTube trolls make it out to be, I wouldn't have played to level 200. Come on everybody jump on the fo76 bashing bandwagon! Its the cool thing to do these days. 
---
Mother of Atom, I want a kazoo now. And that mouth harp.
---
Good to know
---
Why? I've got better things to do with my time, like everyone else who is legitimately playing the game.
---
Is it available?
---
Yeah, it's Mothman week
---
I dont need to watch a YouTube video to know trash when I see trash. Maybe you do, but I dont. I also dont need to stop low and be pathetic enough to call people i disagree with, mouth breathers. But i will call people being assholes for no reasons, petty assholes. 
---
Have a nice day.

WAR RIDER AND BLACK RIDER GIMME
---
 I'll be honest, I almost didn't buy the game because of all the negativity around it, and this as someone who humbly has the expendable income to spend on a game I might not like. I've been a fallout fan since 1 and I'm glad I didn't heed their advice as this is just such an exquisitely created world.
---
Not from my experience, or many other peoples’s experience.
---
The regular invasions of Super Mutants to Lewisburg didn’t annoy you too much?
---
I have had the game since launch and have put in over 110+ hours into it and love every bit of it. Just annoying when the queens loot doesn't load for half a hour. But I mostly play with a team and we all are level 70+. It's worth it if you ask me.
---
They found why their system flagged him. Doesnt mean the system isnt flawed and false positives never happen. 
---
Did the same as you + a Behemoth and said well fuck it.
---
Hmmm that’s a good idea ty I definitely have it on my excavator, I almost never get kicked tho except in SBQ but I guess that’s because of how intense it is on the CPU and whatnot 
---
Definitely be sure to try Fallout New Vegas. Easily one of the greatest games ever made. 
---
Just saying if they were doing a weekly maintenance and scanned for dupes as part of the maintenance, that would cause a lot of problems for dupers. They have already shown they can delete a lot of rare dupes during a maintenance so why not do it on a weekly basis to keep the pressure on the dupers while they look for ways to patch the in game duping.
---
Comment of the year for me
---
All the rags posting the doom 'n gloom articles are in a circle jerk with each other.  It's clear none of the morons writing these tripe articles play the game.  The only thing that matters is who can claim the money shot by being first to print.
---
:D
---
Lol I'm paying g 2.5k for the legs on ps4 
---
I meant like those rope bridge things. Not just walkways.
---
&gt;The good stuff should be very rare and it is. 
---
I highly agree. But with duping nothing will save/fix what we have. I can only hope at some point we will get cheat free hardcore servers that are completely separate from current system.
---
Sweet, good thing I held onto a couple spares. Now if they can just fix ultracite explosive vents, buff the hell out of them, buff 'em again, and then make them impossible to find....
---
What? You aren't really making sense, what do you mean checked counts against their data store?
---
I mean you can easily see that BSG doesn't check if you've already picked up an item before just by putting a legendary you have in a container and closing the container and then re opening it and pulling the legendary out, you will get the same pop up you get when you first find the legendary, which means BSG has zero checks on if an item you pick up is one you already had in your possesion. Which means them miscounting his ammo would be more likely than not. Especially with the way they have been handling everything else. They have bungled literally every single patch and every single thing they have done with this game, why is it so hard to believe that they may have screwed up their algorithm as well and had false positives?
---
No, I'm actively attacking people who are attacking the OP and saying stupid shit about "now you can do something different / they did you a favor / why would you waste your time" etc. People being pointless fucks for no real reason other than to show how superior they think they are by piling on the hate train. We get it. So go somewhere else and do something you enjoy rather than trolling more Fallout 76 stuff. You are the pathetic ones with nothing better to do, clearly. 
---
In all seriousness, I suppose it is. There's mutated cryptids running around, everyone who isn't a player is either dead, a robot, an AI, mutated beyond all repair, or a zombie worshiping a giant bat-dragon monster, Cthulhu's baby is asleep in Lucky Hole Mine, and according to messages in hidden rooms/locations, it's all a Matrix dream.
---
there is only a few ones that can be tamed regardless of your lvl you are looking for lvl 21 deathclaw lvl 30 mirelurk king lvl 24 mirelurk hunter lvl 16 yao guai , there are a few lower lvl things too  but wouldnt be worth your time and of course they have to be at those special spots
---
Yeah, I noticed at a certain point that I was really outclassed.  I think at that point you have to make sure your guns and armor are leveled up to the max and you can pick some cards that increase your favorite weapons' dammage.  
---
Once you hit 50 and can't level up gear but mobs keep leveling with you, that's when you really have to start investing in cards that increase dammage, ignore armor, etc.  I had to come to terms with that. Prior to that most my cards were for weight reduction.
---
Happens when I spawn in, at my camp. I'm on xbox

Dude is disabled from his job. 
---
There you go it is in the Armor section. Thanks for that tip!
---
no
---
I saw at least 3 articles about it too. Fucking ridiculous. People are just eager to bump on the fuck Bethesda train though, even though they don't deserve it this time. 
---
Haha let 'er ride, let 'er ride!
---
Oh I see. I actually haven't found much places who could use a rope bridge that already doesn't have one. Even recall seeing one post here regarding a camp spot with a rope bridge in it.
---
All these people talking about being banned... I haven’t played in so long I don’t even know if I was banned 
---
I’ve never paid more than 1200. I bought a chest and arms for 1k each
---
That is up to you to not believe it but the player that I linked to is very well know and trusted in this community (aten_ra) and he lays out all the numbers and you can clearly do the math yourself and see that gathering that amount would be trivial for someone multiboxing like he was at level 450+
---
Also, you have to keep in mind the issue is it seems BSG screwed up on this ban wave and hit him an innocent person because of the sheer amount of time he played he fell to far outside of your "average" player. 
---
Why do you think that bethesda is incapable of making a mistake with this ban when they have shown to make mistakes with literally everything else they do with this game, from breaking the end game by making nukes impossible to launch for a week, to sharing peoples personal info on their website, to releasing an old patch in place of a new one?
---
I just don't understand why you feel that they couldn't also make a mistake in banning people?
---
&gt; What you're saying doesn't make anything sense though. Why would I want to go through the effort of tracking every single time an item is picked up and put down, then increment it. That's a huge waste of computing power. It's much simpler to just look at on-hand inventories. In fact, if you wanted to be clever about it, and do it with minimal checking, you would take two snapshots.
---
Because that's only going to catch &lt;10% of the dupers trafficking in rare items. Rare item dupers don't dupe to stockpile, they dupe **to sell things**. The only effective way to find people actually duping and selling rare items is to track transfers, not how much is on hand. Why stockpile when you can just make however many you want on demand with minimal fuss?
---
Man I just started playing this game yesterday because I picked it up on Amazon for 16 bucks. I thought to myself, *”Well can’t really go wrong for 16 bucks.”* As I continue to play, I just feel more and more guilty that this game is being handed out like expired jerky in a department store. 
---
In terms of feel and gameplay, to me, this is the best fallout has ever been. The game is gorgeous, and yeah it’s got some frustrating bugs (motherfucking invisible enemies wtf???) but man is it fun. I like that the survival aspect isn’t optional; everybody has to *actively* try to maintain thirst/food/rads. Fallout 3 and 4 were fucking easy as tits. I don’t care that there was an *option* to play survival, it should have been at the heart of the gameplay. 
---
And the map design is outstanding! This is easily my favourite wasteland! Sometimes it’s so beautiful you don’t even remember it’s a wasteland. Others it’s ugly and decrepit. But man compared to fallout 3 and 4 there’s not even a contest. 
---
All of the people riding the hate 76 bandwagon ruined this game for me before I even played it. I’m genuinely disappointed in the gaming community man. The criticisms are valid but it is *nowhere near* as bad as people claimed. I don’t feel bad for Bethesda per se, but I feel bad for the individual employees who clearly put their best foot forward into constructing this wasteland. I feel guilty that I belong to the same gaming community that has done nothing but shit on this game. 
---
I usually hate MTX, but I am deliberately going to spend some money in the 76 shop to support the devs and close the gap between the $16 dollars I bought it for &amp; the dollar amount that I believe this game is worth. 
---
He's disabled from his job, and house bound. But go ahead and keep telling other people what is best for their lives. 
---
Is that a Mothman statue? It looks wicked. Super  cool. 
---
Right.. because it's a good idea to make it easier for anyone to repeat a specific event endlessly as opposed to making events more readily available and deterring people from farming a specific event 
---
Got that error too like last week. Diamond was on the ground but no enemy. I'm on xbox. 
---
Was awesome for bounty hunting :)
---
Unless it's on my end, it says "deleted" where the link should be?
---
Way way way too many rules dude
---
I think a lot of it, other than lack of good drops(probably intended), is that there is no real way seek out and trade items apart from using third party sites comming across a random trader in game. I would bet that a very large portion of the player base don't know about trade subs or probably haven't even traded with a player in game. 
---
My suggestion would be to create some sort of separate in game auction menus where users could put up their item for others to buy using caps. Of course you would have to increase the total amount of caps that a player can hold. 
---
This way anyone can easily list any items they wish to sell and you can view all items that are for sale across all servers.
---
Being disabled doesn't mean you should play video games all day smh...
---
Im addicted and love this game. Level 77 here
---
[It seems like this is the best that's out there atm.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VKr7cpjwVJtt9aFNFb2xVYm-kyOVA0p39pKxfjnBBak/edit#gid=0) Doesn't look that complete so I think it might be fun if I make my own tomorrow
---
Holy shit. Cosmetic team ramping it up. Love it. Need more for cheaper! I'll bite. 
---
Do we get a hat like Team Fortress 2's Cheater Lament??
---
Hi Five for not cheating and not getting banned!  
---
93 to 112 at full health. Difference of 19.
---
181 to 218 at sliver of health difference of 37
---
I’d say that’s false. And they do work together. These numbers are from a bloodied lever action and a bloody explosive lever action with no perks
---
For new players who stumble into my camp, I quick drop 10 stims then shoot the paper bag.
---
Yes. I got some space back after the last patch. 
---
I was the night team leader at a supermarket chain. I loved it. 40 hours a week being physical, then almost all of my free time goes into gaming and I keep my physical fitness up. I recently lost about 55kg and my health is important to me now. I used to be a big fat gamer. Now I'm a skinny flappy gamer. I've kept all the weight off since being injured, but my fitness is terrible. 
---
Yep more stealth nerfs.

you can't tame with lvl 2 perk only pacify has to be lvl 3 to tame
---
I'm well aware of that and clearly am not attempting to dictate someone's play style. Couldn't do it if i tried. I was asking for honest opinions on an issue I encountered. If you read all the way through I would hope you had seen that but if not maybe my post was too vague. I do not believe it was, however maybe you do. Play how you want to play. If you want to kill the people that just helped you, you do you. I Can't control it and i wouldn't want to. I had just never experienced it myself and was wondering if it was a common occurrence. 
---
Are you reselling them or something? Or are you buying them for different characters and/or platforms?
---
If ‘search’ doesn’t show up at first, walk a good ways away and come back to it in a few minutes. It’ll come around. 4/5 times this works, in my personal experience
---
edit: forgot megasloth i think it's around lvl 20 ish if i rememebr right
---
If you want to learn more about wv legends and folklore I always recommend Telltale Lilac Bush and Coffin Hollow.  They are two books of West Virginia ghost stories and cryptids.
---
If the Help menu was on the Main menu, before you log in to the world,  players perception would increase and people would be able to target problems.

thank you a lot, i dont use perks at all so im pretty clueless, i have most the headlamps tho

I really want to get into PVP but almost (literally) everyone I encounter has some sort of TS/E weapon. It's really annoying. Even in Fallout 4 when I got an explosive shotgun, I didn't use it. It was just too much. It wasn't fun anymore. Aim at general area. Fire. Win. Lame. Of course people doing PVP on FO76 are going to use the most broken exploitable weapons in game. It would just be cool to see some variety in people. Not everyone playing out the same power fantasy as the next guy. TSE weapon one shotting everything in WV. Really kills PVP for me. I can't even loot run at WS without one of those wads showing up killing everything before I'm able to pop a stimpack. And the chances of you getting one are seemingly very unlikely. I have 175 hours in and the only thing remotely close I've obtained was a level 35 Two Shot .50 Cal Machine Gun. It's just too much. It's not fun. Survival mode is going to be whack. I really wish they were able to pin down everyone that had a duped TSE and take it. Too many floating around.
---
By the way, I still love this game and am going nowhere. Here's hoping it all works out!
---
How so? What would you change?
---
take heart fellow wastoids. i got the tesla coil today. not even hopping. just swinging by to see if there was by some miracle a jet pack in there. 
---
i’d *much*rather have about 10 other mods for x01 but since it’s even apparently even more rare than the jet i thought i’d confirm that it does indeed drop. 
---
You seem pretty pissed since you made a reddit thread about your troubles!
---
This mindset is how nazis came to power.
---
Hey Cathy’s pretty cool :(
---
Good news, it's fixed. So by that account it's already the most polished game in years from beth.
---
Todd could use one of these
---
I flip them sometimes. I bought them for myself though.
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure they are just subject to the same rules as other emergency kits now.
---
No, your just a cunt
---
You didn’t even spell it the same way both times you typed it lol. You managed to fuck up this stupid joke even worse than it already was lol 
---
They really should say that in the Inspect description.  This really confused me as well.
---
Stimpack is not an issue on that game... maybe until lv 10?
---
Once destroyed a dudes camp and killed him a few times while playing the breakfast machine from pee wees big adventure.  One time I found a couple roleplaying as husband and wife in the wasteland, so I roleplayed a home invasion and killed them.  Whenever I have a wanted level I run around whitesprings playing renegade by styx over the mic until someone picks a fight.
---
It's pretty fun.

Does that compute with you or do I have to dumb it down more?
---
Thanks, I really do feel this is a bug. Will try some tests and see how often I can replicate it.
---
I probably was moving like 20,000 ammo at a time of assorted types. I can't remember my latest ammo counts. I'd be surprised if I had more than 200k total on my accounts. 
---
I normally liked to keep roughly 1000-1500 rounds each of .45, 5.56 and shotgun shells on my mains inventory. And usually didn't store much in my mains stash. 
---
My build is highly refined now. But a few weeks ago I was using bandolier, scattershot and travelling pharmacy for weight. And 80% wep weight from gear.
---
It is since it is what we call an example of people who do such things. 
---
Or are you saying that they do not do things because of enjoyment or some strange fulfillment?
---
Last I remember, Yongyea went to shit after Metal Gear Survive was announced.
---
Hilariously, that game's a similar deal to 76, in that it's not as bad of a game as the massive negative response would give.
---
I’m talking about domere/domer you idiot 
---
Good book
---
Very excited to have you join us Tenno. r/warframe is full of hard to comprehend memes :)
---
Wow! I'm actually in a similar position (health wise) and was wondering if you had ant tips on how to lose weight. Not looking for any *miracle methods* or anything like that but just what you do for your routine or any tips you may have. Congrats by the way on losing so much!
---
You can PM me if you don't want to put it out there or just not answer; you've already been very motivational, so thanks!
---
Have a good night!
---
I looked like this for a while when I was building my first set of PA, and then as I built the excavator. A mix of the highest level wearable stuff I found until I found good parts for a full set. 
---
Now I have a set of highest level of each PA and am having fun modding them out for different specs and purposes. 
---
Ah okay the level things is what is messing me up. And suggestion on where to look that don’t scale in level. 
---
Definitely try some of the other fallouts! Definitely not a good fallout for your first experience. 
---
We have those?
---
yea the game never tells you you could even tame anything it's like they kinda left it out
---
It has not worked, once, not one single time for me. 
---
Unstoppable magazine in the store.
---
I have similar stuff happen. I have a TSE double barrel, and it seems like 10% of the time when I select it I’ll pull out a regular one if I’ve picked one up in my inventory. 
---
What non cosmetic items were added? Or am I missing something. 
---
Team-mate who is not pacifist tags someone by accident.
---
This sounds like a problem for maybe 1% of players 
---
I've been killed in four hits by someone more than three times my level before. The slap damage system is a fun mix of a joke and an insult, from Bethesda to us. 
---
So you didn’t check your facts?
---
Just posted coz this seems to be the big trend for that *Karma Grind* am I right?
---
You’re way late to the party, man. Just like all of YouTube is late to it. 
---
wtf they are adding magazines to the store?
---
I think it's more so that the game didn't have an identity. Does is want to be a Fallout game, does it want to be co-op, does it want to be MMO. It was torn between so many things that it wasn't really good at one thing specifically. Average at all. 
---
Having Fallout in the name is a source of hate though. I agree.
---
Did you not see the part where I'm Canadian? Do you have a helper explain everything to you that took a day off today?
---
Posts like [these ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/astttj/id_say_i_cant_believe_it_but_i_certainly_can/?st=JSE3VP4Y&amp;sh=05cd34fd)  are getting thousand of karma off it and so many people are being misinformed
---
Which is why I love seeing Anthem getting trashed everyday. Don't get me wrong; I have no grudge against Bioware and its game. I just hope more people would realize what it means to love a game some people hate.
---
I've played it pretty much everyday since the week after release.  It's pretty fun, but you have to know what you're getting into.  If you like Fallout 4's core gameplay loop of explore -&gt; shoot -&gt; loot -&gt; craft -&gt; repeat, with a heavy emphasis on the exploration, you'll probably like 76 on a fundamental level.  But if you're expecting an elaborate narrative with branching paths, arguing philosophy with NPCs, and having to make epic decisions that change the fate of the wasteland, you won't find that here.  There is a story, but it's kind of like the entire world is a Vault and you're trying to piece together what went wrong and how to fix it.
---
While there will always been other players in the world, you can mostly play it "solo" if you want.  It's a big world and you aren't going to be bumping into other players all the time.  They are like a random encounter in any other Fallout game, an X factor that keeps things interesting.
---
It’s missing a lot of items. If you’d make a more complete I would so Karma that. 
---
Thank you!
---
Can't stand this with mole rats
---
I uninstalled the game, and went back to FO4... but not because I got banned. I just figure the broken devil you know is better than broken devil you don’t.
---
2 suggestions: first, I always felt an increase in stash limit would be more exciting if we get them as we level up; stary with 200, and increases until we hit the level limit. 
---
Second, and maybe this has been asked already- players homes? A bunker to call our own and store items ouside the camp/stash system?
---
Could be because people bought a game for $60 that was filled with bugs, crashes, disconnects, etc. And marketting PR people who have done more to create toxicity in the community and hate for the game and company than any bug, crash, or hater ever could.

Regardless of video game addiction it would be almost completely impossible to get that much ultracite with being extremely lucky, knowing every tip and trick form when the game first dropped and working straight toward that since it was released which is impossible
---
Try to know what you're talking about, dweeb. 
---
It was a weekly event that boosted your stats if you wore an outfit that's already available in game or can be purchased. For valentines it was +15 hp per team member. Is that pay 2 win too? Fucking D W E E B

We all are testers, you naive soul

Probly watched YongYeas video about the weekly events that happened 3 weeks ago.

Ok thanks.

what exploits?

do you even play?

Where is the party? Link to thread please.
---
yes go to thnder mountain substation tm-01 and there is a road and a railroad track north of it a "random encounter" can happen at both spots is easiest place to server hop for tames , will take a while before one of the tameble animals show up unless you are lucky
---
People will hate what they can even if its about a month over do and looking dumb in the process even Bethesda said they thought it wasnt a big deal so they scrapped any future plans like that for events 
---
And tell me about your mother. - Freud
---
No fair. You all know my 100,001 single action ivory pistol grip plans were all legitimate farming and required zero duping. ;)
---
I was for an actual person not a yao guy. 
---
I guess its possible but still highly unlikely. The mats to make ultracite ammo are not easy to come by.. you would have to launch nukes back to back for awhile. I just feel like its alot more likely that he duped em, or got them from a duper. 
---
Honestly, this game is an online version of fallout 4 survival mode. If you’ve played that n enjoyed it sure you’ll have fun. You enjoy walking around the world n scavenging junk to fix guns n armor like in fallout 3 n NV. I play the majority of my time solo only 10% with actual friends on a team. However, the community is very friendly, like never have I played an online game with this many helpful players. I routinely help out other low level players in a tight spot n have been saved by other even higher level players. I have received gifts from other players looking to rid themselves of excess materials n gear. If you have played fallout games n enjoyed them despite the periodic bugs n disconnects you should try the game. Just make sure you don’t pay full price I’m sure you could find a deal. 
---
Can I join this Banwagon, err.. 
---
Thank you very much for sharing.
---
I agree that many people seem to have expected another fallout singleplayer sandbox even though bethesda was clear from the get go that this is not at all what Fo76 is going to be about. I even had trouble making my friends understand that and in the end most of them didn't buy the game.
---
But your perspective is very rarely being looked at on here.
---
If someone actually came for all the promises, survival, basebuilding, pvp.. the game still falls flat on its ass and low budget early access indie survival games from 5 years ago surpass it easily.
---
So not only did they disappoint the PVE sandbox guys, even the actual target audience is scratching their heads about this mess.
---
What does being Canadian have to do with spelling words correctly?

A lot of people were sad that they didn't have dolls to talk to.

Have you been active at all its over a month old and no one cares any more besides people looking for a reason to hate just cause yong made a video doesnt mean its fresh on the store page they addressed it and said we wont do it again
---
Steam has wrongfully issued bans for PubG, and people have posted about it on Reddit. That's one example that easily comes to mind.
---
Technically that’s only cosmetic items that were added. What your mad about is the event that urges you to buy said outfits. The outfits themselves are only cosmetic. It’s the event that’s crappy. However I don’t recall them ever saying they wouldn’t make in game events that urge you to buy cosmetics. So they are in the clear here all be it a scummy thing to do.  I also believe this was already covered three weeks or so ago and yong yea was just late to the party. 
---
In general people are very susceptible to adopting opinions stated by someone well known (e.g celebrities, politicians, their boss, their parents or other figures they idolize or regard as an authority figure)
---
It’s called argument from authority fallacy.
---
Put simple, just because someone is famous or well know does not mean they are right. Quite often they are wrong, but yet it is easy for many to take what they say at face value without actually fact checking or, in the case of games, actually trying the games.
---
In short a lot of people are too lazy to formulate their own opinions based on facts or from own experience (or obtaining the experience through trying, eg games).
---
I never base my opinion from listening to critics and I never regard some face on Youtube as a credible, well, credible anything. Youtube is purely for entertainment driven by bandwagoning onto whatever gives most clicks and likes. Such an agenda for acquiring likes undermines any credibility towards an objective and unbiased review or assessment whether it is games or other things.
---
Do your own fact checks and research. 
---
Acquire your own experience.
---
Formulate your own opinions.

---
Mods.
---
You duped. Just admit it.
---
Didn't mean to make it sound like the basically unplayable launch of the game isn't the main factor, just wanted to add on something that I saw apart from that. Personally when me and my friend group started playing we didn't really notice and bugs other than the occasional T posing enemy but I definitely know this wasn't the case for the majority of people.

"decent game" okay.
---
Nope. If they pay you 100 bucks you could consider It I guess.
---
Lowkey, I'm not innocent. I cheated, but someone killed me and took all my stuff so...................... (they were cheating anyways maybe for health, shotgun fire rate)
---
Thanks I appreciate the help. 
---
and if you tame a deathclaw, yao guai  or sloth it will still have a red bar like it's agressive even after you tame it, but once it's at your base if you "pacify" if with the perk then log off it will remain with a non hostile white bar

*~~reads~~ watches something about 76 being bad*
---
"BOY AM I FIRED UP! LETS GO TO REDDIT!"
---
Just a guess but I think he would get rid of the rules.
---
 So what? I never see what the OP is talking about when I go to scorched earth.  That doesn't mean that it never happens  It's been widely known for a long time now that high- level players with powerful weapons one-shot kill legendaries there all the time and all the other players miss out on the loot.  If you apply  the OP's same logic to this event, then Uranium fever should have a level cap because of the actions of a handful of players are causing lower level players to miss out.

Life long West Virginian here,  if you've never been here you should check it out sometime.   On top of the beauty, places, and history every major town has a couple antique malls and art galleries.   You can take a little bit of West Virginia home with ya
---
&gt;Most if not all of these issues stem from trying to make an aged engine do things it was never intended to do.
---
DAoC (NetImmerse 2001) and Warhammer Online (Gamebryo 2008) used the same engine.
---
Maybe they should have hired the ex-Mythic guys to do the technical part of Fo76...
---
No, [I’m Spartacus!](https://gfycat.com/quarrelsomeeuphoricalleycat) 
---
Just drain the water by drinking it.
---
Oh wow! I'm trying this tonight! 
---
Even better lets make a post and act like its a huge deal and then get shit on for being late 
---
This pretty much summarizes the entire fo76 experience in a lot of ways.  Sadly :(
---
The admins won't ban this sub because it's not politically left-leaning, though.
---
I say it jokingly, but it's also unfoetunately true.
---
Different teams I think 
---
Pro-tip, don't use the word "fanboi" when accusing others of being toxic.
---
I like you, and not just because you got tha NUT SUPREME
---
I could almost believe it with how bloody common those stupid prints are lol
---
Same for me
---
&gt; I still have a hard time understanding why there isn't server text chat and guilds.
---
Moderating chat isn't something you can really automate and on consoles textchat is probably just a waste of money?
---
Yes.  Most will need at least one of Chem/Adrenal/Nerd Rage/Crits to hit it against a 400DR SBQ, but I've never heard of or fought a SBQ with more than 300DR so not sure how big a concern that actually is.
---
Aten_ra already went over the numbers, it wouldn't be difficult at all for someone who is running multiple characters at the same time through the same area acting as their own team. Remember each killed enemy basically gives him 3x the drops as normal because the enemies drops are instanced for each character in the group. So say he kills a glowing one, instead of only 1 hardened mass from that ghoul, he would get 3 one for each character that he loots that ghoul with.
---
That is why it would take less than a week of grinding for him to get that much ammo.
---
Not to mention the issue isn't that he actually had that much ammo, the issue is that BSG accidentally counted his ammo stack multiple times from him moving from one character to another to save space on his character.
---
It doesn't appear so. He's not even  regurgitating the correct lies the YouTube twats we're saying.
---
lol do i? sorry if i came across as pissed just posting to see if this is a new thing and its happened to other people..because i v been slapped many times before and never died..until now
---
That's what the mid community is for 
---
I also used the word "hater". I didn't include the word "shill" but it's something I'm going to be pursing for review by regulatory bodies. I know I'm toxic, but I wasn't always that way.
---
ok..thanks for the info
---
Just tryna nut man
---
I made a post about it too. It's definitely broken.

---
Based on data-mined information.
---
Me too. I haven't logged in since maybe mid January briefly.  
---
and you might see high lvl creatures at those spots but they just arnt tamable the low lvl ones will spawn at those lvls regardless of your lvl
---
You can literally do that now...... You just log in and out again and again. If I was dedicated, I'd just relog in and trigger same event ...
---
&gt; I know I'm toxic, but I wasn't always that way.
---
And I suppose that isn't your fault either.
---
A small arcade machine running Fallout 1 so we have something fun to do while they work on this alpha. :P
---
For me it was about Kate December. I have faith in the game, but I’m taking a break until the fix everything.
---
Cant say I disagree. The game isnt good, period. Having guns that actually work and actually having junk in the stash with the trick to pass the cap was one of the few reasons to push foward. Never cared for pvp, guess the game would last even less to me If I was forced to do It. They did the players a favor banning them. Didnt log for over a week, now I got an even better reason to unistall this and forget the fiasco It is this game.
---
I opened a government supply drop.  That’s the answer. Thanks for the updates everyone!  
---
i thought wind instruments were chimes and so i threw the plan out the first time i got it
---
Mmhmm and it's stupid that it can be done
---
you can think whatever you want about bethesda, just dont be a bitch about it and mock other people for playing their games
---
I've come across a few bags of duped items in the wild, never looted anything from them. Gave the bag the thumbs down, too, if other players were around.
---
I've stalked dupers and inspected their poopy dupey bags while they were duping whilst i was Stealth Boyd, but never looted anything.
---
I had someone offer me a free bag of 800 nuka grapes once during a trade where I was after a lever rifle plan. I told him I was diabetic and didn't take the colas. And I turned down the plan. 
---
I've refused all trades with players who had ridiculous carry weights in the trade window. Or sent me screenshots of their duped inventory.
---
I've grouped up with strangers only to find out they condoned or participated in duping. I left those groups immediately, sometimes muting them, sometimes sending them a text message saying I wasn't into "that duping thing".
---
And guess what... **I'm not banned** \#feelsgoodman
---
Also fanboi is an accurate description of one who blindly defends a company or product and defends it against any and all criticism, with absolutely no rational or critical thought.
---
My camp is near there, on the first U bend, I took up the space around the little pond in there. Decent space, but I may move.
---
That means a moderator removed it. I have no idea why... didn't get any moderator notifications. That post that lists all weapon mods is very applicable to this conversation. I'll try posting it again. Maybe if a moderator removes it again then can message me and let me know why.
---
With style like that I’d let you join anything. 
---
Yep if the scream comes up with the steal option avoid it. 
---
But weapons are leveled. If I'm new and a lvl 10 or 25 even how am I supposed to use an upper tier weapon or armor that is lvl 45 or 50?  
---
I don't see how this hurts new players at all. Even if you did get a great lvl 20 legendary your only going to end up swapping it out once you lvl up. 
---
I'm only lvl 49 and have only used weapons that I have found or crafted. I have yet to feel like I was underpowered for the tasks that I was doing.
---
 r/unexpectedjojo
---
Do you even pay?
---
Or you could just ware the free one you get in the game. Or you could spend the free Atoms you get. Or could not care about it because the "buff" was laughable and it was just a week long event anyway. 
---
This belongs in a war journal
---
I've been playing longer than you.
---
Loki? You can’t help it, it’s really just your nature. 
---
I don't like valentines or Bethesda now.
---
Waiting it out too.  I'll start a new character in October.  That's when it should have released anyway.
---
No, no, no...I meant the link to your spreadsheet. The post itself is still there but I'm unable to go to your list.
---
Also "fanboi" is an accurate description of one who blindly defends a company or product against any and all criticism, with absolutely no rational or critical thought, and attacks anyone who says anything remotely critical or negative.
---
&gt;in that it's not as bad of a game as the massive negative response would give.
---
You have to pay for save slots.
---
Two steps forward, one step back, they testing us.
---
If you want an youtube channel that knew jow to enjoy FO76 for whst it is, a new Fallout world to explore, Oxhorn has been killing it woth his lore series.
---
You're welcome!
---
Let's be ass to the OP for having a life to live.
---
Killed at least one of each today, nothing. It has been swapping between all of them checked off or none, but never completes.
---
I’m happy that you’re enjoying the game, but as a potential buyer I was thankful for those personalities. At least at the beginning, now anything F76 related just seems like a low hanging circle jerk. I appreciated that I was able to see the condition of the game at launch.
---
 Might buy these if they ever made ones for the PA I actually use, like the Excavator/Ultracite Armors
---
+15 max health isn't cosmetic.
---
Aw shucks. There were THREE all near each other.  It was peculiar.  Only one was unopened. 
---
Seems like text chat would solve all of these problems...
---
Cmon brah it seems you been watching yongyea's videos. I like the guy but he funked up big this time. That wasn't a pay to win since you can obtain costumes in-game fairly easily. No one cared until the guy made a video about it.
---
You're presuming his guilt, GG WP.
---
As a Raider, it brings me great joy to see my Red Flag fly high. Anyone over level 50 is fair game. 
---
Hanlon's Razor.
---
What i watch is up to me.
---
The owner of the acc said he wanted that info public so i dont know if that helps,but i dont think bethestda would risk legal trouble for a ban so we will never know. 
---
Sorry for having a life.
---
I don't really have them but I thought it was funny. ;)
---
It’s worth 20-30 bucks. Don’t buy for anything more than than that. I’m enjoying playing with my buddies but it’s a buggy mess of a game and the dev team is noticeably inexperienced and or lazy plonkers. It’s fun to run around with the boys killing and looting, but there’s nothing compelling that makes any of that worth it. It’s abysmally lacking in endgame content. Despite all that, I’m playing with my mates rn, and we are having fun.
---
there just needs to be a custom emote solution, every multiplayer game has this, we don't, it's a design oversight, one of the primary parts of the game that most importantly needs finishing. i'd like to see it be a text, i mean how does someone build the letters in a camp?  there needs to be a custom emote that has a small amount of text enterable. i don't care if its 20 characters or if they manage to finally design text communication (this would technically be the more ability egalitarianistic solution rather than Just a limited emote solution)
---
what is a "level action reload?"
---
Seperate vendor caps.
---
Make explosives viable again.
---
Bulk selling or ability to break down ammo. 
---
This thread is in denial that the game is extremely flawed. Sure it can be fun, but don't act like criticism isn't valid when there was a video recently of 1000 bugs in the game.
---
And said save slots serve no purpose other than to give you absolutely ridiculous amounts of materials that you already have a shitload of, as your inventory is shared between characters, and you can change your appearance and gender literally whenever for free.
---
If you're trying for a fresh start, the save slot isn't gonna work, and if you're looking to do a new build, you can already max all the skills on one character anyway.
---
I didn't, i literally said no decent reviewer would even touch again the piece of a dead corpose that is this game without a stick.
---
Then i made fun of you for defending Beteshda despite literally throwing rocks at your face.
---
Liar, you can buy the outfits.
---
About two weeks ago, my husband went to go help a low level who owned the ammo factory and was  getting attacked by two other low level players. Both were wanted so he killed them and messaged the kid asking if he needed anything. Kids response was if my husband could break into the factory he'd give him 300 caps. Guess that's why the other guys were wanted...
---
But what we didn't know was he barricaded himself in with unbreakable stash boxes ! My hubby took the kid up on the offer, but not with the intention of busting down the door or sneaking in a forgotten crevice...No, not my husband. 
---
He ran silo Bravo in about 20ish minutes, no looting, just powered through. Nuked the little fucker right out of the factory. We all teamed up after and had a blast just shooting the shit and giving him all our old gear. 
---
Still worth it!! Its been my go to weapon for clearing white springs for weeks now, the thing shreds ghouls lol adrenaline is a must  
---
I thought that was meat pies.
---
paper bag is the next biggest thing on my feedback list that NEEDS to be finished, a little tiny bag is such a place holder for what player containers needs to be and the functions it needs to fill
---
in other words, you!  lol  ;-)
---
Fucking tool.
---
If you’ve ever wondered how major game companies die besides not having money, this is how Bethesda 
---
Man that is awful. Jesus. I just don't get it. Not at That nuke zone. PvP will always be a thing and so will griefing but Damn.
---
And those that blindly attack just because YouTube tells them too? Most of today this sub was getting brigaded by people claiming p2w because a YouTuber made a video about an event from two weeks ago that was not a p2w event. But sure, calling BS on that is just "fanbois" rejecting "valid criticism" because they are blind unenlightened plebs that aren't super smart like you.
---
Assume they meant lever action reload.  A couple patches ago the lever action would reload the full capacity even if you only had a single shot used.  Now it only loads as many as needed to fill the capacity.  
---
Time to play Anthem then Division II. Cue "Up" music
---
Thanks for the tip. It is extremely hard not to accidentally shoot someone in that zone. It is why i stay in pacifist. Plus I don't enjoy that content.
---
yep, spot on, the game has some amazing mechanics and challenge and feel to it, it has a realy cool implementation of an array of heritage from classic games and modern character / base building ones. it just failed to end up finished with the way players need to make more permanent impact on each other and the world. this is front and center in my feedback response to their Jan 1 inside the vault call for feedback. you can read that on my /u pin posts
---
Lets call it.. hmm... "the active playerbase"
---
This is my favorite answer,  so far!
---
It can be incredibly frustrating to server hop for an hour to find one world with a few dozen plastic left in the highschools. Not everyone has hours to devote to freeform wandering gameplay when every server is picked clean of even the most common items we all need.
---
Don't even get me started on plans.
---
same to u
---
The problem is that every modifier outside of Two shot, Anti Armour, Explosive, Bloodied and maybe Furious is useless
---
Take out all the +30% damage to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ enemy type from the prefix pool and replace them with explosive and some new effects that make these weapons actually unique, even if theyre only 1 star
---
Almost all the modifiers that are strictly saved for 3 star weapons are crap, the third star is useless on your weapon if its just giving you "move faster while aiming". I mean c'mon these effects are supposed to be the best of the best, saved for the highest tier of weapon
---
ah.  danke.
---
Reverse 2 shot Nerf
---
Reverse or readjust explosive Nerf
---
Bring back blackbird paint
---
My teammate and others ran into this issue with Rose before.  They had to continually talk to her and listen to her rant and talk about unrelated stuff until it triggered the quest.  Took a few minutes of standing around her and clicking on her occasionally. 
---
Thanks for the opinion. I'm just trying to get a pulse on my favorite game and the other people who play it.
---
Actual content. Make enemies less spongy and more deadly. Address the fact that server hopping is the only good way to get things.
---
I'm super smart like the guy in Idiocracy.
---
or you can do some quests and get one for free
---
Same here
---
Open the other vaults.
---
More perk points.
---
More quests/missions.
---
i didnt defend bethesda, i didnt even buy this game lmao
---
get off your high horse
---
The +15 max heath did not come from the cosmetics. But the event that was ongoing at the time 
---
&gt;Aren't most people mostly honest?
---
In general? Maybe. The guy who just caught a suspension for leaving behind a highly suspicious paper trail on the servers and is now complaining about it on the forums claiming innocence? Yeah, I'm gonna go with probably not.
---
I'll grant you though, I forgot about the part where Beth mentioned they would also be investigating people based on user reports even if they weren't flagged by the system, so it's possible some other player saw his ridiculous inventory stockpile while trading and blew the whistle on him. I could definitely see them suspending somebody for collecting impossible amounts of mundane items in a case like that. 
---
Anyway, the point was — as relates to OP's question, BGS has been repeatedly adamant about being 100% confident that their system is not resulting in false positives, that people playing the game as intended without exploits have nothing to worry about, and they've also been clear that they're not divulging the full details of how the system works so as not to give people clues about how to circumvent it. \*That\*, to me, is a lot more believable than the sketchy sob stories that have been flooding Redding and the forums since the ban waves started. 
---
I didn't mention Pay to win anywhere in my comment, wonder why that's on your mind?
---
&gt; I understand but don't buy it. In their dupe purge post they clearly stated that they are flagging accounts with 100000+ of a given item at a given time.
---
NOPE! From the email:
---
Why would they put a duration (30 days of gameplay) on an instantaneous measurement? They wouldn't. It's not as simple as "we saw you have 100k+ of a rare item in your inventory".
---
It also makes more sense for them to do it that way. Rare item dupers don't dupe to stockpile, they dupe to sell. If you only go off of who has 100k+ of an item in inventory you're going to find &lt;10% of the dupers out there.
---
&gt; fun mix of a joke and an insult, from Bethesda to us.
---
Just described the entire game right there
---
Perk card load outs... I just want three slots, one for battle, one for scavenging and one for crafting.
---
Increased camp budget and stuff to put on my tables and shelves.
---
True dailies, that actually proc once a day.
---
I was gonna keep our friendly banter going back and forth but noticed you have a sweet dog in your picture.  Beagle?
---
Well, he only had 225k ultracite. That means when 900 hours he only would have been doing that for half of his available time.
---
Better base building, clans, scraping ammo
---
Yeah that's not true. All of my friends who hate it haven't even played it. They just repeat the echo chamber hate from youtube. Even a lot of the youtubers who hate on it you can tell haven't played it and just repeat stuff they read. The people who have played it and hate it tend to have more concrete ideas of why they didn't like it than "lol shit game"
---
Nobody got Banned, sadly.
---
Seems like all of them got "suspended" with an option to return some time in the future.
---
Heres to hope they stay away.
---
So here’s my take on it, from a guy who played a bit of fallout 3, but loved fallout 4. I was super excited for Fallout 76 and was honestly a little disappointed when it was announced as a mmo version of fallout but I was still hopeful. I still have yet to play but the sheer amount of backlash and controversy around has made me believe that best case scenario this is No Mans Sky all over again and a year from now it will be an actual game. That being said if you or other people are having fun playing this game that’s awesome and fuck anyone who says otherwise. We should be happy that people are enjoying something, but at the same time it just doesn’t seem like Fallout 76 was ready to be launched and seems to have an imperfect streak of banning players who didn’t need to be and making bug patches that just create more bugs. Fallout 76 has a lot of genuine great stuff in it but it also has a lot of problems. Bagging on “YouTube personalities” doesn’t really move the argument forward. I watch a few channels that put out content on updates to fallout and Bethesda games and I can whole heartedly say that they would be doing way better if there wasn’t anything to complain about. That being said I also understand that outrage culture is a thing and that works to but long term a lot of these Youtubers were excited to make fun and interesting content and instead they got a hella buggy game that at any point may just ban you for no reason.  
---
Yes they did because if you weren't wearing them you wouldn't get the bonus.
---
lol for more than a third of his life in the past three months he has been playing 76. who has that much free time and who spends all of it on one game?
---
The guy that couldn't figure out his girlfriend was a prostitute?
---
She was a dox/ jack Russel mix. Had to put her down last year when her kidneys failed. Didn't want to have her suffer. Lived to be almost 14.
---
“Currently in the tree outside of your house Mothman”
---
That's about the only thing they will be able to do since there's no reason to team up, unless you enjoy added frustration.
---
Captains log.....its been 5 hours and the scorchbeast have no retreated yet
---
Tldr look past the controversy and enjoy the game yw
---
Just did this yesterday. I had to basically spam my action button before it triggered. 
---
Multicanister it too it is Sooooo satisfying
---
Sorry to hear brother.  My dog Bailey was a Beagle Jack Russell mix from the shelter.  Had to put her down after she had a sudden stroke three years ago.  Took my online name to remember her forever.  
---
I get that occasionally. Switching weapons usually fixes it. 
---
The quests in The Outer Worlds will be way better anyway.
---
Sure thing bud 
---
Honeybeasts
---
Arguably we don't (if you're American) but we're billingual and French and English words get thrown together a bunch. Is that really not common knowledge of Canada? Even south parks creators know that.
---
All calculations that support these conclusions, especially about DPS, can be found in this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-eloRSOljf9k3skX51qAYqzL9jyB2N-oxHHMI9zsrv4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-eloRSOljf9k3skX51qAYqzL9jyB2N-oxHHMI9zsrv4/edit?usp=sharing)
---
I tried spamming her but she wouldn't respond
---
Yes, it's a very sure thing despite your sarcasm.
---
Agree totally.  
---
LOL Ive seen a couple of nuked workshops like WTF? Why?
---
Not that I wouldnt blast one myself if someone had taken it from me. 
---
Had that happen to me a few times when I used to use it over a month ago. It happened against my first Mirelurk Queen. I ran around for a good few minutes against her and some kings. I would have been dead if I didn’t have my medic pump. I ended up hitting Alt-F4. 
---
Or, likely, the main account with the items was banned then they banned other accounts accessing from the same IP
---
I think it's a valid question. Your thread describes the slap system working as intended. They hit you at reduced damage, took many hits to kill you, sounds like everything is working as intended. So that being the case, what is the point?
---
They had to wait a long time for her to stop talking.  And they had to stay around her listening.  
---
Ah that sucks (and really hard) but a good way to remember. Yea I don't have the heart to change the picture since she was my little buddy. Hardest thing to do was to sit with her when they put her down, but it was better than watching her suffer.
---
Current dog is a rescue, he is an american pit bull terrier. Handful with how much energy and how goofy he is. But he is a big baby and just wants to play and get attention.
---
You just don’t understand the difference between an in game event buff and an item buff. if I put on one of the outfits right now I won’t have a buff. It was an event. So what if you had to buy into the event a lot of games use similar tactics to get you to spend. 
---
Idk I think the other dude makes more sense 
---
I have a boxer pit bull / Rhodesian ridgeback from the shelter.  He’s the sweetest dog ever.  Giant.  140lbs.  Sleeps in bed with me.  
---
There was a pretty big exodus just after the the removal of duped weapons. The toxicity levels hit critical mass in the 24 hours leading up to it and this place lost lots of subs. I've said it before, and got downvoted pretty hard, but people are leaving this sub, not the game. r/fo76FilthyCasuals picked up a lot of new subs during then. All I know for sure is every time I log in I'm on a full server, and nukes happen often . 
---
I'm not saying the quest is good, what I'm saying you can get one for free if you do the quest
---
That sucks. 
---
Yeah i ended up having to keep putting it away and back out again which is annoying seeing it is my highest damage gun with prime reciever i have to fight the SBQ with.
---
So does mine but he is only like 60 lbs. Lol. He gets upset if I am working on the computer while he wants me to nap or sleep with him. 
---
He made an inference that was wrong, but that inference was based upon what he knew to be true in relation to the mechanics of the armor/outfit he possessed. Your comment seems to assume his objective was to be a karma-whore. Did you ask your question because you thought this oversight negated the entirety of his argument? It's perfectly fine if you disagree with his assessment of the game, but that sort of accusation is not generally constructive to the conversation and is arguably baseless.
---
Yeah i just kept putting it away and back out it is really annoying.
---
Sanctimonious assclowns by a wide margin. All the dupers I knew got bored and quit playing before the inventory purge and recent "banwave". I actually think some of the people complaining on here about being suspended were actually screwed over by an poorly implemented algorithm. 
---
i just thought it would take hundreds of hits to do this not 20 or 30
---
These are self-imposed rules. Not changes to the actual game.  You pick ones you find interesting or challenging and stick with it. Why there would be "too many" is legimiately drawing a blank on my end. So if "too many" means "I don't like rules" then,.... okay.. fine... don't use them
---
They need a slot where you can add two perks that are non combat that permanently stay and arent subject to special allocation.
---
Because when you get to the end game or high level PvP you will be outmatched. 
---
&gt; also now slap damage can kill you
---
Slap damage could always kill you. It's part of the mechanic. 
---
Half flight stairs and stairs that connect to quarter floor pieces. Would be able to make much more interesting looking camps!
---
ok
---
See you in a couple years...
---
Hit you with a follow.  Anyone who loves dogs is a good person. 
---
Rose would be proud
---
I don't believe it's bannable. It's also easily fixable if they wantedpeople to stop doing it, just flag foundations as destructible.
---
I couldn’t even switch weapons, use stims, etc. I think the only things I could do was pull up the map and move. Everything was zoomed and blurry, so I tried to dodge trees and not stay stationary while I tried every key. 
---
Power Armour displays and weapon racks. 
---
And faction specific items like flags and barricades. 
---
I can definitely confirm this. I had a back injury a few years back and I was pretty much shut down for a year due to it. Not only could I not do anything for fear of making the injury worse (think "spinal cord involvement") I was in pain even on some pretty heavy meds. Playing games wasn't just one of the only things I could do, it also helped distract me from the pain. I clocked in what would otherwise be an unhealthy amount of daily hours playing games, but at the time it was probably the only thing that kept me sane.
---
The game transferred all your legendaries to OP
---
B-But Kotaku called Gamers^TM racist so they're the real racists!
---
Did the same. Feel free to hit me up whenever if you wanna chat.
---
I understand what he assumed, I don’t really mean bout the Karma whore, just something I slapped on 
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I've seen the number at 5% damage, though I don't know if that's confirmed. But let's go for it for the time being. My polehook does about 350 damage. 5% of that is 17.5. That x20 is 350, which is already enough to kill most players. That x30 is 525, which would certainly kill any player.

You too man.  If you are on pc I’m beaglejack2020 in game too 
---
ok...thnx for the info

The fuck are you on about, melee is still king.

I noticed this at the gold clubhouse. Level 62 charred ghoul? One hit, sliver of health. Level 15ish withered ghoul? One hit, sliver of health. 
---
Anytime you think about starting a post with “and in America” just go home. You’re the type of person that makes the rest of us look like dickheads.
---
So the prize is trash then...cool,glad I've been doing this mission over and over.
---
Lame-
---
Yup. I have three handmades and they have to be remapped every time I log in. One of them is favorited, but in the wrong slot. 
---
Sometimes, if I add a handmade to my inventory, it will display one of the ones I already have. 
---
Oh yea I am. Haven't been playing since my bud who I normally play with is in and out of the hospital a lot. Mine is Nodoubtsatall . I am prob going to slowly try to get back into things especially with the whole duper "fix".  (Pc as well)
---
Damn, you beat me to it :)
---
Yeah its stupid i hope they fix it.
---
Just fought an awesome dude named clientsomething who was doing this over and over again. I had him tagged on a recon scope and was flabbergasted at how he was contesting from behind walls. 
---
Eventually he gave up and congratulated me on my ability to hold the workshop and massive penis. I asked him how the heck he was doing this and he told me. 
---
This is going to be so much when PVP servers are out.
---
Although the military uses 4x, ACOG comes in models that range from 1.5x to 6x
---
Or we could have a name that no one would expect...
---
Bigger question is why do I take rads for collecting dirty water.
---
Well every time they "fix" it, they list it as an 'exploit' in the patch notes, so I wouldn't totally put it past them. 
---
Seems like the game is working as intended
---
Kids, Don't Dupe Drugs mmmkay...
---
Taking a workshop always gives a few. And if you stick around to do the defend quests you'll get you more as well. Also just wonder around the wasteland and you'll rack up a lot faster then you realize. Phrama farmer is always good to have on standby. Or can also buy the recipe from MODUS, crafting them isn't *that* expensive. 
---
Agree. It's too few people to be an MMO, but it's such a hassle interacting with anyone that I don't want to play co op either. They advertised that we could solo it if we wanted but with so few NPCs it's just not engaging. The first time I saw Graham I was so excited to be able to interact with another living being but since then it's nothing but the odd brief robot encounter. 
---
There is no need to brag or taunt other people about it, but I do wonder how many white knight type players have been revived by someone using duped stim packs, while fighting the scorch beast queen that was summoned by someone using a duped nuclear key card, and a "decrypted" launch code that someone took out of the dev cell, all while players using duped weapons and ammo carried most of the burden of the fight. If they fought the sbq on a Monday (code reset day), I feel like the odds are pretty high.
---
Bethesda is legitimately trying to fuck their image. I'm never buying a game from them again. Long live piracy
---
well, it was fun.  a bit costly in some materials, as i would have to repair stuff when i ran out to collect.  time to log off for a bit.
---
*Carl would like to know your location*
---
incredible work. i was frustrated watching my fav player experiment with it and think it was fixed for various reasons / methods, this is awesome. i'll let her know stat
---
looses caps and loot
---
Definitely! Got mine for 40 too and it's absolutely worth it. Tricentennial paint for 10mm and power armor is cool, and you can mix and match to get a good, unique look, especially with the red patriot paint on the x-01 helmet.  I'm all about collecting outfits / paint though so if you ain't motivated by digital clothes, get the basic edition if you can for less. 
---
The Appalachian Inquisition?
---
Oh man. I can go on this one for HOURS.  
---
Shelve sthat allow for actual displays ... Bobbleheads, the teddy bears, etc. Teh code's not difficult and it'd be awesome to show off.  
---
Similarly, weapon racks, power armor stands, and MANEQUINS ... let me dress 'em up in armor or costumes so I can see what they look like! Put 'em around teh roof like guardians!  
---
Fridge and freezer, functional.  
---
CLEAN toilet and tub. Showers, both nasty, clean, and VERY clean.  
---
Autodoc like in Flatwoods and advertised in a few other areas. (The machine that you get the Scorched vaccination from for the lower level gang)   
---
Interior walls! With wallpaper and paint options. LET ME DECORATE!  
---
More kicthen gear ... place sto hold pots and pans, spice rack, place for salt and pepper and a peppr grinder and so on, with a breadbox, just on a shelf in my kitchen. Pantry where I can put canned goods, mac n cheese, etc.   
---
Wine cellar rack , some kind of "beer fridge" for drinks, a stockable Nuka Cola machine. I have doznes of Nuka COlas ... let me show 'em off!  
---
More carpets and rugs.  
---
Mirrors that work.   
---
Windows that aren't broken!
---
Lights that look more functional.   
---
Faction-themed gear! I want Responders stuff (signs, arrows, etc) but TONS of people want Raider stuff, while Enclave, Brotherhood, Free States, heck, Super Mutant stuff strewn about for the freaky people.   
---
A few BIG things, like house trailers (mostly wrecked, semi-intact, mostly intact, fresh and clean), RVs, and dead vehicles ... maybe I want a bunch of cars and bikes parked outside my eattery, to look busy. Let me do so!  
---
More fences... chain link (busted, intact, gate), white picket short and tall, hedges, etc. Maybe I want to make my own hedge maze... that'd be swell.  
---
More plants! I want flower gardens, cranberries, glowing moss and brain mold (might require a small nuclear dump to be added somewhere on the property ... give us some radioactive barrels and yucky spills for people who dig that kind of thing!) ... if it grows in West Virginia, we should be able to plant it.  
---
Some kind of meat farm ... a pen you can sit down that produces one cow an hour, or two dogs, or four rabbits or chickens, for instance.  
---
It just ... man... SO MUCH. this barely even scratches the surface.  
---
hahahaha oh jeez i want test servers. this like when i was coding a class based mutator mod for unreal tournament classic. code, test, bugs / funny errors, go back, code more, test more. laugh
---
*finger snaps* Bingo!

Wow, dude. Drop it. I'm sorry you can't handle opinions you don't like in a mature manner. It's been 12 hours, go do something else.

Bro, guns don’t kill people in this game (insert political joke here), you gotta use melee.

Oof there you go thinking you’re above me for some reason. I feel just fine about myself mate. I’m not the one who started a thread bitching about low level players in a video game.

You seemed to be the butthurt one, I was telling you to stop being a dick because you’re being a dick. Simple as that.

&gt;Duped  way to much shit myself...over 1 million nuka cola easy! Hundreds of  tse weapons thousands of flux and stem packs antibiotics ammo...ffs I  was sure I would never have to pick up shotgun shells again! BUT! I got  busted! Bethesda-1 Me-0. Good game bethesda! Had I known they could  track this is would have never done it. I enjoy this game a lot! Pushing  500 hours. With this said does anyone have any information on when this  temp ban will end? (Fyi before I get roasted I no longer have this  stuff...they successfully deleted it all last week. ) I will take my  punishment (better then most) just want to know if I have to sit out for  a week, month or even a year?

If that's who you wanna be then by all means. That's not who I want to be. I like being honest. And unlike you, I'm not foolish enough to believe that the best items are going to make me the best player

Ideally you'd get banned permanently but if that's not how it goes down then whatever. When Survival Mode launches, I'd love to hunt you for sport.

What does your build look like?  What rifle, main perks, and how much damage do you do?  Maybe I'll try it out, melee gets boring.
---
It is pacify but if you are near your base you will tame it

It’s a problem for 100% of player, but 99% of them don’t realize it yet.

I lost it by swapping to the keto diet. Ages 22-27 I weighed 150kg on average. I dropped about 10kg trying to manage my calories but hit a plateau. I randomly saw a before/after post about keto on r/all and looked into it. 
---
Around the same time I started my job. Physical job and a  low carb diet and the weight melted off. 
---
Once it started falling off I kept at it and still eat keto. I get blood tests every 6 months or so to make sure I'm good. Diabetes runs in the family and my diet was purely made up of chocolate for 6 years. I'm all good. 
---
Lol i duped like crazy and was unaffected 
---
My problem is by the time I pick through ammo &amp; aid to give someone, they've wandered off and I end up picking it back up. It's happened to me the last 3 attempts
---
How do you deal with rando mole rats chewing on your walls???

This bot is a plague
---
Now you're just being sad and pathetic.
---
Good night.
---
Find a less annoying catch phrase.
---
Not like i even care about the game anymore really am sad about how quickly it died
---
Wow lol...I guess I've never had the patience to wait it out.
---
Right haha just my luck 😬
---
Not everyone who is left without a ban is innocent. Not everyone who is banned necessarily duped. This logic is much more solid than any other posted here.
---
Once again, you think you can tell someone what is good for them. If it works for them, don't judge. It isn't your place. When people get disabled, they get depressed. When they get depressed, they seek escapes. That's what online games can be. Escapes. If someone literally can't leave their home, how are you going to fault them their one actual escape from their situation? Seriously. Everyone is different. He's not hurting you. He's doing what he needs to do to get by in this world. That's good enough for him, and that's good enough for me. 
---
ur so dumb. this is just trolling stupid kids like u.. and ur downvote will not change this fact.
---
Well what are you looking for? If it's new content that comes next month in the form of  optional PVP servers and some new PVE content. It's unclear what the new content will be right now, but it looks like weekly events in what they're called "Wild Appalachia". If it's server stability, yes it's greatly improved- not perfect but much better then before. There's been several balance tweaks and various small but noticable QOL improvements. Duping isn't a big thing anymore, and several other exploits have been fixed. You can read all the various patch notes on Beth's website if you want to.
---
It is amazing, but I do miss the intro key in 4, I still wait for the BOMMM every time I load, instead there is a couple of second wait with a nice easy intro 
---
Yeah, you tell yourself that, person who commented on most of my comments that were not on your comment. You tell yourself that. Have a night. 
---
Well with the right perks you can have unlimited ammo or max capped lol they weight around .0 something if I remember correctly
---
More stable, a bit less lag. 
---
Two shot legendaries got nerfed from 2x dmg to 1.25 dmg. Explosive legendaries got nerfed too, don't remember how much tho.
---
If you finished most of the quests there isn't new content yet.
---
The perk fireproof got an additional effect of reducing explosive damage. Paired with a dense mod on a chest piece, it will completely negate explosive damage. If you don't know, those two affixes I mentioned (two shot and explosive) are the TSE you might have seen around the sub. They were incredibly powerful and are now weaker but still pack quite a punch. Especially shotguns as they cause an explosion **per** pellet. 
---
Dupers got banned. Stacked duped items were reduced to 1. (Say you had 10k bobbleheads, after update youd have 1)
---
Uhhh, that's all I can really think of. Main page has patch notes but there aren't any really radical changes. Oh scorchbeasts dont scream as much.
---
Watch with Adblock enabled. :)
---
Yup
---
Very cash money of you sir. An overall jist of the game rn was what I was looking for and u did it. thanks!
---
Someone did this like an hour ago.
---
Exactly.  It's not just the damage - not having to deal with ammo is a biiig deal, especially when stash space is at such a premium.
---
I like this!
---
I'll be totally honest I haven't opened the game and played it since the beta, I enjoyed it only cause I had someone to roam with, do to the bad publicity non of my friends got it :l
---
Cash money good sir
---
I want a "green" roof (flat, covered in grass, you can plant things in it) and a "solar panel tile" roof that provides 1 power per square of it you use.

Oh shit your right...

Yeah brb gonna delete this post

I've tried doing a sneaky but sneaking doesn't seem that effective for me.  Lots of sneaky perks, high agility, chameleon, and I still end up getting discovered often enough that it doesn't feel viable.  Idk maybe I'm sneaking wrong.

---
But still dumb enough to spend your time insulting people on reddit in a sub specifically based on the game you have no intention of getting
---
God yes, logic gates, timed power output options, delayed activation triggers, motion sensors, programmable lights (so you can have them swap between 2 or more states), resistors (something you can just put in line whose only job is to reduce the power by 1, surprisingly useful in logic gates and necessary for anything really interesting). Basically, I want Minecraft Redstone level of functionality in Fallout.
---
Apparently her damage resistances are always 300/300 now, while before they varied with player count, so it's a lot tougher to take her down with a small player count.
---
Yeh I know but at least its good publicity for fallout on a sense that this guy is blatent exploiter and being found out that publicly will only give more praise to Bethesda for doing what they are. 
---
Love this game and glad to see people get what they deserve.
---
Be encouraged not discouraged 😝
---
No, don't do it.
---
Woahhhh there big fella, I'm in Americaland, check your privilege 
---
You don't triple box, or do WhiteSprings for 9 hours...

I've walked away with between 250 and 500 per run, of Hardened, Glowing and Radioactive when I'm lucky.  
---
Scroll up you'll see all that outlined.  
---
No Exploits required, before the Weight cap you could slow walk with 20,000 pounds if you were willing. 
---
You could check with your Cc issuer to see if they can do a chargeback...
---
You to!?!?!??!?! No way!!!!!!
---
You know, youtubers are people too, i found out one of my favourite youtubers went down today, the channel is completely locked up. Health reasons apparently related to the job. This person was known for being critical. I guess it got too much for him in the end and now he seeks medical attention. Don't suppose a person like you would even care though, because you're full of hate for people so it seems.
---
Holy shit you don’t even own fallout 76 and you clearly dislike it, but you still post on the fallout 76 subreddit? I’m interested in why you’re like this. 
---
If you have Grounded mutation, even though the lvl 3 class freak perk shows a reduced rate it isn't reduced for Gauss. Not sure it is reduced for other energy weapons. It's been that way for at least the last two or three patches. I gave up waiting for a fix, just going to sell the Gauss rifles and breath a sigh of relief not having that heavy as hell ammo
---
They nerfed the sonic attack, changing it from fully automatic to a three round burst(need validation) every 10 seconds.
---
😂 Meijer.. Like the store.. 
---
No, just a two shot. 
---
“I have no strong feelings one way or the other.”

&gt;Fallout 76 actually good
---
&gt;People hate no reason 
---
What a brave and original opinion
---
In deep, dupers copied "winning" lotery tickets (legendary god drops) and sold them to everyone.
---
They totally perverted the economy of this game.
---
In the other hand, if dupers didn't exist, I don't really know how the game could be now. Some metakids need to own need all the best stuff 24/7 or they will cry loud...
---
His most ardent defenders are saying it's because he was transferring his ammo between alts, but you still have to ignore the fact that he'd need to be transferring the items between two different accounts in huge quantities for a 30 day period. The guy never specified if both his accounts got banned, or just one. And if he had the help of a friend instead of another account where's the friend in all of this? Also nobody even knows if ammo is flagged or not. It's all just speculation that he's adopted from his defenders, his original explanation was he got reported for trading with his low level alt, the story changed later when other people brought up the transferring of ammo between. His story just doesn't stand up to any scrutiny
---
The pop up doesn't mean anything. Every item has an internal id. If it's the same legendary, picking it up 10 times will not register as finding it 10 times.
---
Try it out. When there is a 'Find x number of Y' type challenge, can you complete it by finding just one and picking it up and dropping it again and again? 
---
Mathematically proven? You don't have a clue what you're talking about. You don't know how the script detected the number. His story is it was traded between accounts a number of times. So cut it in half at least. Then there is getting resources from friends, clanmates, from the markets, etc. Proof would be if Bethesda logs into his account and screenshots his inventory right now. Not some accumulated number over a 30 day period.
---
I have no feelings. Period. 
---
I am dead inside. A rotten husk of a human feeding the mold and bacteria that is humanity with the warm, putrid sustinence deep within.

The mask from Watoga HS? 
---
$40 isn't bad but honestly it wasn't worth the $80 I paid for a couple of skins. When I preordered it they told me it came with the little figurines, obviously it was a lie but I didn't care since they gave me other promo stuff that they didn't use.
---
Woahhhh there big fella, I'm in Americaland, Cc issuer's own your soul upon the first purchase. And that's only if Bethesda allows that in their TOS
---
Drop in in connection speed
---
You could buy good legendaries off vendors in that game. You just have to suffer in this one.
---
That’s also a very lucky turn out. I (level 160) haven’t come close to that ever.
---
This game doesn’t reward either grind or skill. OP is saying that it should, in essence.
---
necroposting but thank you so much for this! I found it on my SSD
---
Wtf are you babbling on about? 
---
The duration means that you have duped withon the last 30 days, not cumulatively acquired them over 30 days. They understandably don't keep inventory records from the launch of the game till now. So anytime your account had 100k+ items in the last one month, you'd get flagged.
---
More special allocation. Better RNG Drops. Create one 3 star legendary item to your specifics every 50 levels.
---
Can't wait for Yongyeis slow talking "gotta make the 10 minute mark" ass to make a video on this
---
If aimlessly wandering appalacia isn't your thing, you might wanna give it a few months. 
---
They're going to drop a survival mode at some point, (no pvp restrictions) if that's something you'd be into. They said that people could xfer characters (lvl and loot) to these servers, but I think they recently backtracked and are deciding whether to do that or start fresh. 
---
Hey, I'm having this same issue again but I did what you said in your post already, is there another fix?
---
Just make an option to 'gift wrap' something you drop.  If you choose to gift the item(s) then they appear as a gift box with ribbon that jiggles around and emits a noise or something rather than the usual paper bag.
---
Happened to me all the time the last time I played this fixed it for me.
---
Open your map, then open your camera mode, then exit back camera mode and exit map. Should be fixed. 
---
I suspected as much.
---
How people like op are so ignorant is beyond me. There are concerns about how Bethesda went about detecting illegitimately gained stuff. Some people are thinking that they’ve counted everything a person has picked up. So if I drop 10k 5.56 to times and pick it back up each time, they think I’ve picked up 100k ammo. That’s wrong. And some people have been banned for having a few hundred k ammo which wasn’t that crazy considering they had almost 1k hours.
---
A community manager took a personal interest in his story and escalated the ticket for him. He's still banned, even though they could easily apologize to him and reinstate the account and get some good karma for doing it.... He's still banned, and Beth is sticking to their guns regardless of the negative press. I mean Occam's razor and all..
---
1k stimpaks isn’t something that could be considered crazy. I have almost 2k and I put in minimal effort to get them.
---
Woot glad u found it, I don’t know why never posting bugs people it keeps everything in one place and helps with people trying to google around. 
---
What did you suspect?
---
I would want something similar to a console to play our pip boy games on. Have it usable by whoever stops by and try and beat their high score. 
---
Hell yeah borther
---
I tag them if other people are around, kill them if there aren’t. But I drag all 2-3* legendaries to the nearest player.
---
Grandpa Billy? You use reddit?
---
They are only banning RARE items lol ;)
---
What’s the mob and item? Just curious 
---
Devil's Advocate: he might have friends who have ammo they're wanting to dump. No reason for him to take it on his main and then transfer it to his mule if they're both on at the same time.
---
Damn, lying more than todd howard to get some sweet sweet upvotes. God this subreddit has gone to shit.
---
Yeah it's the 5th most upvoted post on this subreddit. The most upvoted is the one about the nylon "canvas" bag. Wonder why they removed the upvote numbers from posts earlier today/yesterday? Yeah. That's not damage control shilling at all. It seems like that is the only way to get them to respond. By getting stuff upvoted so high. But now they remopved the numbers. Yeah good call. Easier to manipulate things that way right? What is a "community manager"? What community are they managing? If you mean read some high rated threads on reddit and send an email, yeah maybe they did take an interest.
---
Will do once back at a computer.
---
Shite excuse for trying to beat a dead horse imo
---
Everything is fine while your in the majority, but as soon as your in the minority, everything seems against you.
---
Nah, because frankly, you're rarely gonna be max health in a nuke zone unless you're throwing away massive amounts of chems.
---
&gt; FO76 is a lot of missed opportunities 
---
This.
---
With better design choices, more refinement, some real game-play testing… this game had all the potential to be a great hit, and not what happened. It hurts.
---
K.
---
The monster mask or whatever
---
That's the only thing my bathroom is missing. I'm tracking down the plans for the vanity because that seems like the logical replacement for the time being. I would also like other variations of the toilet and bathtub. Also a mirror stash box like the ones in every other bathroom in the game. 
---
Bethesda already places so many restrictions on us as players. The lack of QOL entirely doesn’t help.
---
This is pointless.
---
nuke silo
---
I agree another 25% would be great. I've got my structure built but would love for a little extra decorating budget. 
---
Man, you gotta love this utterly pathetic circle jerk trying to attack that 900 hour guy. You don't even have half the information, but you just gotta pile on so you can encourage each other in this ridiculous, overdefensive outrage.
---
If you ever see people talk about how pathetic this sub is, then this is the perfect example. It is a toxic shitshow aimed at a single person right now...
---
Well, I mean there's a pretty big story if you care to dig it up. If you don't like reading terminals, listening to holotapes and figuring out what is actually happening then no, you probably won't like it. 
---
this is the stupdiest post I've seen. I haven't been banned bcuz I haven't played? dumb. just fucking dumb.
---
That you are young but you will learn.
---
Stealth nerfs are still a thing. They’ve started another banwave (surprisingly). And they haven’t addressed balance or the awful state of loot in the game.
---
It say it’s worse than at patch 4.
---
I love your builds! Looked through your post history and remembered seeing some of those builds (saved practically all of them) looking forward to more stuff from you :)!
---
@Bethesda  maybe you should find a way to stop players from  claiming several work shops. Today while playing I had a work shop overtaken by a player only 30 levels or so higher than myself, I went  back to contest and was one shotted. Keeping in mind I'm level 95, had full health and power armor on. After a quick glance at the map he owned all the work shops in that area and was stealing more. And killing anyone who got close. This is B%ll S#!+  
---
Looks good for a hardcore rp play through
---
Thats because several Youtube gamers have realized that people like to crap on things regardless if it is earned or not. And as long as their negativity videos get likes they will continue to post negativity videos.
---
The reason Anthem is in the line of fire has nothing to do with Anthem.
---
It has everything to do with Anthem being under the EA umbrella so the shallow Youtube “reviewers” are crapping on Anthem as a proxy of EA.
---
Why?

Because it’s popular to drop crap on EA lately and they know doing so means more likes on their videos. More likes means, due to Youtube algorithms, that your video gets more exposure. More exposure means more ad revenue. More ad revenue means literally more money for the person(s) behind the Youtube channel.
---
Put simply; they are being literal sellouts trying to get more money by crapping on whatever is popular to crap on, irrespective if it is warranted or not.
---
How old are you?
---
I get it from time to time. Someone in the area always seems to crash soon after and its goes back to being fine.  It also happens when someone has a Targeting HUD and the waves of scorched enemies show up
---
You’re ignoring facts too, like the fact that people are speculating that Bethesda counts everything you pick up more than once. If I drop 10k ammo and pick it up again 5 times, they think I’ve picked up 50k. There’s no word from Bethesda about this as far as I know.
---
Also, there is a massive number of things wrong with the game and development team. Please don’t try to pick a fight you can’t win.
---
IF they had something like that for leather or marine armor I would buy... I mean if I could make my marine armor look like I was some demonic deathclaw... I would go insane. 
---
Events on the map to have their Timers showing. So we don’t fast travel to an event that is about to end. 
---
Fast Traveling from Watoga to Harper’s Ferry always causes my game to get disconnected. 100% of the time. I now fast travel to Red Rocket and walk over just to avoid it. 
---
Oh I know what managing the community means. It means using downvote bots to manipulate and control opinion.
---
I agree on the planting items. I want to be able to make a green house and the hydroponics could be used to grow harder to find ingredients. They seem to have stills in game but only have an output container and nowhere to put ingredients, I want a working one in my camp. 
---
There isn't. 
---
This looks less and less like a failed game, and more and more like a massive troll.
---
Nah. I’m extremely forgiving with games. But I dislike a lot of fallout 76 and am angry at the developers because they’re doing a bad job and there are far too many issues for a fully released game. I don’t give a shit what you bees say, I form my own opinions after checking things out for myself.
---
Nope. If you want to start an alt it'll be level 1. You'll have to level it to 50 before doing the main quest if you want the rewards that are scaled to 50.
---
Ability to consume food, water, or meds on pickup.
---
 Fix the broken challenges.
---
Different nuke zones should spawn different Behemoth bosses. 
---
So obviously you have all the info ready to go on a moment's notice? And on a side note has this information been collected from fellow shitting on Bethesda posters?
---
NPC's
---
More Quest 
---
Way more Quests 
---
 Appt of phones let you take "long" screenshots. The iPhone and my one plus 6t for example. Google it for your phone and it might make things easier. 
---
They look something like this[long screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/uADNheJ.jpg)
---
Where is the main thread I can't find it?
---
If that's what you need to tell yourself.
---
I definitely enjoyed the reading at first but eventually got a bit exhausted. I’ve had a few cool finds but I can’t help but feel disappointed knowing every character in most dialogues are already dead (aside from robots) but I guess that’s the whole point. 
---
&gt; high level PvP
---
hmmm… really? What's that? a couple dozen of kids who still did't move to a real PvP game for some weird reason?
---
The 99% of the customers of this game don't care a shit about (hig level) PvP and all that crap...
---
Lmao the irony is real. It’s not the only thing he got wrong either.
---
Buying from others 👍
---
GOOD BOT
---
Lol sometimes it’s the lower level guys doing the killing as it is I’m 140 plus 
---
Flatwoods
---
maybe other player has dump this 8 legendaries on the corpse
---
I doubt you would be banned for that. Maybe when pvp mode comes out they may care but still doubt it as they could just change them to take damage. 
---
Looks like beautiful countryside
---
More perk points and custom load outs
---
Rename power armor
---
Timers and free fast travel to events
---
I think they need to make basically 4 different models of electric doors. One that's simply powered, one with a key pad on the outside, one with the key pad on the inside and one with keypads on both sides and then just be able to change the wall type. Same goes for sliding/garage doors, give me options. 
---
i couldn't get that location to work tried on 2 different scorpions 
---
&gt; The duration means that you have duped within the last 30 days, not cumulatively acquired them over 30 days
---
Then it would say "the last 30 days". That phrasing is very clearly a duration, not a date range. And again, if you're going to find dupers you can't count on them ever having 100k+ of a rare item on them at any one moment. Why do that when you can just dupe more on demand? 
---
If Bethesda wanted to actually address the problem with dupers their detection routine would need to be more nuanced than just checking inventory counts. Otherwise the ban wave would only catch the stupid ones, leaving the ones who are actually problems free to continue shitting up the game. I may question how Bethesda executed this ban wave, but I do think they're smart enough (more than smart enough) to figure out that they needed to look deeper than just raw inventory counts.
---
&gt; Also, are you the Yukichigai from YUP for New Vegas?
---
Yeah, that's me. Hiye!
---
...and yeah I'll admit that my experiences with bug fixing Bethesda games have made me hesitant to assume anything they produce is perfect, including whatever code they ran to produce this list of bans. 
---
In this game? No way, get out of here 😂
---
Could try farming tick blood from the moonshiner shack and lumber mill right next to vault 76. Can use tick blood and antiseptic (forget what other mats) to make stims at a chem bench.
---
Nah, lets face it, he cheated
---
If that was intended that means you stealth changed something once again, depsite promising you'd document any changes (especially game changing changes) a few months back.
---
Haven't you learned your lesson yet  ?
---
Salty dupers 🤭
---
"oh no this community backlash is bad for us let's settle this matter privately so everyone else shuts up."
---
I know it's jarring at first, but once you get used to that fact it's actually quite fun piecing it all together. It's fun having a vast wasteland to explore without giant exposition dumps from NPCs, and is honestly way more immersive then some other games.
---
Can someone tell me why all these people are going off the youtube review fucktards, i guarrentee you they arent looking at anything official, game devs and comps dont ever release the OFFICIAL assets and files for games, it just doesnt work like that, so those youtubers doing "reviewing the fo76 games files, its not promising" videos, are totally lying to their viewers and are reading indefinitely biased fake shit
---
&gt;It’s already been mathematically proven that the damn guy was cheating
---
Where are you getting this? Literally every single number crunch I've seen has said it *is* possible to craft that much ammo, it's just not likely because it would mean he was doing basically nothing else all month
---
Player owned vendors, new weapons/mods/legendaries, and more lovecraft stuff.
---
Loved your mod, man! It made New Vegas actually playable for me, along with NVAC and a few other mods. I like your philosophy for YUP, how you don't do game altering stuff. That's exactly the kind of bugfixing mod I wanted. Once again, great job! 
---
I agree on all this, building my camp is one of my favorite things to do. I definitely wish there were more barrier options. I have the concert block walls surround my garden but it's the only option that isn't a fence. They also snap at angles that aren't 90 degrees which I wish more things did. 
---
You know recently I started to notice that there are more legendary drops from the ghouls there who are maximum as deceased but not marked as legendary. As for legendary they also often don’t give you legendary drop or even body disappears.
---
Was “it sucked” just too direct?
---
Make em! Farm ticks at moonshiners Shack and lumber yard using butchers bounty. Then using chemist and super duper craft them. Then dilute those. I have like 300+ right now.
---
Thanks, just wanted to make a good game better. But I also can't forget to give credit to sandbox6 for taking over after life intervened. If you've used the mod in the last few years then it's been his work keeping it going, not me.
---
Im on ps4 but i will give it a try next time thanks.
---
 Crafting, buying, looting, and picking up from a bag or container are the only ways that I am of of that would cause an item that was not previously in your inventory to now show up in your inventory. I agree completely with your definition.
---
 From what little I understand about the game's engine, it is my understanding that the engine does not allow unique identifiers to be associated with specific instances of an in-game item, and in turn, it cannot allow associated metadata to be captured. I believe that's part of the problem. The engine doesn't have any sort of back end support to run a report, similar to what you are describing. I am guessing you're probably working with an Oracle database?
---
 And, I agree with you again on your last two sentences. Bethesda should have definitions, and should provide them. But, from what I can tell, they have not been provided. This is forcing the community,  any interested journalists, to have to work on assumption, rather than fact. 
---
 Using the assumptions that I am forced to work with, it very much appears that Bethesda used a poorly thought out algorithm to enforce vague policies, and did not perform any additional diligence in the form of active oversight of the process. I could be wrong. I hope I am. But, so far, I cannot find anything to indicate otherwise.
---
Forbidden Knowledge quest, repeatable with one tech doc at a time and gives 4-8 meds each time or 1-3 super-stimpaks. tech docs can be farmed from the Enclave Bunker and server hopping resets the desks, I've found 8 at the top end in the one room there.
---
I first played New Vegas in 2017 and I think after struggling with constant crashes I got the mods in either December of 17 or January of 18.
---
Yea the one you can't keep from the event
---
I just started my game again yesterday, no ban, as expected. All I ever picked up from a bag was ultracite plans when I left the vault, I had no idea what it was
---
No, watoga HS event mask
---
Cause dataminers will find and broadcast it for them.
---
Why not, though? Isnt it better that someone legitimately farms the materials instead of duping? If they actually put that effort into true farming, which it sounds very likely they did, then props to them. Even the hours arent that crazy. WoW players could easily do that.
---
I pretty much did the same thing in Fallout 4, too. I made a bunch of ammunition plants, grabbed as much fertilizer/steel/lead as I could during questing and made a shit ton of ammo mainly so I had to never worry about running out of it. Ever. And with Fallout 76 you have the option to sell it to players, which I would definitely be in the business of
---
You created a glitch? Don’t you mean exploit? That means you’re a cheater, and that means you’re a duper. Dupers obviously have no life, so they’re useless pieces of shit. Useless pieces of shit often watch anime, and that’s a weeb, and you must be a weeb. If you’re a weeb you must watch lots of sexual anime or hentai that has underaged actors making you a pedophile, meaning you must be jailed.
---
People like you make me sick.

---
I heard that rumors about this sub but I never believed it until now :/ Can't say I'm surprised. I'm just disappointed. I thought it was a good community. Everyone celebrating Mothman week, hosting events and such really was awesome at first. But this is just pathetic honestly. 
---
Yeah it’s a bug Bethesda introduces when they tweaked legendaries not long ago. I’m hoping I get a two shot eventually.
---
yes you will very much enjoy 4 if fo only the game chanics they are very similar and better cause it focused on single player being powerful
---
If u like 76, Fo4 is basically the exact same thing. Only better.
---
Nope; we don't know if Bethesda just counted "acquired ammo" that was shifted between accounts.
---
That’s gold Jerry! Especially 1 and 3!  Not that 2 shouldn’t be addressed as well.
---
Except when they grief you
---
Downvote bots...
---
Fucking Alex Jones here on the FO76 sub...
---
Holy shit... 
---
Yea it’s the same pretty much it might annoy you how similar it is 
---
Yep, that's after sandbox6 took over the day to day. Good guy. Talented, too!
---
Yeah, I'd say so. I've always been kinda meh on the story but the setting in awesome and there's lots of cool places to explore and interesting characters.
---
My personal favorite is New Vegas, there's just so many choices and I really enjoyed the story. One day you're a courier, next you're thrown in the middle of a conflicting with so many groups intertwined.
---
How would playing a better version annoy you?
---
Didn't he also put together some 11th hour alibi miraculously before he got suspended too? 
---
&gt;So obviously you have all the info ready to go on a moment's notice?
---
No, and that's why I'm not making up opinions or support a dumb circlejerk. You can actually just use your brain and wait till it's clear what's happening.
---
Because it’s so close to being the same game 
---
I love how the Bethesda's reps answer to so many irrelevant posts, or how they celebrate "cool" photos someone posted here… while they ignore posts like this one, concerning critical areas of the game.
---
I just came across in and it said I need to talk to someone. I assume they just don't exist?
---
[Not sure how you missed it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/egvl13e?utm_source=reddit-android)

But if you really need someone to talk to that bad, I'm here for you.
---
It is a bug that occurs to ranged weapons only, melee shows no affect as far as damage goes. The data transfer rate doesn't drop but you the player lose sync to the server. Had it happen to me and was still getting average send/receive from the server but everything I did was delayed a couple tenths of a second.

DOWNVOTE BOTS...

Do you fucking even read the shot you type?
---
Shills and downvote bots!!!
---
You're the biggest fucking tool in this subreddit
---
HELL YEAH, REJOICE
---
Oh, communities like this tend to be great, as long as you don't get into drama, and I imagine it's the same with this one. But when the drama starts, they tend to lose all self-awareness and become unbearable.
---
And reddits upvote system ofc trains people to act in very much that way.
---
I said "weird reason" for something…
---
Btw, I agree that (some of the) new players could be the most affected by the lack of dupped god items. 
---
Anyway, I don't see many new players coming to this game at this point… with all the dupped crap around, should be more tan enough...
---
It’s called confirmation bias,  only seeing, considering and accepting the “facts” that fit your theory on a subject.  It just works 
---
Depends if u liked it past time ? Coz nothing has changed expect few bugs fixed and a few new bugs made lol
---
Awkward that it took three months to fix a very glaring problem in the game's most common end-game enemy?  
---
Nothing you did was awkward. SBs are a fucking joke, even if the sonic attack is reduced they aren't worth fighting at all when you invest 3-4x as much ammo as they return in cap value.
---
Theoretically these are temp bans, only the duration is measured in "until we fix the dupe exploits". I don't think Bethesda is stupid enough to turn that into "forever", but it may be measured in many, many months. Technically temporary, but still....
---
Just like a day before the bans. Honestly I somehow doubt that was planned on his part, the timing was too perfect... However we all knew this was coming sooner or later, so it makes sense for him set his sails to the direction the wind was blowing.
---
All the emotions, must be hard shorting through it all.
---
I'm going to use that Black Rider armor to send my war boys into Valhalla, shiny and chrome
---
I get this with my scoped hunting and handmade rifles. It’s very annoying when you want to snipe and then move quickly.
---
Worked fine for me with drinks, food, grenades, and meds today.
---
[YMMV]
---
At first I thought with the latest update they increased how many caps you find in stashes, making cap collector even better, but I realized I just got lucky once. Most i ever find is like 30 caps and then searched for another 30. I saw 112 and then searched for 120. Then for the rest of the day it was 30ish...
---
there are still random plans trust me 
---
I also wold like to have some npc emerge from the vaults. Give us quests to make habitable homes/cities for them. Maybe have these zones instanced so they chang as you progress through their story lines but not immediately make them available to everyone
---
Now use a .50 cal or Minigun and do just 2-3 SBQs a day. May have a friend and transfer some ammo just once within 30 days, let's say just 10k. What you bought 15k 5mm rounds?             
---
      
---
Well tell me again you not got banned for 'exploiting' because you legit played a game.       
---
       
---
For Bethesda 99k Fusion cores are fine but get a ban for 101k 5mm or .50 ammo. You can craft that amount (also as ultracite) just from 2-3 hours farming a day.        
---
        
---
I wonder what would happen when you got banned and realized it's because you use a heavy weapon...
---
if you're willing to wait to october you might as well wait even longer. no idea in setting an exact date, as you'd likely want to time your return/play with additional content being released, but i'm way sure 'stuff' isn't going to be fixed before like 2-3 major DLCs down the road (like every other bethesda game).
---
That’s super lame
---
it's easy to forget as someone who plays exclusively with friends how different the game experience is for other people. i'm not sure i could play the game much without any friends to roam with.
---
Same here.  This fix works perfectly.  Thanks.
---
I killed the monster. Before it hit the floor i was looting it. It kept leaving 1 legendary in the place of the last one. 
---
We have no idea how the ban script works and it’s mathematically possible that he could have gotten that. Is it too soon to tell? Yes. Is he an evil duper? Maybe. Doesn’t matter anymore.
---
Both you and them are wrong. In my eyes, the man just played you all like a fiddle for publicity and karma. It’s actually not an eternal ban if you read the email closely, so the guy wins in that regard, and gains publicity and karma. It’s a win-win for him.
---
don't listen to that other guy I have tamed pretty much everything you can in this game , you only need 3 charisma and rank 3 of animal freind and it has to be a creature at a random encounter and highest lvl deathclaw i have been able to tame even with 15 charisma when i respec was a lvl 21   and Doesnt matter how close your base is not sure what he was talking about
---
Do you wanna be level 71 doing the same thing ? Lol
---
BBeing you don't care for the story It will much of the same grind, just a new map to play on. I say go for it, mods can be fun as well, if you're into that.
---
I want this though.... 
---
https://imgur.com/a/w3BWlhJ
---
Sorry for the delay..  
---
Happy to trade fair value maps for ammo :). 
---
I usually pay 50 caps per map, and if you save up a bit happily feed you shells for them
---
with server hopping, you can easily farm 200 ivory pistol grip plans an hour. if you spent a complete 30 days - 720 hours - with minimal sleeping (4 hours a day), you'd get 120000 plans (or 4000 a day).
---
only noobs who dont know how to farm ivory pistol grips and dont know about server hopping think this is not possible.
---
it doesn't matter that farming 4000 single ivory pistol grip plans a day is a pointless exercise, thing is it's possible, therefor, i cannot have cheated. fool proof logic.
---
gj bethesda your move.
---
Let me use unspent perk points to make optional profiles. Instead of having to start a new character, let me spend my unused perk points to make another profile I can switch to.
---
My current build is a power armor/melee/rifle build, andI'd love to do a low health. But not enough to start from scratch and do all the quests over again.
---
Cool! Awesome :) thank you so much! Now do you NEED animal friend in addition to wasteland whisperer?
---
YOU MEAN ACTUAL INTERACTION BETWEEN PLAYERS THAT ISN'T SOME SMUG LV 500 GIVING AWAY SHIT TO FRESH SPAWNS OR STUNTED AS FUCK PVP? NO WAY DUDE WHAT GAME DO YOU THINK THIS IS.
---
Do you know the meaning of the word "tool"? Like a useful idiot. A corporate bootlicker. I wonder who fits the bill?
---
tagging u/Hell-Inc as a reminder to apply cooling gel on burned area. that was one mighty self-burn.
---
Yep, that's been made pretty damn clear. To be fair, I think that also hid the depth of those flaws even from Bethesda. Now that we're seeing the unadulterated economy for what it is the picture isn't that pretty. Hopefully they'll see that and adjust things.
---
&gt; I'm only lvl 49 and have only used weapons that I have found or crafted. I have yet to feel like I was underpowered for the tasks that I was doing.
---
Then frankly you're lucky or made a good first toon. My first toon was a rifle build and I totally abandoned it after level 60 because it was pretty garbage. The perk choices were fine, but I just didn't have any weapons to effectively deal with end game mobs to and relevant degree. At best I was tagging shit in nuke zones and hoping for something good, but when I was alone trying to deal with SB's and mirelurk queens I was pretty fucked.
---
I made a 2h build next and crushed end game with non legendary super sledges, once I got my nicer instigating super sledge and other legendaries I just ran through all the content and farmed up enough stuff to gear out my following pistol and heavy weapon toons. I play my heavy weapon toon the most even though it's not my strongest, it's just the most satisfying.
---
Point being that without either being melee or getting a lucky drop, you're gonna have a rough time at end game with your average gun build at first. The way to get around this is RNG or trading... thus it hurts newer players the most.
---
Banned 
---
:/ Do you still like this subreddit?
---
&gt;It is a toxic shitshow aimed at a single person right now...
---
wow dude you've missed a lot. there's been so many people coming out of the woodworks to behave like nutters. pretty sure no one is giving a shit about the 900 hours guy now that he is banned. fucking good. i hope he learned his lesson.
---
but you're seriously deluded if you think this push-back against all the sob-stories (that happen after all ban waves in all games) is a witch-hunt against a single person. just wow.
---
stop taking everything as a personal attack, and then simultaneously ascribing it to someone else. you don't have to defend the 900 hour guys honor. he straight up lied, was caught lying, tried doing damage control, and failed. no need to bury yourself down in the ground with him, mate.
---
This is obviously my ignorance talking (re:previous comment about looking into this from the outside, but have played all other FO games) but i'm seeing the phrase "trading items" being tossed around as one of the possibilities of the ammo acquisition. Did they actually add bonifide p2p trading in the game and thats how people are muling items, or is the term "trading" being used to denote character 1 throwing shit in a box then character 2 logging in and picking those items up?
---
I've been putting stuff in the overseer's caches, because people don't understand that I'm giving them stuff. Something needs to happen on this.
---
I need to let you know that your post has been shadow deleted, by the way. All I see is "[Removed]" right now. 
---
I'm using the Removeddit site to see what you originally posted though. And I do agree with you that there is some kind of back-end effort to destroy this game. 
---
No one expects the Appalachian Inquisition!
---
Thanks for the cryptic answer, have you seen a dense plan on a vendor since it was patched? I have done quite a bit of server hoping and mods change every time so its likely dense mods still can show up. My rng could be horrible but I have not seen a sigle dense plan since it was patched and I have been looking, I asked around and no one else has seen one either.
---
Wait.. people got banned? ::sarcasm:: But I’ve been a good girl and haven’t been banned either! Yay us!! :]
---
Perk card sets (Combat, crafting, etc)
---
Two-Shot weapons reinstated to former glory
---
Tools (emotes, seems nothing new?) for communicating desire to help new players 
---
Yep - did it 3  times yesterday and got nothing, Got killed a lot and a player stole my loot. Did 2 nukes in a row at first and SBQ health never went below 50% during both. Server lagged a lot and game froze heaps while time was running out and then got disconnected. I think at the end of the first one everyone just stood around thinking WTF.
---
you mean losing self-awareness as in believing a quip against people who proclaim innocence is equal to the unbearable?
---
It seems, that I can get killed in 2-3 hits, even I am not in PVP mode at all.
---
It could be an actionable option like auto play on holotapes. So much easier.
---
Aah. I see. Someone else told me the same too.
---
It’s buggy Fallout 4 with friends and an awful loot system.
---
That’s the simplified version but that’s about it. They’re apparently cracking down on exploiters, which is fine? I guess? 
---
IMO, not worth. It’s only gotten worse since launch. People are starting to realize the game has much more problems than bugs, and the core of it is the loot system.
---
On vacation so have not played since patch 6 but SD seemed to proc more often with certain things much more often than others.  Cooking? Loads of SD! Witch costumes? Yes! Ammo or Flux? Not so much. 
---
Ah okay. I’m interested to know how they got that mask too.
---
5mm ammo isn't a rare item. It is 100k or more of any rare item that gets you banned. 
---
2 too 3 hours farming ? lol you do realise how dumb that sounds right ?
---
that's the most damning thing about it, isn't it? because we don't know the extent of duping, we can't know how much it has affected the average player.
---
for sure, anyone that has killed the queen with a large group will most likely have had aid from someone with duped equipment.
---
personally, i'd be up for a hard reset, or a separate mode (which is what survival should have been), because that's the only way to really fix anything. but if they did that, they'd probably kill off the game. catch-22.
---
When will you start looking at all the false bans? I don't even get a reply.      
---
Could you elaborate why 99k Fusion Cores are fine but 101k Ultracite 5mm or .50 ammo is not? You can farm those in 2-3 hours a day.       
---
Or kill a Scorchbeast Queen with Minigun or .50cal. Have a look how much ammo you used. Now imagine killing 2 SBQs a day. Over 30 days. Guess why you would have gotten banned?       
---
This is just ridiculozus and should get investigated with highest priority. Most if those you banned probably just used heavy guns...
---
High health melees like yours truly hit about 1k. 2k isn’t even required tbh.
---
Guns can hit those levels, but it requires specific legendaries and perk investment.
---
Guns in general need a buff, but melee is fine where it is, besides the bloodied cheese along with sentinel cheese which makes you a one hit kill machine that never dies.
---
shhh
---
This is just ridiculous and should get investigated with highesut priority. Most if those you banned probably just used heavy guns...
---
\&gt;&gt;  Got an event that gives +15 hp to a costume you can buy? pop out R\*'s dick to scream about p2w 
---
This is a slippery slope, dude.
---
Didn't cheat, got banned.
---
Stole from a cheater. After killing them
---
&gt; you don't have to defend the 900 hour guys honor. he straight up lied, was caught lying, tried doing damage control, and failed
---
He didn't, at least not at this point. Bethesda banned him and *now* they are looking into it. There are easy explanations why their original statistics might be misleading.
---
So it's still open, yet you are talking as if you're 100% sure what's going on. Aka you're pretty much objectively a liar.
---
It's not free really, i mean, you wouldn't get that quest if you hadn't paid whatever the price of the game is. Free in that sense is kind of a lie. Bethesda are good at doing that.
---
Cant seem to find the nifs for the other armors can you point me in the right direction for that?
---
also, please look at vault tec weapon workbench. It doesn't lift itself up but randomly rotates itself when you come back to your base. I just want to use cool skin but can't because of this bug
---
Eh, it's all fine and dandy when people just talk about the game they're enjoying, sharing experiences or helping newbies, etc. (although with a game like Fo76, it's unavoidable that constant complaints come up, Beth needs a lot of feedback apparently)
---
Don’t get me wrong I hate dupers too but I get the feeling you would be a different type of dude and probly have a mom or dad as a cop hahah 
---
Yes, no server with more then 8 peoole present have been able to kill her since the patch. I can solo her in 3 minutes though. Her damage aoe thing has also been buffed and is capable of killing my bloodied build instead of just requiring a stim previous patch.
---
Broke Adrenal reaction so it’s garbage.
---
That’s some facts there. Get destroyed liberal.
---
My server crashed once. 
---
i found all 5 in watonga
---
1 in the BOS BOS vendor
---
1 on table outside train station
---
1 on top of school
---
2 in municipal centre in courtroom.
---
nope, he deleted his post after he was outed. hard to feel sympathy for anyone that is actively suppressing information.
---
sorry i mean i havnt personally seen dense but i havnt been looking for it but i was looking for a specific plan  and had to jump a few times for it to show up. yes some of the plans are "set" but there are still plans that are random ...is that better?
---
4 is better so yes
---
Not as dumb as commenting before thinking about it...      
---
You'll get 180 rounds per each single Flux. 280 rounds if super duper triggers. Less than 500 fluxes. Over 30 days. That's 17 fluxes a day. For each queen you get 5+ fluxes. Colors you don't need you probably would trade for violet flux, steel &amp; lead.       
---
Do you need more than 3 hours to kill 3 queens a day?      
---
Oh man, I lucked out too at Watoga vendor and found a BoS combat chest with weightless and AP regen. It was perfect for my Chameleon character
---
Y’all sound like a bunch of Garys.
---
I'm still glad I didn't buy this game. 
---
Yeah, it's all easily rounded down to bias. Irks me how utterly obvious the bias behidn a lot of reactions are; considering how much people on the internet talk about bias, you'd think they actually self-reflect a bit more.
---
Some people just have to learn that it's sometimes fine not to have an opinion, too, as long as you don't got actual information.
---
hey :-(
---
Apparently you can “share” serendipity like this as well.
---
The chickens will spawn in the area around you.
---
You only got yourselves to blame, each time you raise this subject there is a 60% chance a reporter will find it. Start banning posts and there is a 90% chance a reporter will find it due to someone actually telling the reporter.
---
Now if you had kept quite and not made a fuss, maybe this would never have been caught by the press, just maybe.
---
Just saying...
---
Okay, so apparently chickens just spawn all around her, took a minute of VATS spamming (they're damn hard to see) but I got 10 scoped.
---
Rewards? 250xp. That's it. No quest completion notification, just 250xp and the (Misc) quest vanished from my log.
---
I can't even find the robot now.
---
Meh.
---
Thanks. Let's see if it starts proccing next session...
---
The quest has been around since the beginning and the chickens are around the area she is spawned in.  Unfortunately  people shoot chickens.  I'm not sure if they respawn but I've been missing a couple chickens a few times trying to complete that quest. 
---
Yes and it makes sense too. Plus it also gives me hope that they have not been showing up for people only due to bad rng. Thank you for the update, appreciate it.
---
&gt;fire customers
---
I assume you mean stop selling them the product?
---
maybe make meat piles only visible for the team/individuals involved in the kill.
---
Also.  Don't kill the chickens after you tag it.  You will lose credit.  Wait till you have finished the quest.
---
Honest advice, gunsmith 3 your guns will degrade way faster than your power armour ever will. 
---
Yea, you define tool with pretty much every post of yours. 
---
Bro next time update us every half hour. 
---
Bethesda reusing old code? Wow! Who would have thought?
---
If you were just bored; then nope, everything is mostly the same. If you wanted to stock up on plans they’re pretty much all available from various merchants though, so you can deck out whatever power armor you want (besides the x01 and ultracite - still only in random mod form for x01 and plans from sbq for ultracite as far as I can tell). 
---
Lots of bugs are fixed though, so it is more enjoyable from that aspect if that was part of keeping you away. 
---
They claim a lot of new content will be released in the next few months though, so stay tuned otherwise. 
---
Oh there are people who want to play the game alright, it's just that when they do they don't want to play the game.
---
Upvote for the Mel Brooke reference! Bravo
---
Just a day or so ago they confirmed Excavator skins are coming... so... its the waiting game now.
---
&gt;  I'd love to hunt you for sport.
---
now THAT'S contempt!   lol
---
(not that I disagree, I just kinda love that)
---
i always keep power user on because i occasionally use a gatling laser and the perk also applies to the magazine size on them. i only use power patcher when repairing, and my armor pieces break so slowly without the perk that i wouldnt need it anyway
---
Yes! This happened to a friend and I as well- almost word for word. 
---
I know someone too who was a HUGE duper. And to this day his account is still active and he is playing. Complete hillshit, because I got a ban for duping, and I have  never done it before. I just fucked up and crafted way too much ammo. And they took that as me duping
---
I wonder if high horses have longer faces?
---
The ability to make a 'jaw' harp......They have em in game so the assets already exist. ***Would love to be able to carry playable instruments for a well tuned buff anywhere***
---
I’ve never heard it, I’ve run the Fallout 1 music mod since day one. 
---
ITT: We learn about "government" regulated capitalism.
---
&gt; I agree with you on the drop rate need to be increased
---
No, the drop rate doesn't need to be increased at all. I get so much trash legendary drops that I actually quit sorting through it and haven't logged in on a few toons just because I didn't want to go through their massive overweight inventory. What they need to do is go back through and remove the trash legendary affixes or buff them to be worth while. That will fix the whole problem of getting trash legendary after trash legendary.
---
That being said, a few need to be reworked. Junkies is a fun weapon if you're role playing but for all intents and purposes it's a garbage affix even though it does very good damage. Berserkers, assassins, any anti insert mob here, double, medics, nocturnal, stalkers, and even though it has potential in group play suppressors are all anywhere from bad to utter garbage. If you look at all the anti specific mob ones, that's like 1/3 the possible legendary table right there, plus the all other others I listed... that's the majority of the table all trash.
---
Fix them or delete them.
---
Fuck it, fatman his base and crap on the ashes
---
Did you really play the game for 37.5 days?! That's insane! I di need to know, what made you want to play 900 hours? 
---
If you get fix it good even as a swap in when you repair your PA it'll be 200% durability so you won't ever need power patcher. But I agree that it degrades so slowly anyway. As for power user, I've never really had too much of an issue gathering power cores, but if you don't have many frequently it could be worth it. 
---
The treasure maps should be good for you after lvl 50 they level up till 50 also plus you can use however maps you have for each spot, if you have 5 for one spot you can use them consecutively 
---
Neither are needed for power armor. Cores are easy to come by and power armor has a high durability and does not degrade at a fast pace. 
---
It really sucks, I think dense MODS still exist tho. I can’t for the life of me find combat but I have found marine and I think metal
---
I don't think anyone said mules are banned in the TOS. Did I miss something?
---
She's a random encounter, I have found her several times but never could do the quest because I never had a recon scope &amp; never bothered getting one. Spose I should just to say I have done it now.
---
Fyi to all the pvp trolls who keep down voting because they dont want people to know how important a dense mod is for all players. Think I'll make a dense mod post once a day.....eat a trolls.
---
Just saw the same 
---
It’s fun and addicting. But it depends on what you enjoy doing. 
---
There’s not really any NPCs to interact with and converse with like the other Fallouts, but it is fun to run into other players sometimes and trade with them and check out their CAMP. Most people are friendly and many play solo. 
---
The world they built is beautiful, huge and fun to explore. There is a lot to see, and it’s a really fun map to explore. Too bad there’s not more friendly in-game characters and settlements to find.
---
I enjoy it and so do a lot of other people. Exploring the map, building your CAMP, leveling up your character, doing quests and trying to get better loot will keep you busy for a long time.
---
&gt;Even if they counted it because the ammo was passed back and forth. His main account would have record of some of the regular ammo too like his second account had. His main account though only had ultracite and all the other regular ammo was on his mule account  with more ultracite.  
---
Right on man, I'm part of the club. And to the people that trash talk this game but are still subbed, find a hobby. Nobody cares what you have to say on this sub. Constructive criticisms aside, the entire purpose of a game is enjoyment. If its upsetting you, you're doing it wrong. 
---
&gt; I’d venture to say I’m in a micro minority of players who essentially have a build for each major weapon type
---
I do this too. My shotgunner is still pretty low level, but everything else is solid. This is the only reason I still play this game. It was a fun experiment for me to try and make all the "bad" weapon classes good, so I focused mainly on heavy weapons and pistol once I got my 2h toon almost perfected. 
---
I absolutely love the fallout themes, fallout 4s almost puts me in tears😂
---
I don’t man I think if any one is playing role play when they are over 12 they probly should be on a watch list lol , I just see guys who role play the same as a 50 year old guy that’s really into model trains SUS 
---
Yesssssssssssssss
---
They can, but most people don’t. And it’s easy to avoid, ignore or just switch servers if you do run into someone that’s really bothering you. Most other players are either friendly or want to be left alone also. 
---
Instead you run around and 1 shot every thing with out the need to ever farm springs or screws ? 
---
Get a job, you useless worthless pathetic freeloader leech. 
---
Id say 5.
---
One for Daytime, One for Night, One for Regular Combat, One for Nuke Runs and One for Crafting/Workshops.
---
Nah, lots of people play solo self found builds. They don't interact with others in any trading fashion. I'm one of those players, though I admit I tried to use the market to replace one of my weapons that disappeared from a bug. I couldn't find a replacement, so in that small way it affected me, but if the game hadn't bugged and lost my gun I would have never even considered trading. I know I'm not the only person who plays this game to play like this.
---
In case you're curious as to what it really is, it's the [hazard symbol for chemical weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_symbol).

what system you on and what plan are you looking for i am on xbox and have a marine dense plan to sell
---
Elderscrolls 6 or Bethesda died for me
---
Wow. Goes into so much detail about the need to improve drop rates. Totally brushes over the negative impact that duping itself causes, by their own very description.
---
I've never seen a duping apologist white so elegantly.
---
&gt; Devil's Advocate: he might have friends who have ammo they're wanting to dump. No reason for him to take it on his main and then transfer it to his mule if they're both on at the same time.
---
I'm down with this, except the hardcore part. I don't want pvp and I don't want to lose shit on dying. I just want a fresh economy full of other people who also don't want to play with the mass amount of OP stuff. Just let me transfer my toons over without any items. Let me keep my levels mutations and perks.
---
Idk man, when you work hard on a work shop and some dick comes by and wants to take it when he could just trade with you or server hop to find his own is pretty infuriating.
---
Especially when you know you can’t server hop and just let the asshole take the shop because it’ll still register as being taken from you.
---
I don’t think you deserve to get reported but this whole workshop thing is a mess. Don’t act surprised when people are mad that you’re fucking with tier progress.
---
I love these posts gloating about playin the game legit and the ones with cheaters 😂😂😂 they’re all so unnecessary and everyone’s always so salt on both sides lmfaoooo
---
Most CS people don't have more idea of what they're doing than the people calling in do. That's why they have scripts they're not supposed to deviate from.
---
Logged in it was just level 50 pump action &gt;!surpresser!&lt; prefix with explosive rounds. 
---
Please respond to 27thSunshind I’m dying to know
---
I've already had a blast with it.  Workshops are so much more fun to contest now.
---
Kudos for getting me to Google "poopsocking." Now I know.
---
Anyway, my intent isn't to comment on any specific case. Specific cases don't matter to me because specific bans are between Bethesda and the player. I'm just here to strongly agree with /u/Cyshox that these ammo counts are achievable.
---
My point is that accumulating 100k Ultracite 50cal in 30 days does not alone constitute evidence of duping. Not only could a solo player do it, a player acting as ordnance officer on a team funneling materials toward the effort, and/or using trading to get some materials, and/or using materials previously accumulated could *easily* exceed 100k in 30 days.
---
I don’t understand. I am looking for help and you’re advertising your stupidity? 
---
Bethesda responded to my support request and helped me repair my installation.
---
But thanks for your concern. Keep up the good work.
---
Welcome mat that sets the spawn in point for fast travel, just like in Fo4.

Mods disable achievements.

Different teams; in-house work cleaned up - push a years fix already.
---
I encountered a Vengeful Mothman on the cliffs east of Harper's Ferry right after the patch. I ran up to kill him, hit him once with my gun while rushing towards him... and he teleport back... off the damn cliff, and falls to his death! 
---
I thought they could fly?
---
I mean... You decided to play Fallout 76. You deserve this and much more.
---
My stance on all your rhetoric is already in my previous post, which was not really for you. It's my offering to all the reasonable people reading who may draw their own conclusions. Have fun!
---
I’ve heard it’s the anti-armor+explosive combo that breaks. Something about the explosive part breaks the AA part. But that’s just a rumor to me.
---
All of you morons arguing about playing an absolute dumpster fire of a game like fo76 is fucking hilarious. Please continue. 
---
ahh yeh thats probly what i was thinkin about
---
Yeah, I have run into her a few times, first time in B.E.T.A.
---
Haven't seen her in a while now though. Very random encounter.
---
Dude you cheated, we all know it also 900 hours? That's over 8 hours a day since launch, maybe it's a good thing you got banned. Go outside and enjoy life. 
---
Not really no, they don't heal back, it doesn't stop my weapons working, and it's not triggered by huge damage
---
Killed her lat night. There were like 10 people in the fight, all over 100. Took around 10 minutes. 4-5 melee, some rifles, some heavy (including me). Nuke was aimed so that it only touches the prime site, so no special effects for the blast zone. No lag on her loot, some lag on adds loot. 
---
I mean, let's say he had 50k ultracite ammo. He would have had to pass it between his main and alt account back and for 12 times. Even at 100k, you would have to do it 6 times (also remember that it's a full cycle, transferring the ammo to and fro.) There's just no reason to transfer all of it that many times.
---
Taking 5k ammo, in the span of 3-4 months, he transferred 5k rare ammo 120 times between accounts? I just don't see what reason anyone would have to do that. And surely the alternate account would be banned as well if it's also as inflated?
---
Seriously. It's easy to get a ton of purified water. Why can't I cook with it? Wouldn't I *want* to?
---
Fight went fine for me last night... That's on PS4 (I have a pro). We didn't fight her in the blast zone (nuke was aimed Just to touch the prime site). 
---
I might have to build a panopticon-like structure for workshop defense so I can get sightlines on all corners of the map.
---
Those flavored mentats that show enemies through walls are going to be super valuable now that people can hide literally anywhere in the workspace.
---
I have the same sometimes. Had two violent census events next to each other once. One of them was the phantom one I couldn't fast travel to (even for its unusually high travel price), the other one worked fine with regular travel price. They were literally next to each other on the map, in cranberry bog area. 
---
Are you using an exploding weapon?
---
Fallout 76 is NOT a decent game. It is capable of producing fun, but it is not decent, even after patch after patch after patch. It has many, many problems and a full priced game that continues to ask for money has zero business being released in the state it was.
---
That armor certainly doesn't look mediocre. 
---
All I'm getting these days is the game crashing to dashboard on PS4... Haven't dwa had a server disconnect or lag in a long while. Plus the game loads so much faster after the purge :) 
---
States, post is not about defending Bethesda.. entire post defends Bethesda.
---
You can use the ammo. It doesn't register how much you own but how much you got over 30days.       
---
If you count all ammo types together? I had less than 100k rounds at time of ban. But I had used approx. 120-150k .50 ammo over the past 30 days.
---
Magic 🤗 
---
Don’t you know? This is the prequel to elder scrolls.
---
YT is full of shitty channels making shitty 10 minute videos of fake fo76 "outrages" that they took from a random reddit post. Most of the time are fake, and if not, exagerated.
---
I was banned a while ago accidentally, even though i didnt play for like 2 weeks or so.
---
Put in a support ticket, it took almost a month (but i really didnt care that much about the time since i stopped playing by then already, just cared about my account because i paid literaly money of the game) and it got removed because i was accidentally flagged or something.
---
The explanation wasnt really that great but my guess was because i always ran around overencumbered with like 10k weight or something because i hated the weight economy and carry weight limit.
---
Long story short, not saying that people that claim they arent cheating and are wrongfully banned should be instantly believed, but everything should be taken with a grain of salt, because they might say the truth.
---
I'm on xb1 
---
Fallout 76 spy where are you 
---
Hope you get your account back and get well soon :)
---
Most cheaters did not get into trouble at all, only the morons did.
---
I think so too. Yesterday I get always the info I have Rad worms. I put healing stuff in. I have always rad worms. But at the effects there don't stand the rad worm effect.
---
And yes, all of my mutations work, instead of adrenalin reaction 
---
This is ridiculous, bloodied builds are op damage and you were prolly fighting either cavaliers or sentinels. Play against them, use your brain. There is a glitch though dont get me wrong, not many people use it though. Only occasional idiots.
---
sounds like you should try rust if you like basebuilding and resource competition and neighbors 
---
Wow those are awesome, and reminder me of the custom power armors that tribes wear in the classic Fallouts
---
Currently glitched. Not sure the details it's not a mutation I use.

This has been in from the beginning.

You may also get to tag fireflies.

She can be found in a number of spots where random encounters can occur. I have personally found her in 4 distinct locations.

10/10 of the people who have completed this misc 'activity' have been left with a sense of 'is this it?' upon completion and have chased the bot up and down the sandbox area interacting with her trying to find some form of closure.

Do you people actually like rewarding corporations for ruining fan favorite series by being absolutely lazy with them? Go play any new battlefield game and then play battlefield 3 again and tell me which one you honestly enjoyed more. Go play all the other fallout games and them play 76 and tell me them cutting 99% of the story making out of the game was anything besides absolulty terrible for the series New Vegas had options that mattered and speech checks and actual diverging missions based off non combat skills. All on top of a beautifully written story and dialogue. 76 feels like fallout 4 except they removed the weak attempt at a story and just opted to remake it with absolutely nothing but bare bone mechanics.

I have never seen a behemoth other than twin lakes in over 350 hours

I got banned in PUBG by battleye TWICE. Both times false-positives. Support are literal typewriters without decision power or will. After my first unban (which didn't come through support) I vanished from stats for a week - asked support and they repeated with a copy-paste that it'd be a ban.
---
I am happy a person on their community PR team cared and helped me and other fellows out. Something like that removes all motivation of buying new games.
---
Holy cow. I can’t get over the genius of “shibboleet” being the coder code word. 
---
Mine froze up 4 times in a row down in the mine by the prime fissure sight.  3 times it froze when I was in my pip boy trying to eat food and the 4th time was in the middle of the a fun fight.  It blows because every time it loads me up outside the mine, 2 scorch beasts spawn.   
---
Well I dont plan to use a gatling laser but it's good to know it works on it! Thanks
---
Thanks
---
No this is from his own posting that he thinks he was banned for passing the ammo back and forth between his two accounts.  Even if they did this because of the ammo passed between both accounts his main one would have some remnants of other ammo like his second account had but that it was listed by bethesda that his main account was banned for having exploited 140k ultracite and his second account was banned for having high amount of regular ammo plus and additional 255k of ultracite. 
---
That does look nice, but the time it took me to get the setup i have, it will do me. Good luck
---
Thank you 
---
my friend tested it at full health and at near death..no change in his weapon damage
---
I do, I just say forms since it comes in a mutation and armor
---
Omfg i went through a damn saga with this today.  Someone owned Poseidon ...and i popped in just to do the defend mission.  Well a damn mole rat somehow made its way underneath the foundation in which the CAMP owner had laid one of his turret clusters.  I tried to shoot it, immediately wanted.  So all 10 damn turrets begin laying into me.  Had to destroy the things to stay alive.  Enter 110 cap bounty. Then i bought oh maybe if i take the workshop,  i can get to that rat and wont get shot.  So now im the wanted asshole stealing a workshop... ...and the rats STILL stuck under the foundation! Managed to free it eventually to complete the mission. 
---
Next, i jump to gorge for another defend. It's owned by a lvl 27, who of course tries to attack me cos I'm wanted.  Kill him 3 times but his famn turrets are still going ham on me, making it hard to finish the mission so i become the asshole who steals gorge as well. Dumb ass glitched ass turrets still shoot me! 
---
I eventually just run off to a station and some level one fifty something makes work with me. Anyways the moral of the story is third sesh was not what i expected it to be all because of a molerat under a damn foundation. 
---
I didn't get banned, either! Do you think not having an account because my computer's not powerful enough for the game has anything to do with it?
---
I had a scenario happen last night where my head was invisible, I was wearing a pompadour wig then when I switched to the black cowboy hat and skull bandana every part of my head that should have been visible was invisible, it was kind of cool actually like the invisible guy in league for extraordinary gentleman 
---
When you exit the station try not moving right away, just hit exit and wait a few seconds.  I find that if I try moving right away, then it pits me back at the bench.
---
Thanks, I never really used power armor so I dont know how fast they degrade 
---
Kotaku invented Autism
---
Buff the laser rifle damage and durability significantly, it is a joke right now.
---
Get rid of duplicate perks and just let us choose the perk level once we max out the card.
---
Granted I guess this would mean there us a semi-hard cap when you max out every card.
---
Play the game?🤷

I can confirm that from a few hours ago that electrically charged will put you in PvP mode even if you have pacifist enabled.

Haha that's just where my camp has been for the last 2 months. The views from there are amazing!
---
That Black Rider yo...all day...

That sounds funny and doesnt disrupt your gameplay. Me? I can't aim properly as I don't see the gun....
---
I used several different weapons. Explosive, non explosive, energy. Nothing was super effective. 
---
Maybe just maybe
---
He was in power armor. No Cavs of sentinels and he still was either healing for more damage than my TSE prime 50 could deal or wouldn't take damage at all. I'm not saying bloodied isn't broken but this shit isn't ok either. 
---
Holy shit!!! You too!?!
---
Good advice, usually I’m just so excited I’ve got more shotgun shells to slay super mutants with I rush it a bit. Still this is the first time I’ve experienced where it was an endless loop so I think the new patch is effecting it. Not too big a deal tho I’ll just try to be more patient ty
---
Gamepedia has a more complete outfit list, but it's annoyingly clutterered as they seem to get their information from datamines. The Fandom wiki has better location and item descriptions, though they're still unacceptably bare. 
---
I think what's hurting progress the most is that all these sites are popping up to compete with each other, making it hard for casual editors to commit to one for submissions. I suggest you pick one and make it great, so people can flock to it.
---
Fextralife, on the other hand, seems to be the worst of the three and it keeps locking me out with annoying captcha challenges every time I visit, so stay away from them.
---
And the last one is a Tzeentch space marine? :P
---
That's not how to use the word irony .
---
&gt;Literally banned for exploiting
---
That's Irony. Or do you have any evidence he wasn't exploiting?
---
Explosive takes minimal investment to negate almost completely. If you used other damage types and he was unscathed, though, it's likely an assassin's/sentinel's armor set.
---
He was in power armor
---
No didn’t effect me, this game has some funny things when it comes to invisibility like sometimes when I’m in a team my teammates can’t see me. We went through the silo and launched a nuke and no one could see me the entire time it was kind of weird.
---
I really enjoyed walking out of the vault for the first time and having the mothman stalk me part of the way to the overseers office.  I enjoyed the main quest line, and much of the faction quests.  I love having other people in game with me.  Crafting my first silenced weapon and picking a stealth card felt good.  All of the early content was good.  I got my moneys worth, and then some.
---
But now:
---
The serum I spent several days saving up for doesn't work.
---
Two of the nicest pieces of armor I have are bugged.
---
The three star enemies I kill dont drop legendary loot.
---
The quests I pay to fast travel to disappear.
---
The only nuke I have launched crashed the server.
---
I've collected 1/3 of all SBQ drops that I have helped kill.
---
I have to log into 3 or 4 servers before my camp spot is available.
---
I lost my best ranged weapon to a laggy container during a quest.
---
I cant get SLI to work (worked fine in almost all the other gambryo games!).
---
I am not outraged, but some attention to the late game would help put the wind back in my sails.  
---
Lol. You kids and your "griefing." It's a pvp objective that creates a pvp zone, don't like it, don't take workshops. Get over it with this safe space "disrupting my experience" crap.
---
Public workshops. Xp to claim if you get the worst and more xp to defend
---
Hmm, that's interesting. It's not terribly difficult to get armor in the 700s with power armor, but you should still see the health bar move at least a bit.
---
This is caused due to conflict with mods. A fix was posted here on patch day, look for it.
---
They're slandering honest businesses for their own personal gain. 
---
i have no mods installed. 
---
Decide what kind of player you want to be. You want to be stealthy, brutish, a mixture of both? Pick your perks to what you plan to be. At level 50, it becomes a chore to change them. 
---
Weapons: ranged, melee, and a shotgun are basic necessities. Remember that these weapons can be enhanced by modifications and perks.
---
Mutations: before you get them, invest in the class freak perk and the starched gene (these perks might be level specific.
---
Scrap and bulk often. It frees up space in your stash box. 
---
Placing your CAMP: A lot of people build on the Whitesprings Resort golf course, which has a tendency to get nuked, a lot. Find a place close to the center of the map, minus Whitespring, and try to setup near water.

Was pleasantly surprised by that just a moment ago. Camo paint on T-60.   
---
Gonna go look for this fix haha
---
"it wasn't me, it was my friend" probably won't hold up. Try it anyway.
---
*Right*. It was your *friend*.
---
tried to fight her for the first time yesterday, almost 10 ppl at the fight, mostly level 100+ (me and my 2 mates being lvl 70-ish).
---
Used 800 ammo on my explosive shotgun, plus all the other ppl shooting her, she reached around 75% hp after 10 minutes and healed back.
---
At that point ppl started leaving after witnessing the dumpster-fire that it's supposed to be the most epic fight in the game.
---
You ever try shooting, recording, overdubbing and editing a video? It’s gonna take some time. They’re not just gonna drop a video the day of. 
---
Then you must have edited the ini at some point.
---
Just when I thought Bethesda couldn't screw up with FO76 any more...
---
Try dying and respawning.
---
I just had a guy come out of nowhere, kill me in 5 hits while I was adjusting sound settings in my menu, and then he disappeared after taking 38 caps from my corpse. This is the first time I've okayed since the new patch, can people just kill you that quickly without you accepting PVP now?
---
You a mad lad
---
Also, if someone were to kill my death claw/ if I were to hit it them have to kill it, will it respawn?
---
Also, if I were to want to get rid of it, how would I do so? 
---
Sorry for all the questions but you seem like the pet expert and would be helping me out greatly :)
---
i have installed the whole game yesterday without any edits, still buggy. 
---
i did edit the ini file a while ago, just to make the game render at 3840x1080p but reseted it a while ago since the rumor bethesda ban ppl editing anything in the gamefiles. maybe the config.ini is still the same after reinstall since it's in the document folder? 
---
The only other place I've seen one is at abandoned bog town, during a "defend your workshop" event.
---
Prefer the fight at twin lakes though, it's far too easy if you can just sit on a roof and shoot.
---
Are you serious? Your saying the multi million dollar company is the victim? This is Bethesda we are talking about, not some small indie dev. And how can you say they are being honest? Before the game was released, numerous spokespeople and executives stated that the items in the atom shop would be cosmetic only. They went back on their word and added in game buffs for micro transaction items.
---
A 10 minute video that uses BETA footage takes 3 weeks to make while they keep making videos every day about everything else? Right.
---
I made a post on this and it was shadow deleted. Something is fishy.
---
no only animal friend is all i use
---
Oh, didn't try that one. Will do! Thanks :) 
---
A) Oh, what time was that? I sure don't remember it. And B) if you really want to go apoplectic with pretend outrage over a big heap of nothing, be my guest; I'll save mine for actual issues. 
---
You craft the pure stuff from nuked flora, you also get random drops from sbq
---
Lol try it. Seriously I’m sitting on footage I filmed over a month ago. It just takes a lot of motivation
---
I don't care what sheep like you say. Bethesda is a good company in my book.
---
if someone kills it it will respawn next time you log in if a creature kills it it will die permently unless you log out fast enough 
---
More quests/ story line/ main quests/ DLC content
---
Paint jobs for excavator PA and weapons (guns and melee)
---
Team stash box instead having to trade every few minutes and team C.A.M.P
---
Not in my top 3 most wanted but definitely in my top 5 more dam locations or another map!
---
One of us! One of us!
---
Gubba gabba
---
and you can't do any damage to your own pet
---
Hahaha, do you really think Bethesda can handle such mechanic to develop, hahaha.
---
I just dont see how having 100% damage resist is considered balance in any sense of the word. 
---
Did you own a workshop?
---
i can even shot through without any collision, others can't see me couse i am behind the floor. very nice in pvp fights when ppl think they can hide inside their atom shop base. 
---
Increased camp budget
---
A dialogue box of some sort showing me what asshole killed me while I was adjusting audio settings so I can hunt the the fuck down
---
More frequent weapon and armor plan drops.
---
For whatever it's worth, I've been updating fandom/wikia. My latest work was the Marine armor (fallout 76) page. Will be starting the trapper one next.
---
That's the one possibly causing the issues.
---
I will say despite how ridiculous my experience getting sudafed in W.Va it was the cheapest. No wonder they have an issue with people making meth, unless it's so cheap because its formulated differently to make it harder to make meth out of. I think the people at the pharmacy just felt bad for us because when they asked if we had a prescription we just responded with an exasperated, "Are you kidding me?". Some pharmacies will just straight up tell you they don't sell it at all.
---
Kinda strange though with a state with pretty widespread drug problems to prescribe the one that doesn't prevent abuse.
---
Non combat perk point is passible
---
Infinite stash
---
Vendor and up to space for correct houssing and placing object.
---
i'll check that, thanks.
---
They clearly has enough motivation making canvas bag videos everyday. They put out new videos within hours of a new patch. This is clearly some manufactured drama. This isn't an hour long gameplay video with edits and cuts. It's a 10 minute ranting which re-states things from this reddit.
---
Junkies/bloodied utterly destroy power armor. It's literally underpowered lmao
---
Could have been an exploit. I don't think there's a way to completely reduce the damage of an attack to 0 in Power Armor.
---
Ah holy shit yeah this would be perfect!
---
I find it funny how you’re complaining about manufacturing drama. Dude have you ever seen any fucking television show ever? 
---
If you have unstable isotope or electrically charged they can cheese you. Also ya workshops allow for forced pvp anywhere on the map
---
Sheep? I’m the one not buying into what the corporation is selling. You are the one falling in line to hand over extra money. Bethesda may have use to be a good company, when they had to worry about pleasing its consumers when they released new titles. Now they release a glorified mod at the price of a triple a game and have the nerve to try to put in micro transactions to give you in game buffs. If you have played any of their other titles, you have to see that this was a cheap money grab.
---
2 of them sort of are. 
---
Might have been a glitch maybe. I also saw him just healing for more tha. I could deal back.
---
It used to respawn and you could get 2x XP.
---
Now it seems once you kill him, he disappears, his body respawns in the water and you need to loot him there. 
---
This raises some in my mind. I thought it was a rendering issue user side, but its obviously affected server side as well. That doesn't seem good? 
---
I saw a post about the same thing on the other /r and dude falls right through a atom shop floor. 
---
Imminent hot-fix I hope. I haven't actually purchased anything from the atom shop but this absolutely just de-incentivized that. 
---
They say in their post that they're a bit Rust player.
---
They did have a major leak pre-launch, maybe they tightened up their security or something, I dunno
---
Wait so to specify, I only need to use animal friend level 3 to tame a deathclaw? No need of wasteland whisperer?
---
Classic Sith.
---
I have about 2k shotguns shells. Which aren't duped. Looks like I'm fine too!!
---
That's an interesting point of view
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** doyouknoowdeway! ^(hug)
---
This guy is just trying to derail the topic with a ridiculous argument. It's a common tactic. I suggest you just ignore him, so other replies can get more visibility.
---
So the lesson is, stop playing stupid amount of time and learn how to play a guitar or learn to speak Norwegian 😎
---
Not this again.....
---
Maybe it takes 60 seconds to ask but never 60 seconds for the issue to be fixed. All in all on average I guess you’d have to wait 1-3 hours before getting anything done by a normal rep
---
as far i know, pink textures are only clientside when the system can't get the resource. i had this issue several times modding fallout 4, when a weapon etc. mod conflict with another mod the same kind.   
---
i play in a clan, and no one else had the issues. they all see me and other players just fine, only i have this bug. guess it is the fact i am the only one from our group who changed the game settings to make the game render the whole monitor instead of only the half or now with 21:9 only 2/3.   
---
the floors are the same, others can see it exept me. 
---
&gt;Got an event that gives +15 hp to a costume you can buy? pop out R*'s dick to scream about p2w.
---
this is some extreme apolygist going on.
---
I don't think anyone should feel bad for liking a game. I play a shitton of jrpgs and I can't ever mention that on most big subreddits besides nintendo because jrpgs are seen as niche/grindy/shit in alot of places. (there are heavily upvoted comments under /r/games about jrpgs being literally mobile games, I shit you not).
---
But don't you dare even pretend this isn't them testing the waters. Don't you play the apologist for bestheda of all publishers. You can enjoy the game but you can't be blind to its faults. I love cheeseburgers, I don't give a shit that its not healthy bu I am not going to pretend it's doing my arteries any favours.
---
How soon do people forget. Paid mods.
---
Just blame Bethesda for incompetent system. What a failure
---
Sure and if he did this it'd be fine. But I am pretty sure Bethesda has logs of how he gained the ammo and so it's save to assume it wasn't legit if they banned him. Even if they have troubles with the game I am sure they are able to read logs. But well, I guess we will never find out.
---
Bethesda did not deliver a complete, polished product on release, for full price. Then they dropped the price by almost half two weeks later. People absolutely have a right to complain, and anyone dismissing it is just enabling this shit to happen again with their future games. Games as a service are an excuse for devs to deliver an incomplete mess, and it **needs to stop**.
---
You cannot seriously tell me that 76 having a boatload of bugs on release, some so obvious they can't POSSIBLY have slipped through bugtesting, is an acceptable thing that needs defending. Are you seriously calling people entitled because they have the entirely legitimate complaint that the product they purchased was a buggy mess? There's no ''if you don't think it's worth what you paid, no one else should either''. I was largely in agreement with your actual post, but you really shouldn't go pretending like you're better than people because their legitimate complaints differ from how you see Bethesda. They are improving the game, for sure, and that much is good. But maybe, you know, a lot of these fixes should have been in the base game to begin with?
---
The only one coming off entitled here is you, because you're literally just dismissing and looking down on people for not sharing your opinion.
---
That doesn't really counter what I'm saying, unless he posted that his mule NEVER took items from ANY other sources but his other account. And depending on how the totalling process works, the higher totals on his mule account could simply be a side effect of doing inventory management on it.
---
Yes, it's a fun game
---
Caligula (The roman emperor that declared war on the ocean) would be proud! 
---
Lol...bullshit.
---
.
---
Its bugged. 50 other posts already expressed their frustration with it so I'm certain evrryone is having this problem. 
---
Optimistically, I'm hoping these tie in or at least hint towards some new PVE content with Raider Factions, especially as the Four Horsemen have been referenced in Fallout before.
---
Probably just skins though. A little bit elaborate for my tastes but actually pretty good compared to some of what's been on offer. The Death set looks particularly nice.
---
You still whining?
---
I literally just said I have video of the exchange. Did you stop reading ? I record all my game sessions on ps4. this will also show the person's psn id for Bethesdas perposes. It's dumb that collecting items makes someone as guilty as someone who duped.
---
Till some cunt comes along and kills said brahmin and steals your shit.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; This is a slippery slope, dude.
---
its not even "slippery" its a proven elevator. Other companies have done this sort of "toe dipping" in the past and people were even argueing "paid mods" was basically a toe-dip into what we have now.
---
When people look back and ask why the "outrage" doesnt do anything for things like lootboxes (or dlcs back then) - its because people who clearly don't care, pay for it and then it becomes normalised. Money just talks louder than a 10 min youtube video.
---
Where's the proof of exploiting then? I've read the email saying something along the "acquired item over 30 days period" line not "players in possession of bla bla", and its a freaking online game, trading and dropping items are common stuff. Bring out the proof, its your burden, not us. Ironic.
---
And between incompetent Bethesda and players? I trust players more. 
---
Yongyea has the face of an asshole. Proves accurate as I have never heard him say anything nice, ever.
---
No idea, but i would like to hear what bugthesda is going to do about it. 
---
trump says "fake news"
---
rofl at this.... You guys defending Beth... enjoy your pay to win game in a few months.
---
Bad joke. Ew
---
My guess?  Bethesda knee there would be collateral damage, but they’ll stick to their guns because of how big an issue this has been in 76.  It’s easy to not be banned - like me - and say that it’s all great.  But I know I’d have a hard time proving I didn’t do anything wrong if I did get banned — and not because I’ve done anything wrong, but because I don’t keep the kind of records I would need to prove them wrong if they had banned me.  Proving a negative is rather tricky....
---
You should have known 100k Nuka Colas were duped to begin with.
---
Nope
---
Then dont defend Bethesda?
---
That I understand. What bothers me is that there the shitfest around this one dude has flooded the front page again, with all the selfrighteous ''remember, cheaters are often liars'' and ''if you ask me, dupers should be rightfully banned; bye bye!'' circlejerk. A couple weeks back, there were still actual valid complains about the state of the game, but this sub's front page just keeps relapsing to ''i've played this game for two hours and i love it!'' and ''DAE think everyone else is trying to bash the game to ruin it for us?''. It's such an extreme us-vs-them mentality that it feels like people completely ignoring how hard they've been fucked by this release. Bethesda has lied and scammed people with their collectors' editions, fucked over people who bought the game at full price on release just about two weeks after the fact, the list goes on. Yes, it's shady that media are defending a story that is at best, unlikely to be legit. But if you ask me, people defending Bethesda with the avalanche of fuckups they've had lately is just baffling.
---
Current state of this sub is that a majority of controversial opinions and valid complaints are immediately downvoted while positivity and ''dupers are the scum of the earth''! circlejerk goes right to the front page. I understand that there are people who have hope for this game, and following the last patch/duper rollback and the total absence of disconnects I've had since then, I do too- but it really does feel like the sub at times shifts towards totally ignoring warranted complaints in favor of positivity.
---
To make pure/stable flux you'll need harden mass glowing mass and high radiation fluids and a chemistry set. Id suggest to have the salted perk and green thumb perk on while gathering. And when you go to make your stable flux have super duper and chemist perks equiped might get lucky and make extra! Good luck
---
Console copies are not selling well as the game performs worst on PS4. Retailers find no value in keeping around copies on the shelf eating up space.
---
Dude this Is my first fallout game and I didn't know their value. Also apart from anything else. The suspension is due to a tos violation. There's nothing in terms of service about picking up items 
---

There should be two links there, one to an Excel Sheet, and one to a Google Sheet. Are both links showing as removed? If so, here's the link to them. I don't see the [removed] tag on the links.

I've never heard anyone tell me just the links were listed as removed.

Okay so you don't have any proof then.

I'm fine with Raiders as long as they know when to stop and don't just keep killing you for sport. 
---
But as a Brother of Steel, we will destroy you! ;)
---
thanks, never heard of it
---
Nah, blame Bethesda for incompetent system
---
Well he posted a guide to how he supposedly did all this and accumulated everything never once saying anything about getting ammo from friends or anything else just stating he passed is ammo back and forth. Also will add he was trying to say he got banned when the ban wave that just happened hit and he just got caught up in that by error but it was found out he wrote the guide after being banned and posted the guide at least a day before the ban wave he was supposedly banned by. There are way to many inconsistency with what he says to really belive what he says is factual. He even admitted to using a macro for harvesting to make it produce extra items that it should not. Ironically it is almost the same way to dup items too. 
---
You are just as wrong as they are. Acting like you have solid proof. Posts like this are idiotic but alas, do your witch hunt without proof of anything.
---
Can blame them for making a bad game. Can't place that on someone getting caught duping and being banned. 
---
This sub is the_donald of video games right now bro. they’re all convinced Bethesda can do no wrong and continue eating up shit with a smile. Bethesda’s not gonna unban you because they already got your money and they have no reason to care about you now. 
---
No don’t give a company money for an unfinished product. Only encourages more of the same down the line. 
---
Do the story line and any side quests and as stated before workshops as well plus you get a lot of different plans and stimpacks /radaway so win win! Team up with people ask them to share the inspirational perk ( if you dont have it). Killing big creatures( scorchbeasts, behemoths, mirelerk queens, etc) good luck
---
If I'm banned with no TOS violation and they don't deal with this I'm in my rights to take back my money as an eu member;-) I don't want to and won't do this though 
---
I say it would be better if the brahmin gave access to your stash so that you don't have to travel or carry just to trade
---
Thanks. I see it too. I will ask a moderator why was removed. In the meantime, here are the links 
---
Seriously this subs gotten so sad. “So what if it’s pay2win it’s such a minuscule buff” 
---
It’s still fucking pay2win why the fuck are people defending this garbage game still how much of Bethesda’s diarrhea are you gonna swallow 
---
I'm not making a claim that he was exploiting, you are. The burden of proof is on you.
---
Aquired over 30 days, not 100k stacks in inventory
---
Best tip is to learn how to file for a refund tbh. 
---
I've paid full price and played over 100 hours and still enjoy it..you cheapskate 
---
I am ought to believe what I see. As I was younger I liked to dream about unreleased games or games in progress. Nowadays that is a really bad approach, cause the gaming industry does not care about consumer satisfaction.
---
Even if all those patching would be flawless and Bethesda had no technical issues, the game would be still in big trouble. Fallout 76 gamedesign choices themselves do not work well with being a multiplayer. 
---
At this point it would be not cost efficient to invest ressources into the game. Bethesda would have to break and rebuild it from scratch. But giving the state they released FO76 in the first place, they never showed the intention to make this a quality product. So why would they know? The game is parked at a branch for maintenance. Oh, they will try to make improvements. But it cannot overhaul the beautiful mess in its core.
---
Keep dreaming a bit longer about a future version of the game. It has merit and enjoyment in itself. But you might have to come around at some point eventually.
---
Sounds like a new tag on pornhub.
---
No. It does not say "over" 30 days. When purging the dupes, they clearly wrote that they are checking for large stacks.
---
Canvas bags totally Bethesda fault.
---
I'm lvl 163 and I've repaired my PA armor ONCE (every part to get 200% durability with right perk) - it degrades veeeeeery slowly. Which is logical lore-wise - you should be walking tank while in it...
---
What fake news?
---
I have no idea... Sadly I care less and less by the day.
---
At this point everyone should just stop playing this pos game and let these apologists play to their heart's content and buy everything beth feeds them.

The opening of the video is: "Bethesda adds non-cosmetic items to the store".

---
Obvious troll.
---
is adrebal broken? i havent noticed
---
Many thanks for this. :)
---
Why do you feel annoying? You are pointing out a major problem with the game. If anyone finds that annoying then the problem is with them and not you.
---
And one last question, do you need a certain charisma to tame higher level deathclaws or deathclaws in general? Or you just need the perks?
---
I may be in the minority here, but why ban them in the first place? If you really want to teach them a lesson, put all the cheaters together in one "prison" server permanently. Let them matchmake only with other dupers and cheaters. See how long they find it fun then.
---
Cheers mate, good info. 
---
It isn't, since he was already banned and you even stated why in your own comment just now. Now you have to provide proof as to why that that somehow doesn't count.
---
So.... if I dupe 50 million tses and let my mule pick them up as I am recording the whole procedure, I should be able to get away fine, right?
---
i have tried with 15 charisma and that lvl 21 was still the biggest deathclaw i could tame 
---
The most realistic looking exterior of a Fo76 CAMP l've seen. 
---
The green sheet bed, variant 5/5, is the vault tec bed 2. Available at white springs and it now works as of patch 6
---
Who me? I'm serious ...love the game if you can't spend 5 dollars then go play Minecraft 
---
This and when you do this with super duper, buff your Luck with food and chems.
---
Best place for violet is after fighting the sbq; pick all the ferns(check around little patches of trees) and the pitcher plants. 
---
It would be useful I usually just follow them and drop it and then shoot the ground near the bag multiple times to get their attention! But an emote button would be way more effective as I love giving away stuff especially plans and cool melee weapons 
---
What advantage does having 500k ammo give you over having 50k?
---
Whatever you think of the 900 hour guy, this was some amazing sea lioning I just read here.

Every responder bot sells the barn and warehouse "kit". You have to buy the doors separate but it comes with the walls and floors. I've never seen them NOT have them.
---
&gt; karma
---
I'd say "popularity" and maybe a bit of satisfaction in the ability to create a bit of a storm (at least in gaming this week).
---
Karma, is largely useless....except for talking in controversial subreddits like the starcitizen subreddit. If you have low karma in those subreddits, you are labelled a troll. 
---
There's a difference. These are things that can be proven. The person who traded me these items was under a different psn account in a different country with a different IP address and console uid. There for not in the same location as me. Secondly The character was deleted so the items no longer exist. This is also on video. My point is they can't prove who knew they were doing something they shouldn't or who did. So unless they can somehow prove that then no TOS violation has occoured
---
I've got densed CA + fireproof perk and now I don't afraid to use explosive weapons anymore. Just curious, which vendor should I look for those plans?

I would like a, "let's do a nuke?" Type emoji.

I REALLY don't understand this rhetoric. What youtubers act like this? Why is everyone so upset about people not liking this game?   
---
I enjoy it. It infuriates me sometimes, as does Bethesda, but I've been playing the game for over 500 hours now, and I don't plan on stopping. But seriously, what the fuck is wrong with US, as a community, when we can't come even remotely close to accepting the idea that another opinion might exist? 
---
Did I? 
---
For food it's very common, but for ammo I also noticed it trigger much less frequently than before.
---
Ah! Gary!
---
Honestly I don’t have much of an opinion on him just wanted to stop the misinformation about how easy it is to craft/loot this ammo. Instead all I got were a bunch of people who refused to acknowledge my arguments, it’s all good tho I guess I should know what to expect on reddit lol
---
Don't fuck with mother nature. 
---
The ban isn't proof of anything. In fact the ban email does't even prove anything it just states the ammo that they claim has caused the ban. When someone is acting as judge, jury and executioner their decision on a matter isn't proof of anything.
---
So back to my point, you're claiming Jim is defending someone without any actual evidence while you yourself are branding them an exploiter without seeing any evidence yourself.
---
Xbox...
---
I'm speculating.
---
Pls read op post again. I dont want to call you an idiot
---
The part that gets me is... Did Radworms turn us Undead while it was "bugged"? 
---
Much less then members of this forum(very few left, very poor game
---
) SAD!
---
Follow high level players around (whitespring is best). Shoot what they shoot.

MY OPINION = FACT

YOUR OPINION = OPINION

Nice here, love it.

Can't charge atoms points for that though, or maybe you could.
---
Could see it getting abused though.
---
Read the op post carefully will ya? You're not an idiot
---
What kind of melee /shotgun/ gatling are you looking for? I'll be launching a nuke tmr on whitespings then sbq so I might come across some thing good 
---
Unless its Psychobuff.... do lots of Psychobuff.
---
My wife &amp; I play together (well over 500hrs each) and enjoy this game.  But I'm on the flip side of this discussion, we put our camps away from each other to help utilize the free fast travel. If there ever is a future DLC that gives a benefit to building next door to each other, we might take that step. 
---
You can blame social norms for that. To go all Vsauce on you, it's in our human nature to feel sympathetic for the little guy, so we have a strong bias towards believing their case of pity rather than meet them with skepticism. 
---
Read the op post again? I rather blame Bethesda incompetence
---
Sounds like something a duper would say ::eyes suspiciously::
---
If F76 was made actually by someone who had experience with online games, this how you would look and this would been f#cking cool. Because then you would not find PA at each corner, you would have to use different pieces for full set until you actually find all pieces from one set. If you look to other online games, wearing different pieces of sets is totally common, because it takes time and dedication to get full set.
---
So the ban and the reason stated for the ban aren't evidence for the ban? Okay buddy sure. You get back to me when you find some actual proof he wasn't cheating, instead of just saying "Bethesda bad so he must be innocent".
---
Snitch 
---
im not frustrated, i think it's funny. Honestly without some of these features Bugthesda implements, I don't think I'd be having as much fun.
---
Acquired over 30 days....pls think more
---
::opens up trenchcoat:: Hey Buddy you wanna buy an ivory pistol plan?
---
I've literally played induce. Kept getting banker by the same couple of higher level players before I could even finish the full tutorial. Just said fuck it after that. 
---
Really ? You are defending dupers now ?
---
solid math and reasoning
---
\- more perk cards slots (at least for passive ones, like lockpicking, etc) or good perk cards set manager - so I can change cards with one click when back in camp to repair stuff/craft ammo etc. and the with one click go back to my "battle" set.
---
\-  Two-Shot weapons reinstated to former glory
---
\-  Fix the broken challenges
---
\- open the god damned Vaults with nice quests/events.
---
My father was a Radtoad and my mother was a Vertibot.
---
Did Bethesda actually say they are checking to see if this was intended 😂 
---
I am not sure about the judiciary, but I believe in innocence until proven guilty. And I simply do not trust, that whatever algorithm Bethesda is using can account for every legitimate situation in the game.
---
Yeah, and you don't have the proof then. I dont trust both nor do i blame both. Yet here you are "hur dur he's cheating"
---
Did you kill legendaries just before encountering this ghoul in that area? The game sometimes doesn't drop legendary loot for a legendary and the next spawn will have it instead.
---
I have an abundance of screws and other materials psn is gofukyurslf326 no not a joke actual psn send me a message saying your from reddit we'll make some deals
---
Yeah, and you don't have the proof either. I dont trust both nor do i blame both without any proof. Yet here you are "hur dur he's cheating cuz he got banned by daddy Bethesda who can't do no wrong"
---
Smh
---
Some traders probably had a lot of duped items too.  It was really obvious from looking in those trading subs.  If they were clearly duping weapons, why wouldn't they also dupe 100k of their favorite ammo/ultracite ammo, bobble heads, nuke cola, first aid, etc?
---
I'm here reeling from your fish puns after waking up and reading this in bed sideways, water way to wake up, reading this baloney, I mean honestly, baiting for responses much ? =) =)
---
So if i get 2 pcs and login one of the accounts using a vpn, is that gonna guarantee me safe duping? I'm not trying to fuck around with you I'm just stating that it can be abused to hell in the wrong hands
---
He even posted the email ...
---
Stop reaching. That pic is about as pro vax as you can possibly get, as is the guys twitter feed.
---
Hate him for making an article devoid of facts, not for some BS untrue attack on his personal beliefs. 
---
Shit wont happen if they made competent code that can track when and where players acquired items. Nah, they can't. Only gross sum of total item acquired over 30 days. Still not Bethesda fault?
---
Maybe? Im waiting for Beth answer to this problem now
---
&gt;Yeah, and you don't have the proof either.
---
Except I do. It was even in your own comment remember? But then you started crying about that proof not mattering.
---
I love reading most of those stories from people who got banned. How they're denying how they've never cheated, and then after some comments they admit some "friend" traded them cheated materials. But they didn't know of course! How could you possibly know there's maybe something little bit weird about it.
---
I want to try and give you a different perspective.
---
We are on Reddit here. Posts that contribute positively to the community should get upvotes. Posts that do not should get downvotes. This is how it's intended and this should apply to misinformation/yongtea's videos.
---
Moderators are here to enforce the rules. If a post breaks the rules, it should be removed. If it doesn't, it should not be removed, even if it's misinformation. 
---
However, one of the rules is 'no witch hunting'. If you link to  a post (especially if no one would see it anyways, because it got down voted into oblivion) it could be interpreted by a moderator as witch hunting.
---
I know this can be frustrating, but that is how it is.
---
I always find it mind numbing to try and take in all the changes and work out what's relevant for the average Joe.
---
Anyone mind TL;DRing the changes? Is it mostly just a quiet nerf to adrenal reaction, no fix to scrap all and that's it?
---
Well consider we have no idea how they came by the formula which they used to ban him we can't say if they tracked it or not. We just know he was banned for exploiting all that stuff.

Actually if they really wanted to they could check the PSN of the other user and see they are unrelated. Apart from. That they cannot prove they are the same person as much as they cannot disprove it so they should do nothing Until they can 
---
What they should do is do what other games have done and proven to work- remove the ridiculous humongous loot pool from SBQ, make her deadly and give her loot pool of 10-20 items. Idea is that she wont be a thing that every idiot can do, but those who can, get actually rewarded. 
---
Well, if new content is coming f#ck the SBQ, let her stay garbage, but if new content is similar to SBQ...f#ck them
---
Like your idea. Sharing is caring and a giftewrapped  legendary is true love.. 
---
Melee isn't overpowered.
---
it worked perfectly fine for me yesterday. topped off my HP when not fighting
---
That's on consoles I'm talking about PCs here. People dupe on PCs too you know
---
Nah, fuck em
---
lol, place to farm Atoms nothing more. How many of you actually know how to write proper test report? When running to problem of opening door, 10 out of 10 would write into report- "I can't open the door"
---
or you know make it so that the brahmin can't be looted or doesn't drop loot.
---
I was killed in Gamdon Park by an invincible monster I just bout 2 things of bulk adhesives and a plan I can't remember is was like 70 coins. I tried to repawn at the location after 15 mins I had to close the application and log back in and lost everything I had such a load of bs.
---
Hi, im here for the bethesda ban. I would like to get one please.
---
There is stuff in ToS about exploits, which you participated in. It's okay to be upset though.
---
I tested this out with Adrenal Reaction and starving but w/o a Bloodied weapon.  My weapon damage stayed the same from Well Fed through Starving.  I think it's an interaction with Bloodied that Starving is buffing.  Will have to test it again with Bloodied tomorrow.
---
I played maybe 200 hours or so before I stopped because there was nothing to do and to many glitches but I did have fun while playing I don;t think it was worth 60 bucks that I paid when it launched though.  I still have faith it will be fixed later down the road and I might start playing again then. 
---
Just a quick check: is this thread still up? Just got a notification about a comment on a deleted thread and can't tell which thread it was.
---
How about a daily quest where a known-duper is dropped into the game to be hunted. The reward, for whomever gets the kill, would be the duper's head mounted on a plaque that one could place on a wall in their CAMP. 
---
Picking up items or accepting items in a trade are normal In game actions. They cannot prove a party to that trade knew of any wrongdoing. That's like buying a teddy  off Amazon and getting arrested because it contained stolen diamonds and you are the one who received it 
---
No as I've said, by itself it's not proof of anything. Also I've said no such thing please don't put word in my mouth. You seem to the the only person choking to defend anyone.
---
I get booted out a few times. But definitely a HUGE improvement. 
---
I’m pretty sure everyone grew up with magazines, newspapers and radio broadcasts.
---
Just try playing it. Usually works for me. Saves on typing.
---
I kept tweet at Bethesda support, but they never respond - either a sign of not caring or just not even wanting to waste time on an issue they cannot fix.  
---
The only thing I can think of would be a different RAM kit, but my RAM is Samsung-B die 3200 CL14 - if that's not fast enough for their game engine, idk what would be, and I am not gonna waste $300-400 on RAM for an unoptimized game. I just won't.
---
&gt;It was actually not a 11th hour but a 12th because he posted his alibi before the actual ban wave happened.  He was banned before the ban wave actually happened and tried to play it off but he even said he wrote the guide after he was banned and the guide was posted at least a day before the ban wave happened
---
How do you make it disappear? Does it re appear after a certain amount of time or can you toggle it on and off like a light?
---
wait you got banned for no reason? 
---
Well I cheated and I'm still not banned. So not sure at all what you're so proud of 😉
---
yeah lol 15 health is really miniscule, its just for shits n giggles imo. Even with all 4 group members wearing the costume it's just +60 health. My sniper character still get one shotted by deathclaw lv 91, so... I don't think +15 health will make any difference in terms of PVE or PVP.
---
Lolz
---
I think that lower level players can have some utility but it should be beyond just XP farming with tagging weapons that do little else like the Tesla. 
---
They can help keep the other enemies at bay to allow the heavy hitters to focus their attention onto the queen, at the bare minimum as cannon fodder but people under 50 can still prove useful with PA and a decent melee weapon at dealing with the scorched and smaller creatures.
---
I do agree some balancing can be done but it shouldn't be at the exclusion of other player's participation.
---
It doesn't really take popular youtubers for people to decide to hate something. And you know what? Bethesda totally deserves it for this train wreck of a game. There is very little effort put into this game, you can see that with the patch notes, you can see that with their lack of communication and you can see that with how very obvious key features and QoL updates are done by modders instead of the developers. You can see that with the repeated use of this god awful twenty year old engine, and you can see that in the sheer lack of content without anyone needing to point your eyes towards those things.  
---
Do you still like the game? That's cool, no one is saying you need to jump on the hate train, but don't think that train was assembled by a few select popular voices alone. If people didn't like what they were hearing or identify with it they wouldn't hop aboard.   
---
Yes the outrage machine is real, it does exist to make money, but if those same personalities were to instead promote a shit game instead of tearing it apart that outrage machine would target them for being full of shit instead. They are only saying the obvious popular opinions most would come to on their own.  
---
That'd make for a pretty good horror movie. Bedridden with only a PS4 to pass the time with, and when you pop the drawer all you have is 5 copies of Fallout 76. 
---
This thread is still up, yeah. You can check if your own posts have been shadow deleted by opening them in a different browser that doesn't have your reddit account logged in.

---
900 fucking hours mate.
---
I see. Thanks. 
---
Yes I am so disappointed. I have banned myself from playing the game until there is something new to do :(
---
I'm Brian and so's my wife
---
Im lost, what part of the Unstoppables being pay to have buffs is fake news? It happened weeks ago
---
But that's the thing, they don't, i have not seen one person below level 50 to actually be of use in nuke zones. I really wouldn't care if they were helping. That would be awesome, but they don't more than most sit in a house, tag the queen a few times and hide.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias
---
Who is this "No one" you speak of?
---
If they are gonna be barn and gully dwellers fuckem into the dirt imo. All they do is waste the resources and ammo you have grinded for to make the sbq fight happen
---
* Optimize the game for AMD Ryzen so the game stops freezing. (for the love of all thing holy...)
---
* Release paints for Excavator and Ultracite power armor.
---
* Additional high level bosses to fight, aside from the Queen (e.g. Grafton Monster, Mothman, a Liberty Prime clone, etc)
---
Wait you can do that. Sweet, im going to cheat in a load of stuff and give it out for free to get people banned. Thanks Bethesda!
---
I've seen a few. Not a lot but a few that genuinely want to try. Probably as a member of a team with their friends.
---
I've also seen plenty of 100+ plus people do little more than legendary tagging. They care more about maximising legendary loot and XP than contributing to and completing the quest.
---
Goes both ways. Level isn't the determining factor in my eyes but, as you mentioned, there can be something done in terms of balance.
---
Not everyone with a left hand has a right hand. Not everyone with a pencil has an eraser. 
---
When I was playing this I got this all the time. It drove me nuts there was always at least 1 think I had left to kill and it would always be underground
---
True. It should be that once you claim it by wearing it, no one can steal it unless you take it apart and drop the pieces or sell them. I would like to display mine too. 
---
Doesn't happen too often tbh
---
More than most its lower level players. If you were to make a server with 75+ level players you'd see a significant difference. 
---
If y’all “nerf” anything else I will stop buying Atoms each month.  Y’all have time to “nerf” the safe in the Watoga Mayor’s office but no time to buff energy weapons.  Fire that one one guy who lives to “balance the game.”   He deserves to be sleeping under a piece of cardboard on Sixth Street.  
---
Thank you so much, i live to build lol
---
What a shitshow. From a "system" point of view, they probably - perma banned- you. Knowing how stupid those thing come, the ban might include irreversible deletion of everything. I never played FO76, just watched the gameplays but you just gave me another reason not to play. Also, coming from Customer Support myself, they are probably having a freaking laugh at your case. Sometimes company policies are stupid, and your case sounds just like that. 
---
Yeah, I’m nearing 700 hours and enjoying every minute of it.
---
Do you have trouble building so high up when you fast travel? 
---
True, idk there’s just a lot of people who hate on the game for no reason but sometimes people especially on reddit confuse hate for constructive criticism. The only way the game will get better is if we bring the issues up so you’re right I shouldn’t feel bad about doing that. Good pep talk coach, put me in I’m ready to play!
---
So you saying are banned? Or is this some badly written joke? 
---
The 3rd server I was on today crashed out on me. Also, I am still experiencing client freezes on PC - after force closing the game a 3rd time today, I gave up on playing.
---
The video claims the Unstoppables outfit is "non-cosmetic".
---
Also, it was a fucking weekly event that you could hve with in game items as well. Pay to buff, pfft.
---
I know that feel! Aaahh... Like sitting in the spring sun, right after brunch on a saturday, knowing you are free to do nothing the whole weekend.
---
I put an apartment above the little snack hut on one of the greens at white springs.  
---
Neat location anyone might want to check out is those monorail sections way up still on a track.  The bubble goes straight up.  I messed around with one but didn't like the lack of headroom.
---
I'm with you on it - I'm 163 and didn't joined SBQ fights until 100+ because I didn't want to be burden for those who contribute to fight. Last night someone started the nuke and when I fast traveled to V9 there were already 3 guys below 40 lvl. Those leechers didn't contribute to fight but were first to claim the reward...
---
I think the best will be some kind damage filter - if you didn't make xxxx amount of damage to queen you won't get any reward. Level only restriction is not always fair - you can have all required perks and get good gear beeing lvl 50, but can contribute to fight. Or let the nuke-owner decide who can participate - prolong the timer to 3 mins and within that time make blast zone inaccessible to anyone outside of those, who will be accepted by nuker.
---
Agreed. Go get em tiger! 
---
People without jobs or lives. 
---
 bought 2x PA editions full price, played for abou 300 hrs in 2 months, and still I feel like I just started the game and there's hundreds of hrs ahead for me... I absolutely love it
---
Really cool.
---
&gt; I'm just linking to it.
---
See, I am not fully disagreeing with you, but there will be people that do. 
---
The witch hunting rule is vague and you are usually at the mercy of the mods here. Here is an older entry I found while searching for it on Google:
---
`People can easily decide someone is "the bad guy" for whatever reason and harass the hell out of him. Then others join in the harassment as if it's cool. This is witch-hunting and it isn't allowed.`
---
Mods could interpret you linking a post in this manner as, "Look, another one of those. (Go down vote it)" I.e. a call for Reddit justice. 
---
&gt;No spreading rumors
---
Honestly, I am not going to watch a youngyea video (I don't want to lose brain cells), but is there any rumour in there? It's about the health boost, from the Unspoppables, isn't it? If you really squint your eyes and perform the most lawyerly hair splitting, it could be considered [^pay-to-win](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction) . An uncharitable reading of the situation is not a rumour, stupid yes, but not a rumour.

Youre a wimp gamer then and no fun at all. Guess what, this isnt real life and morally objective behavior in video games does not cross into the consequences of your reality. Cheat away, kill npc’s, murder innocent bystanders, duping, etc... doesnt have any effect on anything outside of the video game. You win no awards for being a nice guy in video games. I see you think it makes you special though. I say BORING
---
Holy shit! Now THIS is the good stuff.
---
Are you guys hiring for QA assistance/testing? This is becoming quite asinine!!  There are startups that more accurately predict their evolution than you, an established AAA company with funding that most would give everything for, seems to struggle with basic concepts of communication. *** your engine works but needs a ground up redesign for it to compete with other titles....***
---
Misleading title and post. 
---
His first statement is "Bethesda is selling non-cosmetic items in the store." Do you really need to squint a lot to see what's wrong with that sentence? 
---
Unless the employee decided to bait and switch a collectors edition item, add a restrictive stash limit because of game architecture, destroy server stability, add a million bugs, not properly balance how damage and armor rating works making half of the weapons useless, cause quests to not carry over between worlds, crash the server on launching nukes and not even allow a rejoin, put in several dupe methods and an exp/cap farm glitch make it so they could not be fixed for months, design the game around a legendary lottery for a broken OP weapon combo, add a wonky level scaling system that causes high level mobs to spawn in and wreck you because someone ran by, and on and on and on...
---
Then yeah, probably not.
---
I think so too lol. Like Bethesda is testing what works and otherwise, so they could implement it on the next Fallout. 
---
Even in the current version of the game, I am one shotted by people with those TSE (two-shot explosive) guns. Even with passive on. It's extremely unbalanced in favor of people who log on solely to grief. Definitely an issue that needs to be addressed.
---
LOL SUCH TRASH
---
Whatever you say, the proof isn't proof because you said it isn't. Just like I said you'll say.
---
Like I said, not going to watch it, not going to waste my time 😂
---
Wise choice.
---
&gt; [...] and with all the creatures dying all over the map this has to be pretty taxing.
---
It really shouldn't. I'm not sure how they managed to mess up loot drops and loading enemies this badly. 
---
When the game needs a minute to load enemies when corpses are around in Whitesprings, it's not normal.
---
When the SBQ dies and people flock around the corpse for a minute for the loot to load properly, it's not normal.
---
While it is a different genre, take Path of Exile as an example, where 100 enemies on screen can die in less than a second, leave a corpse and fill the whole screen with loot seperately for a whole party. Stable, I might add.
---
So no, this shouldn't be taxing at all and just speaks volumes about the QA process involved.
---
True, but i didn't have anything great at level 50. My gear and weapons even with constant cap, junk, weapon, armor and perk grinding i didn't really do a SBQ event until level 80. I really like the damage done idea, but what if you play support? I use shotguns to cripple the queen then use a cryolator while she's down so she can't do much damage to other players. I wouldn't ever get the damage done pass. So it would have to go by how many tags you got on the queen maybe? 
---
I don't think there is etiquette in a post apocalyptic multiplayer only game where most of the storyline involved have to do with people preying on others for their own gain. 
---
Broken on purpose w/o notifying the player base.
---
This game is a joke.
---
If there was an intentional change made to it and it went bad, that means it was a stealth nerf. I have been defending you guys saying you wouldn’t do that. Some clarification would be nice.
---
Ditto! Tried two fights yesterday, we list both. The enemy spawns were INSANE. (At one point we had two Mirelurk Queens, three Wendigos in a little gang, etc) 
---
And her health just didn’t move.
---
Aaah right...haven't watched the video just seen the 'Fallout'
---
See what I did there :D
---
Who gives a bunt if it was only up for an hour, Bethesda clearly said that they wouldn't make any items that you can purchase give any one person an advantage over someone who didn't purchase anything. 
---
With regards to the fact you could use the mistress of mysteries outfit...If I'm only level 5 it's likely I haven't completed that questions, but I have a good credit card. I can pay to have a buff over others who haven't completed the quest either.....therefore it is, in some cases, pay to buff :)
---
Post like this really question Bestheda's laziness when this isn't their first rodeo in the mmo landscape (hello ESO).
---
What op listed is literally the bare minimum for such events and is absolutely right on the implementation. What suprises me is how this got past testing. 
---
Find a hobby and get off reddit before it's too late. Unban yourself from intelligence.
---
If you got banned they have done you a favour tbh 😅
---
Alright Lance Armstrong, go get your Tour de France
---
It works both ways guys,I’m only lvl 24 but after hours grinding for ammo etc and porting to continue the main quest I find a lvl 100+ ports in and 3 lvl 80 scorch beasts spawn and pick on the little guy,in the final throws of death I notice the lvl 100+ player complete with shiny yellow pa sniggering in the corner,licking my wounds I ported,I’m not complaining I just love this awesome game!!!!!

---
So it's not just me... Yeah something has changed,  plus my SBQ got stuck and about 75% health and became immune. Everybody left
---
Fuck these devs &amp; their sneaky nerfs.  
---
This game deserves all the hate it deserves &amp; gets.
---
&gt; That would be awesome, but they don't more than most sit in a house, tag the queen a few times and hide.
---
this is going to really suck but anyone who plays mmos knows this can happen and builds assurances against this. The most common approach is usually loot by contribution (so the low level player gets scraps).
---
Whats shocking is bestheda went the complete opposite and having low level players actually can screw over the higher level players like you say. wtf
---
I duped items cause I saw a video on youtube. I never even once considered it cheating because im not competing against anyone. I di t even feel even remotely bad for it. It is a single player co-op game to me. Who the fuck am I cheating and why should I feel bad? The game allowed me to press a few buttons and voila, there were now more items. Its bethesdas fault that this was an aspect of their game. Hialrious that its cheating to you nerds though. Hell fallout 4 friggin emplores you to cheat with all the mod supports. All fallout games are item collecting games. Duping is just items. Not fucking cheating you bro. Get a grip. 
---
Level 60, now? Someone the other day stated level 50, so the desired lvl is getting higher.... Someone even wrote once that after 50 people were max level, so much for that fun fact. 👀

Vehicular deaths amount to more actual player deaths than player to player combat kills. We need a " watch out for that car !" Emote.

---
Don't know how many thousands of hrs I accumulated on the Fallout series. Maybe too much :D. But I can't stop playing...
---
Dude. Half the weapons don’t work and are not viable because of a bad damage/armor system.
---
This could not have possibly made it through any kind of QA. It’s a straight up non functioning design.
---
I’m not trying to say you can’t enjoy it or have to care about that - or the other flaws, but you have to acknowledge they exist and that it’s pretty reasonable for people to be really upset about it.
---
What’s decent or good is subjective, what’s up to current, general standards and functions internally kind f isn’t.
---
yes daddy
---
You didn't cheat, you duped. Dont let these nerds tell you otherwise. Who do you think you cheated? Unless you are just a pvp douche then I get it. But this is 99% a solo or co-op game. There is no one to cheat.  
---
So what grand thing can you accomplish at level 5 with 15 extra health?
---
You 're right about pcs but my point is still valid. They cannot prove if a player knew an item picked up or traded for broke rules. If they tracked an items source then there would be no issues
---
You sir, are level 50 legendary PSA. Thank you!
---
true, it's difficult to filter leechers - every method mentioned in author's topic have its flaws, but it should be definitely done something because too many times people feel disappointment and feels they're wasting time prepping nukes.
---
 Y,uy
---
It's Bethesda, even in their really good games they break stuff when they try to fix it. I loved Fallout 4 despite its flaws and would constantly find something wrong. My character spent 2 weeks as an immortal man thanks to the Radio quest
---
100k nuka cola bottles = 100,000 lbs

\*insert sceptical hippo face\*
---
Almost as good as getting ghouls at Mt.Thunder. 99% chance they’ll spawn under the concrete towards the cooling tower &amp; you’ll have to fast travel away and come back, by the time they’ve respawned and destroyed your entire workshop.
---
That is so completely besides the point....the issue is one thing was stated and another has happened. 
---
Thor real, man.
---
What are you sceptical about ?
---
Says the one actively perpetuating the lie. Well done. 
---
You activate it and it does an animation, lasts about 8 seconds then it’s back again. Definitely worth it imo
---
No. They promised only cosmetic items. The Unstoppables outfits ARE cosmetic. The outfits themselves are nothing but that. They don't sell a single non-cosmetic item in the store.
---
That's pretty cool! thanks for the info!
---
From your nickname it appears you're around 30 years old. You're a big boy now - figure it out.
---
Ah there's that Complete Transparency they promised with their patches.
---
Not like they earned all that money to begin with. This wasn't even suppose to be released this soon at least as a full game.
---
They were suppose to be updating the game, fixing bugs and making new content w/o money from players and w/o players in the game.
---
It's not misinformation if it's true though
---
It cost $60 and BSG wouldn’t refund it. Not everyone can just shrug off sixty bucks. 
---
I’ll gladly shut up and move on for a refund for the game and apology for rushing out this mess. 
---
Half of my yearly game budget for 3 days of buggy, unstable game play before I finally gave in and stopped, is fucked and the only hope I didn’t burn that money is if BSG actually fixes the game - which yeah, I’ll keep squeaking until it gets the grease.
---
No one can explain how duping in a single player/co-op pve game is cheating. Its not. I mean who cares if someone has 300k ammo of something. It doesnt affect me at all so I would never call you a cheater for it. Should i care that you duped in fallout 4 or used a mod that gave you op alien weaponry?? NO because that’s ridiculous. Same for fallout 76. Good for you if you found away to get great gear.
---
Saying "Bethesda is selling non-cosmetic items in the store" isn't misinformation? 
---
lol, they just did. granted it is ALSO a cosmetic item that provided in game buffs. No matter how small the buff, this is the DEFINITION of p2w. But w/e, think what you want.
---
Stop using the term nerf for everything,even that you don't know.
---
They did not nerf it. It broke in the patch. Now it has been proven to work with you hunger and thirst,which is not correct anyway and they know it.
---
Reducing the damage of tse ,that is a nerf.
---
So sit down,wash your tears and wait a week for a hot fix.
---
YES! Cousin and little sister are both deaf. Ive thought about transcribing them so they can enjoy em too. 
---
Ill dig through my holos and transcribe the ones i have with no in game text.  If someone has a list of locations, ill scoop the missing ones and transcribe those too. 
---
Ok....well I'm sure that they said you would not be at any advantage if you were to purchase anything. Could be remembering incorrectly as it was months ago and I've not got age on my side.
---
It was handed to me by another player and then destroyed along with the character holding it. By then the damage was done. What is there to figure out? My character wasn't over encumbered as it was moved to a character to be deleted 
---
Tbh that doesn’t seem comparable, that’s just a freak occurrence that happens in the wasteland, I’ve seen 4 SB at whitesprings before. 
---
Seriously anyone who’s not at least lvl 50 just doesn’t have the perks and guns needed to take on the queen and all they do is raise her DR. It doesn’t matter how many enemies on the ground you take out, those are just an annoyance.. we’re all there for the queen and these lower lvls ruin it. Not talking about you specifically cause Idk you, just generally speaking 
---
Way to misuse ironic!
---
If the guy really is medically bedridden I feel bad for him. Either he is a cheater and just keeps milking it for his weird personal entertainment or he really didn’t cheat and just played the game way more than anyone should.
---
No, it was the hordes of ghouls that got me. 
---
There's a win in p2w. Where's the win in this?
---
They explicitly promised multiple times that they would have cosmetic items that don't affect gameplay in any shape or form. The Unstoppables outfits did. You can get caught up on wording or use listening comprehension and get to the conclusion that he meant PURELY cosmetic. Or you can defend a lying company. The choice is yours. 
---
You are not. An in game item also provides the same buff.
---
The additional stats provided. It doesn't matter how small of a buff they gave you, they still did. Which Bethesda explicitly promised would NEVER be the case. 
---
Level doesn't mean shit, I've seen plenty of lvl 100+ that can't kill a fucking mole rat. I also ran my wife through her first nuke run at lvl 17, she stayed up top and kept shooting till everything broke then started with the rolling pin.
---
I don't get why ppl keep saying they spend so much time trying to grind a silo, and the resources it costs, you get that much lead, steel, aluminium, and other shit from all those robots that it's become a standard for farming. After all it only takes 20 minutes to run through them.
---
Okay, so are you admitting that you weren't receiving the nukas for your personal use, but to delete them?
---
So you can dispatch them in an area of your choice smart
---
I don't know in one server i joined a queen fight ,withour prep,where there were just 4 high levels ,and we destroyed her in 4 minutes.
---
Yesterday i joined in a fight with at least 10 people,went there prepared with even syringer,and in 30 minutes we just hit the regeration point.
---
Then why is he making this post?
---
In *this* economy?
---
I’m an old and don’t understand why anyone listens to youtubers (even the name is cringe and weird) - but no one rushed out a game that belonged in early beta bust Bethesda and it’s no one’s fault the game is in this state, derided or flopped but Bethesda.
---
I watched a few of the reviews and even critiqued some that were really bad - some guy named Juicehead mostly.
---
But in the end, misreporting the finer details of what types of trash are burning in the dumpster doesn’t make it any less of a dumpster fire.
---
Once I realised what had happened yea I took steps to get rid of them including deleting the character holding not that it seemed to matter 
---
I just don't understand how they didn't do resistance scaling until level 50, then go based on perks after 50. So anything after your base resist would be determined by perk cards, thus making it to where super high level creatures one shot lower level players.
---
I roleplay a mothman dedicate. Chameleon armor in ritual bindings/mask.   
---
When i spot low levels on the map i pile up on aid/plans/gear then sneak up on them with a "Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Lamp?" Anyone that stays gets tons of free stuff. "Here have some literature." (drops plans)  
---
The other one I like to play is the Cop character. Ill run up on someone after they finished clearing a mob, and play the role of the detective investigating the murder scene.   
---
I'm far from a hater of the game, but it's always felt a little like a tech demo for a FO4 multiplayer mod.
---
At 50, you still have flaws in your build. Im not the other person writing the post. This post is my opinion. Level 60 would be the lowest level i would really care to see in my sbq fight. At that point they should have a better spec'd build and better weapons and armor to help. 
---
I've read your original post before it was deleted and I agree. There is something going on. I don't think youtubers are necessarily conspiring with each other in a coordinated way, but there is definitely some kind of view/upvote manipulation out there by people who want to sabotage Bethesda and this game. Reddit is far too easy to manipulate. The greed of Youtubers and outrage mentality from the general masses just fills in the rest. It's suspicious that hate posts for this game went rampant months before it even came out.
---
The bugs are real, but I'm genuinely having a lot of fun. 
---
If he was cheating, fuck him.
---
If he wasn't, 900 hours over three months? Ten hours a day, every day? Use this ban to take the time to go the fuck outside, man.
---
Don't think wondering at 5:20 am EST is going to do you any good. Beth employees won't get to work for 3 to 4 hours.
---
Also they come weekly, not specified by day. 
---
When you play solo 90% of your play through you have to rely on other players to help with events.  I mean good for you i guess having others you can coach and play with. I've played mostly solo since beta, i have 400+ hours playtime, and yes it takes a lot of time to gather resources necessary to repair, and craft. We don't all have the same builds, so some grind for resources more than others.
---
Right now there's an icon with your name and "owned"  beside the deathclaw name,so everyone should know that it's a player asset and not to attack it.  You cannot rely on that tho,people are stupid.
---
Not sure it’s just isolated to workshops?  I was at Whitesprings and a legendary radscorpion spawned and i was on top of one of the buses and it came up from beneath?  WTF 
---
It's 10 am gmt;-)
---
Where can you get it!?
---
If you deleted the character then imo you shouldn’t get suspended.
---
There’s definitely people playing this game that didn’t know about duping and maybe picked up stacks of rare items without thinking twice about it. 100k nuka cola is kinda ridiculous tho.. most players know pretty soon they give you a bottle cap a piece, but Im not gonna impugn your character with accusations. Hopefully Bethesda fixes these dupe glitches ASAP so suspensions like this can be ended. 
---
Well yeah, I also did mess around with cheat engine. But mainly to check what can be fiddled with clientside and what could not.
---
Didn't they patch this?
---
*The more you know*
---
Or they just allow you to trade the cards that you dont want for levels which you can use to respec or get the card that you actually want.
---
it can be 3 cards exchange or even 5 cards for 1 level.
---
Bro, I wouldn’t even bother. You’re basically trying to convince a cult at this point. Evidence doesn’t not compute to them. lol
---
This really sucks. How much more does Bethesda want to inconvenience their players? What about Caps spent on this...just re-acquire it? Seriously?
---
Patch what? 
---
It's totally possible to legitimately pick up 100k Nuka throughout the game world.
---
This is my point exactly. If Bethesda look into my account right now they will see this. But here I am with my ticket on waiting for an agent for 4 days 
---
I don't thing "snigger" is a word. Did you mean "snicker?"
---
too random. So many mutations can easily hose a build.  
---
Oh you wanna use non-melee? Sorry, Talons &amp; twisted muscles. (-50% accy each)
---
YOu melee? Bird Bones, egghead, and eagle eyes for you. (-3/-4 str, each)  
---
Energy weapons? Grounded! (-50% energy dmg)
---
Play solo?; Herd Mentality! (-2 all specials when solo)  
---
Bloodied? smacked by empath. (you take 25% extra damage)  
---
I see mutations sold for \~300 caps. Thats less than a week @1300 caps per day. (1400-100 for travel expenses)
---
How do I tag Bethesda here on this comment thread ?
---
As far as I know, Unstoppables outfits unequip all your normal armor, so you're actually nerfing yourself by wearing them.
---
Ah shut the hell up. Nobody would have considered this behaviour griefing if you hadn’t explicitly made a post about how much you love griefing workshops.
---
Honestly I miss running into a situation I’m not capable of handling at my lvl and having to figure out how to survive because I saved my game an hour ago and didn’t want to lose my progress. Obviously this is an online game but I’m looking forward to the PvP servers I think they’ll add a more wasteland feel and make it more realistic. 
---
You may have gotten away this time Lex Luther. But know this... Lady Justice will come for you...and she's wielding a rocket powered, bladed mahogany baseball bat with your name on it.
---
Happened to me just the other day. Rolling a new character and I notice before I head out a lol 88 was hanging around the vault entrance. I pop out and they follow me around so I stop and wave. They drop a crap ton of recipes for me and just left the server. Though I do get the apprehension of seeing such a high number heading in your direction on the map though. 
---
Electrified fence. Bbq'd molerats ready for eating.
---
From Atom Store, 800 atoms I think
---
Explain the thought process behind deleting the character instead of just dropping the items on the ground?
---
The scum themselves 
---
How do CDPR do it? By telling lies.  
---
CRPR claim to the community that they made the Witcher 3 entirely from the profits of Witcher 2, yet turns out they took three government grants to complete the game, and it's looking like Cyberpunk will be taking 4 to complete.  
---
Their games also aren't online, there's no servers that need maintenance, and after the last DLC has dropped you're probably looking at one or two patches for bug fixes and after 2 months at that point never another one.  
---
So let's see, they don't have servers that need to be upkeep, they don't keep the game serviced for years so no funds need to be diverted for this.  
---
End of the day you have two options to keep a game like FO76 alive, either a monthly subscription like MMOs, or MTX.  
---
And considering current generation of gamers are entitled cunts who hate monthly subscriptions, companies are left with one option if they want their LiteMMO to live.
---
To remove them from existence. If I dropped there's a  chance someone else could pick them up
---
i've only seen 1 alive (bog), and second one as a corpse (in front of Whitesprings)
---
Hey, my in-game Name ist FreeHero and I have an performance problem.

If I go in rooms, houses or anything where the world have to load new, I have less FPS and it laags. It's not always, but oftentimes. Maybe random? I can't find out why it's so.

---
Sorry for my bad English ;)
---
I mean honestly man you’re not gonna get your account unsuspected until they fix the dupe glitch and who knows when that will be. It really sucks and I feel for you and I really feel like they painted with way too broad a brush. They at least should look at peoples inventories rn if the account gets flagged and decide from there, guess that would be too much work tho idk. 
---
What level was your character when you deleted it?
---
Wow.  The plague and pale rider ones are really excellent.  I can't wait to kit out my T-51b with one of those.
---
The plague theme is perfect for those that spend a lot of time in nuke zones.  It looks like what I imagine a suit of power armor would look like after spending a day in a blast, splattering ghoul guts all over the place and being infected with glowing pustules.
---
Death (the second to last) looks more like a Tzeentch cult marine than the last one. The swirly bits and dark raven look fit it well and wouldn't be out of place on a marine belonging to the Lord of Change.

Maybe learn to not hoard before it's too late and you end up on TV.
---
Well fuck me in the ass and snigger while you do it!
---
I'm not even sure what you're trying to say at this point. Just because a company makes a statement doesn't mean that the statement is truthful and proof in of itself. When EA says that micro transactions were to instil a sense of price and accomplishment doesn't prove that that's what they're there for. When a developer puts in a youtube copyright strike and youtube takes a video down because of it that doesn't prove that said video had copyright infringing material and just because a [video game company](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9wswa6/epic_are_unbanning_falsely_banned_accounts_giving/) bans a user does't mean the ban is necessarily warranted.
---
These overdramatic YouTubers pisses me off aswell. But then again it also pisses me off that Bethesda said there would ONLY be cosmetic items in the store. No matter how insignificant this buff is they still lied about that. 
---
Pure RNG and the legendary system was always a lazy, unoriginal copy paste of a new convention. 
---
What the game needs is a modular system that integrates with the already robus mod system.
---
The game shouldn’t drop singular, pre determined “lenendaries”. Wtf does legendary even mean in the context of fallout? What great battle was fought with a any exterminators rolling pin, let alone my 20th one? 
---
What, at all is “legendary” about this ghoul that has a star? Was he some legendary soldier, some great general? Nope. Just a rando we call legendary because it’s that or elite in every other version of the same bland system.
---
Just steal this BSG - I spent like 10 minutes on it so about 8 more than you did workshopping a premium loot system.
---
West Tek Prototypes: Some monsters that were experimented on in Weat Tek facilities escaped - they have unique mutations like regaining health, or breathing fire or super speed that manifest as they take damage. Some mutate once, some mutate multiple times with multiple abilities.
---
Some of these creatures have technological modifications: bionic eyes, IV tube ports, implants. Some were just attracted to shiny or radioactive components of prototypes West Tek was developing.
---
They drop these parts when you kill them. You can craft these parts, once you lear the blueprints from quests, into unique mods that add either:
---
1) a “Prototype slot” onto a weapon. 
---
2) a West Tek Prototype Mod onto a “Prototype slot”.
---
You can add up to five slots, each having a mod - so in total being the same as a 5 Star legendary
---
Different mod parts have rarity tiers. A 1 mutation Experimented creature might drop the parts for Exterminators or Hackers mods. A 3 mutation deathclaw for Assassins and Quad. The Scorched Queen for Two Shot and Explosive.
---
There ya go. Solves the whole infinite grind Legendary Lotto and at least pretends the system should have the barest pretense of inworld consistency and context.
---
How is this hard?
---
That's great that you like it, but it isn't a decent game. It isn't even mediocre. It's a bad, unfinished, rushed game. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it 
---
Yeah. The last months (since Blizzcon 2018) made me seriously reconsider what I think about gaming communities, gamers in general and these "gaming journalist" or "gaming news" youtubers. When I looked under the facade of all this I saw Daleks - blind hatred towards things that are different and toward people that support different things. I found people that are so deeply indentifying themselves with a company/franchise/product that they take every bit of criticism as an offense, every competitor is an enemy that must be talked badly about and every change inside this company/franchise/product is personal betrayal made from greed. Especially the last point is worrying - when a company does something unexpected that breaks the current dogma it turn the religious devotion into religious hate. A hate that is more than "I'm done with this company/game, goodbye". No, this hate makes than still follow the company/game and spread poison everywhere, attack the players that still play the game and like the company and sometimes these people resort to spreading lies just to help their "cause".
---
I simply don't get what's so messed up in the heads of many gamers that they fall into this behavior. Gaming used to be about love for games, but now it's all about fighting someone, spreading some narrative and the games themselves are secondary to that. Why are Witcher 3 players so obsessed about being considered the best RPG? Does it make that game any worse for them when someone points out a flaw or expresses his preference for other RPG, like Skyrim? Why are Path of ~~Elitism~~ Exile players so obsessed with being the best action RPG? Why are they obsessed with invading anything Diablo-related and being toxic there? Why are FNV players so obsessed with the game to the point that they become outright hostile towards anything connected with Bethesda (especially when it comes to the 18-months contract, where they LOVE rewriting history)?
---
So many times people spread that we shouldn't be in love with a developer. They aren't our friends and don't owe us anything. Yes, that's true. But many of these people break their own rules because they use their love for something and justification for hate. And a food for thought - if we shouldn't love a developer, why should we be allowed to hate them? They are not our friends, but they are also not our enemies.
---
That could work but I'd rather just have a respec all in one, because even doing that is = to 1 point at a time.
---
?
---
Well, you don't have access to the evidence or the algorithm. So why assume anything at all? 
---
Even assuming your account gets unbanned, Bethesda is likely to 'helpfully' wipe your inventories.
---
Are the items illegitimate?
---
Was a character on your account in possession of them?
---
If yes to both your account gets suspended. 
---
 Claiming ignorance changes nothing.
---
The only thing that might help is the character being deleted.  If it was only deleted after you were suspended you probably need to be suspended the same length of time as everyone else.
---
Cheating. Obtaining something through deceptive means to gain an unfair advantage. Given your duped items and duped caps are used as barter... Jesus christ am I really typing this.
---
Lmao I'm not the one calling anyone a cunt and being generally rude for no reason, that's you. So, you're the toxic one. Simple as that. ;)
---
Those low levels griefed your queen party. Funny. 
---
Don't try to use this justification on r/Games. They love to deny us the right to have fun in the game, because "there are bigger concerns surrounding the game". And if you try to explain that games are about having fun, you'll be accused of having low standards, shilling for Bethesda or just for being "what's wrong with the gaming industry today". Been there, seen that. Several times, when the reviews came after release. 
---
Sometimes I think that gamers no longer care about games, just about the narrative surrounding the games.
---
This post is sad 
---
I thought those outfits only provided that buff during some event. Was it not temporary?
---
Well it is in the U.K. as far as my experience goes.
---
Also I've never heard of a 'snicker' as anything other than a chocolate bar!
---
Not sure what happend but it sure seems there are several changes not listed.  Anyone else seem to have a damage nerf again?  Being almost level 300+ and taken down the SBQ our average is 5 mins less with 4-5 people..  We had 10 people all over level 100+ and took 15 mins.  The game still crashes in nuke zones.  The rads are not showing currently in nuke zones.  The list goes on and on, not sure if the is a full detailed list.  The sorch beast attack from regular ones is not a second 10 delay, unless after 3 back to back attacks there is a 10 second delay?
---
Also, all I did was state my opinion and a suggestion that I think needs to be in the game. You're the one who decided to attack me for it and got your original comment removed cause I reported you for being toxic and abusive. So, yeah. I'm not the toxic one or butthurt, YOU are for attacking someone with an opinion. Nice try lmao
---

"Fallout 76 player **(singular)** who spent 900 hours in-game says they've **(plural)** been banned"  
---
so, gaming journalism is outside the jurisdiction of both grammar and common sense these days
---
It did, this person like many others are just making a big deal out of nothing, the atom shop isn't pay to win or anything like that. It's all free and optional 
---
Anyone who has the energy to battle this misinformation is a hero in my book.
---
It is fucking sad to read articles ”players have nothing to do in Fallout but to keep nuking each other because of lack of end game content” or similar. Most of the time there is some truth like the end game content for those who put in a lot of hours is a bit lacking in variation and reward.
---
But the youtubers and writers do a piss poor job of being factual or nuansed. It is just hit pieces everywhere with little to no basic knowledge about the actual state of the game or the mostly awesome community amongst those who PLAY the game.
---
TLDR; fuck the flame train and the fake news.
---
though you kinda use it the same way as junk, no use on in being in the inventory, or am i wrong?
---
&gt;  I’m taking a break until they fix everything.
---
Hey me too. I also need to buy it then too. :-)
---
Similar thing happened to me.  The only other time I remember failing that fight was when my friend and I were only level 20 and didn't know what we were doing.
---
Look, dude. We’re just gonna have to agree to disagree on this.
---
Serious question: Did you eat paint chips as a kid?
---
&gt; from SP Fallout games, where the narrative is mine to create.
---
Then why don't you play actually good Fallout games, like 1/2/NV?
---
It looks like an alpha behemoth spawned others.
---
Small correction, Zeninax Online Studios does ESO, not Bethesda
---
That is besides the point. Actually that can make it even worse. Making it limoted time only causes people to buy it ASAP even if they don't have the earned caps to do it, so they will spend real money so they can enjoy the positive effects. 
---
I accidentally duped my excavator set in some way once. What'd I do? Report it to Bethesda and drop it afterwards. Am i banned? No. Happy times
---
Free? 😄😂😂👌🏿👌🏿😅😅
---
I can see how some people may view it as pay-2-win. I don't necessarily agree with that. Whatever small buff they received during the event wasn't worth paying money for. Pretty sure 99.9% of people that bought the costumes with Atoms (real money or earned) did so for the look, not the buff to give them "the edge".
---
As long as Bethesda doesn't continue with this pattern of "event-only buffs" with Atom items we be cool.
---
I think they are literally the same words, just british and american, haha. 
---
Snigger - ​to laugh at someone or something in a silly and often unkind way
---
Snicker - give a half-suppressed, typically scornful laugh.
---
Best make up a long post explaining how you were a victim of the cheaters but not actually a cheater.
---
Yah free I currently have 1800 atom and already purchased many items with out paying any real money, it's all free! If you choose to spend money to get it faster that's your stupidity 
---
If you like base building and survival, Fallout 4 is the game for you (in this series, at least). No PvP, of course, but you already knew this. 
---
I've found it difficult to get into Fallout 3 because of how the visual and mechanical elements of the game hasn't aged well, but I'll keep trying. 
---
May I ask, do you even play this game?
---
Lol. Then what do you call limited time items that can only be purchased in a certain time period? What if you don't have the atoms earned cause you already spent them? 
---
It's not like atom is hard to come by, it's stupid easy to get rich in atom and buy anything you want 
---
I'm sure by "free" (s)he meant that you can earn Atoms to buy stuff from the shop.
---
Something happened in my life time, i dont know when, but somehow Youtubers became some kind of trustworthy authority. People look up to them as if they're gods. im nearly 30, and YT has strictly been for music or useful shit, why the fuck do people hang on these peoples every word? 
---
Not anymore. Was planning to come back if/when things are fixed/more content is added but that seems unliklier by the day. 
---
Eventually you will be strong and it wont feel that way.
---
You don't need youtube personalities or whoever else to realize that the game is a hastily made, bug-ridden and an obvious cashgrab that further rapes the body of a once legendary game series. Is your buyer's remorse so hard or have you never played a good game?
---
Then you're out of luck? Stop acting like fo76 is the first game to have limited timed items 
---
So because you only have 3 days to buy it you're forced to pay real money? 
---
What kind of logic is this lol just stop with the circle jerk and think 
---
wow /r/nocontext
---
That is ok. But you cannot earn Atoms infinitely. Well, technically you can, that's why it's not such big of a deal in case of non-limited time items but when we talk about limited time items,you won't be able to buy all of them by simply playing the game, so you'll have to shell out cash if you want them. 
---
I see. Well, there are weekly (?) event buffs that sometimes require something from a player in order to benefit (sleep in bed, be in a team, wear a particular item and so on). That particular event asked for you to wear a cosmetic outfit that was released same week. It was done to celebrate the release of these new outfits.
---
Not the first game sure, but usually games that have limited time items in their real life money store are usually either blatsnt cash grabs or are free to play... Fo76 was advertised as neither. 
---
Tried and True. It’s sad that we’re at the point we’re just happy when BSG tacks on Diablo 1 and 2 systems.
---
I participated in SBQ last night, around 8-9pm EST (New York resident), and everything seemed pretty normal to me.  There were probably 7-8 players involved, me being the lowest level at 103 and the highest close to 200, and I even had a bit of time off of my usual melee "takin' out the trash" activity to pull out my revolver and get a couple dozen shots on the queen while she was flying.
---
Possibly increased mob scaling with a large party to offset the sonic nerf?  Maybe a perfect storm of an old server, some latency issues that made her health appear to stand still and perhaps doubled up mob spawns due to new players entering the area?
---
There's so much that *could* go wrong with such a busy, persistent event like Scorched Earth that it's a minor miracle it goes right at all.  That coding had to be a nightmare.  Anytime they mess with something scorchbeast related is like trying to swap something in a house of cards, because that's what the coding for Scorched Earth must be like.
---
I usually like his content but I didn't agree with his conclusion here at all. Did anyone realistically go and buy the outfits for this 'event'? In my gameplay at least, they could double my health (or even half it) and I wouldn't really notice, I have 2 points in endurance and I've only ever died once while not being particularly skilled.
---
Jim Sterling just put out a video about the recent bans. Even though it seems satirical there was nothing untrue about it.
---
Bashing FO76 is a meme right now and it = clicks, views, likes.
---
I don't think it will hurt the game anymore than it already is, at this point it's a feedback loop.
---

It only hid them because we paid $60 to beta test their game for them and report the massive flaws......

Yeah that is concerning to me, but I might be alone with this sentiment. IMO it's just in place to encourage players to spend money. Which would be ok if the game was anything other than in early access state... 
---
But they are not limited (except for that PA black paint). They sell them at a discounted price as an event and then you can still purchase them with Atoms for a full price later on. Sales are there for you to save Atoms and keep checking their shop for deals daily.
---
I'm still waiting for new content, I love the game to bits but I am starting to get abit bored :( 
---
True story.
---
What, i have to take your defense of cheaters and your complete disregard for the damage they've inflicted upon the game and the enjoyment of legit players serious?
---
Camp/Stash Limit upgrade kits for 10k a pop.
---
Wait. Why/how are you paying to join? Fast travel costs?
---
There were limited timed items last I checked. It might have changed but the point is that if you offer an in game stat bonus for a limited time for said items then you essentially force players who don't want to miss out to buy those items in those timeframes. It might just be an issue for me, I just think it's pretty scummy. Especially when they promised us these things would not happen. 
---
I'm still disappointed with the amount of content released since launch. I was expecting a large update around this month, but so far it's nothing but tumbleweeds. This game is in dire state with barely any meat, and not enough people work on it by the looks of it.
---
Over 1000 a day, every day since the game came out.  I mean maybe I guess.  Probably not though.
---
source? 
---
Nice to have an actual conversation with someone of different views. 
---
Yeah that's one of the reasons I stopped. I found the content lacking and boring. Especially after nerfs to progression. 
---
“seems like it should have been thought through a little better.”
---
It sums up pretty much every design decision in the game that isn’t a straight up copy and paste from Fo4 (which had plenty of its own).
---
Stealth boys are not hard to find given the amount of static spawns so I doubt they're all duped. There's also the cameleon mutation and the stealth boy mod for PA. As for dealing with them, just set them on fire.
---
If you REALLY want them - yes. I have close to 7k Atoms and still waiting on items I'd want to spend them on. I'm not an impulse buyer, so I can be pretty patient. 
---
I also play a lot and earn Atoms via achievements as well as the dailies/weeklies. People that only play on weekends can't do dailies every day, so they might have to spend £££ on Atoms instead. It is optional after all.
---
Player level 106. \~4 weeks of playtime, 3-4 days per week (work 4on, 4 off) usually just hop on for cap runs on my work days.   
---
Have used 0 exploits, bought 1 weapon picked everything else myself.  (unless killing things and crafting tons of ammo is an exploit)  
---
Always well rested, usually rocking cranberry bonus as well. (so +20% xp gain)  
---
Some of us dont want waste hours looking through every room, terminal, book, holo, etc. Stopped caring about the story after about 5 hours in. Everyone's dead, so who fucking cares? (FRT, how much interest should I show in a kid that was kidnapped 100+ years ago. FFS)   
---
Story/quests are boring, so I kill dudes. most of the mobs are far too easy. Im used to dozens of dudes to shoot, all on screen at the same time. So these tiny mobs are practically a joke for me. Ive been rolling over them since \~lvl 35 (even after the nerf.)  
---
Ive prob got around 70-80 hours in the wasteland.  Id argue that you're just a filthy casual trying tom impress your boring method of play on everyone. If i wanted to play "Look at Stuff: the sim" id go to a museum.
---
"They only ever be cosmetic" 
---
But I can't be the GEEK like I want because my friends keep learning repairing and crafting plans!  Seriously I've spent forever hunting down plans and getting perks for crafting/repairing/carry weight and now my friends only need me to help them fight enemies and to "have fun."
---
Lol, there are always people stupid enough to respond...
---
It's funny to read all the posts and their mental gymnastics to prove that the duper is not a duper. 
---
Like, let it go. 
---
Likewise :D
---
Yes you are right. Problem is most people don't have enough free time to earn that much Atoms. Also, people are generally easily persuaded that they need things they don't actually need. Bethesda and other companies know this exactly. 
---
I use Nukapedia (https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki) because The Vault (https://fallout.gamepedia.com/The_Vault_Fallout_Wiki) looks like ass.
---
They're both pretty bad on FO76 though, need a lot of work.
---
I totally appreciate what you’re saying, and agree. You do still have flaws at 50 and it leads me to wonder if ‘respecing’ should begin at 45, but that’s another question for another day. :)
---
Whereas you’re used to no-one talking to you?
---
Oh no not my fake internet points you bastards
---
FO4 legendary system being a shit copy paste of a bland standard system doesn’t make it good there or here.
---
Pure RNG systems only exist to add grind and the illusion of content.
---
Dude needs to grow up and move on. Stop whining to every corner of the internet.
---
I am a poor communicator.
---
Stealth boys never break stealth so I think you do not know how stealth boys actually work? chameleon is nothing to stealth boy spam.
---
Craft armor and weapons to your closest level, if you are still using level 1-5 gear. Always try to get an sneak attack in, go for headshots, thats just about it.
---
... because he desperately wants to be unbanned?
---
No offense, but they were datamined long ago.
---
Now they seem to be in better quality tho
---
\*eyeroll\*
---
'They've' is also used to refer to a singular person without specifying gender. Rather controversial to some people, but seriously... word definition and uses do change with time.
---
What’s the difference between “Dmg Bonus” and “Super Dmg Bonus”?
---
Focus on damage-dealing perks and forget the defensive ones. Believe me, the defensive ones are a trap. Hoard lead and steel, and constantly craft yourself bullets. Get mutations as soon as you unlock level 2 Starched Genes. Work on getting better and better legendary gear. It's pretty much assumed any level past 20 has some kind of legendary drops, so normal gear isn't supposed to be enough.
---
I never had a problem myself, but I understand other folk might end up in different situations, so... Levels are just a number. If they're too strong for you, they're too strong. Stay to a zone that you can handle until you manage to get equipped well enough.
---
I agree with you. But I do feel that these event buffs are a grey area in this situation. Not only did you have to equip the outfit, but you also had to be on a team of players with those outfits on to get the biggest HP buff. 
---
If you're playing ranged early game like I did you hit a bit of a brick wall from about level 10 to 20. I switched to melee/ sniper to get past it, even without optimal perks it worked well enough to snipe the level 20s enemies and 2h melee the ones who get close. I found shotguns while totally satisfying to point blank waste low hp scored and ferals with really poor damage dealers and difficult to keep enough ammo for.
---
Or just sticking to the forest untill you get past the level hump.
---
Says the troll lol 
---
PSA:  You do not need to redo the steps in that quest.  You can start at any transponder, *even the last one of all*.
---
Just got to the last transponder you know of straight away.  Ignore all the ones you've already done.
---
Yes, it is annoying that the game does not explain this.
---
***bushidou intensifies***
---
Yeah you might be right, I'm just really really annoyed by p2w schemes. I realize thi is far from it YET but I fear that if a lot of people buy these outfits in the period they provide temporary buffs, later Bethesda will just introduce other, more game altering effects either for a limited time or permanently. I just don't want them to start going down that slippery slope. 
---
Fingers crossed - there will be no loot boxes (card packs) as additional cash-generating mechanism. If they ever announce it, I'll be jumping the ship. I may return for Elder Scrolls 6 or Fallout 6, but only after solid reviews by trusted sources.
---
I've never understood this modern idea that games are made by Anti-Aircraft-Artillery batteries.
---
Or is it that game companies are rated by S&amp;P and Moodies?
---
If there are AAA companies are there AAB? ABB? ABC? level companies?
---
For the Chaos Gods!!!
---
I’m very sorry this happened to you. I hope you get unbanned and can continue to play a game you enjoy and makes you happy. Wish you the best.
---
I've seen the articles as well, it makes me so mad because they're all aimed at Bethesda like they are in the wrong. I don't care what that guy cries about he's lying if he says he never duped anything. I don't even think the servers are steady enough to enable someone to play 900 hours to begin with. You got caught cheating and now you're going to whine to the company because they banned you. The whole thing is beyond frustrating and I have nothing to do with it.
---
&gt;  and the amount of bugs they re-add.
---
Please name *two* bugs they re-added.
---
I did cheat but not get banned (=
---
Only the grenades for caps and infinite stash and carry weight though.
---
Hold down the toggle view button anywhere within the workshop. It will begin the claim or so I read in another post.
---
Which is hilarious if you have a "quad" lever action.  Waiting while it loads 20 rounds...
---
Just realised i did exactly the same thing. I noticed i was struggling at level 20 badly, using rifles, think i switched out to a super sledge or fire axe and around level 30 got easier. Just try to pick your fights at this point. I spent so many levels upping my AP points so i could sprint/jump out of face tanking to death.
---
How would it ever result in them being unbanned? 
---
"Guys I didn't have sexual relations with that woman"... just doesn't work.
---
Damn the only player who actually cared about the game and bethesda baned him. 
---
That's fair enough. Although I'd recommend starting a new character with friends who'll do likewise to play that particular role successfully.
---
Sounds fair if you guys would quit raising the level of mobs for my level 20 quests to fucking 68.
---
I completed f4 once and put it down. Way prefer 76 in every way. the story in 4 was so lukewarm i wasnt interested in doing it again. New Vegas is my personal fav though.
---
Thanks for your reply.
---
1. seperate vendor caps would be broken. Thats around 4k a day!!!
---
2. Explosives are very viable, in fact out of all the second legendary affixes its arguably the best(not including melee affixes)
---
3. this one I like. 
---
Ahh a lot of that's bleeding over now though. I get stick for saying 'trash' and 'garbage' so much (I just think they're more fun to say) rather than 'rubbish'
---
So your logic is, "He must be innocent because only an innocent person would make a post asking to be unbanned since it's so unlikely they'd be unbanned"? I've been playing online games for about two decades and this is new a new or novel phenomenon. 
---
im the 900 hours guy 
---
No, I'm Spartacus! Oh, wait..
---
dude all the energy that your are wasiting here, could off had put up that same energy towards a new character. you can have the videos you want an it still sounds and looks a little out off the norm when someone gives you 100k off anything on a fallout game. start a new character an own your actions.
---
In fo4 I got kneecapping and staggering pipe pistol drops (on different playthroughs) and they were awesome (great synergy with luck/vast crit. builds)! 
---
Very rare treasure indeed!
---
I'm going for JUNKIE next. And maybe nSW (no safe water). River drinking druggie... and cannibal? (Almost heaven.....)
---
IF someone requests an item after you have requested one of theirs, does it exchange those items for each other? Or is it always a 'for caps' deal? I wanted something from someone recently but he requested my main gun and i got scared of pressing any buttons for fear or losing it and just ran away. Dude must have realised.
---
Isn't avoiding a ban or having multiple Bethesda accounts "actually" against terms of service?
---
Yeah but you won’t get low lvl peeps in whitesprings. I end up looking like a total moron going through forest and dropping crap then doing a dance which consists of:  ‘come here’ Squat stand up squat stand up’  ‘jump jump’ ‘heart emoji’ ‘squat stand up squat stand up’ ‘bash the bag’ ‘come here’.. it resembles some kind of a mating call.. all it’s missing is David Attenborough voice over
---
Like 5 XD
---
Yes. I would recommend checking out some builds based around solo play. It's absolutely doable and as long as you don't mind the grind you will enjoy it.
---
I do alot of events, yes there has been times i have joined an event and there was not enough time to finish it. It sucks when it happens but honestly it doesn't really bother me that much. Typically i just find somthing else to do in that area. Spending caps to move across the map is part of the risk and reward. I will spend 50 caps to port across the map  if see a player with a 5 cap bounty. Sometimes i get there late. The player has logged or bounty was already claimed so im pretty used to losing caps. Most of the events i join everything works out fine. I do understand your frustration but honestly making caps is easy. I would suggest building your camp far from vault 76 in a location that is close to events you like to join. Also take a couple workshops in other locations on the map and use them for free fast travels.  Best wishes 😊
---
It was deleted well before. I cannot log in now so impossible to delete now ;-)
---
yesterday was not worked for me. i will chek it.
---
&gt;no one complained
---
Yeah we did. Perhaps not loudly enough though.
---
Adding p2w mechanics is shitty. Getting bonus health is p2w. Pootubers also also shitty. 
---
Also I see where you're coming from min/maxing by pumping luck to 15 but the reality of this game everyone needs a bit of strength for the melee dmg and carry weight just to get you to 50+ when you can start fine tuning.
---
&gt; One groups main appeal to the game is leveling up, getting powerful, and doing endgame. 
---
&gt; That is fine, and a lot of people are going to be attracted to that. Like you.
---
He's level 57, doesn't seem like he's been leveling up much.
---
(I find it hard to believe he's finished *all* the quests and only got to level 57).
---
\*scepticism intensifies\*
---
and the Mothman Bed is it as well.
---
Chameleon&gt;hide&gt;claim.
---
I mean, that's a good way to do it if anybody ever claimed them anymore.  I haven't seen anything but the ammo workshop claimed in a while.
---
i was them many times in whotespring at south wall as attackers.
---
My gf disappeared after I got the mothman bed. :(
---
Reminds me of that movie Shawshank redemption 
---
Alright Sherlock. Craft 1000 utracite ammo. Drop it and pick it up 1000 times (better to go overboard). Tell us what happens.
---
In addition to Twin Lakes, there's one that always spawns at that unmarked pond in the Savage Divide. And one spawns with regularity out on the golf course at White Springs (near the fence), usually accompanied by 2 or 3 super mutants.
---
Controversy sells, and with Toutube saturated with gaming content creators it's used as a weapon to keep up with the competition.
---
It's like some of these Youtubers are afraid of voicing their own genuine opinion out of fear of losing out to the ones that do jump on the bandwagon.
---
I have watched twitch streamers who clearly enjoyed playing F76 but were getting so much shit in chat that they were literally forced to stop playing the game, it's sad really.
---
I'm more worried the account is now on a final warning. It could easily trigger again  as the system currently stands right?
---
Hell no, I don’t want to get banned. 
---
I do not concur. 
---
Legendaries are fun and enhance gameplay by allowing you to take on different play styles, but 1\* are perfectly serviceable and so are some non-legendaries with the appropriate mods and perks (like ANY shotgun with the enforcer perk, or a fully modded Gatling gun for SBQ) unless you are exclusively a min/max player.
---
Nearly all of the legendary gear that I use I obtained without the market, mostly from drops (I did do a lot of farming) and a few from vendors:
---
* Full (mixed) sets of bolstering, unyielding, vanguard, weightless, ect...
---
* Over a dozen bloodied weapons (melee and ranged)
---
* some decent 2\* weapon drops as well: over half a dozen swing speed melee, a couple of increased fire rate gatling gun, 2 explosive drops (but drops are likely seeded RNG, so it fits with my play style - bloodied melee)
---
If I were to accidentally drop my 1\* bloodied Gauss rifle (as I feared when I accidentally stashed it a few days ago), I am fairly confident that I could find a replacement on the market for a reasonable number of caps (as I did to replace the ss boxing glove that I had lost).
---
In my case the legendary drop rate and vendor/player markets are working just fine: I may not have been able to buy a max level bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet, but I will make due with the lvl 40 that I did purchase (at a healthy discount!).
---
 SBQ still at 80 when I joined, 5 min left. From thevevebt to actually getting close enough to shoot her was another minute because she was really, really frisky. Once I got her in the sights, i could see her 80% ish health bar and somewhere between 3 and 4 minutes left.
---
Not mad, just irked. Less irked she didnt die (figured that was gonna be a no as soon as I got close) more irked I spent the caps to come.
---
Bethesda is aware of the issue and is looking into it. There was talk of a timer visible on the map but not all events fail on timers.
---
It sucks big time. Only way around this that I've found (after hours and hours of painstaking trial and error) is that molotov's usually hit them underground if you throw them directly "over them". But even with this knowledge I still can't be arsed with killing them :P That, and at some workshops they switch between two "pop-up spots", in those cases you just gotta stand at one of the spots with your best whack-a-mole game on and hope you'll time it right eventually. All in all: you're right to just let it get overrun, sadly.
---
now plz change to melee that build really need a nerf....
---
Well, the game is buggier, then OP thinks bc all this low hunger/thirst thing doesn't affect my damage output at all.
---
probaly crit damage
---
Been happening since day 1.  Not just ticks either.  
---
Yeah, Cause 400 plus hours into a video game isn't commitment right? You think people should play 20000 hours in a still broken game so they can get the gear they actually want? 
---
Truth is I dont care. I did care for about a day maybe a day and a half. This game was only something to do from destiny  2 until division 2 and it filled that role.
---
If they attack u twice and are red they explode and no body thats suppose o be like that, generally if there disappearing and not exploding they revert back to there spawn, its been an issue with everything un game since 3 patches ago
---
So you don't understand reviews and marketing on Youtube but you do understand it exists in other media. Right.
---
Check perks and diseases 
---
Yeh they dont actually tell you “how” to do it
---
Ultracite ammo requires pure flux of one type (varies by caliber) to craft. There is no way he farmed that much flux, even in 900 hours. Steel and lead I could believe, but not pure flux. Even with green thumb, you need 5 radiated plants of a particular type, one glowing mass, one hardened mass, and one high radiation fluids. And that's for ONE flux. And sorry if I don't buy all that ammo switching BS.
---
I was thinking of these ones: [https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy](https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy) 
---
Alanis Morrisette called. She wants her misuse of ironic back.
---
Probably will now that I've just started a new melee character after giving up on any guns
---
and what about bugged adrenaline mutation? i mean what don't give u damage boost? the "remove and reapply" is not an option for me i have about 6 different and needed mutations. and i simple dont want to spend caps to fix the devs fails.
---
I wouldn't post something like this if you are not an English major, cause you can just something really stupid like you just did.
---
They DID announce the pvp servers a while back. Why not just wait until they go live and check them out before you make such posts?
---
I am of the belief than an anecdote is the lowest form of evidence. So if someone comes in with just a story, it's best to reserve judgment until superior evidence comes about. Personally if all I had was a story I wouldn't waste other people's time with it.
---
Likewise, we peons don't have access to the information that Bethesda has on a player, so in a sense "we don't know what we don't know". 
---
So I am agreeing with you. No one should have come to his defense given all he supplied was an anecdote.
---
Once it's been patched, it's a buggy mess else.
---
I made it to 30ish using rifles. Hunting rifle with all the 1 star rifleman perks, 3 in all. At 15 you can start looting raider power armour and this can give you an advantage while you level. Perk some into melee is my suggestion but the shotgun perks like enforcer are great too.
---
Oh i didnt hear about them. Thanks for telling me!
---
Yeah but it’s not been this bad tick wise. I’ve sent creatures into walls and floors before but it’s not a consistent thing that they go poof
---
No diseases. And not sure what perk could do that. I hopped the server and it is still doing same attitude but with higher values. So 289 equipped. 312 unequipped. I’m liking this server more to be honest :))
---
lol.... 
---
Guy claims something is impossible.
---
It is proven it is possible.
---
Guy: I still don't believe it. 
---
It's like arguing with a religious person lol.
---
You randomly deleted your mule character?  Was it before or after Betheada did their scan for duplicated items last week?
---
He is incomprehensible. 
---
So he appealed it on Reddit and was found guilty again is what I've come to understand?
---
A side note: 900 hours or 9 hours... Doesn't matter. It's weird how pitching 900 hours had the effect on triggering people's natural empathy. But I don't think the number of hours should really have ever been a consideration. 
---
The plans! I was farming the BOS Officer Uniform and after DAYS of server hopping i finally just had to give up
---
Well before and it was created shortly before being deleted and only held the nukas
---
Curious.  When the event was a thing i thought i saw mention on here of folk complaining to bethesda about it skirting the no P2W claims &amp; bethesda responded about how it wouldn't happen again.  Is that true or did some poster pull it out of their ass?
---
While i was a bit frustrated by the event skirting things pretty damn closely, i didn't really care all that much in the grand scheme of things especially if bethesda really did back down.  i am much less impressed by the jackasses stirring shit now that the event is over &amp; the costumes ARE purely cosmetic.
---
I don't like it. Buying legendary items from vendors would kill that awesome feeling you get after you kill a legendary minion and before you loot the item only to be disappointed with the stat(s).
---
Better idea would be an ability to re-tinker (reroll) the mods on your legendary item for a hefty price (via MODUS maybe?) be it caps or junk. I'd rather use junk for that so we can trade more and use those workshops too.
---
It has to be reapplied.
---
Solution?:
---
Launch the nuke directly at fissure prime (most people hiding in the bunker seem to not want to deal with rads, even though they give FREE health regen with goulish)
---
Adrenal Reaction is currently bugged, that's probably why you see these fluctuations in damage values. Plus, according to a post on here, hunger and thirst play a role in this as well.
---
That’s just the government giving you back money you paid too much taxes for.
---
It’s not just that tick. It’s every tick. And they all explode into nothingness. I’ve not needed extra stimpacks in a while so only just noticed
---
You're not meant to turn them in one at a time anymore. You have to keep finding new ones after each turn in if you wanted to do it more than once
---
To be fair, two weeks ago people were busy reporting on Anthem and then Alex, two games that actually have a chance of surviving their first six months. FO76 is old new, the player base has dropped drastically since launch, and wasting time on it isn’t a good decision for smaller content creators. They have to report on what’s popular, FO76 just isn’t. Really the only reason they probably covered it is that most of them grew their channels on Bethesda games.
---
Secondly, this is a major issue that a select portion of the community chose to suppress and ignore on the platform in favor of making excuses. Bethesda has shown no good faith toward their customers up to this point, and we have no reason to take their word now. Spokespeople and even top executive said the atom shop would be purely for cosmetic items. The unstoppables event proved they are willing to go back on their word. With the data mined information for lunch boxes that are already coded to be atom shop items, the community has to ask itself if we are willing to allow p2w systems into a multiplayer fallout game. 15 hp may not be much now, but what happens if you can pay 500 atoms for a lunch box to increase damage or damage resistance?
---
Zenimax OWNS Bethesda, that's why they had "help" from Zenimax at developing Fo76
---
It depends on the build tho, I was at like lvl 46 when I fought the SBQ, my stealth build could already take down two SB one lvl 50 and the other 85 in less then 30 secs. I just crouched there with my Anti-Armor Handmade and did heaps of damage to the queen(while not wearing PA).
---
I've seen people say they use a friend have them hold the tech data and give you one at a time and you'll both get the rewards
---
They should have just wiped the inventories of anyone with impossible amounts of nuka cola of orbital strikes, or anyone with over  2 or 5 or whatever of the same legendary gun or armour peice.
---
Seeing as I had a lot of 10mm ammo, and by that I mean probably around 6k, I decided to shred it all a week ago by using the Perfect Storm on scorthbeasts, deathclaws and behemoths and it took me down to 1k later that week and then I went offline for a few days; now just a few days ago I heard about the ban wave and rushed on to see if I was good and everything was squeaky clean and better than before with the recent update. It is as it goes I guess, those who cheat will be caught and those who don’t cheat won’t.
---
You can only turn in “one” at a time. 
---
If you collect more than one, it does not show a quantity.  
---
If you collect one, then turn it on you get 350 exp and some item rewards.  
---
If you collect more than one, then turn it in you get 400 exp.
---
No exp increase for 3 or more. 
---
If you collect more than one and switch servers or log out before turning them in it will “reset” to one and only give you 350 exp unless you find more before turning them in on the new server. 
---
Yeah. I also have an issue with scrapping weapons/armour and not getting the basic materials that went into crafting them, even if a lot less.
---
Something is definately bugged, before the latest patch my deathclaw gauntlet was around 2k damage, after patch it went to around 1.5k due to adrenal reaction bug, today it's at 4.1k?
---
Go buy the game for $20 and do it on an alt account. You accused people of being ignorant.However unless you do this then you are just as ignorant yourself (look up the word). And I'm not disagreeing that it isn't a possibility. But without direct evidence then it's just baseless conjecture. The whole "some people are thinking" thing isn't a valid criticism if it is never shown to be true or false.
---
And for couple of weeks it was combined with the effect of excavator PA acting like with calibrated shocks when you login in it and before exiting out of it so it was kind of nice.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Full disclosure I have not done this quest yet I just remember seeing post on here about it.
---
Oh u sir talking in k. F
---
Thanks for clearing that up 
---
F 
---

---
   T 
---
NO!
---
I saw a post similar I while ago that’s what confused me about it I don’t think it works tho
---
And it's gone!
---
Can you place a camp nearby?
---
Amen, it’s pretty simple to just play the damn game without cheating. I genuinely don’t get it. Happy hunting wastelanders!
---
It's like that redhat kid incident, jumping to conclusions until all the facts are in.
---
Or just have a friend who isn't on your team help out
---
Up high! 
---
down low! 
---
::pulls hand back::
---
Too slow!
---
::crosses arms smugly::
---
I think so I have not tried it because I have my camp already set up in a place permanently 
---
Try using berry mentats. I’ve heard it works well at highlighting people invisible/using stealth.
---
Have you played Conan? What's your thoughts?
---
No, I’m not made of money. I’m not ignorant mate, YOU need to look up the word. I never said that ammo being counted twice if picked up twice was a sure thing, I said that’s what people are speculating and Bethesda hasn’t denied it. I specified this and you ignored it.
---
I think this was possible if you gathered up a bunch before joining the BOS and stashed them.  But I also think they purged excess Tech Data from players a short time ago causing them to drop on the ground (not in bags) when you logged in next.  
---
Melee is very strong.
---
My favs from the early game were the machete and pitchfork (even a board is pretty good if you get your timing down to land hits)... I think that a regular sledgehammer is pretty good too because it should result in knockdowns (but not one of my favs). 
---
I'm in the same boat. My camp is at twin lakes so I can farm purified water
---
Yeah I wish I had. Thanks, made me smile.
---
Hopefully two shot explosive for the gatling or shotgun, something high damage like a super sledge for melee. What time are you launching it?
---
That blows I have a shit ton of tech data I've been saving for this quest
---
you come close to what i posted a while ago.  i am not much into PvP.  i wanted more group PvE.
---
with that said, i was REALLY looking forward to what you called, impromptu towns.  sort of being able to "snap" your CAMPs together.  like building a CAMP, you "snap" parts into place.
---
when you get enough CAMPs together, that allows you to erect "specialized" buildings.  eg.  2 CAMPS are put together, you can now build a brahmin pit.  5 CAMPs, you get a storehouse, a sort of community chest that all players of the "town" can access and use.  put a cap on it.  25 players per town.  i could go on and on with this, but i already did in my post.
---
i am in the same boat as you, just from a group PvE point of view.
---
i even thought we were going to have a "global" travel.  instead of being stuck in just WV, we could go back to DC, Boston, Las Vegas.  WV, great place for food.  Las Vegas, VERY food poor, need to trade for it if you spend most of your time there, or haul it with you if on vacation.
---
this game has sooo much potential, but what we got was a mere skeleton, with broken bones to boot.
---
i have loved all the fallout games, till now.  this was a BIG let down, but like you said, there is still time to fix things, improve things, and possibly bring in more players, new and old.
---
i bought the game 12 1 18, have about 400hrs logged in so far, on 2 characters.  was REALLY sucks for me is that 90% of my game time is spent solo.  my 2nd character was designed specifically for a group, and all the discord servers are empty.  when i approach some one in game, they run, or server hop, or just flat out ignore me!  lol
---
i only got 4 people left on my friends list because every one else has quit.  this is just fallout 5 for me, NOT a multiplayer game.  
---
i am retired, so i get A LOT of play time in. 8 - 10hrs a day if i choose.  i may skip a day here and there for RL stuff.  during my play time, i usually could find 1 person, with a mic, who actually talked and we would co-ordinate our game play.  now, since patch 6, i find myself the only person on the server after just a few hours of game play!!!  UNREAL!  a couple of nights ago, i was the only one on a server, and i sat on the converted ammo dump for like 10hrs.  made around 3000 shotgun shells.  makes me think that 900hrs guy is legit with all his ammo.  because if a player can sit in a server, all alone, you can RAKE in what ever resource you are grinding, i know, i have done it.
---
well, like you, this is getting longer than i intended, so..............................................
---
end transmission.
---
ONLY if you showed how to get it, on YouTube.. 👍
---
I’m not 100% sure on that part. But a few weeks back after an update my friends and I logged in and we all saw loose Tech Data items sitting at our feet and we couldn’t pick them up.  And I read a bit on reddit here about others reporting the same purge.  
---
Most certainly 100K of butthurt ammo would get you banned unless butthurt ammo isn’t considered rare
---
Turn on Pacifist mode.  You can’t accidentally hit people.
---
You don't have to follow all of them... just pick 1 or 2.
---
You could argue basic wear and tear; springs and gears reduced to basic scrap, etc. Not so with basics like oil. 
---
I just want more weapon and armor skins. That's it, that's all.
---
Oh shit
---
yup!!  for me, it was the PvE-RP part.  EXACTLY what i was looking for!
---
Yeah, 900 Hours Guy
---
Nice job!
---
Doesn't his ban kind of do that for me, though?
---
I cannot even believe some people would be upset with this or even consider it P2W. They buff was negligible at best and no more that what you could by running and sharing some Charisma perks. I people really that sensitive!
---
It was fun running around in a group like superheros but that's all it was, a time limited experience and no real money was exchanged. Sheesh  
---
There's a bunch of threads on this as well. Put technical data in the search bar at the top, and you'll see. This comes up quite often, because people "mysteriously" lose a whole giant stack at a time.
---
Wilful omission is misinformation.
---
I have had nothing drop more than a few times and regular weapons drop
---
Monty Python
---
Way to stick it to Bethesda you absolute madlad, keep spreading the good word fallout warrior *tips fedora* we will show them the power of us gamers when faced with injustice!
---
Nice tip... gotta try this today
---
Play something good instead
---
Very thoughtful post. Thanks for sharing.
---
That's normal. Well it shouldn't be normal but it is. Mole rats will pop out like that on top of structures too.
---
The issue with the workshops is enemies that don't burrow underground, like liberator bots, are physically underground so there's no way to kill them.  They spawn there and get stuck.  Sometimes if you're lucky they're near the surface and you can just throw a molotov cocktail on them and the radius blast from it will get them but not always.
---
yup.  PvE sandbox guy agrees with you wholeheartedly.  
---
lmfao, i bet the PvP'erS came in here to fo76 and went "WHAT THE FUCK?????"  
---
Hitting R1 (bash) on ps4 works for me. Alot quicker
---
Sounds like you were caught cheating, especially to amass over 100,000 rare items in 30 days on one account and then made another account and didn't he same thing. 
---
No way. Me too!
---
Nemo?
---
Let's call it.....The "Konami code avoiders club". 😉
---
Since when is $20 being made of money? So what is Bill Gates made out of then?
---
And yes, you are ignorant, matey. It means "not having knowledge". You have zero knowledge as to whether this is true or not. Hence your "some people are thinking". Given the opportunity to acquire said knowledge, you turned it down. Textbook definition of ignorance.
---
Ill do that next time cheers
---
Whenever I hear "this game is shit", on live, reddit or the internet in general, it usually means: This game is really good, it's not COD and it doesn't hold your hand the entire time
---
Just look at what's been the "hits" lately: Fortnite, BLOPS 4, Apex, all of which are pretty much copy and pasted versions of the exact same thing.
---
Go opposite the crowd, it works in investing too.
---
At the time, he was the first guy I met while I was in that play session (Mind you I haven't been playing for like a month) an I accidently hit him while exiting trading. I do like pvp so I kept it on. It's just he killed me almost instantly so I had no time to react.
---
Do you have adrenal reaction? Removed and reapplied post patch 6?
---
If yes, Are you completely starving yourself to zero?
---
If yes, Are you at low health? 
---
If yes, do you have any meds active? Because some just nullify it.
---
If no, check whatever you have active.
---
All in all, you are not missing out on much, except the risky glass cannon experience.
---
Exactly. I feel like this would be relatively easy to add.
---
I’m saying I’m not wasting $20.
---
I’m not ignorant. Ignorant does not mean to not have knowledge, it means to ignore the facts. Hence, “ignor”ant. And I’m not ignorant because I never claimed what I said as fact. I specified that it was a speculation that had merit, had not been denied by Bethesda and therefor directly contradicts all the people trying to say that every single banned user was a cheater in some way.
---
They need to put this in game and have it cost next to nothing in caps. Like 1 cap per level you have, and it needs to reset your SPECIAL and perk picks. If they put this in the store that would break their 'only cosmetics in the store' promise.
---
You probably should have some help forming them, because your opinions are shit
---
I wouldn't mind if they gave us a separate storage option for foods and drinks. Store your nuka colas in a vending machine, and set your price for wary travelers.. Place some burgers or steaks in an ice box where people can pay CAPS to eat... etc.
---
Now THATS a horde event! Heck yeah!
---
I get it.  But the money is gone at this point.  No amount of being bitter brings it back.  We've all made what we thought were bad purchases.  You just move on.  Also, if you can only buy two games a year, maybe don't buy games at launch?
---
I'm not saying put it in the store. It was just a way of me saying "omg I'd even use my atoms on it" as like I really want it. Not great example haha
---
Lolz maybe you missed this, but many duper’s rampantly worked to destabilize the gaming platform, by lining their pockets by created millions of duplicated virtual items. And in the process ruined people’s perception of the game.
---
More importantly, If you really hated the gaming experience and gameplay why didn’t you just stop playing?
---
Or do you feel so wronged of losing $80, it required you to demand justice?
---
Fwiw, if I bought stuff on amazon and I’m not happy, I’m able to return or exchange most stuff.
---
I didn’t buy this through amazon but I knew that going in.
---
ig·no·rant  (ĭg′nər-ənt)

1. Lacking education or knowledge.

2. Showing or arising from a lack of education or knowledge: an ignorant mistake.

3. Unaware or uninformed: was ignorant of the drug's harmful effects.

Just caps.
---
It’s impossible for an opinion to be shit and regardless, mine was formed after looking at facts. The old engine was reused, the scorchbeasts code is LITERALLY copy pasted from the dragons in Skyrim with a reskin, there’s still lag in a lot of areas around the game world, there’s very little content, there were game breaking glitches and duplication exploits for months... I could go on for a long time.
---
Also, I think I should point out that you’re a cunt. Good day sir.
---
Not surprising.
---
600 hours in and I have never been attacked by someone using a stealth boy. 
---
I would think that something to the tune of ["I used macros to exploit server mechanics that are the same ones that you would use to dupe items"](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900_hours_played_my_favorite_farming_locations/egohig8)  would be enough proof, but that's just me. Regardless of whether he duped the ammo or crafted it, he was definitely exploiting a mechanic to craft them if that's what he was doing.
---
Make it more it doesn't matter the main thing is that have the ability to test the patches before they go live to the majority of the player base
---
They r “full” of blood after they attack u. When u kill em when they r “bloated” they explode.    Wait a few seconds till they slim down again in between attacks then kill them.  They won’t explode
---
Cheers
---
The word ignorant means what I said it means. Fact. You also just ignored the rest of my post because you know I’m right.
---
me too thanks
---
I also work in customer service. I'm the first guy many people get when you call in...I can discount whatever I want, give you discounts on a new purchase, schedule service to fix your stuff... Just about anything that my supervisor can. They're actually a supervisor, there in case I have questions.
---
We get annoyed when you complain, and ask to speak to our boss, because alternatively, you could have just asked me nicely and is have helped. People who are jerks usually get passed along to my boss along with a note saying, "I've offered them this already. Please offer it to them again."
---
Being an ass doesn't get you better treatment, it means you get the exact same treatment, but you're an ass.
---
The real tip? Be patient and polite, just don't hang up. All if there are other solutions. Believe is if we say no. We get in trouble if we like. I don't give two shits what you think of me, why would I lie to you? I care more about making you happy so you don't have to call back.
---
If you're taking workshops for realism or because you want to PvP someone you shouldn't be surprised when people aren't stoked on you showing up and stealing their shit. For a real fight, find a player who wants to fight back. You'll have the souped up PvP server soon where by default you'll be encountering similarly minded players. Some people play fallout to relax, others to kill, some to get rich, to each their own 
---
Imagine banning one of the very few people who enjoy 76 to that extent
---
For duping in a game where the pvp is optional :^) 
---
I was reading that if you are starving and/or thirsty, the damage goes up to where it should be.. maybe even higher
---
He meant to say that he's full of shit and that this isn't a thing, but apparently made a typo and wrote that instead. 
---
He was banned first. Then the story. He was one of the very first to recieve the ban, so he was likely 1 of the biggest offenders.
---
But that does not solve the problem of a nearly worthless currency. The economy is broken. I’ve seen so many people with items that I need, unwilling to trade for anything other than the exact items they want/need. I’m looking for some 3* armor (L arm/leg) with good rolls but can’t buy it as I don’t have the AAE/BE  weapon they are looking for and caps are worthless to them. Junk is easy enough to come by. Allow re-rolls with junk and junk becomes currency and caps will have even less worth. You would need to collect enough of a specific resource that it would require your entire stash to trade for a valuable item. That or everyone hoards it so they can just endlessly roll what they have and the trade system dies a bit more.
---
what really gets me is this.....
---
i do A LOT of bulking.  that is how i make my money.  how is it i can bulk acid in plastic?  lol
---
They usually release sometime in the morning/afternoon Eastern time 9, 10, 11 AM ish?
---
Its not having 100k total over 30 days. Its having 100k at once, at any point in the last 30 days.
---
1/ No, it means what we as a society of human beings agree on that it means. Also known as the dictionary definition. Your personal meaning can take a hike. 
---
2/ You will win when you show that people trading are unfairly getting banned, which is what you "speculated" after calling people ignorant
---
In game trading between players, using the actual trade function, is basically the same as trading with a npc vendor. You can buy or sell for caps, but you can't trade something like a shotgun in exchange for 100 stimpacks. 
---
Most of the trading that I have seen while playing
---
The email said both accounts were banned.
---
Technically, the outfits add zero buffs and are purely cosmetic.  There was a limited time in game event that gave people a tiny buff for wearing super hero costumes.  Every week there's a limited time event that gives you a very tiny buff for doing something special.  
---
So if you want to get technical, you're technically wrong since the outfits themselves didn't provide any advantage and technically were purely cosmetic. Now that the event is over, you get zero benefit for wearing the costume since it provides zero benefit.

I don’t need to. You can do it. I don’t give a shit about proving that some of them are false, I was only proving that you don’t know you’re right and I’ve done that.
---
Inferiority complexes are common by the way. See a phsychiatrist or something, it’ll help.
---
Suspended, they weren't banned but suspended. I honestly wouldnt blame them if they didn't come back based on posts from the community such as this. 
---
The sheer amount of stablw flux needed to make over 100k ultracute ammo is insane
---
Second one
---
I mean, self-admitting that [macros were used to get more resources than normally possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900_hours_played_my_favorite_farming_locations/egohig8) by exploiting a very generous server compensation mechanic, regardless of the fact that these macro's/actions are the literal same to get the duping glitch, proves that he was banned for a reason. Even if he wasn't "duping" he was definitely abusing a bug for crafting mats.
---
ha ha!  just watched that episode.........aaaaaaand ITS GONE!!!
---
Good ol circle jerk, only allowed when it's for a witch hunt. 
---
You immediately deleted upon recieving them or held them for a period of time?  Did you use any of the nuka colas?  Idk if it's even possible for Bethesda to do this but would any account associated with you show a huge spike in total caps right around the time the duped nuka was being passed around?
---
Was this the only time your friend gave you an illegitimate item or did he trade you other duped stuff?
---
I ask this because the email 900hr guy posted indicates an account "associated" with an account suspended for duping gets suspended as well.
---
Yes but not worth imo. 
---
This.  Unless someone pops off to me I generally leave them alone.  But I get why people want to grief.  It’s really more of an annoyance than anything else for the way I like to play.  That’s why they need a separate PVE server and separate PVE server.  If you want to kill and grief other players have at it - with other like minded players.  That might even be fun to check out.  But the current setup doesn’t mix well especially if you are lower level trying to learn your way and level up.  I’m 113 so don’t worry much about griefers but every once in a while it can be a pain in the ass. 
---
As a wise person once told me. Eat those berry mentats, and stealth boy will light up like a christmas tree.
---
If you are on Xbox I might be able to help. I don't have an extra copy but I could keep my eyes out send craft one for you in the meantime.
---
It does, yes!
---
Make that PVP server and PVE server.  Stoopid me 
---
I appreciate it, but PS4. Thank you, though!
---
My character build was not done at lvl 50, but may be close at lvl 160.
---
I did find myself getting lost and not knowing what to do next at times, but what always drew me back in was picking up some new to me weapon/perk, learning how to use it: any shotgun with the enforcer perk is a good time, the gauss rifle took some getting used to (but now I love it), gatling plasmas are super fun (although not something that I keep)... even a lowly boxing glove (w/ swing speed) because my favorite way to play the game for looooong time!
---
Each new weapon made each area/encounter a new experience = fun.
---
After I found a preferred weapon, I would learn mods to tweak them to my preferred play style.
---
Now that my build is pretty much settled I have started dabbling with PVP: it can be invigorating, far more challenging and varied then any content that could be added to the game, imho.
---
What’s the problem with Anthem?
---
How about new items introduced into the game and not in the atom shop
---
It’s gone.. it’s all gone.
---
Fireproof and dense mod for 100% explosive resistance.
---
I get what you're saying, with leveling, as I'm level 81, and when I get to my loot runs every day, theres always that day when the fouls are leveled to level 9 and 20. Its really annoying, tbh
---
So they're not big and red when they go poof? That shouldn't happen I think. Although, I see more and more bodies of mobs disappearing and turning into meat piles very quickly. Sometimes it happens right after death, sometimes they stick around a bit. Not sure what triggers it.
---
I always lose tick bodies in tall grass though. They're so hard to see in the bog. As a sniper, I'm usually a little ways away from them when they die. Unless I have a point of reference (ex. behind rusted truck bumper), I've stopped trying to look for them.
---
My prefered place to farm tick blood is near vault 76. At least I can see them easier and the grass isn't as tall.
---
Nobody's taking the feeling of killing something away, it would still be there
---
About rerolling the mods, it might be too easy way to get the ultimate legendary but in some specific conditions it might be ok. Modus point would be a must considering it should be allowed only at end game
---
Same as the pick flowers challenge that literally would show flowers had been picked one minute and then reset to nothing the next.
---
Shrug and move on.
---
I think that’s more than I’ve played in the last month.  I don’t think I’m banned though?  I don’t even know how to dupe and I’ve never traded with anyone so I’m going to guess not.  I haven’t gotten an email regarding it but I also haven’t attempted to login since the bans started rolling out.
---
Well, you're right. I don't know what I don't know. And I have never made any claims contrary to that. I'm happy to admit I have no idea if people are getting banned unfairly. I haven't come to any kind of conclusion one way or the other, and given the complete lack of evidence to support this claim, I will keep an open mind about it going forward. #YOLO
---
How about remove the Cap cost to travel to group events?
---
Haha good point
---
I know they intended these to be big draws for server-wide participation, but I almost never see another person in the events I do. I think they need to take a hard look at the "community events" idea and reconsider letting players launch these with a personal cooldown.
---
The problem I see is most players either don’t understand how to trade or don’t want to trade.  Every once in a while I encounter a good experience - like the lvl 250 guy looking to unload some of his weapons for a reasonable price - but most of the time I get a thumbs down on requests.  And as a 100+ lvl guy I have some decent things to trade as well. 
---
Not really sure tbh you’re probably better off waiting for an email from Bethesda. If you didn’t actually dupe then I don’t think you’ll be banned permanently, just suspended until they fix the glitch.. but I’ll be honest they’re not the quickest at patching things so idk 
---
Or its just not there at all once you fast travel.
---
I don’t understand why people go to all these lengths to make builds that turn 3 shot enemies into 1 shot enemies, but then complain when something changes and now some enemies take two shots. I don’t have a single dmg+ perk besides bloody mess and and the game is not hard. 
---
&gt;Time and dedication to get a full set
---
Me, who just server-hopped for an hour outside the Shack near Mama Dolce's to get a full set of T-45 Power Armor when I was only Level 15: Ehhhhhh, technically yes but not really
---
Someone tested here in pvp and there's no difference. They were shooting a wall and measuring the distance another player was getting hit at. Same distance with and without the perk card maxed. 
---
Yeah I go to the lumber mill and the little cabin up the hill with moonshine set up.. they respawn relatively regularly so I go back and forth.. I make a conscious effort to whack em away from tall grass..  annoying little suckers
---
Im back i built a camp on my main in honor of him but I started a new character,i plan on playing the old one from time to time but i still need time to heal. Saw pictures from the funeral and it made me happy honestly he was cremated and they put him in his favorite Yeti container it was extremely redneck but i know he would have loved it.
---
-Separate chems/food/drink/bobbles/magazines
---
-Fix water purifiers to hold more water and actually work as intended 60 hr doesn't happen
---
-Fix buff on SQB 
---
I used a lever action and meathook to get my first SBQ in someone else's nuke event at level 25 on my alt. Depends on the weapon/armor/build. 
---
WHOA, WE'RE ALL NOT CHEATERS! HOORAY! FREE NUKA-COLA AT MY CAMP! 
---
I feel like Bethesda should have tech in place that detects cheaters who used duping methods... There are actually innocent people who now can't play the game. 
---
Something similar was posted while back, but was in Charleston near AVR I believe. Ive seen behemoths at WS, but no horde.
---
Fast and tenatious is how I like to describe them. It's like keeping a fat kid away from cake. 😜
---
1. I like that you have to use caps to travel because there is literally nothing in this game that i use caps for. I've been sitting around max caps for a few weeks now.
---
2. I do agree that events need polishing but most events in the game drop possibly the rarest to get items in the game i.e. Plans, outfits 
---
3. Chameleon is less of a pve thing and more for pvp because when you have chameleon active you are harder to see and can't be targeted in vats.
---
4. It's not a high level's fault that you are encountering high level enemies. Its the areas you are visiting that is linked to enemy levels.
---
5. calling for help is really only for when you are doing an event and/or in a team. its not meant to be broadcasted to the world so IMO complaining that future doesn't really make any sense.
---
with everything else I pretty much agree with. Especially the text chat feature for PC. Makes no sense why it's not a thing.
---
Perk card presets (or more passive traits)
---
Personal cooldown for events but we trigger them ourselves
---
Ammo scrapping
---
Find one spot where you can get food and water quickly and don’t be afraid to fast travel there quickly at the start of a play session to make 50 soups so you don’t have to sweat about hunger and thirst for several hours. 
---
There’s a farm and a workshop near the Nuka cola plant I frequent for this. Hundreds of corn and razor grain with water near by. 
---
Obviously you still do
---
Thinks they are able to read, fails to understand what they are reading. Makes typical reply. 
---
Caps is junk that makes it easier to trade for other junk (instead of bartering)
---
Run! It's a stampede!
---
so what you're saying is we need a Noise Marine skin
---
1) Perk Load Out
---
2) Buffed SPECIAL to  allow additional perks to be temporarily activated.
---
3) More EPIC battle spots
---
&gt; Bethesda did not deliver a complete, polished product on release, for full price. Then they dropped the price by almost half two weeks later.
---
See, this is what I'm talking about. No, Bethesda did not drop the price. The stores did. Bethesda has nothing to do over what stores sell the games at. 
---
Yes, the game didn't sell as well as they wanted. Stores wanted to clear out copies. So stores dropped the prices. Sorry. Cause it's still the same price on their website. If they had lowered the price, they would have lowered it there.
---
Shut your nuke hole.
---
You thought this game was going to allow you to travel to all previous locations from every Fallout game? And were disappointed when it didnt happen?
---
Ha!
---
Man, that's 100% on you. 
---
Bethesda never promised that. And I don't even stalk every interview or article or whatever that has ever been put out. I just know that it's TRUE because that has to be the most impossibly entitled expectation I have literally ever seen. 
---
Got a banjo in there? I play a mean banjo. I'll be sure to bring my cop outfit
---
&gt;I'm not sure if to wait to see if after later world re-join it appears again or I have to rebuild everything (stored).
---
It takes a couple minutes to join a new server and see if your CAMP is placed.  Well worth it to check before attempting to relocate your CAMP.  Cause once you relocate it, it's all stored and you cannot just pop it up automatically at your old spot by changing servers.
---
Gaaaaaaaaaaary
---
I said, you aren't keeping yourself up to date on what's going on. Since you failed in your first sentence to show you are actually reading, what point is there of replying? You didn't read, you went to posting. 
---
Later.
---
Science!
---
Only place I've seen them is on then railcar and NAR by watoga station. Seen them twice in maybe 50+ reboots.
---
PS though...
---
If you're on PS4, I'll play with you. 
---
I'm either HRockit or Manta__Man (2 spaces)
---
:) own your post. Don't get defensive about it.
---
Solid list!
---
\- Purified water HELL YES
---
\- AquaBoy No rads from water ever.
---
\- You could also reduce the annoyance of caps to travel and events by making the events free fast travel points. A timer would also be incredibly helpful.
---
\- Chameleon rocks in PVP. "Hello from the shadows Mr. 420skate69 bloodied melee. I'd like to thank you for your caps donation. Please seek revenge and have a great day."
---
\- Don't play on PC but it makes total sense.
---
\- " no level scaling of any kind " This one works both ways. We also need level 100+ creatures as the current cap is not difficult enough. IMO the forest is way too big and anything outside that should scale higher. It's the only region I never fully explored because I out-leveled it quickly. Maybe another option is server levels?
---
\- This is really bigger than just call for help. We need a way to group up whether that's clans, a player hub, factions, something.
---
I actually hopped onto another server the moment I saw the base is gone (and was on the server for about 2 minutes). I hope that didn't rewrite the state, I will wait for it to appear a bit longer however.
---
Woah dude that’s like fucking awesome
---
Yep her name is Rachel
---
If you like Fallout for the rpg and choices, you won't like this
---
If you like Fallout 4's shooting, building, scavenging, and survival, you'll like this
---
I stopped calling for help after I tried it at the queen, a player just stood there, watched me die, then looted my junk while I was loading back in
---
To get just the raw flux needed for all the ultracite ammo wouldnt the guy have needed to launch something like 14 nukes a day, every day since the game came out?
---
Yep coming in March.
---
I did like that 
---
You see conspiracies everywhere dude, referencing the CIA when talking about mods on a forum? Wtf are you smoking dude.
---
Can you find a team in game, or do you have to have friends playing the game? None of my friends play it, and I love co op games. 
---
&gt;I like that you have to use caps to travel because there is literally nothing in this game that i use caps for. I've been sitting around max caps for a few weeks now.
---
What a ridiculous defense... As I said, this was not a feature in any previous Fallout game and it doesn't make any sense. Who are you paying it to? 
---
&gt;It's not a high level's fault that you are encountering high level enemies. Its the areas you are visiting that is linked to enemy levels.
---
I never said anything about it being someone's fault? All I said was that it happens. It's kind of ridiculous... It can also happen anywhere so it's not locked by region, FYI.
---
Fallout has always seemed very easy to me, so I get extended fun out of playing with self imposed restrictions (no fast travel always being one of may favorites). Good list!
---
&gt;hard to feel sympathy for anyone that is actively suppressing information
---
Except no information was suppressed, and there are more reasons than that, for example not having to deal with a thousand toxic reddit users. Which you make a pretty good example off right now.
---
Me opening my loot box:
---
You have received:
---
1 Stimpak
---
1 Rad X
---
\*\*\* Ghoul Slayer's Wood Left Leg
---
A couple times. I have to log out of the server and back into one if it happens 
---
I enjoyed reading your post and found it lol funny...  but if you're playing on the PC you can use the number keys to quickly swap weapons.
---
It's easy to find players to play with it you have mic, I had 0 friends on ps4 befor fallout 76, after I have 5 and 2 of them I play other games with. 
---
Well, the defense waves ctually spawn nuked creatures in nuke zones so that's one reason. And if you are two people you can keep taking it from eachother to spawn more enemies. Try nuking Grafton Steel sometime for infinite supermutants and a workshop with ghoul/angler spawns
---
It is possible to team up with strangers too!
---
those were given as an example.  you read too much into it.
---
You can have multiple in your inv but ONLY if you haven’t started the BOS quest line and if you get some from a friend who hasn’t started the quest line and he has multiple they don’t count as the right tech data. They’re just stacked and the quest doesn’t start. 
---
F in chat to our fallen brother
---
Yes! So you can team with ransoms in the waste land with proxi chat. There’s also emotes to communicate. The games true fun if you can find the fun in it. Don’t go around expecting that if you don the main quest as bare minimum you won’t be ready for anything. You HAVE to do side quests to level up. The games practically dependent on side quests. 
---
      I hope this helps!
---
You know you can edit your original comment, right?
---
How does this work? Asking because im thinking about getting electrically charged. 
---
Oh I toted one for dozens hours.  Back when there was early discussions about them.  I just never had it work and never noticed one fired when I wasn't watching for it.  They just don't stay lit long enough for folks to notice or ping the map.
---
Eh.. Are you saying you beat Contra without the code? 
---
If I have it on me I am currently using it when it comes to weapons and armour.  It never occurs to me to try trading stuff with the other people I bump into while out and about.
---
The sooner player vendors are a thing the better as far as I am concerned.
---
5$ is nothing. That's one coffee. Yes the game isn't the best but in no way should it be cheaper 
---
Mine is gone almost every time I launch the game.  I leave the area and come back and the base is rendered.  Been awhile since the game said it couldn't place it.  But my home is remote.
---
It wasn't the outfit that buffed the stats, it was the event. You're not wrong in your statement about the shop not having items that change your stats except for everything about that statement. The only reason I bother to mention it is because you're so fiercely insisting it happened and it's terrible. Wouldn't it be nice if you were wrong and it wasn't like that at all? I have great news...! As to weather events that modify stats should be tied to Atom Shop purchases, that's another argument entirely. (It's still sleazy but it's not going back on their word... technically.)  But, dear ScientistRickSanchez, I assume you already knew that and your war on "fake news" extends beyond Appalachia. Ride off, young troll. The bait has been taken.
---
~~ yoooouuuu ssuuuuuckkk ~~
---
This and the moliminers is bugged for me 
---
damn, pc here
---
Ive yet to odficially team up but have unofficially teamed up with people along the way. Its fun. 
---
Tell him on Twitter. I told him once how much I liked FO4s score and he said thank you lol
---
Does the grenadier perk apply to explosive weapons too?
---
Turns out this guy cheated 300K ultracite ammo
---
Yeah some are a bit of a drag sometimes. I’d probably be bored with the game too if i got to level 200 in a a few months. I get that you played a lot of it because you liked it. Nothing wrong with that. Just not my style and I don’t think you should be surprised that there isn’t content yet. I doubt the Bethesda employees work as long in the day as some of you guys play the game.
---
There is more than one explanation depending pn your opponent's setup. Each one has its counters.
---
Also keep in mind, explosive damage is completly useless in pvp, because of dense mods and fireproof. Having said that, Do not rely on explosives to land your shots, ballistic/energy damage is considered only. For example, if you are shooting a pump action explosive shotgun at your opponent at mid range, you will be depending on the ballistics only, which range reduction effects would make the pellets do little to no damage.
---
That out of the way, you got loads to consider.
---
First; Sentinel assassin/caviler; Counter with critical or stagger
---
High damage resistance; T51b most likely, Counter: AA weapons. Cuts through like a burning knife on butter.
---
Unyielding/Bolstering; These come with low health, but can hold up their health as good as a player with full health. Counter; Radium/gamma guns, Criticals. Molotovs, perfect storm and bleed effects lethal to low health builds.
---
chameleom/stealth boy; Berry mentats.
---
Dodgy is a perk that reduces damage with AP, Counter with high rate of fire for faster AP consumption.
---
Those are the meta defence builds that I come across.
---
We're not all dicks in Appalachia, but there are dicks. If you fell beside me in a queen fight (or otherwise) I'd get you back on your feet. Don't let the dick bags get the best of you.
---
Your only other example was not being able to link up CAMPS into mega towns, which is also pretty unrealistic though too. 
---
Please remove his username from your post. No need for that.
---
Ah, alright
---
Done, didn't realise how cunty it was until later haha
---
Is it really that dead?
---
I play a mix of in the middle of the day and super late at night times and there is always at least 20 people always on. 
---
I'm sorry. That's lame. 
---
All but a few letters are up by Sunday, the codes reset on Tuesday.
---
The folks defending BS haven’t once replied to a person that used the source you just quoted. They’re just ignoring it and deciding to die on this hill for a multi-million dollar company that has recently been exploiting its fans.
---
Upvote for use of dick while having that name..!
---
As for re-rolls on legendaries I agree, good idea when it'll be correctly implemented, but that fragment about "awesome feeling you get after you kill a legendary minion" made my day - I have absolutely no expectation towards good loot - this game has totally fucked up loot system, when you can't get 3\*\*\* legendaries from most difficult enemy from the game (SBQ) - few days ago I've looted 2\*\* nocturnal robot leg from SBQ - WTF?!?!
---
1 failed fight yesterday - I joined the server very late and didn't know how far into the event it was, got there with 2-3 minutes and she was still more than 1/2 health, but post her healing.  Did dent her in the process but there wasn't enough time.
---
2nd fight was a cluster-f...  but it was a novice nuke, hit dead center on the prime so there was no option but to wade into the middle.  Broke my All Rise, broke my gatling, and was left with my AA Handmade...  noticed others were still doing damage so I laid off on the queen and cleared some of the other stuff around.  Got it done but left the bog with 2 rounds of 5.56!  We had it all - mirelurk queens/kings, wendigos, yao guai, etc.  To be honest I was worried, didn't seem like the average level of the players that showed up was 100+, more like 60-80 if you averaged them.
---
This is my 2nd build/character though so he's 58/59 in those fights, but if I didn't have to do the 2nd queen in the nuke zone, the unarmed damage is his primary tool.  Instead I had to use PA.  Emergency Protocols probably saved me a couple of times in the 2nd fight.
---
You know it's true that's why you couldn't even respond with any reasons why it's better. Hahaha
---
Lolz I see what you did.. well played sir. Well played and upvoting.
---
There is a good guide to deciphering/decrypting [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9/stepbystep_guide_to_decrypting_launch_codes/).
---
It's pretty fun, good luck!
---
She supposedly had her loot table fixed in the last patch but I haven’t had time to play. But that’s a first for me, typically the majority of the server jumps in for a SBQ battle, even some of the lower levels jump in to try and tag her(and make the fight harder for us)
---
It was a glitch that was likely patched 
---
Agree mostly, but Purified Water is for chemisty too, so kinda would make sense if you actually COULDN’T drink it and was maybe called “distilled water” and so rename boiled to purified (else makes less sense out of a purifier) and have that for drinking, distilled water for chemisty and make that a seperate crafted item, requiring Chemist perk etc.
---
I just deleted a comment myself. I was being snarky at you when I meant to be snarky at people roasting you. This was 5 minutes ago, not the deleted one you're referring to but you might see its notification soon.  My point, minus snark, is that the item didn't grant the buff, the event did. Yes the event relied on Atom Shop items but show me their buff now, it's not existent or been removed. The HP was from event and not item. They're slimy but not liars in this case, imo.
---
No.....is that what a tax refund is?
---
1. Defense? who am i defending just stated an opinion never said it was a good idea that you have to use caps just said that I liked it. 
---
2.   It can't happen anywhere and thats a fact. The way that enemy levels work in the game is that certain areas   
---
of the map will have 'level pools' for example an area of the map can only spawn level 4,9,18 (nothing   
---
generally in between)enemies. However, it's not because that a high level player is in ur server that ur getting   
---
high level enemies
---
I want a middle finger emote for griefers. Can we get that?
---
One more day 😢
---
So the thing about all these posts that notoriously get upvoted so highly in hate circlejerk reddits is that they’re usually lying for karma from the circlejerk...
---
Yeah, this guy cheated over 300K ultracite ammo despite never even having “over 36k of any ammo” as said in his post. Dude blatantly lied and got caught and was hoping his bluff wouldn’t be called.
---
If you want to hate the game, thats fine. You really should make sure you’re using legitimate examples and not some cheater farming reddit karma for lying in favor of the circlejerks agenda. It takes away from any point you’re trying to make. Your comment is now basically “wow bethesda banned a cheater what shitheads.” 
---
It’s because Bethesda employees care. 
---
I want a Nuka Cola machine that stores my extra colas.
---
I don't have the discipline for this, but great writeup!
---
He is apparently bedridden for whatever reason. Still not mentally or physically healthy in my opinion.
---
That’s the opposite of farming 
---
For me whenever I go to fight her she doesn't take any damage and she did before this last patch.
---
You wouldn't happen to be on XBox?
---
I am not sure caps were ever really useful. About the only thing you need caps for are plans, everything else you could have just farmed easier than the caps themselves.
---
The real currency will end up being screws and springs.
---
Nerd rage is also broken, it does not show nor apply damage buff when perk triggers. Bloodied builds are totally broken post patch
---
What makes it genius for you?
---
To me, it seems like it combines a Lovecraft reference with 1337 speak, is this it?
---
Okay, so apparently pvp should revolve around items that only half the players have an infinite or at least ridiculous ammount of. K thats cool i guess we all have opinions. 
---
I have the full set but I'm on ps4, good luck with the search! 
---
Was that sarcasm?
---
Just don't pour it into the bathtub. 
---
At least all the crappy players will be gone from fo76
---
god damnit😂
---
Then why even be here
---
Wouldn’t get too excited, reviews are rolling in and not looking good...
---
I've seen this once outside of bog town. Instead of the epic behemoth spawning there with super mutants, it was 1 crowned epic behemoth, with 4 behemoths. I squeeled like a little girl and high tailed  it to the monorail tower.
---
Patch 5 ate all my earlier screenshots, but I had a pile of behemoth bodies I was posed with.
---
I was purposefully not replying to anything tonight on account of I'm a bit drunk now, but server hop mclintock for spings or do laps at whitesprings for springs/screws/adhesive/XP/legendaries.
---
I’m on PC and my game has been crashing way more then usual after the last update.
---
If only during wasn’t tied to caps, I’d be all for it, but just a few encounters with someone build for pvp and you can lose 1000 caps. That’s a pain. 
---
You're still going to hit 25k caps eventually because there is nothing useful to buy from vendors and you can't buy any good items from players for caps. Making sense now?
---
She did seem very tough compared to a normal scorchbeast - which is to be expected as the game recommends 8+ players. 
---
I don’t mind that at all but in the post-nerf 76, small squad SBQ runs don’t seem viable. 
---
Yeah, I dont know how can anyone consider fun trying to find a good afix combination as the odds of getting a good one are like 1 in a million (someone did the calculation other day).
---
Perfect. 
---
Couldn't they do it so there was a timer on starting the quest instead of finishing it? &amp; If someone is already doing the quest, the map marker could say "join active quest" or something if the timer has already begun?
---
Like, u have 2 hrs to accept this quest. Once u start it, anyone can join u. Once u finish it, the remaining time is counted down for anyone else to start it.
---
This was so long ago lol. Glad everyone here could help you! 
---
Its wasnt just about the PVP element. PvP is completely broken in this game. Yeah it was entertaining seeing teams hold down territory and others attempt to take it.. I myself set up a humble trading shop in the middle of the mess. 
---
Right you are, but I'm not sure that it is applicable here.
---
Taking the 900 hr guy at face value, he could have simply swapped ammo back and forth to a mule character (and never had over 100k at a time), which is still an exploit and violates the TOS.
---
But I didn't cheat?...
---
The fuck are you on about?
---
Loots not worth it I can solo kill her in under 3 minutes and I have killed her 80 times now since the patch and her loot tables are still garbage not worth anything once you have all the prime receivers and ultracite PA after that she still drops the same shitty weapons and armour as usual also I’m lvl 370 legit and have killed her just over 800 times and have gotten one good drop from her, west tek is where it’s at for good drops. 
---
Bethesda keeps committing sudoku and still thinks they are on the right.   
---
give Rimworld a try and leave this forsaken place.
---
What platform are you on? I can do a loot run with you and help you out
---
picked it up a few weeks ago, it's sooooo fun
---
So you spell one word multiple ways in one sentence over in canada?
---
In all my time playing I only ever saw other players doing the Fertile Soil event in Flatwoods and the Powering up Poseidon ones. Every other event was dead as hell, even ones with huge boss enemies or that are inventive. Make travelling to them free, put up timers and make the rewards a bit more lucrative as atm events may as well not exist?
---
It's up to each of us to stop consuming trash from the internet.
---
Wow you really looked yourself up huh. This comment was from two weeks ago you self absorbed mook. Anyway I enjoy your videos but it's absolute evidence it is overpowered. You fucking one shot so many people by vats teleporting power fisting them. And you're not alone, so many of the top "griefers" use some sort of Melee weapon to kill because TSE was nerfed and Fireproof and Dense mods negate so much damage now. Pretty sure you did a video on that. And not even sentinel armor protects from some Melee attacks, especially the incisor perk. The fact remains that Melee perks have not received any nerfs so at this time it is the OP meta build.
---
Do you want fries with that?
---
Step One: Deselect all missions before entering the school.
---
Step Two: Follow mission marker to mask.
---
Step Three: follow mission marker to candy buckets.
---
*Notes to Consider*
---
There was a glitch that allowed people to wear the mask outside of the event, If a person discarded the mask from their inventory they can no longer trigger the event. 
---
*My Experience with the Mask*
---
I had the mask in my inventory from where a player killed me upon trying to pick it up. Having the mask equipped outside of the event works like a normal helmet, However if you are wearing the mask and someone triggers the event you will receive candy regardless of where you are on the map. (If you can tolerate the event sounds being spammed in your ears)
---
*Rumor* 
---
Monster mash Mask has been flagged for ban, Players who have this item may have their account suspended amd or Permenantly banned as the item is not supposed to exist outside of the event. (Upon reviewing this Rumor I removed the mask from my inventory, I habe not been able to trigger the monstet mash since then.)
---
Is junkie any good? It never was in FO4. And addiction is very rare this time. 
---
Except it's clearly not an apology for duping, he is reflecting on the current state of the economy, an economy where Bethesda failed to fix duping for months then failed to remove all the duped items. This is the situation we are left with.
---
**FALLOUT76 GOOD REEEEE**
---
Gotta love how people are so amandant on being unable to accept that maybe, just maybe, they just like a low quality product. It's not an opinion that FO76 is broken, unless of course your a white knight defender who is blind to flaws.
---
It's like the Hari krishnas at the airport. They aren't selling those books, they're giving them away... for a donation of the retail price of the book. Looks exactly like (and for all intents and purposes *is*) the exact thing they're not supposed to be doing. Not technically illegal because of the donation-to-gift "exchange" verbiage. The armor doesn't give you a buff but wearing the armor causes the event to give you a buff-- because of the armor. An easy claim to make that it's the armor's buff but they'd currently win in court against a case brought against the claim that they insisted Atom Shop stuff would be cosmetic only. TBH, the beds from the shop granting "Well Rested" *is* a pay buff, it's just that the buff isn't shop exclusive. That would be a better case of the shop changing the experience. A low level with "Well Rested" will have a different experience mechanically outside of an event, it's an ongoing buff opportunity. 🤔
---
Yes, me too. The AI is really quite poor. I'd love to mod Fallout VR survival mode into something truly terrifying. 
---
Yeah and most people will not buy them anymore but many did during the event when they were not purely cosmetic. But whatever, everyone can think what they want. Witch hunting though just cause you don't agree with someone (be it a youtuber or a fellow 76 player) is ridiculous and this sub has been doing it way more recently. 
---
Need you on my squad brother.  What build do you run for solo 3 mins?
---
There was a traveling Deathclaw merchant, but he died.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/eLNeCKZ](https://imgur.com/a/eLNeCKZ)
---
I've wanted to play the game since it was announced, and I'd like to keep up with it so I'm not completely confused if I do manage to try it out.
---
Nobody fucking cares, you sad loser.
---
What's your overall DR? Especially with everything at 200% repaired!
---
DO IT. 
---
It's getting more difficult to fight her. I've been in failed SBQ runs 2 out of the last 3 times I've done it.
---
Too many people farming adds for xp and legendaries, making it harder for everyone else.
---
True, I forgot about that detail.
---
You care enough to reply....
---
I've chosen a different path to happiness in the broken economy:
---
The "Armor Piercing Board" I received recently had me thinking "Wild Wasteland", so that's a keeper.
---
I've been trading oddities like that for a few caps to folks that appreciate the finer things... and gifting everything else in bulk to players in the lvl 20-50 range -- players new enough to still be working the core quests but old enough to confirm I'm not wasting items on players who may not keep playing. 
---
I have a running gag with a buddy that we sell Chemistry Workbench plans back and forth anytime we find them, which as you know is often.
---
With an economy that is half Sears and half Craigslist, things have felt odd since the vendors started carrying all plans.
---
What I think we need is a mercenary system so you can hire players for caps or goods held in escrow (finish task, get item rewards)... the problem with the current economy is its lack of labor components.
---
I’ve got a spare plan if you want to trade? 
---
Yes, let's judge a person's acts in-game based on their most recent guide, not on the [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ank683/bethesda_im_earning_bonus_exp_using_radworms/), [*many*](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al793l/explosive_shotgun_preliminary_testing/), [MANY](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agwdek/new_carry_weight_glitch_upon_login_with/) previous posts before being banned.
---
Should've played Fallout 3 first
---
Thanks.
---
I have never Cheated in the game, didn't even use the infinite weight glitch, when I easily could have, but I did suffer from some game glitches a couple months back (mainly the CAMP duplication Glitch), that resulted in receiving extra resources, and was referred to by Bethesda as an exploit, I reported it on a support ticket, which never received a response.
---
I have used the game mechanics, (Perks, and Team mates sharing Perks) to legitimately craft over 30,000 Diluted Stimpaks, which were not deleted in the purge, I suppose what was said about being able to tell what was duped vs Crafted is true.
---
I have 5 characters, &amp; over 500 hours in the game, 1 character (mule) is currently well over the max weight limit, and can not trade, sell or pick up anything, only drop stuff. 4 of my characters currently have 800+ materials in their Stash, 3 of them are near the max weight limit with Legendary Armor, and Weapons, Chems, and Plans.
---
I have a lot of accumulated stuff, but have not been banned because I did not cheat to get it, I have a lot of caps, because I sell stuff to vendors &amp; other players everyday. I have crafted large amounts of many different things including weapons to scrap for learning plans &amp; mods, and outfits to sell to vendors, so, knowing what I have done, I have to call BS on 99.9% of the I got banned for crafting stories.
---
I see her health not move occasionally and it seems to coincide with her just sitting on the ground not attacking. That said, I kill her almost daily and haven't failed in at least a month. The loot is far better after the last patch including on regular scorch beasts.
---
Temporary, until the problem is fixed it seems.
---
inb4 "So It'S PeRmAnEnT!!! XDDD"
---
I’ve had this happen with red ticks and was confused, then I figured out what was happening. But I did lose some regular ticks the last time I came across one so I’m thinking it’s a bug. Unfortunately. I need the parts! 
---
Thinking on it, that promise is why the welcome mat teleportation target was removed from the shop, most likely. That one definitely grants a benefit over not having it. They must be looking at ways to monetize it, as they haven't moved it to a normal plan, either. Doesn't look bright for that cosmetic only promise.
---
Look at your pathetic sycophantic fanboi shilling corporate boot licking post history.
---
Play FF XIV on PS4 and tell me text chat on console is a waste of money. Far from it, if it’s implemented properly with two different chats for AREA and Group it’d be amazing. Could post items for sale, needing help with group content, exploration groups. General chat to give the world some actual personality.
---
Have proximity text chat too For those that wish to RP. You don’t make a game like his without text chat in my mind, it’s why I won’t play Destiny. 
---
I won't be back on till this evening (UK) so if no one comes to you let me know and I'll do it. 
---
I used to be you - never traded, solo doing my own thing.  Traded once or twice out of curiosity and realized it was another means to an end, so now I dabble trading.  Don't like to do it a lot - its almost impossible if you don't have something good to trade no one wants to trade with you anymore.  Its true that caps are going to be utterly useless one day and most high leveled characters will be sitting on their caps maxed out.
---
Well yes new items in the game is nice but if we truly want to see fallout76 succeed long term then there needs to be support from the fan base. Income from game purchases only goes so far. This is why they have the Atomic Shop. I dont want to see fallout76 become pay to win. We need cool items in the atomic shop that doesn't give players huge advantages over others. 
---
Who's to say it's not supernatural armor or something? Their extravagant appearance is why I want War and Black the most. But I get where you're coming from.
---
I’m surprised you all don’t love legendary drills. Killed a level 50 today for a legendary 3* drill.  How are drills still in the loot pool?
---
I’m really on the fence on this one. As a former hardcore GTAO player (Level 335 when I quit), I’m very accustomed to a free for all PvP open world experience. When I heard FO76 was entirely online, I was dreading it be just another GTA clone set in the apocalypse. 
---
I was rather relieved when I read that the PvP was being strongly designed to avoid the constant war zones of PvP anarchy that GTA had become. 
---
What Bethesda cage up with certainty isn’t perfect, but it does show effort. Reality is that the games have two very different player bases, and I think this is truly evident by just doing minimal exploration in any given world server on FO76. Griefers and PvP’ers are an Extreme MINORITY in these servers. Fallout players are accustomed to a Single player PvE environment by and large and the acclimation to a multiplayer Fallout experience involves treading lightly and with awkward friendliness expressed by overly theatrical emotes. Players approach each other and their bases with caution but then break out the huge wave or thumb up and it is immediately established that they are friendly. High level players often drop 1* Legendaries or scrap materials for Low Level newbies because its a nice thing to do. 
---
Fallout’s base is simply NOT a traditional PvP customer. Therefore, any cookie cutter/vanilla PvP experience does not fit here. FO76’s PvP system HAS to be different. I think adding a GTA-similar “Passive” Mode is a necessarily evil, but of their going to do that, they need to restrict passive mode to quests only as claiming public workshops should only be possible without passive mode turned on. 
---
Personally, I’m level 127 in FO76 and I’ve killed a total of 2 players. One was completely by accident and the other was a griefer with a high Bounty that was going around blowing up people’s camps like a 16 year old with spray paint in Downtown L.A.  Other than that, I don’t care to PvP, but I’m very supportive of those that do. It’s nice to have options. 
---
Sorry for excessively long reply. Brevity has never been my strong point.

As an aside, I think you're right on most of what you say. However, I think you're definitely wrong on one thing: it is in no way impossible for an opinion to be shit. Stupid people can definitely have stupid, shitty opinions. Sure, they have a right to have those opinions, but their opinions can still be total shit. 
---
Buggy mess though it may be it still stands the testament of the time and is by far the best of the rebooted Fallout games. (3 onwards). If even say it’s the only actually GOOD Fallout game post-reboot as it actually feels like a Fallout game and goes heavy with player choice which 3, 4 and 76 lack in spades.
---
What the fuck are you saying? God damn it was annoying to read anything you wrote. Please don't participate anymore.
---
Yeah, I just don't see how some people can rationalize having fun on other people's behalf and still have a good conscience. I can 100% guarantee he would be beyond pissed if someone killed him at SBQ and stole all his junk, but he only sees it from his perspective, so I guess if he is having fun it must mean everyone else is too.  
---
I hate people that to bad shit like this and then make excuses for their victims. It's not up to you to decide if it's a dickhead thing to do, it's up to the people you use as victims. And then acting offended that I was "judging him" for admitting to doing a bad thing and rationalizing it? No shame. I wonder what excuse he told his discord channel for kicking me? "He was questioning my immoral decisions" is probably not it.
---
I'm fine with Raiders, just not with griefers taking advantage of a broken game. I'm not gonna hate too much on those bloodied hoe like builds that focus on the stacking of armor ( Bethesdas allowing it). However if you repeatedly melee someone in a trade screen solely to initiate their electrically charged so you can bypass the games PvP settings....You're weak. If you've decided to construct your PVP build around melee VATS usages you're a punk.
---
Anyone who's PvPed enough knows that the VATs system is completely broken, and making a build to exploit that simply makes you a pansy. :) 
---
5 has happened to me so many times. Like other online games, just have the level of each monster be scaled to the individual. That way the same monster can be level scaled differently depending on your level. And what's up with you not getting exp for your teammates kills?? I find this annoying and illogical. Bethesda probably implemented the clunky system they have now (where you have to damage the enemy to get any exp) thinking it would be easy to "boost" with a higher level player. However, If they did it properly and level scaled each monster to the individual, this wouldn't be possible. I've literally had to run from enemies because my teammates haven't damaged them yet and they want the exp. This is definitely not good teamwork.
---
Saaame... :’/
---
For the same reason you can't make charcoal for filters from **wood** instead of coal.
---
The devs don't understand chemistry.
---
What if you shoot a fatman at your feet?
---
Empathy for someone that whines because they only got 900 hours out of a game? Sorry, I'll save my empathy for those that actually deserve it, like sick children, the poor, ya know things that actually destroy people's lives. Not something so ridiculous as being banned from a video game.  You and the OP are clearly both entitled gen z or millennial brats to come on here and bitch about a first world problem such as this. I mean JC, if this is the worst to happen to him, I think he should count himself lucky. 
---
Yea more skins would be great.
---
Paying 15 dollars for a buff isn’t made better by the fact the buff is temporary and sucks, its made worse
---
Oh I know, 99% of all my interactions have been exceedingly positive. He was one of 2 dicks that ive come across that I can recall.
---
The worst part was I was level 150-160, he was around 100. 
---
I guess from then  on (solo) I decided dying isnt that big of a deal, and instead of broadcasting where my body will be (something I **wish** pve enemies would do!), ill just quickly kill myself and retrieve it before anyone notices im gone
---
It sounds like you're saying it'd be cool if armor stats scale up with level (level 1 leather armor versus level 50), and you can increase your tankiness further with perks (serendipity, dodgy, barbarian, etc.), which is exactly how the game works?
---
What’s the damage? Outside of PVP which in no way drives the game, and griefing which is few and far between. You cannot prove that server crashes are only from duping and we all know that’s not the case anyway since servers are still crashing now. Who are we to tell someone how to play the game if it has nothing to do with us? If a guy dupes and plays the game not PVPing in any way, he’s worthless to me- he has no effect on my own game play
---
Do you guys really think Bethesda who aren't very experienced with multiplayer games could make a flawless cheat detection? Or is it just that you guys protect this game like its a cult? You guys can enjoy the game that fine but you don't have to be so rabid.
---
Because that was the intent from the Bethesda show reels they played at E3. As a way of getting revenge. Sorry Beth misrepresented them and theyre actually just grind multipliers.
---
Lol, aww why not?
---
Wow, what a peice or shit you must be.
---
That moment people who don't play are complaining more then people who do play. The 15 health is supposed to be something fun and doesn't even help at all. People NEED to find a way to make $ and hate on the game ig :( these YouTubers are blowing everything outta proportion. 
---
A lot of things are wrong with Anthem. It's basically similar to launch Destiny. The fundamental core gameplay is good, everything else surrounding it has issues.
---
I'll point a few things from the top of my head out.
---
Quick play has no match making requirements. You can literally be level fresh off the tutorial and quick play match make into someone at level 30 on the final mission of the game as long as they aren't on grandmaster difficulty. 
---
There are several bugged weapons perks which do not work. Many weapons are actual trash because of this. There is even a pistol that shoots sideways if you have 2 pistols equipt. 
---
Tethering system is awful. It's a thing that will auto teleport players too far away from the objective back. However it can happen if your only 5 feet away from other players, as it's based on invisible lines drawn by the devs, instead of actual distance. The teleporting itself is also buggy as I even had a situation where a tether teleport moved me even further away, forcing to teleport again until it put me in the right spot. And by the way, each teleport is a long loading screen. And if you aren't the first to spawn in a mission by the time you spawn other players have reached the objective, forcing you to teleport. Loading screen followed by loading screen. 
---
And much more.
---
Make 3☆ Legendaries drop 3☆ loot what the fuck is the point of having 3☆ enemies if they don't drop 3☆ loot
---
I don't know, man. Some of these people posting about being banned had some pretty extensive post histories here, one I even saw speak out against duping and other forms of cheating.
---
Assuming everyone is guilty just because Bethesda says so, when they've been extremely shady lately already, is a slippery slope that could very well lead to this game becoming even more desolated than it already is.
---
I really don't like the idea of them cryptically saying "oh, yeah, they definitely cheated. trust us" with no proof or further information on what they supposedly duped.
---
Yeah you're definitely just here to argue. Have a good day 
---
Yeah I normally run Sugar grove and Fort McClintock... there is another decent location south of Suger grove for stuff too.
---
Took her down in around 10 minutes with 10 people 100+ each. She still dropped an ultracite part plan... Which is useless... And got a 2* trapper leg... 
---
I got a surprising amount of traffic having my camp on the junk pile just west of the monorail elevator. But anything built close to a railway station definitely gets so much attention you could charge admission. 
---
I just wish the events were more rewarding.  Often you get measly reward for twenty mins of work.
---
To give you options I can do it anytime over the next few hours if you want. No charge. Just need those mats thanks.
---
If you click on an event you can fast travel to said event. It's very useful early in the game to open up new areas of the map without walking for an hour.
---
They did him or her a favor, 900 hours... Go take a shower and leave the house
---
So there I was, walking through the wasteland. In my inventory I have chems, lengendary items, and ammo. Every day I live in fear of not being banned for not cheating. 
---
No idea but the last person who did that to me regretted it.  I led them towards a bunch of enemies then logged off so they had something else to occupy their time lol.
---
I seriously want to see it... Played since beta and never seen a legendary drill, ever, not once
---
You didn't get downvoted for maths, you got downvoted for suggesting that people who legitimately crafted ammo got banned for being exploiters. And you did so without providing a shred of actual evidence that Bethesda has actually done this. 
---
That is one of the most adorable things I've ever seen. Kudos. XD
---
Its impossible to barter for stuff if you have nothing to trade with.  And dupes to me have hurt this even further, cause all these items are still in circulation as Bethesda allowed people to keep 1 of a duped item so the market is flooded with dupes in circulation that can be traded off by those who have them.
---
Getting good stuff to trade - that's nearly impossible.  I'd say the odds are more like 0.001% of any legendary drop you find will reach that top tier in demand gear.
---
I'll have a look and let you know!
---
Not going to lie. I've never traded with anyone, not attempted to dupe in anyway whatsoever, but I still logged in, just in case, to make sure I wasn't banned. And then played for 4 hours straight even though I hadn't planned on it. Wondering if it was all a trick to get me to play more...
---
I was seriously thinking about making a post just like this earlier this morning. Happy to see that there are other like minded people who don’t cheat still enjoying this game. 
---
Baited
---
Why would you ask a literal circlejerk about this? They're obviously going to give you biased answers.
---
Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently  maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own  journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't  leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of  Runescapes biggest challenges, the Theatre of Blood.
---
Yeah, I'm OBVIOUSLY Gen Z or a Millennial, you stupid fuck. Take a long walk off a short pier. I just don't like asshats like yourself telling people that they should feel lucky because Bethesda saved them from playing a crappy game, blah blah blah. OP paid for the game, asshole. He is not being overly entitled by saying he should get to play it. That's how games work, you buy them, you get to play them. You are the one who is being a piece of shit here, and can piss all the way off you stupid piece of excrement. If anyone has entitlement issues, it is you little shits who keep bitching about the game even though you don't play it. OP actually plays it and gets enjoyment out of it. All you miserable shits get out of it is troll fodder. You clearly know absolutely fuck all about life, call me back when you learn something. 
---
*that give no advantage over others.
---
None.
---
A tiger you can ride on. The mob is any “S Rank” which are super tough (requires a party of 4-8) and are hard to find. Some require a lot of hoops to jump through just to make them spawn. https://img2.finalfantasyxiv.com/accimg2/2f/90/2f90b031ef00be0bb7e78123228378f9d5c15e41.jpg
---
See that's the problem, I'm all for cool and interesting items in the atom shop if it benefits the success of the game but they will only be cosmetic, they can't put items on there that gives players an advantage over others that doesn't  buy them off the atom shop.
---
We will never see the likes of Chinese stealth armor or the hellfire enclave armor if it's only atom shop exclusive, things like them can only be introduced in the game as future patches or through dlc/new events 
---
For real. Like this sub had been mostly negative for the last 2 weeks, the games been a disappointnent since release, but suddenly people are haters again
---
Can you still contest a workshop and then travel to that player to kill them? Is that still a thing? 
---
We can tell you have never played a Bethesda game if you expected anything more than what you got lmao
---
Lol I was joking about the stars it’s just a plain drill instead of legendary 
---
I think the main concern is well what if next event its 30hp? Then 45 the next time, etc, where does it stop being fun and become P2W? What's the point of adding the 15hp when there's no way in hell they didn't know this would be the perception. Is that extra "fun" really worth it for Bethesda? They could have easily released the event with no bonuses what so ever and this wouldn't even be a topic. With all the other games getting shit on for having P2W stuff, why would Bethesda subject themselves to even the slightest bit extra scrutiny than is necessary?
---
Did you launch directly at fissure prime? Many players do not want to deal with the rads. Personally, I prefer it this way (less players hiding in the bunker) and equip goulish for the constant health regen (2h melee for the hoards, gatling gun for the queen in the air)
---
I mean, I'm fairly certain there's already a law or regulation for the life jackets argument, but that's the only one that's really regulated... Except bicycle helmets, it's actually law to wear a bicycle helmet when you ride in a lot of states... And yeah, and pre-birth insurance isn't gonna get anyone killed!
---
So I guess your entire point was moot, but yeah. 
---
I'm still trying to work out how tse  were deemed OP when you can.pack this much damage into a bloodied build
---
Haha look at his little ears!
---
Well done!
---
Maybe you could use some conduit to create a corkscrew tail?
---
The thing is, my camp wasn't even shown on the map at all, as if it wasn't even placed. I ended up re-building my camp (all items were stored), placing the camp costed me nothing since the server thought I had no base originally.
---
My last 4 fights with her have been atrocious 
---
3 out of the 4 were garbo 1 star armor pieces and the 4th time she didnt drop a legendary at all.
---
For how much ammo you have to spend to kill her the boss is a joke. 
---
that is the reason I mentioned to have Class Freak. In the max rank, it eliminates 75% of the negative effects.
---
they hit you with a powerfist and the mutation accepts pvp for you
---
 Nazgûl!
---
No, not a direct hit.  Aimed so it captured a lot of the map locations in the nuke zone.  Rather than a bullseye on prime. 
---
it's a lot of dps for again many disadvantages like bloodied.
---
I hear you- playing FO4 and waiting for this game I thought “it’ll be interesting to see what kind of personalities come out thru what weapons and armor others use.” 
---
And now I know, everyone’s has the same boring personality- excavator armor and an exploding gun (doesn’t matter which gun because it all feels the same when those little explosions start going off at your feet). 
---
Should have known, people have very little imagination, I’m not trying to sound superior here, it’s just how people are, and it’s too bad because I thought people were going to be npcs- everyone said they were back in August. 
---
Yeahhhh I mean I LIKE it tbh and Im not disappointed with it, but I only wanted to get ONE power armor skin since theyre so pricey yknow. But these are fucking amazing so I need at least one.
---
Except you bought the item I wanted using your duped nuka cola. The seller took your duped 25000 caps instead of my paltry 10000 that took me a week to farm. I may not know this, but you still affected me. You got something using an unfair and deceptive advantage. Hence you quite obviously cheated
---
Oh but wait! You used a mod in Fallout 4 to buy legendary gear off of Arturo without any effort, so that makes it OK! How foolish of me to consider you a cheater, what was I thinking!
---
Me too. Discords filled with thousands of people. Not a single one complaining of a ban... None of us got it. We all play by the rules...
---
You get the costumes. The buff was a "goody".
---
Today i had material for around 18k rounds of .50cal, at the end i got nearly 23k. I think that is acceptable.
---
Holy guacamole there buster!
---
Whoa whoa whoa rule number one of being cool
---
Flames always make everything look cooler.
---
However I agree the design of shishkabob is a bit gruff, if they like removed the fuel tanks and stuff then gave it a nice sliver polishing and made the flames like the "magical" kind I'd have no complaints. 
---
I haven't personally verified, but I've heard that the food takes the spoilage level of the stack they are part of. 
---
IE, if you have 1 corn that was about to spoil, and add 100 fresh corn, you suddenly have 101 corn about to spoil.
---
You're wife's name is Brian?  Do you two ever get confused about who is being talked to when someone calls out Brian?
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
You can drink distilled water can you not?
---
Yeah, and the saboteurs are Bethesda themselves. 
---
So I have an excuse to buy it? I'm leaning towards buying it, just wanted to know co op and wanted to see if anyone had anything negative to say about it. 
---
It is cosmetic. There was a weekly event buff. Nothing with bonuses was sold on the atom store. 
---
My new favorite is "Kill remaining enemies (9/10)" "DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER"
---
It took my husband awhile to see the benefits of playing with others. I never liked wandering the Wasteland alone and pulled together a fun group of people. We're on Xbox if you want to join us. Under Clubs, look for The RGG Group and request an invite 😊
---
Could be .....TEAM UNBANNED !
---
Overreaction but also probably a good one to have here. This should not happen at all unless they also counted Tattered Rags/Mistress outfit towards the buff, otherwise, no matter how minuscule, it's technically a pay to "win" thing.
---
you'd think I'd have known that since I've been playing since beta wouldn't you?.... top tip of the day!
---
How about some real bug fixes before we start dream about that
---
Drop your camp on a junk pile and save your caps. 
---
Yes, I've experienced this issue with the new patch. I'm playing on PC. I either have to quit out and restart or sometimes I can regain control if I just stand still and don't access menus. It feels like my new items need are loading in, tbh. Upvoting for visibility.
---
I mean, it's a valid point. If you get a huge tax refund (like thousands) every year you should really change your withholdings so you get more every pay period. If you get a few hundred back you're probably fine.
---
You should start exploring the voice chat system next. She might be your soulmate. It all starts with emotes, then a little chatting, and then boom, atom bomb baby.
---
You can hookers there for $10.  Uber ride in the city is like $1.20, a nice dinner is about $7, their Fox tv station plays game of thrones, etc free.  Beer is cheaper than water also.  It's a really cool place to visit in general.  They  make a lot less so 5 euros eats into their discretionary budget more-so that spending $35 in the USA does.  
---
Still RPing a psychotic raider eh?
---
Launch directly on fissure prime? The low level players will probably not be able to hang with the rads.
---
I don’t think you’ll be able to enforce or obtain your ask.
---
The map is open to anyone. Lvl2 with enough caps and who have already been to the area can attend.
---
I think the lowbies maybe there to gain more the XPs or see what end game content looks like. 
---
But, just like IRL how many rubberneckers and lookylous, do you not see at, accidents? 
---
No banking, no trading? Challenge accepted.
---
I have no idea if you're actually alluding to something legit, possibly in Runescape; being sarcastic; or meshing a bunch of references into some idea smorgasbord, but I do know that I like it.
---
Do it.  Bit this is from someone who has never played a FO before ever. 
---
I'm 150ish hours in and living every minute. 
---
They patched the event?
---
Update: I don’t F-ing know. 
---
I just completed Distant Thunder in the most lame way possible. Didn’t mark a single enemy with the recon, didn’t kill a single enemy. No idea why is let me “complete” it. Was rewarded with  T-51b helmet plan. Shrug. 
---
I mean, I doubt you'll be disappointed with Warframe tbh
---
Not safe
---
I think it's a lot less ideal to drink dirty water then it is to drink demineralized, no? Hell, I'll take a gallon of demineralized before you catch me drinking some dirty water out of a toxic pond
---
I'm playing this as a solo game and absolutely do not buy it at full price (there are just too many bugs - it really feels like a beta). I bought it at launch and feel ripped off. I'd wait until it's 15 dollars or less, but if you can't wait that long, definitely don't buy it above 30. There are just so, so many bugs and design issues. Please see John Andersen's review of the game for a very good summary of the current state of the game. 
---
It’s acted just like the hazmat suit since day one. Not sure why, there’s nothing special about them, probably some oversight (someone forgot to check a box somewhere). I prefer Tattered Rags, luckily. 
---
I guess it'd be good enough to just display the time remaining on the map. Even better display useful information like if you join it tells you "you have to fasttravel for like 100caps to even be able to finish it".
---
Additionally fix the bug where one is not able to click on a event and join it.
---
And fix the bug where you have to kill enemys but there aren't enemys to kill and you just can't finish it.
---
Yesterday i joined a ghul horde event on the top right of the map and fast traveled to another location. That was pretty weird :)
---
The Outer Worlds is going to put this ridiculous excuse of an Open World RPG to shame.
---
Well all these people that say are innocent I believe cause I have over 30,000 items in my stash box and fallout hasn't banned me or anything I did the most duping and glitches yet I'm still able to play and people who have 1000 ammo legit get banned when I got 10000 of every ammo kind yet I barely play the game anymore
---
If you don't want a bunch of sandbaggers, who make the queen stronger without helping to take her out, then launching directly at FP is a good idea, imho.
---
Agreed, or at least be ready to look up shit in the Warframe Wiki. The community in game is generally helpful too
---
When I am fighting the sbq, I always stimpak downed people. My goal is to beat the queen, not farm for junk
---
If you're on Xbox I can help after 5pm est, but will only be on for an hour or two at the most.
---
What level are you? If you haven't hit 50 yet I would wait until you do
---
rofl at these witch hunt posts. So the community has gone to so deep of a shithole that they don't even care about the game being broken anymore, they just create these threads to go after other players. Marvelous.
---
I'm not a low health build but I did have adrenal reaction. Now it's only a nerf at full health, so it has to go. Really hoping I don't lose marsupial or speed demon while trying to get rid of it.
---
I cant standdddd Yongyea
---
It's still broken - I have confederate hat plan market as known, which isn't, so I also wait for them to fix it. I'm on PC
---
Launch directly on fissure prime: the rads should keep low levels/sandbaggers away.
---
Level 53. And pc. But thanks anyway.  
---
Heh *pushes up glasses* *licks lips* No, u
---
Safe enough for me. Have been using since day one. Have over 300 hours in and no issues to speak of.
---
I have yet to even seen one behemoth, but man this is crazy.
---
There is no user here other than community managers that can answer the question and only if they are relaying the official word from Beth.
---
So far all Beth has said about mods is that the can lead to instability but at no point have they explicitly said that they are either allowed or forbidden.
---
Anyone else that says either 'yay' or 'nay' is just passing his/her opinion as fact.
---
Ok, figured as much. I'll keep waiting.
---
I'll do my best;   
---
It's like Mass Effect in terms of shooting and 'abilities', except your character wears one of MANY suits (warframes), each with their own unique abilities and perks/negatives. Then there's also a LOT of 'mod'ifiable weapons (Primary, secondary, melee). You can also customise colours and sometimes styles of everything too.   
---
Best way to know what I'm trying to portray is to play it, I honestly couldn't recommend this game more
---
i've had my camp there for a few weeks or so. it's a nice location
---
I think the only way to avoid getting 100,001 single action ivory pistol grip plans is to cheat
---
Buy 2 rules get the 3rd for half off ... 3rd rule must be of equal or lesser value. Price and participation may vary.
---
I haven’t leveled up today, so I’ll try the suggestions. Thanks Fellow Wastelanders. 
---
Also a big factor that makes it less fun: they create more bugs with every patch than they fix 
---
Reminds me of kabal in mortal kombat 
---
If you’re in griefer high traffic areas, i suggest blueprint your camp. Just in case you need to quickly restore/ rebuild or decide to move someplace less busy.
---
I went to White Springs once during a nuke event by myself and when running by the entrance that the super mutants all spawn by I heard a loud roar. I turned around to see what the white Springs robots were fighting and it was a epic Behemoth. Took about 10 minutes to kill him as I was only in the forties at the time and everything else around was completely dead. I was down to just a few stimpacks and about half the ammo I walked into the place with. That was fun.
---
These look amazing
---
Joined Uranium Fever, and nobody was there. It had 20 seconds left. Was like welp okay. 
---
And gunpowder is made in batches of 15 at a time.
---
Interesting, didn't know that thanks. But I'm fairly certain I had none to begin with. I don't pick crops unless I'm on an adhesive run. Cannibal takes care of usual munchies and I've always oodles of purified water 
---
I have several friends below level 60 that would love to come to your nuke zone and hang out in a building. Thanks for the invite! Will you be serving food and drinks too?
---
I have school today so when I get home I’ll add you and buy some screws if that’s ok 
---
Yeah I didn't really read into the whole thing that much, didn't realize they're not actually permabans. Still pretty ridiculous though
---
I've never run into a problem with mods from Nexus (other than programming issues, which can be fixed by removing the mods).  I've never had them cause issues like a virus or anything serious.  
---
If you use them, and your game at any point starts acting oddly, disable the mods to see if that helps before looking for help elsewhere.
---
Bethesda doesn't seem to have a stance on them, so use at your own risk.  If you're doing something innocuous like the things you describe, they likely won't care.  I've looked into them, but haven't found a compelling reason to try them yet in 76.  I'm 99% sure at some point I will try some though.
---
Don’t 
---
Ah. My camp has an unequal amount of each crop needed for adhesive, so I end up with a lot of spoilage.
---
Bethesda is just getting the hang of their ban hammer, I'd wait just a little  bit longer to see how it goes.
---
See your local retail location for details. For any questions, call 1-8-QUESTIONS.
---
(Don't actually call that, I dont know who it will ring)
---
Where can you get it for $5? I have a friend on pc that I'd like to but it for.
---
It's unfortunate he left out the part about his thread being deleted by the mods after receiving like 12k upvotes, 5th highest rated post on the subreddit. Along with this nice streamers.

It's also unfortunate he missed the moderators going into damage control shill mode and removing numbers from reddit threads completely after that.
---
I will buy it for sure. I’ll be on 230 PST. 
---
Lol this post has the exact same title as every other post about this ...is this a joke? XD
---
The original ban wave flagged accounts with large stacks of rare items (the ultracite ammo)
---
He had the stacks, he does the hax
---
Free XP for looking down a scope for a few minutes?  Can't complain about that really.  Yeah, it's not exactly compelling content, but it's not exactly a problem.
---
I’ll buy it for sure. I’ll be on 230pm PST. Ty. 
---
No, I don't run any sluggers, and I said "like 250 damage" which is accurate.  Is that a thing you do, just assume what people's builds are and then yell at them about it?  Good luck with that.
---
Ty I’ll be on 230pm PST

hmm, you shouldn't stay still, the AI seems to instantly know where you shoot from and goes there, which doesn't make any sense when using suppressors, so you need to relocate. Keeping distance is also good. I rarely need to repair armour because if the enemy can't hit me, it can't kill me. I sometimes simply resort to wearing the enemy down through attrition. I focus on high per-shot damage and some armour piercing, slow rate of fire is fine except for very close range. Also use suppressors for the sneaky weapons.

People being stuck in power armour. Fixed in Jan 10th patch. Reverted back to buggy state on Jan 29th.
---
Bobby pin weight, Fixed Jan 10, Reverted back Jan 29th.
---
Crafting stations bugging so you have the animation of working at the station, but no menu and no option. Fixed Jan 10th, Reverted back Jan 29th.
---
The only one I heard about but didn't personally experience was a Duplication Bug where by creating a stack of 255 board weapon you can crash out your character and revert to previous inventory state, Fixed Jan 10th, apparently reverted back to working on Jan 29th.
---
That's 4 and those are just the ones I know of, and I stopped playing when I kept getting stuck in power armour, and being unable to craft and it wasn't fixed in their emergency patch on the 31st.
---
those too
---
He has no job he was sick
---
You don't get to dismiss the effects it had on pvp, that alone is enough reason to condemn cheating. No "but besides that", that is already bad enough.
---
I recall a lot of people complaining about being 'grieved' by players who had stacked thousands of bobbleheads to make their TSE weapons into doomsday devices.
---
In addition, server stability and performance issues don't have to be just from duping, there is enough evidence to believe duping contributed to these problems. Causing server stability issues was quite literally how duping even worked. 
---
Stop trying to defend cheating. It's not going to fly.
---
Is West Tek still good for Legenderies? I used to go there a lot and always found one outside at the front, usually round the back and often 1, 2 or sometimes 3 more inside. The last 6-10 times i reckon i've passed through there i haven't seen one!!!! This was even before the latest patch. Maybe just pure bad coincidence on my part. Obviously it's still nice to blitz through the Super Mutants and the Cap and rifle haul still make it profitable. 
---
okay thanks...
---
Thanks u/General-fuckyou 
---
Which is not possible since Bethesda only states actual numbers in a few cases, like 900 hours guy. But Bethesda listed Ultracite Ammo &amp; Halloween Candy as rare items and 100.000 as limit.        
---
I got banned for **crafting &amp; using** 120-150k .50 ultracite ammo over 30 days. I would like to post proof but my Ticket is waiting on a agent for 2 days now.      
---
I don't really care about karma but it seems you won't get an reply from Bethesda if you don't make a post which hits frontpage. I have less than half of his ammo count, nearly 1100 hours, didn't abuse weight bug or any other exploit. Yet I'm banned.     
---
It's sad to see that this community suddendly thinks Bethesda never made errors and those who got banned MUST be exploiters. I bet not even 20% of those who got banned ever exploited or had excessive duped stuff.      
---
Those who are sure Bethesda is right, should run Monster Mash as often as possible. You get a few thousand candies per run. 100.000 over 30 days will get you banned. If you're skilled you could do multiple SBQs with Prime Minigun or Prime .50 cal. You'll need a few thousand rounds per Queen. 100.000+ will get you banned as well.
---
although your camp is way better than mine, lol
---
That's taking PvE kind of literally, isn't it?
---
You kind of had a point until you got mad there m8, in the future when you have a good point back it up with facts and don't start attacking the other person as soon as they disagree with you
---
It is a fun game despite it’s issues.  
---
Honestly, I’d give the game a shot and form your own opinion. I’d also give Fallout 4 a try too. Both are fun games.
---
I did. Power armor negates a lot of that with some rad x. 
---
In my personal opinion you are conflating two things that might not necessarily related however easy may be to do when one is frustrated:
---
\- People bringing sorely underequiped/underprepared toons to the event.
---
\- Scorched Earth being an eldritch tangle of undisclosed/half baked mechanics.
---
The former... well, is no less part of the game than putting up with some cunt that derives entertainment from leveling your CAMP while you are engaged elsewhere or abusing the Workshop mechanics to grief you. Can't really pick and choose, have to take the rough with the smooth.
---
The latter however I agree it could do with some more... transparency and consistency.
---
The level requirement sounds like a no-no, as it would take away from the freedom you have in the game. At least, people should only receive rewards if they've dealt a decent amount of damage or helped in some way.
---
Outrage culture...Tell me about it.  "This is maga country" after all.  Maga meaning magic in this case...not political.   XD
---
&gt;Is it hard to find a team? 
---
I would say yes, kind of hard. Fallout 76 is sort of a single player game that you can play with friends or other people, but there is no matchmaking by itself.
---
So for example if you happen to be near another player you may happen to help and greet each other, but it's not very likely you will stop what you were doing to spend an hour helping that random player, and the other way around. With a friend is way easier, although each one might need to do something different.
---
You can play this game as a multiplayer or as a single player, just bear in mind there is no matchmaking to find people with the same goals as you. Also bear in mind that it's very different to other fallouts: the exploration, looting and survival is really good, but you don't have the dialogues and quests that change depending on your choices. 
---
Sure you are pal.
---
I've played fallout 4. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I'll end up getting fo76 too. 
---
Username checks out 
---
&gt; It's almost like they don't even play the game.
---
Wait, did anybody think they actually did?
---
Yea good post, i agree with it but i dont think we should get to pushy about it. They should put out more items, more options id like to defiantly see more. My post is just about ideas for future atomic shop items.  Bethesda has been working hard with all the bug fixes and server stability, this and balance fixes in pvp is what is most important in my opinion. I bought atoms last week but yet to use them. Id buy more if they had some cool stuff for my camp. I really enjoy the base building. I have alot of the floor skins, wish they would make skins for the sides of the concrete foundation. brick would be cool. More character and gun skins will be nice aswell. Alot of people freaked out about the outfits that gave extra Hp. It was temporary benefit that really didn't give much advantage in pvp so i was fine with it being an Atomic shop item. 
---
Actually have made my YouTube filter out mostly all of the YouTubers that imo steer up drama for no good reason, so I haven't seen any recent videos of drama about fallout 76 in a while. It has been a very peaceful February so far.
---
In 600 hours I’ve had 1 explosive weapon drop, but several ok 2* melee weapons. Still, given the amount of time played (and I’m usually killing things although not farming nuke zones) you’d think I’d gave some rad gear. But I don’t really. However, I can craft virtually anything which is quite fun to piece together unique looks from all the armor types. 
---
But if I was only playing this game for a month, like some people? Psh, you’d never find a cool legendary. But most of the legendaries aren’t cool anyway, it’s all boring passive dmg nullifiers. 
---
Marsupial is by far the coolest item/perk/bonus you can get, and that’s weird. 
---
This is almost meme worthy, "hunger breaks game more than two shot" moderator "checking to see if intended"
---
i would recomend waiting for the survival mode beta release in march, imo thats the only mode that should exist and the game should have launched that way in october.
---
I get your point. But can't we agree that this buff was added to lure players into buying these said cosmetics? And just because it's only a week it's still technically something you can buy in the store, which buffs your stats. That's not only cosmetic in my world. 
---
I'm a PA addict myself so I don't run a bloodied build as I don't get the armor pieces that make it really shine. I'm having fun with a Shotgun/Quality of Life build. I have all the weight reducing perks, shotgun perks, and + damage perks.
---
It's a lot of fun for me, but nowhere near the damage output of bloodied. I just have to be careful when other players are around so I am not hogging all the kills and loot. Especially when legendaries appear.
---
Did he also leave out the part where 900 hour guy had way too much Ultracite ammo to have feasibly been attained legitimately?  
---
Hooray honesty and integrity! 
---
&gt;Flames make everything cooler
---
Right you are, buddy! 
---
Pitchfork? BOOM, IT'S ON FIRE!
---
Chainsaws? BOOM!
---
POWER ARMOR!
---
SLEDGEHAMMERS!
---
BASEBALL BATS!
---
***FLAMETHROWERS!***
---
Just to clear it out. I totally get it's just a miniscule pointless buff. But then why add it at all? If not to lure people into visiting the atomic shop? 
---
Where do you find clubs on Xbox?  I don’t play on any kind of regular schedule. Just when I have some free time.  Currently lvl 90 and would like to join a group. 
---
Given there is no way to setup trades w/o doing it outside the game, I agree this probably doesn't impact anyone except the most hardcore.
---
Expensive place, much fancy.
---
Any douche with a cell phone can become an affiliate. Gaming media is dead in my eyes. I hope end up on the streets and their families starve.

Hell I hid and let the Scorchbeast take all the attention.
---
2 items to think about.
---
Yes, YTers do play off each other for views.  Whether it is a conspiracy or not I can't answer, but it's a fact.  Too many people 'responding' to other YTers videos, and (I think) fanboys coming here and other places to promote the videos.
---
Secondly, there is a point that someone made that I can't shake (not that I buy it, but it's interesting).  Maybe this is Bethesda's 'toe in the water' to gauge our reaction to pay-to-win content.
---
I saw the TY video being promoted here before it got to this sub, and another one like it.  I totally agree that Beth did what they said they wouldn't do, but this was minor enough that I don't really care.  The TYers are right, but the overwhelming righteous indignation is either howling to get views, or some deep-seeded psychosis that I obviously don't share.
---
Shits given (on either side) = 0
---
Speed Demon and Marsupial are the only two must have mutations, and really do add a quality of life/fun factor.
---
I can.
---
I wonder if the difference is that I have something from the Atom shop.  I bought the Lumberjack outfit, and I can craft the hat for that.  
---
Here's a [pic of my crafting menu](2535439614426281-private/50cb2b11-bf7d-496b-b9c9-ca17f75ab4e1.PNG?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=O%2FOeuom%2FVWushO0mPAq0bN4eexF3gtk%2BYR1s03L4fE8%3D)
---
I think you're missing the point completely and I'll try to hopefully help you understand. I am not saying your story isn't true or not. I have no opinion about your story at the moment.
---
1/ You are making a claim and are making it without supplying any evidence other than an anecdote. 
---
2/ Many people who assess evidence are of the opinion that anecdotal evidence is the weakest form of evidence
---
3/ The accused is either unaware of your accusation, or doesn't see the merit in defending themselves in a public forum
---
4/ The actual evidence that Bethesda has against you is unknown to anyone else but Bethesda
---
5/ Bethesda's weeding-out algorithm is also unavailable to us. Whether or not it is flawed is therefore another unknown
---
The correct thing for any impartial observer to do is to suspend judgment. This is between you and Bethesda. We should not take sides unless all the evidence that exists is made available. We don't know enough to come to a conclusion. 
---
So hopefully you can respect that I'm not calling you dishonest, or of fabricating a story. What I am saying is there isn't enough here to draw a reasonable conclusion one way or another. 
---
where are pics of the PA?
---
That's normal
---
Dammit Jim! Love his stuff but he jumped the gun on this one. He does manage to say that everything is "alleged" and point out that whether it is true or not is just another media shit storm that gives the game an additional black eye, but still. He should have held off on this one.
---
Just what I was thinking. It seems pointless to add this tiny buff. If it's not to try and lure a couple more players into buying these said cosmetics. 
---
Both Jim and pc gamer didn’t even seem to notice that and just presumed innocence, misinformation through lack of research. 
---
Yes, isn't it wonderful.
---
Are you having trouble with the last part? Because all those Gutsy's do tear you up pretty good. You can go into the elevator and let the door close (don't go down) and when you are healed and ready, pop out to kill one or two, then back up and into the door again and let it close to heal again. I have also fought from inside the scorchbeast nest and from a little corner down one level, both of which let you face only 1 or 2 robots at the same time. If you don't want the experience from killing the robots, you can cheese it and simply stay in the elevator and grab some snacks irl while the time runs down.
---
This game is hilarious 😂😂
---
Yep
---
You think since this is Jim Sterling we're talking about, he would put some research into it and realize 900 hour guy is a fraud 
---
But he didn't 
---
I think that was done when the megathread was pinned, to mitigate the influx of new posts.
---
Ok if you choose to believe everything on the internet, go for it. I don't believe anything until I see it with my own guys. So the story is this guy played 3 characters at the same time in the same group lmao what a joke. Go ahead be nieave. As far as I'm concerned this guy deserve to be banned and stay banned.. cry about
---
Fool.
---
I just....
---
Didn't play for a while (was playing ark, AC, etc)
---
I can't believe how someone can dare to express an opinion different to my own.
---
Is obvious that whoever that doesn't share my views is misinformed, cannot do his/her own research and is generally wrong.
---
Until such time that I have the time to shed a light into that dark ignorant world they live in they shoudl do the right thing and remain silent. 
---
Are we not gonna take in to account some people will play a game they love for longer than 8 hours a day, especially if they are unemployed and not seeking work?
---
I would like the FO3 or FONV version where it had a motorcycle gas tank backpack.
---
Scorchbeast flying away like... 
---
"awh fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck it right to hell"
---
No, it was done to silence the big threads getting a lot of traction, practically filling the front page.
---
I typically like that big oaf
---
Wow. You guys are literally pulling doomsday theories out of nowhere. 
---
I can finally craft the Halloween skull mask now - picked up the plans ages ago, but it wasn't in my crafting menu. But I have the Sun Hat and Hip Glasses from the Atomic Shop, so maybe that is the issue.
---
Looks cool for my t51b armor hope to see more datamined skins and hopefully they come out soon
---
Can those people even get drops?  
---
Remember doing the SBQ once at low-level, used almost every ammo on it i had  
---
Didn't get any loot from the queen itself

Seriousness though, there is a bunch of advantages to doing this. My power armor build doesn’t use ballistic fiber, the other characters do, so they get it from him. I never have ammunition problems because I’ll pick up all the ammo types I use and transfer them to the appropriate builds. If I get bored playing one I’ll simply switch to a different character, off build good drops are never really disappointing etc.
---
Except that the Mistress of Mystery dress also gives the same buff, so that one isn't shop exclusive as well.
---
It's all about shock and awe.. not facts.. Come on, how else is he supposed to get likes and subscribers?!?!?
---
I had like 30,000 grenades last time I played, but this was months ago. I wonder if I've been banned. 
---
If you picked up ammo others dropped, to dump weight or to gift, or if you bought ammo from someone that was something Bethesda programed to allow as acceptable behavior, as function of the game.  It is not a bug or a glitch.  They have the ability to make items not dropable, not tradeable.  I am not banned, not effected by it.  I have only played a fraction of the time played as that guy and my inventories are full, and my caps are full on 3 different characters.  I could see how a heavy player could look to trade for ammo as it doesn't have much weight.  Ammo is practically given away on the marketplace, If he didn't have other rare items I could see how he could acquire it without a duplication glitch.
---
Mod abuse is real.
---
iirc Juicehead contacting Bethesda asking for their stance before he made a video on the good mods, they said the Nexus mods are fine.
---
2. I believe s/he's talking about the non-legendary explosive types. Fat man, missile launcher, M79 Launcher etc...
---
I'm guessing you're not well versed on "sarcasm"
---
stock up on some pulse or plasma grenades as well. it helps a lot of you are ducking away for cover
---
Based on the terms of service agreement I would suggest limiting yourself to mods that do not provide any advantage (so no lock pick bar mod) but that others certainly do not break terms of service per a strict reading, such as the 'keep/save my stuff' or chat mod.
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
The Mistress outfit did count towards the buff.
---
I doubt all of them are actually guilty or you won’t see this many complains. 
---
When I did a quick look at the changelog post, I spotted some details about Nuka-Cola billboards or something like that.
---
I'm curious what those look like.
---
barricading benches wasnt meant to stop a player from being able to take a workshop, it was meant to give u time to react.  now a player can initiate claiming ur workshop from anywhere within the workshop while his 3 teammates kill the workshop owner anywhere on the map as soon as their teammate hits a button one time.  they can then do it repeatedly by having the 1 teammate leave the radius and re-enter and begin claiming again with the press of a button.  theres no defense for this now.  i like PVP, but this just makes it easier for ganksquads
---
Just a note..... fallout 76 isnt really a fallout game, in the same way as the previous games.
---
The previous games are all story/quest driven rpg-shooters (fallout 3/NV/4). The earlier games were tactic-rpgs (Fallout 1/2/tactics). Fallout 76 is a multiplayer.... thing (is it a battle royale? Is it an rpg? No one is quite sure).
---
It's like saying "Dead or Alive: extreme beach volleyball" is your first fighting game. Or "Mario Kart" is your first Mario platformer game. Fallout 76 is a spin-off.
---
Hotfix coming?  This is more of a big deal imho than the bobby pin debaucle and why is the missing +Damage such a Big Deal, well it's because normal regular weaponry damage is too weak and there's a reliance on the +Damage.  I can go on and on and on but we all know what this means to everybody, thanks.
---
I had a guy marsupial his way up to my cliff side base and proceed to blast Rick Astley. I was in power armor and he was not. I removed the floor under both of us and just waved on the way down  :-)
---
Isn't that the point of the store? Isn't that the poit of all advertisement? Of course they want to sell their merch. The same way YouTubers sell their merch or give exclusive Patreon perk.
---
There are a few things that don't add up! Not that it matters how many hours you play! I have honestly put in close to 850 hours into this game, and I am only at level 220, he is at level 450 at 900 hours? I asked him this and he got mad and down voted me? I think there is more to this story than he wants to tell us! 
---
Hardly anyone nukes her anymore because she was an insane ammo sponge, her loot drops were worth the time and ammo and also low levels would sit around and sponge xp and buff her up. It basically just became unrealistic. I havent seen an SBQ fight in almost a month. Granted i usually only play 30 hours or less a week.
---
I've only done SBQ a few times but the last time i ran it (lvl 70 something melee build) i was doing my due diligence trying to manage adds and ended up face tanking SBQ for half the fight since i was the only melee guy. I broke off to help a guy who was just downed by a mirelurk queen, stimmed him, killed the queen and was then downed by a yao guai. When i called for help, literally half the players fighting the queen broke off to surround me and wave emote until i respawned. 
---
Shit like that makes me want to just go and sit and watch. 
---
God I hate this is a thing. Running through an area for a low level quest to find Level 80 enemies when I’m Level 20. Thanks for that.
---
I agree with your larger point but I'd note that the Distinguished Guests event doesn't require all 24 place settings to succeed. The robot will complain about the job you did, but you still get event rewards, even with just a few places set. 
---
Wait, what terminal let's you do that? Get the Ultracite plans, I mean. When was this added, and where can I get them? I've been waiting for someone to put a nuke on FSP for a while now just so I can try to get those plans (because I'm too lazy to launch a nuke myself, because it doesn't really feel all too rewarding to do so imo). I have half of them, but I want them all. Where to find?
---
Well, he didn’t mention that the player was banned for a legitimate reason and spent quite some time in the video just talking about how someone could play for 900 hours.
---
Even his own subreddit called him out for it and the thread was locked.
---
I do understand your point and you're right. But how should I get evidence? I can't login. Bethesda Support doesn't reply.      
---
I'm no Streamer or YouTuber so I have no video footage of my account.     
---
The only kind of weak evidence is the sheer amount of players which got banned.     
---
If you want help those who can't make proof anymore by livestreaming you're way to legit 100k ammo or candies and wait for your suspension.     
---
Imo it's horrible that this sub thinks 20% of the playerbase are exploiters and Bethesda no way made any error in their ban scripts. Just downvote those who got banned since they must have exploited...       
---
Bethesda didn't even state actual numbers of bans like last time. But it is obvious that the last ban-wave affected a huge chunk of players. If you're part of a clan and no one got banned I'd be surprised.
---
In a multiplayer game it’s still considered cheating. They really can’t go around deciding who’s playing it as single player and who is playing as multi. Though I know your pain cause i fucked up in a different mp game that I play solo (elite dangerous) and wanted to see if I could trick the game into letting me go back to an old save point (forcing the game to close) and no go. It felt sucky cause I don’t really see it as mp especially as I play on a private server dedicated to people who will not pvp and I still have yet to see another player. But I understood cause, well, technically it is an mp. Sometimes us people who like to play me game solo have to remember it’s still mp and unless they make an sp side they can’t really go around determining who is cheating to give themselves an unfair advantage against others and who isn’t trying to compete. 
---
LOL always fun to drop gifts on the lowbies. I fast travelled to Vault 76 on my way to an event and ran into a level 1. Dropped some goodies and backed away unarmed. The hearts felt good from a distance.
---
Cool maybe people will drop a nuke in more interesting places than that one corner or white springs. 
---
Even better, give us the fucking pve servers then. Most dont even care for pvp anyways, make that people that want the pvp servers cant use weapons with affixes. Its mostly a pve game, let people do what they want.
---
this! if they fixed this, then the change would be welcome, but theres nothing in the patch notes about this being fixed.  the new patch change just makes it easier to tdo this.
---

If I have 10k ultracite ammo, drop it and pick it up over 10 times, would that be counted as 100+k. Hmm. But I couldn't possibly have over 100k ultracite ammo legitimately. Lets check my inventory. Hmm 10k ammo. Wonder where the other 100k I picked up went.
---
I was walking along minding my business, when out of that orange colored sky - crash! Bam! Alakazam! - wonderful you came by...
---
I totally agree bug fixes, server stability and better balance in pvp is what is most important. We have already seen huge improvements since launch. I can really see the effort from the Bethesda team. Much better then some previous games i have played. My post is just for future Atomic Shop ideas. I can play hours now on a server without a dc. Today i almost had every workshop on the map claimed i was trying to get them all but defending them got to be alot of work. 
---
u had me till u tried to claim silo runs with a team are in some way harder lol  now it just reads as salty bs
---
Then why say 'viable again' Fat man/missile launcher etc. were never really viable in this game.
---
They're not going to say anything negative about it and if they do, they'll be downvoted to hell. 
---
I never got a lot of legendary items from that event. I just liked being able to go there whenever I felt the need to go all Gallagher on some melons!
---
My question, only having seen the basics of this whole situation, are we sure Bethesda didn't fuck up?  
---
I mean god knows they're perfect and haven't fucked anything up in this game.  They've certainly never introducing patches that broke a patch from a week ago and introduced more bugs.  I mean clearly they are perfect. /s
---
I mean I can be skeptical, but regardless I do not trust that things Bethesda does are done right the first time.
---
Got kicked three times in a Whitespring nuke last night, so I am still seeing stability issues

Is it hard to find a team? Yes and no.

The game doesn't find groups for you. I recruited my friends, so I always have a team. There's also a discord over at /r/fo76FilthyCasuals for finding groups. 
---
SHILLS!!!  BOOT LICKER!!! AD HOMINEM ATTACKS!!!
---
am I doing it right, Sheldon?
---
The entire point of the video is to make fun of the fact that someone could even play Fallout 76 for 900 hours. According to him and his neckbeard followers, they wouldn't "play the game for just one minute even if Pete Hines came with a bottle of high grade Nuka Dark and gobbled his bits while pleading him to play."
---
Yes, I'm quoting. Kinkshaming aside, this is the mentality of the average viewer of his channel. You can be toxic, and then you can be...whatever they are.
---
Don't let the hate dissuade you from buying the game. It's a great game, I got a lot of fun out of it, many hours. If you like Fallout, you like this.    
---
They got a lot of hate for releasing it too early with many bugs. But now with all the patches, the game is in A LOT better shape. 
---
Wrong, nobody cares about you.
---
Thats really cool of you. I was up at the penitentiary just running it for fun and a noob shot me by mistake. I acted like I was going to smash him but didn't. I then asked what his build was and if this was his first character? He was lvl 16 so I gave him some of my nice drops I had gotten that I was just going to sell anyway and also gave him 200 caps. I remember those who helped me out and really appreciated it. He was so thankful and it made me smile.
---
I hid on the little rail behind the lift.  didn't get to eager, just strafed left and right throwing mines out.  The scorchbeast did most of the work.
---
In life or this game..? This is a game, I was merely commenting on the OP and any internal logic to the crafting system.  I too would not care for a glass of toxic pond water, but didn’t suggest that was a good idea either.
---
Nah i think "The game itself" is better !

Not my intention to be negative against your ideas, i agree with you but i also am loosing patience with each patch that breaks something.  Tbh the stability has become better imo. 
---
Look at your worthless apathetic view on life. It’s a  cesspool of drudgery.
---
Are joke posts allowed? I thought anything to do with "I was banned" was being relegated to the megathread?
---
Events/kill random mobs, whitesprings, farm SB's at the AA sites in the bog.
---
Horde events are pretty good exp too.
---
West tek and Whitesprings when nuked.
---
Morgantown airport for 20-25 in about 10 min
---
Grafton Day event via Server hopping for 1-3 every 45-60 seconds depending on your load time
---
Id say collect the unique items like the mothman wing fragments in case we ever get a trophy display mount for our CAMP.
---
It be cool to just have a giant mothman head or wing on my wall. 
---
If I could be bothered, I would go and find the 3 times you have replied to a post of mine with guess what we would find? "Whiny bitch" and "tool". With such "ad hominems" I was surprised you would even know what it meant.
---
Have you done all the side quests? All the Dailies at least once? Have you mapped out the entire world (Aka all the fast travel points)? Have you done all your Treasure Maps?
---
Yes, you can grind the Golf Club or stuff like Monster Mash, but that'll get boring fast. You might as well accomplish something while you level.
---
By the time I got to the Enclave portion of the questline, I was well above 100.
---
History of the world part 1 = Mel Brooke
---
Damn man that's shit. I ran through 2 nukes zones with 0 problems.  What platform are you on? I'm on PS4
---
There was one youtuber that was on top of it and posted about the mechanic while it was still being active. Guess the rest are just after views.
---
Decor. I collected all of the bobble heads and I'm just waiting for a display case.
---
Awwww...don't be upset, Moon Pie....
---
Just show me proof that's how the totals are tallied...
---
*If you don't like the things I like you're toxic*
---
Rejoin would be awesome, browse would be even better.
---
Does soup count for both hunger and thirst? None the less, thanks for that tip on the location. 
---
Did you see the other post that had a screenshot of how much ammo they attained? And how they deleted a bunch of comments they made.
---
One shot kills of pacifists is a myth, much like the trade steal exploit. PvP slap damage is capped to 5 HP. So the only way to oneshot someone is if they are going about with less than 5 health points.
---
Yes!  A mirror stash or even just a mirror.  I think for my next CAMP build, I'm going to build over a river and open a hole in my floor.  Bathing, toileting, and hand washing all solved in one hole. :D
---
Fallout 76 was my first fallout game as well (I have a habit of showing up late to the party). My buddies from work convinced me to pick it at release.
---
I logged about 100 hours, even paying the full 80 dollars at release I thought I got my money's worth - I enjoyed my time playing - especially since the beginning of the game felt so new and fresh (new game-play I wasn't used to yet). All my friends quit however, I still log on from time to time, re-organize the stash, do my vendor runs - join a nuke zone. 
---
However, buying FO76 led to me getting FO4 GOTY Edition. I logged 225 hours on that game - and I will play it again. 
---
Now I'm currently playing FO3 GOTY Edition, and it's a great game as well (took a bit to get it running smooth on my rig, but now it's great). 
---
\----
---
Basically, if I never picked up FO76 I may have never played FO4 and now FO3. 
---
I personally think FO4 is the best out of the three I've played. Being a huge fan of Mass Effect, the characters are as important as the game itself. I think FO76, albeit the concept was neat, should have NPCs. However, especially when the game first came out I had some really fun interactions with strangers, but the experience much like in real life varies from person to person. 
---
For a stand-alone fee, FO76 is a good game, and who knows how it will evolve. It may be something that once a content patch hits, come back and soak it all in. 
---
This is exactly right. Dunno why it's downvoted. 
---
I'm not sure how they'd do it, but workshop PVP needs to be tied to that area. If you own a workshop and I see you in white springs crafting or trading, my friend can travel to you and the moment I contest the workshop he can kill you. Correct me if I'm wrong but that DOES work right?
---
It was legitimate because those who banned him can legitimize anything by having the ability to enforce rules that apply retroactively without disclosing the methodology.
---
I have a healthy amount of distrust of any entity with such capabilities.
---
So, spending 30 - 60 minutes, and thousands of rounds ammo to launch a nuke only to have low levels interfere, is *completely* the same as you being momentarily inconvenienced by a higher level just entering the zone you're in?
---
What system?
---
Please elaborate.  Which costumes are you referring to?  What did you miss out on?
---
What items would you have liked package, and at what price point is it a good deal?
---
Point is, why even bother. This is the first game ever I got banned/suspended whatever and funny enough I hardly care. Haven't logged in weeks, game is pretty much a disaster. Reviewers and customers hated it, they are giving copies for free if you buy used controllers in some stores, the bundles are getting extra copies as well just to get hid of them.
---
Funny part is I met like 30 people in this game. From these like 4 stayed and now they all got banned hah. They are doing all they can to kill this game for good. Its a pve game for all effects with some shitty pvp tagged in. Make separate servers for pvp with affixes disabled (they are unbalanced anyways) and let people have fun with the pve part. 
---
Still jokes on us that belived Bethesda could pull out an actually working game. Two of my friends that I convinced buying it are still pissed at me, one at least got a refund.
---
The last few times I've joined the fight (lvl 102) it's been impossible to kill her. I got tired of it. When I see a nuke down that way nowadays, I wait til Scorched Earth is over and then head down to farm violet flux. Still haven't launched my first nuke, but it's not gonna be at FP when I do.
---
&gt; prolong the timer to 3 mins and within that time make blast zone inaccessible to anyone outside of those, who will be accepted by nuker.
---
Yeah, but then you'll get people who won't let anyone at all, regardless of level, in on the fight because it is so much easier to kill her solo than it is with other players
---
What I have been doing lately is just go to flat woods or train station and just drop bags. If anyone does show up they can loot it if not I don't worry about it. It would be nice to have emote saying gift that would be good. I use the buy emote. It sometimes works. 
---
coolness but wait - how you stacking concrete foundations?
---
You clearly don't follow the news much. I don't like CoD. I don't actively go around spewing hate on CoD forums. Anti-76ers do  exactly that, which is the definition of toxic. Sometimes go and read the replies below Bethesda's tweets every time they post a tweet about server maintainance or patch update or even just photomode pics.
---
Don't participate in uninformed bashing just cause it's cool. It just shows how much of an ass you are.
---
Cheating is charging for this game.
---
Bethesda publicly stated that 1% of account had duping violations. To me it sounded low, so yes, maybe there is a bias. 
---
I do have an idea for you but it's related to a separate qualm that people are stating. Namely that picking up a bag over and over can flag you for duping.
---
Essentially, create 1000 ultracite ammo. Drop it and pick it up 1000 times (1 million ammo). See what happens. If you get banned and you made a video of your experience then at least you'll have something tangible. If not then, well it wasn't quite related to what you said got you banned but it's a shorter path than actually crafting 100,000 ammo. 
---
Or you could just stock up on caffeine and craft 100,000 .50 cal and see what happens.  
---
I don't disagree with that. I honestly would prefer it that way. I think it was just a test to see community reactions. I can see why players would be worried, what starts off small somtimes ends up big. If they continue to offer opportunities for players to get Atoms from just playing the game then really somthing as small as a little extra hp outfit that everyone should be able to afford without throwing on real money is just not a big issue for me. I totally understand your perspective and respect your opinion. 
---
It's called probability.
---
With the cost of 5mm ammo you'd be looking at 1743 batches of ammo assuming ammo smith 2 and super duper giving you on average 210 bullets per batch.
---
That's 1,742 violet flux and ultracite, and about 26,000 lead, 52,000 steel, and 14,000 gunpowder.  He'd have to pick 8,000+ violet flux flowers.
---
He'd have to craft 2 batches of ultracite 5mm an hour for 900 hours to hit that.  And why keep farming it?  When I hit over 10,000 5mm I swap from my gatling gun to a minigun cause it's fun.  I don't keep farming ammo.
---
Now what's more likely, that he did all that, or watched a youtube video and started with 200 ammo and duped 11 times?
---
I'd say, if there's like 4 costumes for sale - sell a bundle for the price of 3 of them
---
It obviously worked. OP just shared his story
---
But he's using that mule to swap between two primaries, which brings those numbers back within reason. Since the mule is trading between 1a and 1b (then back again) he's having to interact with ammo more.
---
...or he's cheating, and evidence like this will do him in. But based on what he explained above, the number difference can be justified.
---
There's literally no reason in the universe to be upset over this.
---
Spreading lies about this game needs to stop.
---
The one in taggerdys office they added that in patch 5
---
If you kill ticks with bloody mess perk  equiped there are unlootable.
---
I didn't say that Activision is better than Bethesda. If I have to chose, I'd say Activision is better than Bethesda but still both are just horrible company
---
Flaming Flamethrowers of Flame!
---
It's fair IMO - let it be their reward for launching a nuke. You can always do it by yourself and be the one to choose who and if will help you fight the queen.
---
That's pretty vague don't you think? What exactly about the event was patched?
---
He's saying that it showing 140k of ultracite ammo being accrued over the period of 30 days is simply a case of 900 Hour Guy dropping and picking up a stack of 10k ammo, 14 times...or some combination of him swapping between mules or whatever...
---
As of yet, he hasn't provided any evidence that's how the total is tallied...
---
More of this. We need this. 
---
It is really more responsible to pay for your barrels with cash rather than credit.
---
Heh, I doubt people that are actually selling itens in game gives a fuck about being banned. They can easily buy new accounts and do the stuff all again. Its the legit players that duping or not do it to play not to profit. Its not like the thing was fixed, duping is in game since beta, its basically a feature lol. They took too long to act and now they are banning people like they were all selling stuff on internet. Its pathetic.
---
The sad part is most dont even care, very few still play the game anyways.
---
Headcannon accepted! Gaia=Interloper
---
Can you link his video please ?
---
I'd say buy it. All my friends stopped playing it a month or two in, but I found new folks to play with. Accidentally sent a team invite once to a guy who accepted, we played together for a few hours, and now we team up whenever we're both online. I've found other players on this sub or the Filthy Casuals one and we have a great time together. It's a lot of fun and you meet all kinds of people that way. And if you're going to play on PS4, hit me up.
---
I've done all the side quests and all the dailies I've found. Probably haven't mapped the entire world or done any of the treasure maps! Thanks for the tips 🙂
---
my first category starts with the heavy armor. I'll try buying an outfit in the atom shop later today and see if that pops the menu. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
You joke but I met my wife in a game (Ultima Online) back in 2000. Knew her about 6 months before ever meeting her face to face. After that first meeting there was no turning back.
---
If you love Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, the RPG element, story line and a modding community that has added and fixed many things, if you like a AAA game from a AAA game development company that invests millions into production, this game **IS NOT** for you.
---
Don't Carp on it man! Just Catch and Release!
---
Ok, that's fine, but the point is, *most* of the players who are under the level of 60 do not care to participate in the event. There are certain cases they do, but its still end game content. Not intended for low level players.
---
I always stim anyone who needs it, but I don't even bother trying to wait for help anymore. It's just 20 seconds wasted I could be sprinting back to the fight.
---
They were just trying to have a nice day together and the waterpark. 
---
Np probably better to message me on Xbox at that time. GT same as here, don’t worry if it shows offline I’ll be on. 
---
Nakanokalronin, PS4
---
Again...another new problem after your latest update. Now while in almost every combat situation, my secondary hot keyed weapon is unequipped when I switch over to it. For example, I will be fighting off a lot of enemies while I have a rifle out, I  then hit left on the controller to switch to my other gun and my fists come out. It's happened with all types of weapons during 99% of encounters with enemies. 
---
In Fort defiance? Correct?
---
Step one is apparently extremely difficult for a lot of people in this game...
---
His name is not Warren...?
---
Looks great. This is so much better than the giant cubes 90% of players seem to build. Those are so fucking boring and out of place. Don't get me started on the floating shit or reverse pyramids.
---
I took the camp thing literally and only use tents but I want to try building into an existing structure when I find a good spot.
---
Bethesda broke yet another bottom lol
---
Most white knights and fanboys live in a diferent reality it seems. Game was despised by reviewers and customers, sold poorly and game stores are giving copies away like candy. Still we got people in here saying everything is fine and they should ban people that blink in the wrong way. Servers are already empty from what I heard, just wonder how they are now lol.
---
Her health is scaling for a full 24 people without that many people being there. 55K hp per person. She has 1,220,000 hp. So when people dont pull their weight it really shows. I burn't through a ton of ammo figuring this out. Her hp was no different regardless of people. Ive killed her once after patch and failed once after patch. Failed simply because 5 people can hardly do enough dps within the time. 
---
She also doesnt land as often until under 50% hp and she does her "dive bomb" none stop. 
---
She also lands and glitches her charge with taking off and weird things happen. 1-2 waves of enemies spawn. 
---
I am 100% here for Roman Historical references and Education! Had I Gold to give, I would do so!
---
 scientia ipsa potentia est 
---
Just checking are you buying the plans? If so you don’t need me you’ll be able to do it yourself. Otherwise I’m happy to help if needed.
---
For sure, but I had assumed that some people are just cheap when it comes to chems (but it is not like they are hard to come by)
---
As someone who is a solo player I wouldn't say its hard to find a team but it seems to me that many play with their friends. I have made a few friends in game in the last 2 months I have been playing but I rarely play in a team. I wouldn't mind a few nights playing in a team setting but it just doesn't seem to happen. 
---
Step one is apparently extremely difficult for people in this game....
---
A man is no one...
---
No shit! Same here. I try to ignore everything else for as long as I can, until the trash mobs literally block me from moving
---
The 1% was the ban-wave before. The last one affected much more. I recieved dozens of messages of players wondering why they got banned. On PS4 there are 'communities' which got flooded with banned users.       
---
I can't login at all so I can't try the 1000 ammo re-picks. But I assume it will get you banned too. At the end it's just a simple script adding up what you got over 30 days.
---
Demolition Expert will 8ncrease the damage (under INT) but I don't think Grenadier does anything.
---
Yep. 
---
Just in case this is related to your issue they altered the spawn rate of the event last patch. It was being spammed too much too quickly and now there is no player trigger. The event triggers on its own and cant be forced by entering the school anymore. 
---
Which thread?
---
If I were apathetic then I wouldn't be fighting, would I?
---
Like i said **most** of the players who are in the event do not participate in the event.  Certain cases do. Its not the point.  Its end game content. Unintended for lower level players. 
---
All good bud, i appreciate your feedback.
---
Xbox  it was acting weird all night 
---
&gt; As of yet, he hasn't provided any evidence that's how the total is tallied...
---
He can't. If 900 hour guy is correct and truthful he should have received 2 ban notices. One for his main account and one for his mule account.
---
The fact that he didn't get two means there is at least one lie in his story and that lie casts doubt on the rest of his story.
---
Literally just server hop the golf club house, kill every living thing you see always, once rinse repeat. People can downvote if they want but dude wants to know the best way. And as frowned upon as it can be, it is the best.
---
I still have only seen the mothman once, and that was like 4 patches ago. Since this mothman event thing that's going on, where you have a better chance to see him, I still haven't found him yet. Is my luck really just that bad?
---
I agree with you that it costs way too much to respec right now. If you don't like your build it would be easier to start over, except that you'd lose all of your schematics/plans/recipes and even your gear if you play solo.
---
As the other post said theres a quest marker. Basically when it starts each round you can follow the marker to the mask then it highlights the candy your supposed to find. This happens 3 times for each of the 3 rounds.
---
Right. So we should start killng them, or be able t kill them. Its part of the game, right?
---
Yeah I get ya, should have a lvl cap.
---
[You deserve this]

---
No, mine is working as it should.
---
Because they were more than likely talking about FO4 levels when getting hit by a mini nuke, shoulder fired rocket or grenade resulted in more damage inflicted than a sniper bullet. 
---
And explosive builds were viable. Not meta, but viable fun. Fully spec'd bunker buster for flying targets and auto grenade launcher with a plethora of hand grenades for ground targets made for a good area denial/mob control setup for people who liked playing that role.
---
Your right.
---
At one point in time he had that much on him, so Bethesda had a look at his account and saw he had that much ammo on him so going by your reasoning the numbers would most likely be much much higher because he used it up and duped more, stop being ignorant.
---
This was correct grammar even when I was in school some 25 years ago, so time has nothing to do with it.
---
He had over 300k. Giving him the benefit of the doubt and saying he crafted with A, muled to B, then ended up with C who uses that type ammo, it's still over 100k to account for.
---
Not everyone who realizes this guy is a liar is a Bethesda fanboy. We're simply able to use simple logic. Your crowning achievement of the past four days is learning the word "shill" so you could inject it into almost every comment you made. Good job! Proud of you!
---
Just stay out of the area if the enemies are too hard to kill. Rifles are solid in this game. Not OP, but they will get you through. I used nothing but rifles on my first playthrough. Personally I liked the fact that I once in a while would run into something scary and get killed. Made the game exciting :)
---
Yu mean tbe game should be pvp only?
---
So glowing consumables could be bad too?
---
I agree. Or at 50 being abl to clear and respec one time at caps cost.
---
A man is Country Roads from West Virginia, and I'm going home
---
0/10 Did not show coinslot (but upvoted)
---
I think it's still random.  I crashed to the xbox home screen twice last night, once the night before.
---
There are 7 factions.  Responder, Raider, Whitesprings, Enclave Bunker, Free States, Brotherhood of Steel, and Watoga Station/Grahm.
---
So you don't believe anything on the inter et except when Bethesda says it? Interesting
---
No. You should wait for the "Todd comes to your house and does a strip tease, while handing **you** $5" deal.
---
I'm sure it'll happen.
---
Any day now.
---
Yep, aaaaany day.
---
I checked, there's nothing to my right.
---
I dont know man, hope things clear up. 
---
Heheh it's actually some guy his series which blown up the OSRS (Oldschool Runescape) community and sort of turned into a meme at the same time. This just reminded me of it so was leaking =p
---
But honestly no-stash like challenge could be cool.
---
When the high level mobs stay till cleared yes. Most of the time the high level doesnt even know they spawned high level mobs because the range around them is damn long. I commited time to workshops as you have commited time to getting the launch going so its not like I'm gonna ditch server amd redo everything. Then I'm forced to fight to progress which costs ammo and stims too. So ya, fairly similar.
---
I fixed my adrenal today
---
you have to eliminate the mutation and reacquire it with a serum that has been created after the patch 6
---
for me it has worked in my two characters
---
Well, shit. Thank you 
---
Duping destroys the in game economy. Indestructible bases don't.
---
Don’t ask me. I’m asking the OP the same thing. 
---
Pretty sure they really don't understand the point.
---
Camps take about 30 s to a minute to fully appear. Don't log out before that 
---
I’ve been turning in forbidden knowledge for weeks. Can’t get the plans to drop. 
---
Ye. It sucks so much. Hopefully one day we may get respec nuka colas. ^^
---
Yeah, its really serious to get a bunch of nuka colas in a game thats pretty much pve. Joke is a 10 years old telling someone how to be a better parent.
---
No, I have been well aware of the word shill for a long time and have been working to make other people aware of what manipulation and deception is going on online. They are most definitely breaking consumer protection regulations, laws, rules, etc. And I feel that it is my duty as someone who is aware of it to make other people aware of it.
---
How did you meet a level 1? You’re given your first level up in the vault so he’d have to have been at least level 2
---
In terms of harassing you, it's possible but very rare.  In that whole time I've played, people have come after me only once or twice.  For the most part, they leave when they see you aren't interested in fighting back - whether that means ignoring them, going to a different server, etc.
---
Because it's an exploit that benefits **me**.
---
(Not really me, the figurative me)
---
They don't know what ad hominem means, they have just seen other people post it, and they are copying them. 
---
I've seen and killed him 4 times in the last 2 days in the area around Westek... prior to that 4 times in 400 hours! 
---
When I play alone, its to be the hoarder for my gf and brother. That way, when they get on and are like "shit, I need 80 springs to fix my PA" I can hook them up
---
Np
---
&gt; play the game for just one minute even if Pete Hines came with a bottle of high grade Nuka Dark and gobbled his bits while pleading him to play.
---
ngl, that's a pretty funny turn of phrase
---
Couse they got banned lol. I'm still here tho couse I'm not a moron and kept myself in check
---
I always run to downed players as fast as I can, friends or strangers. Can't always get there in time, tho, which sucks. Would be nice if they gave you a few seconds extra.
---
Capped a workshop and forgot about it or teamed up with someone who initiated PvP, eh? Sorry for ya.
---
Yeah happening quite frequently since the latest patch.  My instigating super sledge would one swing most enemies, now often leaves enemies with a slither of health requiring a second bash. 
---
do you also use a bloodied or berserkers weapon?
---
the pip-boy UI is bugged and incorrectly displays the bloodied/berserk effect on all weapons when you have one of those equipped and browse other weapons in your pip-boy. Once you equip and browse to another weapon and back it corrects.
---
All these people claiming to be Nigerian Princes, but I really am and WILL pay you back a million dollars.
---
The youtubers are motivated by one thing only - clicks/likes/subs because those translate into money for them. Let me say that again - youtubers are motivated by one thing only - money. They will say anything to maintain that income stream. They don't care about the games, they don't care about gaming, and they sure as hell don't care about you. Just keep your eyes wide open and your brain on straight when you watch their *entertainment* videos, don't be influenced by them, make up your own mind.
---
But also don't forget that Fallout 76 was a blatant cash grab, a leveraging of franchise value through a slick and masterful marketing campaign. Bethesdas has proven through their *actions* that they don't care about the games, they don't care about gaming, and they sure as hell don't care about you. They also are are motivated by one thing only - money.
---
The half-assed effort to patch the game after release is just a bit of face-saving to restore a little of the brand as they move on to release of their next games on the schedule.
---
And yes I have deleted and quit and come back and am playing because I love this game I hate. It's so much fun, it's so cool and man I wish they *did* care enough about it to fix it all.
---
I literally wanted to wretch after reading this.
---
What economy?
---
That's the intent, at least.  We all know how easy it is to lose bags when you place them on bare ground.  This way, I can lead them to some elevated location as a failsafe.
---
But what we really need, and what many users have requested, are different kinds of bags.  A literal gift box, for example.
---
This is wild. I just watched my fiancé try to take her out last night with a bunch of players, ranging from 30 to 100+. It was outside the nuke zone. Usually you can barely make it to the event without her already being dead because she dies so quick. This one didn't even lose a quarter health before the event ended. I know that if the enemies get far enough away from you they will heal, and I think that did happen once, but most of the time that health bar was not moving at all. 
---
No, base stats.... you missed what i was saying. Yes i understand what those perks do... I'm not even going to explain it. 
---
This.  Simply make Pacifist mode work both ways.  Certainly a line of code or two is more efficient than creating entirely new servers for separate purposes.  Then more time could be devoted to new content.
---
I just want 5he cover/pads
---
To kill the game for good they need to get hid of the players... Most people still playing are the ones that found ways around the most absurd limitating things in game, such as stash space or garbage weapons. Game in its core is flawed. A fallout game where you cannot hoard, really? If it was not for the stash bypassing limit trick I would have quit even earlier. Havent played in a week or more so the ban was just another reason to unistall. Feel bad for some friends that still had hopes for the game and got banned but I doubt they would stick much longer anhyways. From around 30 poeple I knew playing this game only 4 stayed and they all got banned now heh.
---
If this is the case, GT: MICRO UZI STOCK For 100 cap serums on Xbox. 
---
That's most likely it. Duping has a chance to harm me while my indestructible base only benefits me.
---
You pacifist != others will be pacifist towards you.
---
You can be Gandhi but war never changes. 
---
Last night I showed some people the water fountain in the gazebo at White Springs.  Then dropped a few dozen glowing steaks and blood. They were flabbergasted 
---
&gt; Ability to consume food, water, or meds on pickup. 
---
That would be great indeed. I just stick with the Cannibal perk while that hasn't been implemented
---
No.. you can't solo all those mobs and the queen.
---
I know this should be common sense... but just in case... if someone else grabs the mask before you... then when they move so does the mask. So if someone has it, you will have to take the mask from them.
---
I'm not saying level spawning isn't a problem, because it definately is. But, if you're taking a workshop in an area with no level cap at lvl 20, that's still kind of on you.
---
Sadly, I did. However during that time, the camp wasn't even shown on the map. As I mentioned, the server before crashed while my camp was being loaded. I suspect that affected it.
---
The email from bethesda says acquired. That doesnt mean on hand, or in their inventory hoarded away. They received those amount of ammo within 30 days, whether it's by trading , or picking up. 
---
So if I want to get banned all I need to go is drop and pick up 500 rounds of ultracite ammo every day for a few hours a day. 
---
Now if bethesda wants to send a better response saying "we found you had on hand, at this point in time, 100k+ crap" then that would be a clearer sign of duping. Not the fact that you acquired something. 
---
It's the same button as the one you hold to enter build mode when in a workshop or camp.
---
WHERES THE SUNSET SARSAPARILLA?!???! 
---
Duping screwed with the servers. Indestructible bases do not.
---
Apparently it resets though after re-logging in, so back to the same problem? Can anyone confirm?
---
It's something that I noticed even for the Anthem VIP Demo. One streamer took his stream from Friday (the day when it basically didn't work) and cut it up into videos, releasing them over the entire weekend. My friend told me that the game wasn't working at all, for the entire weekend, because one streamer/youtuber made it seem like the game was busted. 
---
Either that or hazmat suit. I mean k see what you're saying. 
---
I thought that I was the only one...
---
I know that feeling! I’m just checking as it’s wintermute above who is offering to trade the plans. If you can strike a deal with them you won’t need me to mod your suit. If you can’t/don’t get the plans I can absolutely fit the lining for no charge. Let me know. Thanks.
---
Indeed. I read other day about bans, didnt play for a while. Checked out and found that I was banned too. Doesnt really matter much, quit over a week ago. If not for the stash trick to bypass the absurd low limit of space and the guns/ammo I would had quit even earlier.
---
Oh right you'd have to buy PS plus too on top of another copy of the game. Probably more hassle than it's worth.
---
Well, first we would
---
-*disconnected from server*-
---
Yeah, this made me sad. Its be far my favorite event to do. I wish they would at least increase the rate.
---
It would also be cool to have a feature where you can "favorite" certain events and get a notification when they start on your server.
---
I never played any Fallout games in the pass.  I pick up this game as my cousin said he lets of fun with it. I like coop games. First day I played I met two people one from California and the other from Florida. I live in Canada I played for about 6 hours didn't even see the time. Now I have been looking at the background of fallout and I'm intrigue. Yes there are bugs but they can fix that. I play for the fun not to grind or pvp. I enjoy it a lot. My uncle who is 70 years old is playing with us. He like me enjoying the game with it faults. If you take your time and read listen and adventure you will enjoy it. Don't grind go slow 
---
Not sure what you're on about. I don't think the fact that the teleportation welcome mat being removed constitutes a Doomsday theory. Oh well, continue spouting rubbish. The point stands that the event was the only thing modifying HP. The point stands that the fast travel welcome mat was removed after beta. Nothing else for me to say, sorry for wasting your time with rambling points to consider.
---
I used to always run right down and help out if I saw a Fissure Prime nuke on my server. I'm level 200+, have taken out plenty. The last 3 or 4 I've been at failed, even with many high level players as well as the usual low level shed-hiders. Also tested with just three high level players in an otherwise empty server and we couldn't make a dent in her either.
---
Yesterday I joined a server with Scorched Earth already in progress and when I got there, there was 8 minutes on the clock with literally NO ONE there.
---
It's definitely frustrating. I don't mind the ammo waste but with Stimpaks no longer spawning at the Watoga mayor safe, I just don't feel like getting my ass kicked for half an hour for basically no reason.
---
This is the post that made me finally unsub
---
An actual main quest 
---
I understand,  I've had i happen. I kill them and take their stuff.
---
Clever marketing strategy.
---
The writing isn't code, it's instructions on what to do if you see the texture, because if you're seeing it it means that correct texture couldn't be found.
---
In my personal opinion yes, that is an advantage (admittedly a very small one). Then again, I am not the person who would be swinging the ban hammer either so they may think otherwise.
---
It would be nice if they could lay out some clearer guidelines soon, as more and more mods are becoming available.
---
I'd guess it's because it doesn't work on every animal... but even then, "Chance to Tame" would be descriptive enough.
---
I haven't played in a week and only did my 4th character for 1 day. But I was doing no stash, no repairing, no crafting as well ... Just randomly did the nuke zone baby thing by fast traveling to a nuke zone and teaming up with a stranger on a whim. and thought that was pretty fun/funny. So it took precendence. 
---
I'd like to do a total wild man build. Always addicted to chems, drinking dirty water, eating only humans, throwing away broken gear, not repairing or crafting anything... stealing workshops just to abandon them.... maybe living in a treehouse with nothing but hanging skulls.
---
What's the name of the youtuber?
---
They both got banned dumb ass. 
---
They trigger when you go near the location, I farmed the powering up posiden event within half an hour so I could get the nuclear generator by server hoping.
---
Oh no! The mods removed the post a lying duper made...whatever shall we do...
---
If you get your account back will you really continue to play 76? Getting banned for playing legitametly is some huge B's
---
I am the op.. and no the haven't patched players joining causing resistance. 
---
So exploiting bugs to ruin gameplay elementa is fine as long as it doesn't impact server performance?  
---
In short: Duping is fine if you don't do it a lot.
---
Gotta disagree with the no good drops for casuals theory. I recently had a 2 star instigating homemade drop at one lvl higher than mine at the time (24) and I regularly find 1 star stuff when I kill legendary stuff. Sure it isn't always stuff MY pc needs but the other newbies seem to appreciate it.
---
after re-logging the game, the mutation positive effects does not appear reflected in the pip-boy, but the effect is working
---
Look I like the game, but you'll have a hard time finding a group with most randoms. Your best bet are any of the discord servers from the various subreddits. /r/fo76FilthyCasuals and /r/fo76bazaar both have their own.
---
I wrote a lot, not surprised you didn't read it. The event granting HP doesn't care where you got the item, that's my point. HP+ isn't Atom Shop item related, it's event related. Your reference to the MoM dress proves that point.
---
Its not that, its about being able to counteract someone when something is used. Thats how you win at most pvp fights. Nothing wrong with using something if it gives you an edge only if there is some way to counteract it. In this case there is. 
---
Should always carry at least one thing you think could counteract a build just in case you run into that said build. That way you can cover your bases in the event of said pvp. 
---
That fast traveling should cost caps makes sense. Arguing that it doesn't 'because it never cost caps in other FO games' is like arguing that VATS should slow/stop time in 76 because it did in other games as well. Fast traveling provides in-game advantages and therefore comes with a small penalty to offset it. If you're having trouble getting enough caps for it, two things help.
---
First, pick every damn plant you come across and sell it. Soot flowers sell for 1c each. If you have Green Thumb, that's 2c every time you walk by a blue flower. And sell some of that purified water as well.
---
Second, put your CAMP somewhere over in the Savage Divide or Cranberry Bog. Then you have the Vault as a free fast travel layover on the west side of the map, and your CAMP on the east side. It makes a big difference.
---
No fine per say but definitely not as big of a problem.  
---
They are.. more enemies, more people to manage. J would rather solo a silo.
---
Aw shucks man, I'll treasure it forever. 
---
And you opinion of his opinion is shit. But unlike his, you hunted out someone elses steeming pile, and took a dump on top of the dump. You have built a shit pyramid.
---
All hail the shit photo.
---
Yeah I had help, and even then I did three times. 
---
Well played sir, thank you for the laugh 
---
were you banned for duping too?
---
Yea id like that, a little medical box that we could place and store our chems also. Actually what id really like to see is a extra storage boxes that others could break into give us the option to lock it so players get a bounty when breaking in it. Instead of increasing stash size any further give us a storage compartment with some risk involved. It will be players choice to use it or not. Id personally use something like that as storage for clothing i find and plans i already know.
---
I can't imagine how anyone would believe that. Even if it were true he was measured having 360k ultracite ammo. 260k on one character, 100k on another. I'm supposed to believe that he dropped enormous piles of rare ammo on the ground instead of trading it and that he did this "back and forth" for some reason. There is no need to trade that ammo "back and forth". Not to mention if he was trading it "back and forth" the ammo numbers should be a hell of a lot closer than they are. I have seen people concoct all kinds of stories about "how it all went down" when trying to get out of something. The only "trading back and forth" he did was with a container when he likely duped the items or when he purchased what was clearly an exploited amount.
---
I am assuming they'll get around to fixing campfires at some point, but they have lots of stuff to "fix" that doesn't need fixing first.
---
I've seen someone build a foundation base right outside of fissure prime, and it may be coincidental, but it was the worst, horribly laggy mess of an SBQ fight I've ever been in. I'm sure there will be enough people abusing campfires to bring it to the devs immediate attention.
---
Yeah I heard that, but others were saying it definitely doesn’t work once you restart? I’m wanting to try but only if I know for sure that it fixes the problem for good?
---
Ok thx
---
Yo Dawg! I heard that you like flames so we put a flame job on your Flaming Flamethrower of Flame!
---
I think the biggest hiccup with pacifist mode is the claiming of public workshops. If you’re in pacifist mode, you shouldn’t be able to claim those. 
---
*You just made a player who has grinded and farmed for hours on end for ultracite ammo, armor, regular armor, weapons and keycards, waste every single bit of resource they had.*
---
OMG Drama much?  Are you OUTRAGED&gt;!&gt;!&gt;!&gt;
---
better make a reddit post about it! oh yeah you did.
---
Some specifics on your load out may help us to make suggestions.
---
Yes seems that’s why
---
That must have taken a lot of effort.. job well done.  You have more patience that me by a long shot.
---
Thread title, your reply, confusement.
---
[What happens if I get caught?]
---
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtLf5v9TXeA)
---
Why is it that anytime someone is bested in pvp they scream that the players where cheating somehow?  It is vary easy to stay invisible for very long periods of time with the right perks and not have more then a few stealth boys.
---
IIRC there was an accurate FO76 info leak prior to release on 4chan, where it was referred to as 'fake and gay' at the time.
---
He keeps spawning on the cliffs above my camp.  Not terribly often, but I've seen it a few times, and managed to kill him once.  Always appeared at login, if that helps.
---
I don't put in a lot of hours, so even that much is pretty remarkable for me, they've definitely upped the spawn rate significantly.  I've seen him twice in the 50 levels up to now.
---
Were not gonna talk about the 30 day fact, that if he played for 24 hours is only 720 hours, the email he received said that he obtained those items within 30 days, it was funny though that he did a bunch of "information" posts the day before the ban happened though.
---
Okay. So the game comes out.
---
Videos of gameplay come out.
---
People do not like what they see. They audible dislike it.
---
You call them uneducated on the matter.
---
More videos come out of gameplay, multiple fuck ups happen with the game company and game. 
---
People dislike this.
---
You:"These people can't have opinions! They haven't played the game!"
---
You ignore all the criticisms people have of the game and then says "They have no concrete Idea of why they dislike it."
---
You kinda seem like a rabid fanboy.
---
Confederate hat item itself is missing from the game. It wasn't a crafting issue, it was a missing item issue. Union hat, witch hat, skeleton mask, top hat, etc. are all fixed
---
It's not just low levels ruining the scorchbeast queen.
---
The last one I went to there were about a dozen lvl 85+ standing around shooting the adds.
---
Not a single one of them were firing at the queen when I got there nor did they ever Fire at the queen. Almost as if they wanted other people to waste their ammo rather than use their own.
---
1. Perk Card Loadouts! 1000% this one
---
2. New Game + I want to get all the old quest items at 50 and re-run the quests while waiting for updates
---
3. Base building upgrades: more budget (or smaller cost for turrets), And make laying down large bases easier without the \*base clipping or \*base floating
---
\- moved my base that's been established since week 2 of the game and can't lay it down anywhere in the game. spend over 1k caps trying to move to flat locations to put it back down, including the original location i had it at for the last few months
---
I understand this, but my bigger question is why people are rightfully angry at dupers but constantly applaud people exploiting the building system and ruining a specific gameplay element.
---
New content was anounced at the same time as PvP servers.
---
All said, PvP servers doesn't negatively affect those of us who prefer PvE. They may actually add to my enjoyment, I'll be willing to try them.
---
If you're in Pacifist Mode, it should be deactivated when you claim a workshop, because it initiates PVP.  Some mostly PVE people(myself included)are willing to accept that risk/reward but aren't interested in just fighting everyone that comes along in the game.  
---
These are two separate issues, really.
---
But the chalkboard in the Lucky Hole Mine says "Buffout+Syringe=FUN??"
---
Fuck yeah rejoin would be great for when I launch a nuke and then get disconnected immediately
---
All you would need is a claim workshop dialog box "claiming this workshop will turn pacifist mode off"
---
Grandfathers gifts are many.  Time for a Plaguemarine build.
---
Hahah that sounds like an interesting series I'd watch tbh, lots of fun and frustration involved.
---
The name of the guy is 'SettledRS' and his most recent series is what I referred too.
---
Explain to me how a base can ruin your gameplay? If you’re a raider youre SOL. Prevents griefing 
---
for me and my teammates it worked, 100% confirmed
---
Thanks man, good to know!
---
They never said it was fine. Duping was just a higher priority.
---
Any further luck spawning him?  If i spawn in run over and kill that grafton monster then run back it should possible spawn him or do i need to run farther?  I saw the pied piper bot spawn there  so i must be doing enough to make the spawns happen.   
---
That is true. Just frustrating that I couldn't hardly do events without being attacked by one especially when at first I was going the melee route and they would just spam the sonic attack without landing. Made me wanna look up at em and say "am I a joke to you??"
---
If you didn't include the picture, I could've guessed exactly what your character looked like based on the title of this thread. 
---
Tricentennial vault boy head and swimsuit get old?
---
You know sympathy and solidarity towards strangers is not a realistic aspect in a fallout world! Survival of the fittest. Exploit the weak! 
---
I wish they would do that, it’s only good when you know there are players about. 
---
Someone should test this theory.
---
as far as i know, that is still working, but i ahvent tested it since the patch.
---
If sever crashes me I like to join back on my last sever. I have been in a situation where took the time and effort to build a workshop (friendly open one I never lock) then sever crashed and now lost all that cuz sever was buggy. And one more thing as I join a sever and I wasn't wearing my PA cuz of crash loaded in a God dam nuke zone. Died as I logged on. That really sucked. 
---
I saw 2 mothmans &gt;!Mothmen?!&lt; next to each other
---
That would be useful. I hate when I check for events, nothing, do something else for a few minutes check again, ooh uranium fever! Fast travel, aaaaand there's not enough time to talk to the robot, enter the mine, and sprint to the terminal before the event fails.
---
lol not marketing strategy, if you have the materials i can give you for free
---
Are you seeing the event on the world-map, or just hearing it mentioned on the school PA-system. The school PA system sometimes "advertises" the Monster Mash  event even when it isn't occurring. One of my friends got tricked by the PA announcement earlier this week. 
---
Don't misunderstand me, I agree with you. I just don't see it being a priority to BGS.
---
I spend a shit ton of time farming and crafting ammo because I hate melee weapons and I like shooting stuff. 
---
I have full ammosmith perk and full super duper perk and let me tell you there is no way you are crafting 100k rounds of any one type of ammo.  The weight alone wouldn’t make it feasible.  
---
The best part was the ultracite component to the story. Um yeah right dude.  
---
Yes, because i would like something done. I'm not being dramatic, I'm being honest. I have been pretty polite in what I'm saying. No need to be that way.
---
Those crops take up a lot of camp build budget so I prefer to just do runs or take over workshops when I need stuff and keep the camp budget for aesthetic items only. 
---
Helps keep more of a purpose to the day to day looting and workshop takeovers. 
---
Finding those furniture plans is what keeps me going at end game.
---
&gt;Call for help when downed literally does nothing. all it does is make a little flashy emoji in front of your face with some guy waving his arms. No one on the map will see it. People around you won't even care if they do see it. 
---
No one owes you a revive. This is the wasteland after all, resources are supposed to be scarce and competition to survive tough. Maybe find some friends and you won't have this problem.
---
I've seen a lot of players freak out and abuse this feature. Shit's rough out there and you're gonna die, get over it. Worst case scenario you lose some junk. So what, there's more everywhere. Otherwise dying is wholly inconsequential so it makes sense strangers aren't crawling all over themselves to save your ass. Thems the breaks, kid.
---
Pacifist mode is fine as is. People have to really try to kill you if you even with it off if you dont shoot back. Just stay away from workshops unless you want the possibility of pvp
---
Any J-RPG might fit you, i personallty recommend FFXIV.
---
i mean i will never play 'adventure mode' once survival mode is released.  i think survival mode should have been the vanilla version of the game at release.  the wanted system (and the rest of the current pvp model) is entirely broken imo
---
I had a person slapping around one of my characters   while I was looking through my stash near flatwoods. I had pacifist on so He didnt do much damage but the game locked up when I heart emoji him and I couldnt move. I reset the game and returned to beat on him in PVP until he turned pacifist on and quit the game. 
---
Did you own a workshop? 
---
5hp? Interesting. My friend almost killed me the other day. I had no workshops claimed at all and I had pacifist on. Three hits from his grognak axe came very close to killing me. Had to use pretty much all my stimpaks to not die since he kept wailing away on me. And I was at full health and have high dmg resistance thanks to a full set of vanguard and ironclad maxed out. Eventually I had to server hop away
---
It fixed my civil war top hat plan.

So why I have plan for it, if it's missing?

This is great.  I wish the focus of the media and the internet for FO76 was on this kind of creativity and fun being had by the players instead of -- well, you know what we get instead.  
---
Feels good Inc
---
It’s off and on.  There were only four of us in the nuke, so it wasn’t player numbers. The only saving grace was I looted the same legendary ghoul 4 times. Three wood armor and a pool cue. 
---
Same for me. I stopped doing solos because I always disconnect after launch or after wasting a ton of ammo on the queen.
---
I hold off until I'm teamed up so there's a good chance I can rejoin if disconnected.
---
The plan is in game available from the civil war reenactor. The item is not.
---
I admit we'll have to wait and see what Wild Appalachia brings.  Whether it's some exciting new content or one or two new events will show us the level of effort.  
---
I've put over 200 hours into the game now which IMO is more than my money's worth.  I would gladly pay $10/month for SUBSTANTIAL new content.  Most people crying about this *shitty game being not worth the money* clearly dont remember(or are younger and too entitled)most new games being $50-60 and having anywhere from 30-80 hours of actual worthwhile content.
---
Notice how that is happening in every sub-reddit and probably has nothing to do with your conspiracy theories?

Lolz,  You wanna kill rubberneckers who JUST wanna watch?
---
If you hate their lack of participation,  then MAKE THEM PARTICIPATE.
---
Then, bring that ugly flying bitch to them and her posse the rally point where they sit.
---
Have them decide for themselves, do I sit and cower hiding in my bathroom while getting my ass beat.
---
OR do I grow a pair, and start throwing lead? 
---
FWIW, everyone’s a pacifist until they get popped in the nose. 
---
The lookielous came to see a show. They brought their popcorn snuggled in and wanted to someone’s ass get beat. Why not make it, THEIRS?
---
I read somewhere the US civil war battle, bull run or manassas had civilians sitting on the outskirts of the battle area, watching the fighting, placing bets and having picnic lunches.
---
I bet when the fight moved to them, they fought or ran. Maybe both?
---
Fwiw, there’s a line from a movie where the hero says, I’m not gonna kill ya, but I’m not saving you either..
---
Now they can just walk all alone and realising they are playing fallout lite single player
---
lol good luck with that.  as someone whos done many silo runs solo and on a team, its significantly easier not having to swap out perks for picklock and hacking, in a team, only 1 person needs these utilities.  and ive had team silo runs where we are just standing around for half of the launch prep waiting for it to be over, cuz no more mobs spawned

I do some adventuring still, now and then, but I stick with resource farming at camps. Sell the extra, fix my shit and make tons of bullets. 
---
you are just dictating what other players do with their time.  
---
Do you go to a friend's birthday party and then proceed to tell everyone how to act, what to say?
---
you cant control everything, and its a fools errand to even try
---
however, good luck with all that!!!
---
&gt; so no special effects for the blast zone
---
can you educate me on how nuking the area around prime adds special effects? I've just nuked whitesprings (and only once for the first time yesterday so I'm new to the whole thing) so I didn't know that was a factor for the SBQ fight.
---
If you're on PC we have a small discord that will gladly play with you.
---
Funny (or sad) thing is that you care more for my ban than myself.
---
What's the area of your camp, if you don't mind? So maybe I could try to head there and maybe find him, if that would work lol. 
---
My endgame lately (I'm L118) has been crafting L5 pistols with stabilized barrels and hardened receivers and leaving them w/250 10mm rounds in various containers around Vault 76 and Flatwoods.
---
Hope new players are getting them!
---
I'll have to check around there, thanks
---
The "buff" was simply to incentivize players going around together dressed as one of the Unstoppables each, to take group photos, etc, instead of going around dressed normally. No one bought the outfits so that they could have +15 health for a single week. That is silly.
---
I don't visit any others. But thank you for the information. I appreciate being corrected if I'm wrong.
---
this bug completely destroys my build, I'm happy to have solved it
---
I know, I just still can't believe what kind of lame developing is this, that you insert plan for non-existing item!?!?!
---
The idea that Bethesda's test team is competent considering the launch state of FO76 is kind of mindboggling.
---
Theres no evidence that this guy cheated.  We can't just assume he was and call for justice against him.  The hate train for Bethesda is so full because it's justified and earned.  I'm a huge fan of the fallout franchise,  since the first fallouts. But the issues list they have is extensive.  I'm not saying hate the game because bugs, all games have bugs.  But the mannor in which they conduct things is deserving of the criticism 
---
They also summoned an inter-dimensional being so... Take that as you wi...
---
Wait...
---
The banned dupers... Did beth at least save their blood and salty tears for the sacrifice?!?!?!?
---
That's nothing like what I'm trying to do, but cool story. 
---
I am not band but I am unsubing from this place. 1300 of you are supporting a condescending attitude to players that you can't prove are guilty. This isn't the first time I have seen this kind of shit from this sub but thank God it will be the last.
---
Yes that is how it works.
---
Look at hot they should be on there ! They actually change the look of the armour
---
I meant RodneyKang, the OP who said it was patched. 
---
Id love to make a noise Marine personally but this should hold me over lol
---
Call for help works fine. It's visible to people nearby, who are the only players with time enough to reach you. I've saved strangers twice, teammates three times, and been saved once myself. I wish the timer were a bit longer, but it has worked fine for us. 
---
But there are 4 different endings available.  You can side with the Institute, BOS, Railway, or the Minutemen.  Each ending is different and most are satisfying.
---
Did Tattered Rags count as well? Because the Mistress outfit is a really bad armor set.
---
Nope, I was not banned for duping but my oldest mule did get suspended for reasons that according to the numbers on my spreadsheet make no sense.
---
Said that this is between me and Bethesda. For now I have stopped playing the two mains that require ammo and resources - heavy weapons and stealth sniper - and limited myself to the melee toon that can go for weeks with minimum resource consumption.
---
Just up your stealth and hide in the elevator the whole time.

You mean most that are still around are gone heh.
---
Ooo although I like the billbords and stuff I'd love to see some more pallets and more building stuff I feel the walls we have are very eh ... It's hard to do so much with the limited walls we have
---
Wrong, at no point in time did her ever have that much on him. If you actually read the Bethesda email with proper reading comprehensions kills, it says he had that much pass over his account in a 30 day period. 
---
&gt; by your reasoning the numbers would most likely be much much higher because he used it up and duped more
---
My "reasoning" is simple. In no way does the email say he *has* that much ammo in his inventory at any given time, only how much has passed his inventory. 
---
Aka, he can have 5k ammo, pass it between his 2 accounts, that 5k will count as if 10k ammo has passed his account. In other words, the values are inflated. We know for a fact Bethesda can not track where non-unique items come from, they way they punish dupers is by looking at their inventory, not tracking duped items because they can not tell what is or isn't a duped item. 
---
&gt; stop being ignorant
---
Or you could learn to fucking read. Hypocrisy at it's finest. Calling people ignorant, but fails to educate themselves on the matter properly and think they know it all without actually using their brain. Stop being ignorant. 
---
Unless you've got friends buying at the same time, I wouldnt.

As others have said, hide in the elevator. You can either close the door or hide behind the left or right side of the door opening to regroup and heal.

Let the scorchbeast do the majority of the damage and tanking them, help pick off the bots that focus on the SB and you'll have a shiny new All Rise in no time.
---
I had the exact same issue just yesterday, with some prick in excavator PA, one shotting me regardless of what I would do to tey and retaliate. I did little to no damage with whatever I'd use, plasma 'nades, TS black powder rifle, explosive shotgun, Anti-Armor lever rifle, nothin. I'd like to know how this happens too
---
Awesome, hope it fixes mine too.
---
This isn't true. That's why people are complaining. 
---
It's not fine. People in pacifist mode, who want nothing to do with PvP are being harassed by cowards who are beefed up *for* PvP. Often times higher level players. 
---
It doesn't take much effort to find people sharing firsthand experience, even of getting "one-shotted" in their own camps. 
---
Man, last night, I went over into a confrontation with a Scorchbeast near Pleasant Valley Station.  It was fighting a gang of Super Mutants, so I start trying to kill them off.  From out of nowhere, a Vengeful Mothman shows up and starts attacking the Scorchbeast, and then me.  Very frantic battle.

100% agree. Not all opinions are equal. There are tons of uninformed opinions out there, especially on the internet. 
---
Usually around 5-6pm in the UK mate 
---
Just keep plugging the talk button at her. It took like 5-10 minutes for her to acknowledge me.
---
I think there was a delay after her dialogue finished.
---
Not as permanent as the feeling that we got scammed into buying this game.
---
Do you have no idea what Acadian is? Frangalis? Look, you should get your assistant and ask. Hell, even Americans have whacky french/English hybrids. Ever been to New Orleans? Nah you obviously don't travel much.
---
While you're doing all that other stuff listed make sure you keep stocked in cranberry relish. 10% exp buff adds up 
---
Mate?  I'm not your mate, and not only that the math doesn't add up. The volume of flux he'd need to have farmed is well beyond a reasonable expectation of level.  He had that much ammo on his account, not 'counted from picked up or switched through numerous trades'
---
He cheated.  Oh well.  
---
I think your solutions is great, but I like my idea of giving griefers a random incurable 24 hour disease.

I hate that you are right.

You mean 46 years Young!!

fair enough, but to take time to stop fighting to surround me and all wave at my corpse is ridiculous
---
People already did everything they had to do in this game anyways. Bet most dont even know they got banned as few still play. I only found out after I read about it in here, havent logged in in a while.
---
doesn't it say you're entering into PvP already? 
---
From the home screen, they are on the community tab. You can also find a link from the friends list. I'm playing now if you want to stop by. Otherwise, we all have odd schedules and insomnia, so there's usually someone online.

There is already an era appropriate bathing suit in game?

thank you! i was also wondering how that worked
---
Of course it's at the golf course.
---
OOOh fuck those looks cool...
---
I will drop some Atoms
---
Reddit is a fickle mistress
---
Got banned, don't care. Don't even remember the last time I booted the game.
---
There is just no other location in the game that has the quantity of high tier high exp enemies to spawn at such high rates. You would think endgame cranberry big would be the spot but nope, I hate that I’m right too.
---
But PvP and destroying bases is just as much a gameplay element as farming for resources or legendaries.  
---
Are you suggesting that because you don't like a specific gameplay element it's fine to exploit bugs and deal less with said gameplay element?
---
They're basically interactive soft porn for those entertained by pixelated boobies.

You might want to consider growing up, then.

Just an innocent little baby trying to survive in a scary, demon-haunted world I take it.

I had to server hop twice to complete this quest

So, I guess you're option 2 then?

I wonder if video games will start having Senior Citizens Discounts once my generation gets truly old.
---
Do you have some specific goal in mind for leveling, like you are respeccing your special or something? If not, why worry about it? You don't get any more powerful above 50. It's not like your hit points or anything scale with level. You don't get any more special points or perk slots above 50. You already have access to the highest level gear. You're at the point now where leveling is just an extra thing that happens on the side, as you do other things, like farming for resources, hunting for loot, or completing challenges for atoms.
---
Dude!!!
---
I did cheat too, but only one of twenty mules got banned. Still got like thousands of TSE's. Anyone wanna buy some?
---
1k caps each.
---
I never see cool bases like this in the wild.
---
How does it matter whether the event is still live or not? It was a real thing and without calling Bethesda out on it they will most likely just slowly up the gameplay benefits from events like this. 
---
People have mostly lost interest in the game so it's perfectly normal that creators are a bit late to the party, compared to when this game was making headline news every week.
---
The only thing that's manufactured is your interpretation of the intent behind these videos. 
---
speaking as someone waiting for survival mode, i don't want a single pacifist player on the server im playing on.  i dont think pacifist should even exist.  i dont think pacifist should even exist, its extremely immersion breaking.  because we have very different perspectives on this is why we need separate servers, for survival players and carebears.
---
Actually I'm to your right, stealth boy'd ... glaring at you.
---
Why leevl 60? 50 would seem more appropriate..
---
No worries. I’ll be here if you need me.
---
What's shadow deleted compared to regular deleted?
---
i tried to warn people about the economy being fucked while duping was still a hot topic here. it's only natural with the **rng** based loot and an **infinite supply of caps** in the economy, we go to item for item trading. Hell it already got there before duping was nixed.
---
sadly, i guess most of it went on deaf ears.
---
Must be worst with that weapon tbf, I found it annoying just with a rifle having to hit again.
---
I don’t understand his appeal at all. 
---
The chance for exploits would be high
---
It may, I never paid that much attention. I'll have to claim one later and check.
---
True, that's just a dick move all around.
---
Fallout 4 is in an almost, dare I say, halfway-acceptable state now.
---
It certainly *feels* like night &amp; day coming from 76.
---
It's just like the Anti MAGA folks and the Jussie Smollet situation.  You just WANT to believe Bethesda did something horrible, even when there's clear evidence that there's something suspicious about the 900 hour guy's claims.
---
Basically, the Devil's Backbone location (Due east of Huntersville, on the switchback road where the flagpole is).  He shows up on the cliffs right above that for me.
---
Alternately, the camp where you went to for Rose at the Top of the World where all the traps were, it's SSE of there.
---
I've been on two SBQ fights since the last patch.  In neither one did she ever go below 3/4 health, even with a team of 10 people pouring fire into her.
---
Ofc, the adds we killed had the "endless spinning arrow" error so we did TWO queen fights and got NO loot.
---
Aaargh.
---
Because by that time if you mess up your build level 60 is enough time to correct it.
---
How do you get rid of that specific mutation, without getting rid of the others?
---
So I run heavy gunner too with the Gatling.

Any reasons on why you think the .50 cal is better in large enemies?

Welcome to the internet. Forums are only good for two things:

---
thats your opinion.  i killed a level 73 this week at hemlock holes when i was level 11.  how exactly are the players who want PVP cowards and those avoiding it are not? im not sure u understand what that word means
---
Hmmmm I guess that is likely. I'm sure they could look at precedents set by similar online survival games &amp; MMOs on how to combat that. 
---
Was your server empty? I have seen a couple, both with turrets blasting the back of whitesprings (perhaps causing the server to become unstable and not add new players before resetting).
---
Not worth it anymore though.  An extra 20 DMG on top of base 200DMG is hardly worth 5 Perk Points.
---
YES YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
camp would be a great way to let people blow caps. I'd even be ok if they split out a new bar and made it "non-defense" only expansions or something if they're worried about a bigger bar meaning too many defenses.
---
It'd have to be always on pacifist so people can't abuse it. Possibly asked before you log in and only be disabled so you can own workshops.
---
The actual ban was for 140k of ammo.  You can obtain this if you happen to come across dropped ammo in the world if you buy it from another player.  There are posts on LFG selling large amounts of ammo for a cheap price.  Buying or picking up ammo in the world is Legitimate.  Bethesda allows ammo to be dropped and sold.
---
You cant get one shotted if you are not engaged in pvp. 
---
And then there's me over here just wondering why there is a shack in the mire filled with bicycle's and vacuum tubes...

Though technically they shouldn't be strangers, since we're all out of Vault 76.  So teamwork!

I can't set foot in Grafton without triggering Grafton Day and Protest March, as well as the daily quests Pass the Buck and Buried with Honor. Fertile Soil seems to always start when I want to pass through the Flatlands quickly, and Feed the People happens every damned time I pass by Mama Dolce's. You want an event, go to where it happens.
---
Did you ever see a lvl 250 dude with mr handy saw or ripper? You literally die in 5 seconds
---
Hi! This one is on our radar and we're looking into a fix.
---
I know you said you've tried switching weapons and reloading, but if you holster your current weapon (by holding the reload button) while invisible,  unholster it, and then move around, does that bring you out of cloak?
---
Also, do you happen to have the Escape Artist perk equipped when this occurs?
---
For a month or so doing about 10 sbq a day legit was my record.
---
 I can tell you have yet to farm sbq or at least never tracked the results let's say he gets one of the right flux per run(not likely to happen but it makes the math easy) and does 10 runs a day a month, it would take him 5 months of 10 sbq runs a day to cover 2/3rd of the ammo he had.
---
So 2.5 months of 10 sbq a day to cover the ammo he supposedly farmed in one month assuming he only made 100k and triple transferred it.
---
P.s. "consumer protection rules" ahaha see the thing is they haven't if they had multiple actual organizations would be breathing down thier necks, instead of a small class action.is Bethesda perfect hell no but you may want to hop off the hate train.
---
Destroying the game? How? Trying to bypass the main flaw in the game that is not being able to hoard stuff in a FALLOUT game? If anything duping and stash trick made the game live longer for the overwhelming majority. I have to say if not for that I would had quit back in december. Didnt help much in the long run though, havent log in for over a week. Only found out about bans after reading here lol.
---
I'm not here to judge what they do for leisure 
---
There's no evidence he's played for 900 hours either
---
Relax, I'm not attacking you and mate is just something I use to say.
---
Yeah, launching a nuke just for the game to crash is extremely demoralizing. I can only imagine what it feels like for people who have nuked fissure prime, killed the queen and crashed before looting her

Bethesda has not done a good job explaining themselves regarding these bans. Believe it or not, Bethesda has a lot more blame than r/fo76 wants to admit.
---
I’ve reaquired via serum and the text actually still says weapon damage.  This is Long after logging off and the serums wearing off.  
---
I took off starched, cleared all my mutations.  Logged off and on, then took all the serums. Adrenal was the last one I took.

It’s been nerfed but it works.

If it's really a "great idea" there are people here who would embrace and support it. The fact that not everyone might opine that an idea is great is simply part of life.

unfortunately, it is pointless.  ur correct =/
---
It was there to promote people playing together not necessarily buy the costumes. How do people actually expect  all the updates and expansions to be free but bitch when they promote the Atom Shop.  
---
They have to keep revenue comkng in somehow.  Don't like?  Don't buy and shut up.
---
Oh yeah, I think that needs to be fixed for sure. Oh, and get this.  Say one person claims the workshop and a teammate kills the owner in a seperate part of the map.  Even if the workshop owner respawns without seeking revenge everyone else on the team that hasn't killed him, will still be hostile.  So even if he doesnt go defend the workshop, or seek revenge, and simply chooses to respawn wherever they just were.  Each teammate now has the opportunity to kill him at least once no matter what. 
---
&gt; I don't think Bethesda every wanted it to be a caps economy, they want people to barter with stuff. That's why the venders have very little caps, mobs drop very little caps, cap stashes have very little caps, bounties are low and there is a 25k limit on caps.
---
then give us an easy way to barter. 
---
Perhaps have a CAMP item that's a display case. you can put any 1 item in it, and it has a doorbell on it. when a player rings the bell it alerts the owner of the display case that someone wants to tride. allow the owner to put a txt note or holotape describing what they want.
---
each case costs 10k caps to create and takes up the same CAMP size as a turret or something.
---
[Homer Simpson voice] Small group co-op… mmmmmm! [drool]

76 has a story and quests and RPG character building. It differs in that there's no way to play turn-based and there's no roleplaying in the story.
---
Okay, point taken. My mistake. Then there's still their other fuckups, what's their excuse for those?
---
It's working just fine for me, for my basic crafting needs (ammo, food, meds) ((even weapons and armor))
---
At best the ultracite thing is a radical edge case that applies to practically no one. Maybe there's one dude out there... who lives in a log cabin all alone in some frozen backwoods way up North. Due to a traumatic brain injury, he no longer has the need to sleep. So to pass the time he neurotically crafts ultracite ammo for 23 out of 24 hours per day, stopping only to stare at a wall for an hour in hopes of turning wood into gold using ONLY HIS MIND (gotta have more than one hobby). That guy.... yeah... possible he got banned.
---
I know there are some invisible walls in the game. Maybe they were outside the event area and the game bugged out? I'm just rambling ideas. 
---
It maybe 5hp base slap damage, but I wonder if damage % increase that?
---
I had a griefer with a power fist that was doing around 10-20 dmg per hit through slap/armor. I was counting hits/checking health while they were doing it. They weren't able to kill me, but I wasted quite a few stimpacks for science.
---
Hi! Thanks for reporting this, going to send you a PM for some more info.
---
my theory is that its related to the time traveling guy,  he started with deep space vacuum and bicycles as a means for travel, then gave up and moved to the monorail experiment 
---
- with Bandolier 100k ammo weight as much as 11k rounds (90% reduction)           
---
- you don't have to own 100k at once (I didn't too), just use them over 30 days        
---
- you get multiple ultracite scraps per SBQ &amp; only need one single scrap for up to 280 rounds (depending on ammo type)
---
Pretty much.

So nice and junkie looking :o
---
It looks really nice and is invigorating me to want to go out and find a re-existing structure to build in and around! :-D
---
Level 20 not banned either. 
---
This new account. So I can tell you are as ignorant as you are subtle as you spout off unfounded facts to gas light hate here. 
---
the point is that some builds require legendary gear. and chances are you will never find your very specific drop. so you look for someone who has it and is willing to trade. except they want a very specific legendary you don't have either.
---
duping masqueraded the fact poverty builds is what 99% of the playerbase would be running otherwise. and I'm not ok with locking such content behind a 0.000001% rng and ludicrous trades I'll never qualify for.
---
I sure hope not. By the way do you have an ice pack?
---
Can you give an example?
---
Level requirements are just a bad idea - you have no idea how people have built.  I have an under lvl 60 that can output more damage in the right circumstances than I can with my lvl 170.
---
The scaling for the queen is what needs to be fixed, though giving full credit for the event to anyone that shows up and tap the queen should be examined too.  Make it a minimum amount of damage done to queen before you can get the event rewards and loot from the queen's body.
---
It's funny to me that at the core. the problem is a duplication glitch and there's a perk to duplicate items called SuperDuper 
---
Problem is this game did everything in it's power to drive away the hardcore gamers that were carrying 90% of the SBQ fights.  They still haven't addressed her loot table properly, and she was the ONLY end game content. 
---
Between the nerfs, stealth nerfs, breaking things that actually worked with no justification or reason (ex:adrenal reaction), bans, basically everything they've done since launch has stifled this game and people's desire to play it.
---
Would you really want to put up with all of that crap over and over again just to kill a boss that drops nothing useful?
---
Do it! Less is more! 
---
One of the informal "rules" I have for my character is that she doesn't wear underarmor except in special cases.  I've wanted more flattering underarmor options.  For example, I like how the Harness leaves the arms exposed.  Why?  Because she's cute and I like the idea that she's killing things left and right and not even wearing pants. 😇
---
If you can get past the impracticality of it, the only thing about having more revealing options is that skin looks really weird when it rains in this game.
---
I had the witch's hat plan learned for ages and wondered why it never appeared on the crafting list but it's working since the patch.

I'm just rambling thoughts. Lol I have no idea.

Usually, deletions are due to rule breaking. In that case, your post is deleted with a flair that says the reason it was deleted.
---
Shadow delete involves deleting it without telling anyone. I didn't even know it was gone till people who were following the discussion messaged me asking why my post was removed.
---
Ya it’s weird. I never even made ammo. The most ammo I ever had was 5000 .45 rounds. But I’ve just collected those from playing. The only thing it can be is that I had a duped weapon on me. But I’m sure everyone does whether they know it or not. Or that I have duper’s in my fiends list. But why are they still online??? I’ve been against duping from the beginning so this is a huge punch in the balls. Fallout is usually my favorite game. I don’t know if I’m going to play it again after my band is lifted. Plus they said I had 100,000 legendary weapons... wtf! Nope. I don’t even have two of the same. They prob had their special ed intern write the algorithm to find duper’s. Sorry you got the boot too. What is even worse is after they realized they banned all these peeps for no reason they won’t apologize or give us credit or anything. We are walking away with strike one. Strike two is Permanent.  
---
Occasionally they drop some nuggets like this in the patch notes, so it's always worth skimming at least.
---
I never put pacifist on. I have a little over 100 hours played and I've only been attacked by another player once (and I killed them).
---
Tattered rags did not count afaik.
---
Lower the cost of serums for crying out loud!!
---
You are twisting it all. SBQ isn't the only source of flux. Only one of the sources. You can also farm, it from nuke zones. On multiple characters I would assume? But maybe not, so lets leave that out. A hundred unstable or 10 stable flux every time average. Then you can trade with others. If you are in a clan, say 10 people at the event, everyone could give one person their flux, or the flux they didn't need, trade it around between each other. Next there is the markets. People can buy flux from other players, or ammo for that matter. 
---
And the shilling that is going on online isn't well known or regulated, but it will be.
---
wish u were on PS4, if anyone needs a teammate (or scout for upcoming survival mode) add me PSN piwrecks
---
Good explanation, can't think of anything else that could have caused it.
---
Actually, we don't know that...
---
We do know he got suspended for acquiring too much rare Ultracite ammo over the period of 30 days...
---
140k of ultracite on ONE character, at one time. His OTHER character had over 200k, at one time. Thats well over 300k AT ONE TIME.
---
Yea, that seems innocent enough.
---
Bring an endangerol syringer.  It used to work... but who knows what got broke in the most recent patch.
---
This dude deleted a ton of posts. No need to defend him, removing evidence nearly always points to guilty concious trying to clean up.
---
Then what's wrong with Jim's video?
---
Everyone is assuming 900hrs guy had 0 ultracite ammo at the start of the 30days. Whatever beth is using to detect over 100k items hasn't been running since launch. The email says over a period of 30days it was detected that over 100k of a rare item was detected. That's all it says. It doesn't say when the 30days started. That ammo could have been crafted over a period of time a lot longer than 30 days. But of course Beth is infallible and incapable of being wrong, right?
---
My thought is that Beth flipped the switch on this detection system probably 30dsys before all this banning mess started and arbitrarily flagged people with over 100k items regardless what they were. And since it's only been running for 30days theres no way for them to know when exactly and over what period of time these people accumulated these items.
---
There is no percentage increase on the base damage.
---
I guess I’m a poor real estate agent, because almost everywhere I build I eventually hear the sound of chewing while I’m crafting. At the fucking molerat or  irradiated dog is chewing out a concrete wall.

At home I use a 2006 Mac pro.  I upped it to 16gb of ram, and put in a gt 1030.  There is no real hardline Internet so I use a glorified cellphone tether.
---
I get a steady 26fps!
---
Ive got the 2gz CPUs too!  I. Trying to get the quad core 3ghz processors so I'm not running at 95% across all 4 Cores.
---
Even an old crappy Mac pro can do it! 
---
Hahaha... and wearing exactly the kind of outfit I would expect for someone who owns a C.A.M.P. this eccentric. Marvelous.
---
The rewards off the scorched queen suck, the adds from the queen are worth more than the queen and when they nerf those you wont really have anyone showing up except for flux. 
---
the only reason to the queen is to get the plans that i can now get from fort defiance. 
---
Truth came out on mr 900 hrs as well, chap. Cheaters always lie. And LOL the funniest part is you seriously sound like you convinced yourself you did nothing wrong. It’s funny whether or not you truly believe it, btw. 
---
Just relax and be happy they didn’t perma ban you.
---
I'd take a hit for the team and skip that useless item.
---
The fact that 4chan seems to be an accurate source of leaks most of the time is a dark irony
---
ive experienced this first hand this week, wish they would come for me on my lvl 141 not my new character i just started lol
---
It does. It says something like other players can initiate pvp with you. Not very clear, but there is a warning.
---
That's not how everyone feels, hence the split and hence survival mode is not replacing the current rules. Not everyone wants to pvp.
---
I don't *think* he has any specific spawn conditions, but I know two things have always been the same the 5ish times I've seen him:
---
-I was alone
---
-He started perched on some overlook or high point that was above me.
---
But why would he if he wasnt using it?
---
And if he was using it, that means he made and used up 100s of thousands more. Think about it.
---
😂
---
If they increased her dmg res scaling then good luck... it was already way off in regards to numbers.  Patch 5, 3 of us could take her down fairly easily... 3-5mins.  With 10+ it would take significantly longer, 10+mins.
---
If they gave her more DR... I'd just give up.
---
Do you guys know if cats are actually more sensitive to the cold. I heard that once and ever since the idea of an outdoor cat is disturbing.
---
I have one of these bases, the only people that would dislike it are raiders, I was watching a show with my gf and I come back to 3 people trying to bust in, so I turned on my 50 sirens and afk.’d again. They were cussing and flustered so it was funny.
---
I destroy bases, but don’t don’t be upset that you don’t know how to destroy things within concrete ones like I do.
---
If you can’t figure it out you deserve to cry/complain. Git gud 
---
Even with the increased stash limits I am always running out of space so dumped a bunch of screws and springs and adhesive at various train stations.  Also did a WS golf club farming run and actually ended up with a couple of legendary weapon drops (Gatling Gun and Action Rifle) and dropped them for lower level players.  
---
I had a guy drop me a nice 2 shot Gauss back when I was about lvl 60 (now I’m lvl 114) and I was very thankful. 
---
Once you get higher level and cores become easier to get, 1 point in batteries included is better than 3 in power user.  3 points in batteries included will allow you to carry 10 times as many cores.
---
Again this is contingent on how easily you can get cores.  Starting out a session by claiming the 3 power plants and periodically stopping by the fusion core generators usually provide me a week or two worth of cores.
---
Prior to the patch, I've had numerous instances where enemies would be seen in the distance, and when I scope them, they would fall to the ground dead.
---
It actually hasn't happened to me yet since this last patch that I remember, but the bug is likely still there.
---
People have been practically begging for travel without the use of caps. Every time it comes up, some troll comes in to argue and express why they love paying for traveling and how it makes sense, they should just git gud and make more money. so silly because it hasn't existed in any previous Fallout game even in survival mode. Just one example. People will argue with you over anyting
---
Yeah. A new vote manipulating account. GTFO.
---
I highly doubt this guy got 140k ultracite ammo from buying it from legitimate players. Some of it or most of it was duped, almost certainly.
---
Hard time finding teams a lot of nights but absolutely worth a buy. With the way they have marketed it since the backlash of the bugs and whatnot, you will most definitely get your moneys worth.
---
those were 3 generations of the engine ago. That version may have had some MMO capability, but that ability is sorely lacking here.
---
Huh, I don't know then lol.  I'm always alone, I'm a solo player, and I tend to avoid other people, as they just can't be trusted. I guess maybe I'll have to start looking up at cliffs more often when I'm near them or something.
---
Did anyone actually pay money for it though? There's also no win state in this game so I don't know how anything could be pay to win here. If someone kills you you might lose a few materials and a handful of easily attainable caps. Whatever.
---
I don't think Bethesda should have done the buff because it was obvious that there was gonna be this fake outrage over it and the game didn't need more of that easily avoidable bad press. But I also can't be bothered to actually give a fuck about it.
---
Charging barrels for the Gatling laser we’re buffed a while back, they are decent and pretty ammo efficient, especially if you get one with the legendary modifier that makes it fire faster, as it makes it fire much faster than the 25%increase it says it gives.
---
Don't be idiot. If anything, SBQ should become obsolete and it should be replaced with actual endgame that requires teamwork and brains.
---
My favorite game now. Found a group of people in game. Love it. If on Xbox, can give you my gamer tag.
---
This is the right answer.
---
It's something that should be fixed, but it's not as big of a problem as something that crash entire servers for everyone playing.
---
Ideally, since campfires are at the heart of this, I'd like to see them implement formal garden plots first, since that's what a lot of CAMPs use the campfires as a substitute for these days.
---
Don't forget the Brotherhood Recon Rifle!  You can craft them to level 1 for the cost of a hunting rifle, but it comes fully modded including a recon scope.  They make excellent gifts!
---
Glorious.
---
He really cares about the 900 hour asshole. He rushes to his defense in each thread about him.
---
It's random so you need luck
---
Yeah there are so many problems I want fixed before that lol that exploit doesn't effect me in the slightest 
---
Yeah, I read up on the latest patch, but didn't read up on patch 5 really. Just kinda didn't feel like it I guess. Gonna have to always read them for small things like that from now on
---
How do you figure? Someone came to my base recently and shot me until i died without me fighting back. I just stood there expecting the games mechanics to work as intended...
---
I started an Alt character a few weeks ago, and on my way to the Overseer's  camp I was approached by a level 47 who dropped a bag with ammo, water, stimpaks &amp; dog food. I tried to tell him I didn't need it, but I guess they had no Mic, so I just flashed him the Heart emote, picked it up then dropped it at the Overseer's camp.
---
I've recently started crafting Level 5 Armor &amp; BOS Recon rifles for the new players, I drop those along with Ammo, Water, &amp; Diluted Stimpaks which I have an overabundance of, hoping they will pay it forward in the form of cooperative gameplay.
---
&gt; People will argue with you over anyting
---
No we won't
---
this is why i said IMO, which stands for In My Opinion. 
---
I don't think I have the plans for that? Where did you get it?
---
I think it's a way to destroy caps. To me I think it's an economy check. 
---
It's still stupid. Lol
---
But this is an odd venue of fallout 76 players. There's a lot of butt hurt people and a lot of people who aren't having fun and want to blame others as to why they're not having fun. Don't let those people drag you into either category. 
---
Pretty sure they stay in that world.
---
And after all that, the three star legendary behemoth doesn't even drop a legendary item.
---
I'll have to see if he spawns there for me, thanks
---
The funniest thing about this is you think you figured out how it works. LOL!
---
Thank you for the replies, im just "afraid" to find out, and loose my 700 hours of play, because i was "abusing" a glitch for my own personal gain, which makes it an exploit.
---
What’s your build 
---
but you dont know for 100%sure thats why the ban is fucked up.
---
inocent until PROVEN guilty
---
My point is proven, just by the way you react tells everyone here your age. You might possibly be 40 , but mentally you're a twelve year old girl with a chip on her shoulder. Apparently someone including Bethesda has wronged you. Get used to it little girl, you're going to be wronged a lot in life. Better learn to start finding cronstructive ways to deal with the disappointment, instead of thrashing about on Reddit. . 
---
They disappear pretty quickly.  You can try and see for yourself.  Drop something, fast travel elsewhere, wait 10 minutes or so or even less, FT back.
---
PC or console. PC version of regular edition is around 10$, those few extra skins not worth 30$.  
---
Personally, I understand why there's a coat. However, I don't think that you should have to spend currency. You're not paying for a post-apocalyptic Uber, after all. I think that the cost should be in food and water. That's what would be expended traveling the wastes, so that seems to make more sense than caps.
---
That sucks, I should start investing in the plans to craft them.
---
I've done that with newcomers as well... But there was a level 2 I wanted to help, he answered me "Sorry Man, not interested and I don't trust you"... He ran away and lost couple low level legendary items I wanted to give him... Anyways... That's the Appalachia 😁
---
Okay, cool. I'll walk around those places to see if I find him, thanks
---
This hasn't happened to me since the last patch. But if this is happening to you just quit to menu and re join another server.
---
Does this work because Bethesda mistakenly thinks that you banned your friend, or did you actually ban this person at some point by mistake or on purpose?  Seems like such a strange fix but I am happy to try.
---
I've seen this very intermittently too; usually I walk into Whitespring golf club and hear 20 ghouls dying at once
---
Life ain’t fair and the world is mean. 
---
And yet you're still here for some reason.
---
Hey look another new account. Here to get enough karma to start manipulating the votes some more?
---
Its not whitesprings. Its the greenbrier. 
---
The dupers also smirk at those grinding for the resources and gear they want.
---
Possibly. Crashing can do bad stuff. Progress is saved every 10 minutes or when you checkpoint in  a quest, so that's really a problem that is hard to get around.
---
I think the learning experience should be extrapolated far beyond the gaming world.  This lesson is true of all media outlets.  Every information source has an agenda, regardless of whether they are providing news on video games, politics, sports (literally everything and anything).
---
People need to stop believing everything they hear.  Stop giving these media outlets power to control your thoughts.  Use your brain and come to your own conclusions.  The world would be a much better place.
---
Hmmmmmm, interesting. I've seen some others saying it's working less and some say they haven't noticed a difference. I have seen a lot less on ammo and drugs personally as has my husband but according to comments it's not happening to everyone. Strange....
---
Or a delivery costumed pipboy offering a package.
---
oh look OP ended up editing his post to say "hey guys guess what the two shot adds 25%, just like the devs specifically told us."
---
so this is a wall of text to say the obvious.... 
---
Swiggity swooty, scorchbeast be comin' for your booty.
---
notice how the person with objective reasonable statement is downvoted just like he said would happen.  ur asking in the wrong place if u are looking or objectivity 
---
How do you make an indestructible base?
---
Shh, the Internet Hate Machine will hear you.
---
Can't get banned if you don't cheat and haven't played in weeks. *Taps head.apng*
---
They dont stay in bags but will in an overseers cache.
---
I don't agree with you.
---
and some of us dont want to have our immersion broken by you having more time. It's a matter of opinion.
---
People keep saying that it is possible to craft as much as this player did technically but that it would have been difficult. I keep thinking that when I started, had only a few hours into the game that crafting in any sort of large quantity just isn't possible. The perks are not available and collecting the required components at low levels just isn't going to happen. Being able to craft mass amounts of ammunition isn't going to happen until much later in the game, after many hours of play time and that isn't something I'm seeing calculated in when people are saying it is possible that the player crafted it. 
---
Exactly. Everyone has been saying this repeatedly over and over and over again, but you have the keyboard warriors coming in to argue over nothing. 
---
You should be VERY proud of this.
---
I think the problem with TSE was it required no specific build effort. You could just buy a TSE from somewhere for caps or $$ and start doing a lot of damage immediately.
---
Wow! And I'm happy to get the stuff I got and it isn't close to legendary stuff! I think it's really cool that you do that.
---
It's true though.  You know there's a fundamental flaw with the enemy layout when no one wants to hang around the Cranberry Bog (or even the Mire, for that matter) for any longer than it takes to visit the vendors.  One can say, yes, Whitesprings objectively rewards too much XP.  But it is an equally valid argument to say that the Bog and Mire are dull and empty in terms of enemies when they really should be teaming with hostile encounters.
---
That does not apply to TOS, never has.  
---
Tinkers workbench lets you raft ammo. It takes a while to get this plan in the game, although it is rather common. But it's good to have the plan early on. Make sure you read the plan from your PipBoy.
---
Build a camp by the vault entrance on the path. Put a table there, and a sign that says "Free Stuff" with an arrow pointing to a non-CAMP container that sits there. IIRC there is a suitcase on the trail.
---
I second this, Destiny (ack it burns us) has several apps that alliw item swapping from bank to character and back
---
Its first video of Jim fucking Sterling son that i had to dislike. Out of all people i did not expect him to fuck up so badly...
---
My opinion is that bethesda should fix the SBQ. Give it an unchangeable amount of HP. So if lower level players enter, she doesn't become a bullet sponge.  Idk how the system works though. Maybe its the more players that are in the area the  more HP she gets? I did the event twice. The first time was a succes we were only with 4, all between lvl 80 and 100. And managed to kill it in like 15 min. The second time we were with 8 or more, high and low level players, i got  through like 3000 rounds  of 5mm ammo and she stopped taking damage after some time. So it was a waste of time, a nuclear keycard. And hours of scavenging for lead. I think lower level should be allowed in the area and they should only get loot if they  actually participate with the event and do a certain amount of damage to her.  
---
Now i dont bother launching a nuke. It takes alot of ammo to go through the bunker and i dont feel like wasting extra ammo on a SBQ that eats ammo like skittles. And keeps flying around yeeeaaaaarging at me... So until this is fixed i wont participate. Also give it unique loot, like unique legendaries, unique mods or plans that u can't find anywhere else. 
---
What proof was there even that this guy actually played for 900 hours since launch? I went over that thread and all we have is his word. No proof is provided. I think it is important since that whole 900 hours keeps comming up.
---
He wrote that whole guide where he claimed to have played 900 hours after he was already told that he got banned and why.
---
You scary. 
---
LMAO I'm a peice of shit for thinking that people shouldn't be banned for playing the game?
---
Same thing, about an hr after the patch we got in to a shit storm of a fight, 2 of 3 weapons broke - having to be "that guy" hiding and healing up.  Even the mole miners showed up - kinda strange....
---
Countdown timed still had 10 min on it and majority of team gave up and left.  Could not get any movement on her health bar after first re-heal
---
If you just stand there yeah they can kill you. However you could have 1 used stems. They heal more then they can hurt you. 2 blocked them and leave. Then they can keep attacking you. Or 3 server hop. My point still stands people cant one shot pacifist players unless the players have flagged themselves somehow for pvp. You have to literally let them kill you to be killed.
---
Love fallout 76 and playing with other people. Send me an invite. GT: strembrulie . On most nights
---
Evidently! If they ain’t dropping dead they’re running away, it’s getting kinda lonely haha.
---
Will this sub ever stop talking about that guy?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs9trxxMEhs
---
Just one example of a solo SBQ kill
---
Last time i saw a lowbe coming out of the vault i went over and 3 other high levels showed up and we all posed and got shit ready for them... after like 10 minutes we check the map and they are gone. never came out....
---
When I did it on PC I got bored, for a good reason. The game only sent one Gutsy, I was expecting more,  and I waited around until the end but that was it... Maybe the game is sending a different number of robots to different players? Have you tried it after patch 6 to see if anything has changed?
---
Do you have defensive Perks like Born Survivor and Serendipity? Those two Perks have saved me countless times.
---
If the 900 hours guy is innocent; then Bethesda deserves the criticism.
---
If the 900 hours guy is a cheater; then Bethesda created the condition where he could cheat, and deserves the criticism.
---
There is no set of facts surrounding this case where Bethesda does not deserve every bit of the criticism that's coming their way.
---
FeelsBadMan, if you were banned you would have been forced to play a different game. Sorry bro
---
huh? think u may have misspelled a word and autocorrect took over or something, cuz ur statement doesnt make sense in its current form.
---
I usually do, unfortunately it’s not helping! Saves me some ammo at least.
---
Some dwellers were taught not to talk to strangers, I suppose. I enjoy helping new wastelanders, but since most either run away or otherwise don't seem interested, I just put stuff in the flatwoods (usually) overseer's stash. 
---
Uh, level 1 through 4 players, I can't really do anything to you, even if I wanted (other than bestow some goodies upon you), so I don't get the whole "I don't trust you" thing from a level 2 or 3 player. We're not all griefing tools....
---
Well. 
---
Caligula declared war on the god Neptune and ordered the Roman army to stab the ocean with their swords, so there is precedent.
---
The difference with these builds, is that theyre high risk builds. They have a whole character set to this. Whereas the tse one shot epidemic was more of you could literally run anything you want with no risk or drawback. 
---
Only the -12hp for me after relogging. Ps4 here
---
Screw PA, give me some normal armor love!
---
Nice.
---
Jokes aside, I've had it too, it's usually because of laggy servers. There's discrepancy between the server and your client side data, so enemies are spawned, but server then tells them to be elsewhere, so they die. Also causes The Flash enemies sometimes.
---
Have fun in Appalachia, friend!
---
Monsterbirdnation, I think? 
---
For me it’s more when I get near them, ranged it happens less but still far too frequent for it to keep being funny :(
---
I have a heavy weapons build and a, shotgunner build.  The heavy weapons build matches best with PA.  Having perks like heavy gunner, master heavy gunner, expert heavy gunner, bear arms and the stabilized perk, 
---
That's some pig!
---
I can check again , best way to remove unyielding armor&amp; radicool right? And take rads
---
Exploit the building system, try campfires.
---
Visit r/fo76FilthyCasuals for a refreshing change.
---
New issue of PC gamer. 
---
Fo76 players now ban themselves.  With BES ever fix their game
---
So if you were at white springs and saw a bag in the crafting area containing hundreds of thousands of powerful ammunition you wouldn't be tempted to take it? Because you would know that taking it means you might get banned right?
---
And you don't see the problem with that? Dark Souls 3 also had a massive banwave shortly after release. Plenty of people proclaimed their innocence, and plenty of people like you laughed them down and labeled them cheaters. Within a month the truth became clear: There were people invading and co-op'ing who were intentionally dropping items that were getting people banned and corrupting save files. But fuck all those banned players for not knowing better right? Fuck anyone who thinks that it's ok, in a videogame, to accept some random windfall.
---
&gt; What proof was there even that this guy actually played for 900 hours since launch? 
---
What proof is there that he cheated?
---
ive only been casually playing for like a month or so (lvl50) and tbh the pvp mechanics have seemed broken/ineffective since i started. I mentioned in a different post because of how muddy the mechanics are im pacifist 24/7 and dont bother with PVP until a more fluid, effective system is in place (gunplay is clunky anyway so eh) So forgive me for sounding like a bit of a lemon, but i literally stood there to see what would happen. He killed my 5c wanted friend, but then turned to me and just started shooting. I server hopped about 1cm from death lol.
---
Yes I'm sure a clan of people conspired just to make sure this one guy had ammo.
---
Fine let's assume he made 10 stable per nuke zone which is by far the fastest farm way  if he only crafted 100k it would take around 3330 plants need harvesting which even the best nuke zones for violet have around 10 so it'd be what assuming they respawn instantly on CD and don't bug so 330 harvest runs which let's assume take 10 minutes with a roughly 30 min cd on the plants that would be 160 hours of playtime due to plant spawn rates even with green thumb and that's not even accounting for bugs where plants dont allways become nuke plants. And that's assuming he had all the glowing blood hardend mass and glowing mass prepped and ready. As the best violet flux point spawns supermutants and very very few.
---
Or let's assume he bought it it would take about 4x the cap cap to buy all the needed flux at current market value.
---
Also worth mentioning he had 2 chars a mule and a main his main used the ammo and bandolier he claims to have dropped it due to weight but with bandolier even 100k ammo is only 10 pounds of 5mil
---
Far too much of his story dosent add up.
---
Get creative with mines and draw them into your line of fire. Energy weapons like the Gatling laser have a mod that adds fire damage. It’s great for suppressing an area you think there’s a stealth player. 
---
Explosive shotguns work for peppering an area or room.
---
Maybe invest in some stealth armor for your PA. It’s fun!
---
Haha, Gary!
---
Man you fanboys are fascinating. Seriously thinking about doing a physiological study on how people wrap their identities around corporations or a brand like fallout, regardless of how awful it is and how clearly the company is taking advantage of them. Its like a religion.......so weird but please please please keep it up, I get so many laughs out of these kinds of posts.  
---
if u just let something kill you without responding in any way, thats on you
---
* Glass/Greenhouse Walls and Roofing. I wanted to make my room have a Skylight without annoying rain.

* "Bulletin Boards" for quests/requests you'd like to make that can be fulfilled by other players like gathering some Bulk Junk that can reward whatever you want, but it has to be in your inventory.
---
What's worse is eBay lets this shit happen 
---
If you own a workshop, you have to understand that comes with pvp in any regards whether it be griefers or someone who wants the workshop more than you. This is the wasteland. Welcome to the thunderdome.
---
Why is everything cheaper on PS/ Xbox? Did they dupe that much over there?
---
I've done that before in flatwoods, and everything I put in the stash remained there for about a half hour. I believe the stuff should be there, assuming no one took it or some sort of glitch (like that would happen in this game, right?)
---
What weapons do you use?  I was under the impression that heavy weapons are pretty useless.  
---
It seems it’s a trade off, I crash/get booted less but at the expense of all enemies dying haha.  Hopefully it’ll get better then, especially with the future more frequent maintenance to come.
---
your a fool making stuff up but ignore the 1000 facts against Bethesda. Grow up 
---
It is highly unlikely for that to have happened and in fact not what the guy himself admitted of doing,  so stop finding excuses of a cheater.
---
That’s what I’m afraid of, I’m also PS4
---
I wish I could post the screen shot. 
---
You keep your card. You simply share the effect with your team for the duration you're teamed up. 
---
One level of a card for each 3 points of charisma you have. 
---
Have you ever stopped to consider that maybe 76 isn't a perfect game, and those of us who are disappointed with its glaring flaws are allowed to voice our complaints?
---
No obviously not, anyone who criticises Fallout 76 must be a toxic hater.
---
After the balance pass drastically reduced the TSE stuff I haven't seen her killed.  Last few times on ps4 SBQ didn't even hit 75% HP.
---
Post to Imgur and put it here 
---
The normal Mothman goes away.  The higher level variants, like the Vengeful Mothman, don't.
---
See above 
---
Criticism and intentionally spread false news and hatred are not the same thing.
---
Will look into this, thanks for your report!
---
Well... A level 15 Perfect Storm is not that useful when you're level 125 😅😅😅
---
So, is better to help others 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
cool, thanks 
---
Maybe in a court of law but not when you are subject to the T&amp;C of a game. They did not even have to provide you with any evidence. 
---
It actually is in FO4, and far easier than FO76.
---
Junkie is near impossible to maintain in 76, due to addictions don't seem to last long enough to collect all the addictions needed to max out the weapon.  In FO4 you could get a pretty consistent 165% increase to damage.
---
Hey look a dodge. Guess that means I was more on the money than you’d like to admit. How do you explain your 100% fake ideas of how stuff in the game works? You lying with purpose or out of ignorance so deep you fooled even yourself? I’m just curious how deluded you are, it’s part of my research.
---
I'd like to see the tablet pipboy from Fo4 go live on this. Being able to do things there while in combat easier was great.
---
I would have killed them and taken that sweet junk they were building with!
---
Welcome to the jungle! 🤣👍🏻
---
Probably cause this is the 80th post today complaining about YouTubers talking shit about a game
---
I hid in the eleavater the whole time only to pop out to kill the robots if they got near the computer
---
I don’t understand the Gauss rifle.  Seems really slow.  What’s the advantage?
---
People seem to ignore this, thank you. I can understand meeting a deadline, but don't expect me to be pleased by you selling me an undercooked product. 
---
Yeah, they love to argue, but not have a rational debate. I hear ya on that. 
---
I made the post yesterday and it was deleted. 
---
This will be on the cover of National Enquirer next week with “secret Russian a-bomb test creates dragon” as the title. 
---
I agree, but ... it's a really fine line.  They toed up to the line and stuck a toe across it.  I seriously hope they don't try more like that.
---
*this week then*. If they shouldn't care whether or not you like the game why do you care whether they do? 
---
Also, if you ever watch any of the youtube personalities, they have level 10 characters max. I never see higher end videos, and if they do it's someone elses and they tell you hey this ain't me. Those dudes dont even play, they stir the pot for ad clicks. What a meaningless life to cause more hate for nickles at a time :)
---
They can spawn outside the north gate at white springs 
---
The first time I went to the water park, I was around level 20.  I saw five behemoths casually walking out of the front gate.  I immediately walked away.  I then assumed that this area was an end-game area and it took me a long time to go back.... was disappointed when I finally did.
---
The intent is greatly reduced damage. You could have out healed it with a bottle of water.
---
You can share a single card when in a Team.  The number of Stars on the Card must be less than or equal to your Charisma divided by 3.
---
Hence CHR-3 can share a 1 star card.  CHR-9 can share a 3 star card.
---
You cannot share 3 different single star cards with Charisma 9.
---
The game will remember what card you last shared (unless you swap it out, or even out and back in) between joining teams.
---
Team members receive the full benefit of what you shared.  You cannot stack the same cards for increased benefit though.  So if YOU have 1 star Pack Rat, and someone shares 2 star Pack Rat with you, then you will only get the greater benefit of 2-star.  They do not Add together to 3 star.  
---
To share cards (on PC) select the card you wish to share (it must be Actively slotted) and push T.
---
Well guess what genius, when you WERE a fan, had countless hours of fun with Bethesda games, and then they clearly turn on you. If you don't know about 1000 legitimate things Bethesda has done recently I dont know what to tell you. I will not support trash, I will not support a company that clearly has become a greedy corporation that cares nothings for their fans. 
---
This is what makes no sense, how you fanboys cant move on and continue to lie and try to put up smoke screens for a shady company. You are not helping change anyones minds, the hate will continue UNTIL Bethesda knocks off the crap. You can cry, whine, and whatever else it is you are doing against those of us who are upset about fallout 76. Oh, and because of you fanboys, I am now not buying Starfield or Elder Scrolls, and to even things out, I am going to dedicate all my time to spreading negative PR about Bethesda. Its a war now lol, I honestly cant stand you fanboys that much because YOU are causeing this game to bad. YOU are the reason the game wont get fixed because as long as Bethesda has mindless people like you supporting anything they do, this will persist. 
---
Because they are spreading fake news ns making money off it and some of us beloeve that is harmful to the game and needs to be stopped. Same reason people care about any crime, actually. 
---
Your problem is that you don't understand the intended function of the game mechanics. Pacifist mode doesn't protect you from taking PvP damage, it only prevents you from initiating PvP by shooting someone.
---
That doesnt get clicks/views/likes if you add that part since your just reporting that a hacker/exploiter got banned. 
---
I had a fight where mostly everybody was above level 100 but they were just standing around or whacking basic scorched, even when the queen landed several times. I CTD'd 5 minutes before the end but she had still 30% health remaining at that point. It looked like some simply gave up after 15 minutes but hung around in case the determined few would kill her eventually. My build can solo the queen with 2k standard 5mm rounds in 15 minutes, including dispatching the mobs during the fight.
---
My experience is that she is doable with 1-6 people reasonably well, 7-9 likely and 10+ almost never. Looks like her health, not DR, scales linearly with the number of players participating, which means if you are one of the few damage dealers, you'd end up spending 2-4 times more ammo/swings.
---
I'd say she should not scale at all. Balance it for the recommended 8 people. The more show up, the fight should be easier as expected. The less show up, you'd have tougher time, but could be compensated with more loot.
---
I just chalk it up to being so damned intimidating... 😎
---
I hit 97 last night, and have never farmed anything for XP, let alone Whitesprings. There are several events I enjoy doing, so I always hit them when they pop. I run at least one workshop at a time, so there are always defence events.
---
Why grind? It just seems like it would lead to burn-out.
---
I got it after being 100% sold on the hate train (i disliked F4 already) , only after asking granular questions and watching my friend play was i on the fence enough to shell out a measly £25 for it. Honestly, i recommend it. I never listen to mass opinion, and this time i did and was wrong imo.
---
This sub is so plagued of Stockholm Syndrome its amazing.
---
The entire gaming world around them sees the mismanagement, incompetence and abuse that Bethesda is guilty of; and as they all call it out, one after another, the White Knights at this sub keep insisting "No, the whole rest of the world is wrong."
---
It happens when you have two weapons of the same type, but with different prefixes (like Instigating Combat Knife and Vampire's Combat Knife).  The wheel will only accept one, unless you manually reassign it, and it becomes unassigned every time you log in.  Bethesda is aware of it, and they agree that the prefixes are the cause, but as of Patch 6, it hasn't been fixed.
---
Carebears! I like that designation. Did you just make that up or is it already a known title for the casual/explore/loot character? 
---
It fits. I like it. 
---
I took the Demolitions Expert perk. My shotgun went from 121 to 125. So it adds 4 DMG per perk I'm guessing. 
---
Nah, I do not suffer fools and liars, and dude is a straight up fool.  Why defend someone like that?
---
ah, the good ol' "nolifer" insult.
---
on a more related note, these used to go for 20$ but the number of people selling dupes is dwindling every day. 300$ is not unusual for a bis/best in slot.
---
hopefully now you people realize just how much a 0.000001% rng is worth.
---
Even if it WAS a court (and not a private company enforcing their broad powers under ToS) then you wouldn't need to be "100% sure".  Even in criminal cases the standard is "beyond a reasonable doubt" which is less than 100%.  In something as weak as this, the standard is "preponderance of evidence"... which means basically you have to be 51% sure the player cheated.
---
The question you have to ask yourself is, "Is it 'more likely than not' that the player obtained that level of ammunition through means that violated the ToS?"  If your answer is "yes" then the ban is legitimate.  If you honestly think "no" or "I'm still 50/50 until I see more evidence" then, you might see the ban as not fair.  I'm just saying that, at no point in our legal system, is '100% sure' required to prove guilt.
---
eBay should be removing these listings, because they are illegal. I suggest reporting them to eBay and let them take care of it. 
---
I suspect that if you get disconnected from a server it's usually because the server crashed.  If that's the case, there's not much point in implementing a reconnect option since you obviously can't reconnect to a crashed server.
---
Calm yourself browski. First of all it isn't fake news, nobody can prove the guy is a cheater everyone just says he is. So what if they make money of it (Sterling doesn't cause his videos aren't monetized)? It doesn't effect you. The game has done more harm in the marketing department to itself than any 2 bit youtuber so just chill and enjoy the game
---
I hid on top of the sensor array. The SB distracted the bots and I sneak attacked them as quickly as possible... worked well
---
It's more likely that the new team, Bethesda Austin branch, who did the majority of the work on 76 were unprepared, underfunded, utterly mismanaged, or all of the above. It feels more like the Austin branch struggled and Bethesda HQ didn't give a shit.
---
reddit loves it's quotes so: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity".
---
I can see your point there.  Personally, I like that Scorched Earth brings in players from all over the map to accomplish a single goal.  But that's just me and if it's not my nuke in the first place it really wouldn't be my business.  haha
---
I’ve read a lot about it and it seems weird to me that people can be so sure one way or the other. I also think it’s hilarious that there are so many threads trying to mathematically prove that it was impossible and they all have wildly different numbers.
---
It feels like it's happening less for me as well. And pharma farma yesterday too. I make the same aid run every game session so I have a good idea of how often it triggers and it was barely triggering at all. 
---
I have a random spawn site by my camp. I had a glowing feral wolf regenerate on me. I had I to keep hitting it with my deathclaw gauntlet. Finally killed it. I wasn't happy.
---
I found an area that was glowing purple yesterday. I thought it was the flatwoods monster so I can over to it. Areas of the ground were purple and had lettering that appeared to be computer code..... something about hold Ctrl+Alt.
---
Good luck in your "war". I bet history will remember you as "the guy who single handedly took down Bethesda".
---
Also, YouTubers are not spreading this hatred because of Bethesda's continual fuck ups. Yongyea literally dug out a three week old event, added false news to it, and started the drama. They do not do this beca5theu are upset about Bethesda. They do it because it makes them money. And now that the controversies have been dying down, they are running out of views, so they need to create more drama to get views.
---
OH MY GOD you guys did you hear they give away a nylon bag when they promised a canvas bag!!1
---
Sshhhhh. That's the easiest way to get on the roof and hide when you need to escape a griefer or take a bathroom break. Don't make them fix it.
---
I looked at the math and it creates an ideal situation AND overlooks several limitations and aspects of the situation.  
---
Also it doesn't imply "well" under 30 days at all.
---
I know that's how BGS stated it works, but he was notably doing more than 5 dmg per hit. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that slap damage can be bugged in some way.
---
 Not defending the idea of one shot slap kills, they're still bs, but I observed slap damage being over the stated 5hp.
---
Aww, muffin, did I hurt your feelings?
---
Suck it up princess.
---
&gt; Your problem is that you don't understand the intended function of the game mechanics.
---
This is the point im making, its not straight forward enough. A passive mode should be passive both ways.  
---
you should quit the game whenever a server starts acting up. otherwise you risk stuff like that.
---
I know, im saying the mechanics are unclear to someone somewhat casual.
---
"Hey it's me your old friend wooden cube base"
---
You can, just redact identifying info and post it in the comments.
---
Thanks I hope to see you out there!
---
It doesn't have to seem innocent to your standard.  Bethesda can make ammo not drop-able, not trade-able, can limit the amount of ammo a character.  They made it so players can drop and pickup ammo, and buy it from other players.  Its reasonable some people are going to choose to stockpile it.  
---
Right. Whatever happened to this game was amplifued 100000 times by these two bit YouTubers. They can't create content so they just create hatred to generate views.
---
Those are some expensive ears
---
Thanks you too, hope to see you out there!
---
Is there an inside to this or is it all one solid construction?
---
I'm with you there, fellow traveler. I actually play his FO76 album on Spotify on my commute to work haha
---
Damn, my set of armor is worth $300? I grinded and paid about 5k caps to get my set lol
---
If you're on PC then maybe we will.
---
That's very well possible, and I know they've been working on making servers more stable. But I'm not sure that's the case all of the time. Idk if/how it would be possible to reinstate a server that's crashed either
---
I for one am really enjoying FO76, 500+ hours feels like money well spent. sure there are some annoyances, but after playing FO1, FO2, FO3, FONV, &amp; FO4, I was expecting to encounter issues, and when I lose something, well... it's just a game, and I can find another one.
---
I consider myself an intelligent person, and prefer to form my own opinions about things, I don't watch the YouTube Money grabbing, Game Hater Videos, and take everything I read on Reddit with a grain of Salt &amp; a cup of understanding.
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but most of the people slamming the game seem to be the ones that feel "Entitled" to everything in life.
---
If you don't like the game, you are certainly entitled to stop playing it, and if you do like the game, I will see you in the Wasteland fellow Vault Dweller :-) 
---
There were some post about that during the week it was live. 
---
Granted it was nothing big,  but it was a small sample of p2w.  If we don’t make a big deal about this now, BES will just keep boosting the p2w aspects IMO. 
---
Idk. I’ve seen long, detailed threads “proving” it’s impossible and some “proving” it’s possible. They all just pull numbers out of their ass and act like it’s verified fact. I’m skeptical of anyone saying definitively that it’s possible or impossible unless they farm for hours to get real data.
---
That’s good to know for future reference but alas no such perk in my stack :)
---
Question for the developers: Will water be included in the new adversary mode? Because that's completely unfair and imbalanced if so.
---
Once you've progressed in the Brotherhood quest, check the terminals right outside the door of Fort Defiance.  I think it's the one closer to the door provides the plans for it.
---
"Rejoin Server" is something we're looking to add in a future update. 
---
I am the representative of the Kingdom of Gadlantis. 
---
I have already made lots of quests. Ive had about 100 players run at least 1 of my quests. Got about 3 hours of content if enough members are online...What is this in reference to?
---
I'm pretty sure my guild is the best quest content available in fo76 right now. Lol. Because we are NPCs... And we interract with players creating choice, moral dilemmas, drama, risk and reward. Something bethesda kind of... Skipped.
---
Bethesda just needs to release a roleplayers kit in the atom shop (COSTUMES) and custom notes/notebooks/something i can write on and leave in a CAMP as a clue or quest item. Something a player can read or pick up.  
---
I haven't died yet, do you drop everything or something? Also, I figure if you wanted to kill me, I'm sure you could without asking to give me things. lol
---
You can upgrade it to levels 35 and 45
---
Thank you very much for the response! Look forward to seeing that option 
---
Not true.
---
You have only about a 100 hp in the game, so a 5HP hit looks like a lot on the health bar. But the number is definitely 5. This has been checked by many people when the one shotting issue first came up. I myself have checked it.
---
Last time I fought the queen someone killed it in mid-air and the corpse landed on top of the sundew trees where no one could get to it. Then the game locked up while I was trying to jump up on the branches to reach it.
---
 Fuck yes I would have liked a chance to rejoin and find a way up to it.
---
Resources aren’t difficult to come by. Gear on the other hand is, network and make friends, anyone looking for concrete to make one of these bases can go to Monorail ——&gt; Abandoned bog town ——&gt; Harpers ferry ——&gt; Site Charlie.
---
These bases having nothing to do with gear though.
---
You wouldn’t be complaining if you weren’t a griefer though.
---
Well, I do remember seeing another post about how Bethesda doesn’t know how to differentiate from fake purchases to real purchases, so maybe that’s why they need all that time. After all if it’s justs a digital receipt you need these things could be faked. 
---
Thx!
---
I've got an Executioner's Gamma gun that says that this is a terrible investment.
---
We all did and came right back to the same thing finally  just stopped playing all together and called it quits!! I’m bummed  even though it wasn’t legendary my lever action was a trusty companion , this character I’m revisiting is from the the beta I’ve had that hardened lever action  since level 40 !! The only one I ever found in the the game!!!
---
You use only foundations stacked on campfires lol
---
Stuff you 'drop' (ends up in the little paper bag) decays pretty quickly, and may despawn when you log (not certain about that).  Stuff you put into containers stays around a long while, even after you log.
---
Most popular places have containers that lots of people use as default 'freebie' locations.  The blue suitcase/lunchbox in Watoga station.  The cash registers and trash cans near any vendor.  Trash cans along the hallway in the Whitespring vendor area, and the suitcases out front (outside the resort).
---
Whitespring and Watoga seem to be the most consistent places to find stuff, though I'm still crawling my way around to find some of the other stations.
---
Plot twist: I never destroy CAMPs. I do however see the double morality this community has when it comes to exploits.
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
Then it doesn’t ruin your gameplay.
---
An alternative quest path that goes more in lines with the Overseers mission to take control and protect the silos, rather than launching the nukes.  Maybe even deactivate the automated nuke factory(s).
---
Also a better quest line to encourage me to launch a nuke to begin with.  The existing lore just doesn't do it for me.
---
1) Oh look a random enclave terminal entry regarding weird plants... hey I know lets Nuke the area I live in!!!!
---
2) BoS quest line of Nuke Fissure Prime with a split in the faction on whether or not to do it.
---
The BoS quest line could be GREATLY improved by adding a quest outlined as:
---
1) Hey we found the Scorch Beast Queen and the source of the plague in Fissure Prime.
---
2) The mine is too deep to strike with a Nuke oh noes!!!11!
---
3) Infiltrate an automated Silo Factory and aquire a nuclear warhead, fight off automated defenders!
---
4) Carry nuclear ware head into Glassed Cavern / Fissure Prime.  Automatically encumbered! Encourage group play by having 1 person be the bomb carrier.
---
5) Place Nuke, triggers mass Scorch wave attacks that would go along with all the dead bodies in Glassed Cavern.
---
6) Must defeat wave before 15 minute Nuke Timer triggers.
---
Sounds like u have no idea.  Plenty of you tubers can record game footage and have a video out in 1-2 days if not in hours.  Dont know wtf ur talking about.  
---
if you quit and jump right back in chances are you'll end up in the same server. wait a minute before pressing play or restart the game.
---
we already are testers, by playing on the live servers and getting atoms for daily and weekly content    
---
Call me weird but I sort of like the glistening sweaty look on a hot babe.
---
I imagine if ET for Atari or Superman 64 came out in the internet times, these same white knights would be defending it lol.
---
Level 160, 300+ hours. I just found and killed my first one! (I have seen the enlightened or wise one from the quest) I just heard a noise and saw black smoke and then BAM! I was pretty excited because I had just thought "what if I go this whole event and still don't see mothman?"
---
Yep, literally the only two things that could have happened here. There might be a bug or something that happened in the particular instance, but slap damage one shotting is false.
---
a server browser would be nice.... a browser that shows how many ppl are in a server.
---
Are you really this self-centered?
---
Gamers rise up!
---
Fair enough, they could certainly do a better job of explaining how it works. This is probably the most misunderstood mechanic in the game.
---
Git gud.
---
I have 280 hp, the base is 250.
---
- human npcs
---
with a card like inspiration which ends up in my stack all the time when grouped is that one automatically applied or did someone manually share it with me and from then on it auto adds? Also does that card stack as an exception to the rule because someone told me it did who i was grouped with. 
---
You're wrong.
---
Go through the variables of the concrete floor and you’ll see your atomic shop floor
---
I was under the impression you had to build new pieces, not upgrade like the Order of Mysteries stuff. Not arguing, just seeking clarification.
---
I never thought about that, accumulating that much ammo and the amount of grinding that would take.  I doubt people would hand over ultracite ammo because it is so damn hard to make enough.   Also, when you make “enough” you don’t want to use it.  
---
Exactly. When I hear someone like that say they have been everywhere and seen everything, I just don’t believe it.
---
No you dont get any back.  I found a level 28 running around and gave mine to him. Needless to say I made a friend that day. 
---
Then why didn't they also remove the post calling Mr. 900 Hours a liar and making fun of him?
---
It should come with a cool down period of 10 or so minutes, maybe less. Literally problem solved. 
---
Taking a workshop puts you in PVP regardless and you can still be killed, it would literally solve so many problems. 
---
You sir deserve an upvote. I had no clue
---
most normal games don't ban you if you have too much ammo. 
---
Uh, yes it does. Here is literally a direct quote from Aten_ra (a well known and trusted member of this community)
---
&gt;With some rough / quick and dirty calculations, assuming WhiteSprings runs were included, and the Legendaries obtained were sold for either caps later turned into raw materials, or traded straight for raw materials, 300,000 Ultracite bullets would take about a weeks worth of work. 
---
So you are right it doesn't "imply" it could be done in a week, it straight up says it could be done in a week.
---
If you press collect enough times it should completely drain that location of water and you will be victorious over your new found foe!
---
Kidding! Thanks for the report. We'll investigate. 
---
&gt; This dude deleted a ton of posts
---
[citation needed]
---
The both of you are wrong. 
---
Thanks for the tips on where to look
---
need a chat function so bad...  
---
I'm a mute with no mic but with few emotes....
---
You can't upgrade it that way, no. 
---
I'm not sure what that user meant, but you have to build a completely new set if you want one at higher levels.
---
Walk around Watoga.  Bots spawn and instantly die constantly.
---
It seems so obvious after you point it out. Thanks! 
---
Lol no, dont do this to yourself. Game is a mess, not a single reviewer liked it and they are giving copies out like candies (game stores are giving copies for buying used stuff, bundles are getting extra copies too).
---
Wait until it goes f2p I would sugest. I know Bethesda said it wouldnt but we all know it will. It doesnt have enough players to keep it up.
---
Yeah, you're still a stupid piece of shit who makes non-factual judgement calls about people you don't know, because you think you have some special insight. I'm pissed at assholes like you who think you have a right to tell people how to live and what to do. You don't. You don't get to judge me, the OP, or anyone else by your own standards. I'm 47 years old, my life has been filled with multiple disappointments, I know how to deal with them. What I dislike is stupid fucks like you. You can't process that or get it through your skull that YOU are the problem here, so you want to try to shift the blame somewhere else because you can't possibly fathom that you are the asshole in this scenario. 
---
Hope this doesn't get buried, controls still lock up on PS4 if you open pipboy too quickly. (post update Feb 21 2019 11:07amEST)
---
I shot this down 
---
Wow, the one thing we sought for the most turned out to be our worst enemy. Top 10 anime betrayals. 
---
My ign is Tylus if you see me!
---
Or mobs that fly around forever...
---
To answer the question in that post? Yes you can, easiest way to find this out is make a new character and use wood, pick up 10 or 20 outside of the vault and then put it all into one of the suitcases close the suitcase and reopen it and take the wood out, your achievement for gathering 76 wood increases.
---
Players are welcome to engage in PvP all they want. 
---
I'm not sure if you understand the intent of this post. I'm saying that in a game in which players were told up front that they would have the ability to opt out of PvP, they should be able to opt out, whatever their reason. They are paying for the product too. 
---
Anyone who wants to engage in PvP has ample opportunities to do so ... with other players who like PvP. 
---
They are cowards if they are intentionally targeting players who aren't interested in PvP, aren't armed, armored, or configured for PvP and are minding their own business. 
---
I have seen plenty of cowards in real life and online. I'm pretty sure I understand what they are. 
---
Bladed melee works best for me. Or plasma grenades. But yes - I always feel really bad about hurting them. Silly, maybe, but there ya go.
---
Nerd rage is bugged aswell, it does not apply damage nor show the damage buff in pip boy effects when at low hp
---
IGN = Tylus if you happen to see me!
---
Thank god, I got so frustrated with that bug. I was worried it got brought back like the bobby pin weight bug.
---
When you die, you lose your junk. The other stuff shouldn't drop unless you drop it yourself.
---
1) make the alien blaster meaningful again, it should be a top tier gun at the risk of limited or extremely rare ammo
---
2) add more unique weapons
---
3) fix the god damn railway rifle so it benefits from perks
---
In a day or two when it stops getting YouTube clicks. On a side note I find it funny none of the YouTubers have started on the Adrenal Reaction stuff and instead jump on something that happened two weeks ago and isn't even relevant anymore. My guess is since they don't actually play this game and don't understand it's mechanics they can't grasp why the community is up in arms about a broken mutation. And it also shows they're not targeting people that play this game.
---
There's dozens of people in this thread still literally making up scenarios to try to defend the guy. This sub has serious mental issues.
---
He was just a cheater. It's not more complicated than that.
---
Gorge Junkyard is my go-to for black titanium. I take it at the beginning of the session and can usually get quite a bit. There's a junk pile there as well.
---
&gt;Try it out. When there is a 'Find x number of Y' type challenge, can you complete it by finding just one and picking it up and dropping it again and again? 
---
Yes, make a new character and collect some wood right outside of the vault and then take it and put it in a suitcase close the suitcase and then open it back up and collect the wood you put in, then go look at the "collect 76 wood" achievement, it will increase from that wood you picked up multiple times.
---
No problem
---
I thought the player claimed it was nowhere near that amount of ammo they had, but can't even log in to verify it. What the player did do was transfer the ammo back and forth between two characters. It is possible that a log tracked the ammo as being obtained, but since it was traded back, it may not log it as used, sold, or deleted? It may only be tracking obtaining the ammo and vastly misreporting the real quantity.
---
For sure! its not *that complicated*, just fussy, and beth doesnt really do tutorials. I think if i knew what would entail from the start i would have engaged in PVP properly by now as i do partake often.
---
The last few times I tried the shed had record numbers of stealth low levels hiding, it was in the blast zone too, they must have been grouped up sharing rad sponge. 
---
A lot of low level players act as if they think that having a high level means a player is a cheater, therefore they think it's no problem for ten people to hide while 4 fight. News flash , a lot of us are not cheaters. A few weeks ago I got an awesome zealots gatling gun with 50% chance to cripple a limb. It melts scorched beast. I saw many players complaining about sb on here so I decided to start killing them off in every server I played in . Xp gold mine, I shot up in level real fast, now at level 193 I got people thinking I can cheese the queen. Hell no, I wish , yesterday I fought her for 20 minutes and used all 5k rounds of my ammo and broke all three of my guns.
---
If you aren't damaging the queen , please stay away from that fight. Please
---
In my experience, there's nothing there until later on in the evening, I assume because a lot fewer people play during the day.  I'm east coast, so I get on early-ish, and there's rarely any activity or gifts anywhere (though I do try to fix that a little).  By the time I'm thinking about sleeping, things do start to pick up
---
What do you play on? I could help you out if you’re on Xbox 
---
Roleplayers kit. (Generic costumes and camp item bundle: Knights, pirates, raiders, detective, spy, circus stuff, greasers, king, queen, sports themes, just a bunch of shitty costumes on the cheap allowing for a wide array of roleplay for quest givers) id pay 30 bucks for a large kit that has some range. 
---
Terminal + diary/notes/printouts/journal (something i can write on and have players pick up and read!!!!)
---
The amount of ammo he had wasn't even feasible to get in 900 hours let alone just 30 days.
---
Yeah I think that's it. It involves stairs and the campfire
---
Someone shouldn't have to do those things though. 
---
It's hard to comprehend why you all find this bothersome. You would STILL be allowed to engage in PvP, just not with people who don't want to and aren't built for PvP. ... People who find you annoying. 
---
Whats most likely happening is people are showing up for the fight and her health is scaling up, then maybe some one dies and respawns in the fight and her health scales up again cause they are classified as a "new" player. 
---
&gt; I don't trust corporations. I however believe random anonymous people on the internet. Especially if they feed my confirmation bias. I'm a true skeptic like that.
---
Will do next time thanks for the advise .
---
Probably around 4-5pm depending on how many of my team get on
---
Except that isn't what happened in this ban wave. You are literally just making up stories to find a way to demonize the 900 hour guy because you can't fathom that someone could easily reach that amount of ammo in a 30 day span.
---
This subreddit has already done the math, and it was figured out with multiboxing like he was collecting the materials to make that much ammo would be trivial over a 30 day period, and could be done with just a week of grinding.
---
Lucky bugger, I've tried over a dozen times and only seen her killed twice when I was there.
---
Laughed at this, thank you.
---
My favorite is to drop a bag in front of the vault door when I see a newbie hit 2nd lvl in the vault, then crouch across on the railing in Chameleon. When they pop out, I start spamming my pip boy light at the bag. 
---
I've gotten several wtf reactions from new players.
---
Thats cool 
---
That's because unlike weapons, scrap is not ID'd.
---
Sure, friend!
---
/r/fo76/comments/aset43/ammo_crafting_math_re_is_it_possible_to_craft/egwlui5/
---
Someone did the math. It's possible within a week.
---
There's another post suggesting that she's scaling for 24 players every time now regardless of how many people actually show up. Giving her something like 1.2 million HP.
---
YNNEL!!!
---
wait, wrong sub....
---
&gt;highly unlikely
---
So it's possible. Forget that guy, he doesn't impact the possibility that unwitting players can be banned for someone elses cheating.
---
Did you try removing the stairs? It usually won't let you remove something that is used as "support" to something else. For example, can't remove a wall without first removing roof piece. Not saying there aren't ways around it, but that's how it's generally worked for me.
---
&gt; were you banned for duping too?
---
&gt; Nope, I was not banned for duping but my oldest mule did get suspended for reasons that according to the numbers on my spreadsheet make no sense
---
So... yes.
---
Exactly what sort of mentality leads to the thinking that having a spare $300 and being in a relationship are mutually exclusive?
---
You can say that but that's not how this subreddit behaves.
---
Please leave politics out of this. The discourse around this game is already toxic enough.
---
Thanks. I've honestly found very few griefers in-game. Most people seem willing to help lower levels in one way or another.
---
I enjoy helping. Just don't become a drain on those who help (and don't let others drain you when you help them either). Some aren't yet aware of just how much time and energy it takes to grind for a just about anything in this game, and begin requesting you fix/build/take all the damage for them. 
---
Pvp as a whole is a mess but people being able to completely opt out of it would be highly exploitable.  Imagine someone leveling someones base then having a friend take there bounty then just poping on pacifist mode so no one can try to retaliate.  
---
I cheated my butt off and didn't get banned!!!  Hooray for me.
---
Jk.  I don't even own the game :/
---
They banned him with an explanation and screenshots of why?
---
Nothing new. Word of Warcraft account with raid items have been sold for 10k. One person actually bought, but that account got banned, so the buyer lost 10k and also the items.
---
Sentinel Armor is stupid. It to be effecting you have to stand still. That is so stupid meta. Whats next? set that doesn't require you to aim? ...Well that is already basically in the game, when you build yourself into VATS.
---
Or just doesn't land, had one a couple days ago that landed twice amd second time it was for maybe 10 sec.  Only a couple of us melee had time to get to her and swing a couple times.
---
Noise
---
Clearly says 4-6 months.
---
I think they're saving five star legendary drops for future endgame content. 
---
Yes, the stairs were the first thing I tried once I got to this point. They are definitely not supporting anything else now since it's a floor and some random stair going to nothing. Lol. 
---
At time stamp 1:58 he specifies the exact amount of ultracite ammo he had.

---
Can we get a comment and some investigation on this? Seems like another hot fix would be appropriate to correct this and adrenal reaction.
---
You make baseless allegations about "the shilling that is going on online" and you want to educate people on it, then go do exactly that, make a well worded and information post where you provide sources and links to backup your claims. Right now you just sound like a disgruntled player that got banned for duping and refuses to admit that the blame lies with Bethesda and not the people to go against ToS.
---
To me it’s destroying a base for fun
---
I don't trust random people either, we all tend to be the heroes of our own stories so to speak.
---
A healthy dose of eskepticism is necessary in every scenario. 
---
Maybe that's because the game sucks?
---
Im a helicopter mechanic. I have no ideal what any of that means. LoL! 
---
What would be a good reson to destroy someones base in your opinion? 
---
Actually we don't know if he was banned for acquiring an obscene amount of Ultracite ammo. That's just what people have been saying because it's the only item that he may have had a sliver of an outside chance to obtain 100k in 30 days. 
---
Hey, thanks for answering!
---
I tried holstering, moving around a bit last night. It's what I use to cancel the reload :) Doesn't help with the gatling laser ammo bug, but still faster to holster and pull up again.
---
I don't have escape artist perk.
---
I do have the chameleon mutation however (don't use it, but it has no side effects so didn't bother trying to remove it and still keep the other mutations I like.
---
I'll try dying tonight and report back.
---
Thanks! 
---
At time stamp 1:58 he specifies the exact amount of ultracite ammo he had. Did you even watch the video you shared?
---
Budum tish
---
That comments literally shows it's impossible.
---
&gt; Multi-Accounting means double, or in my case TRIPLE the loot when farming one location continuously.
---
&gt; -When Farming WhiteSprings post nuke, properly done for 9 hours I personally using three accounts
---
This is cheating. You proved it's impossible. Now adjust your opinions.
---
Someone who isn't capable of actually enjoying anything so they try to at least get some small sense of satisfaction by hindering the enjoyment of others.

Friend? Forced you to server hop? Get yourself some new friends. 
---
A griefer is somebody who intentionally makes another player's life miserable.
---
Bethesda doesn't deserve you, go do another game a great service
---
Will investigate, thanks for tagging me!
---
When they destroying yours. I tend not up mess with people cause they’re unpredictable. 
---
That's what I said. I watched the video, and it just seemed like any other of the YouTubers just riding on fallout 76 hate. Jumping on the latest controversy, without any understanding of the context, while showing completely unrelated random stock gameplay.
---
This is proof we’re in a simulation. Or it could be something else. 
---
Goes both ways, you can cause level 20 spawns on the east side as well.  Just depends on level who is first in the cell for it to populate off 
---
Still broke. 
---
But if you get a new AR crafted after the latest patch6, ditch the old one, reapply new one and your good to go. But it still doesnt diaplay in effects. 
---
Also the bugged one is stacking with hunger/thirst instead of hp... So if your survival bars are low you get a dmg buff..
---
Can I ask you how to give power armor to someone? Can you "drop" it?(asking because it gets recalled and I have too many chassis right now) 
---
I had the issue where some enemies just wouldn't die.  It coincided with an issue I've seen logging back in after the latest patch, whatever weapon you have equipped may show the wrong ammo amount or it may say you don't have any ammo for it. I had to switch to a different weapon and back and it seemed to fix the issues.
---
That’s not the issue at hand. I’m pretty sure that he had more ammo than it was feeble to make in the time frame. Plus we all know that having lots of a particular item puts strain on the servers, although I admit it’s a tricky question to be sure because everyone and their grandma hordes ammo, although I think it’s pretty clear to Bethesda that he duped some or all of that ammunition. 
---
**Anyway** he has despite common misbelief **Not** been permanent banned, he has simply been suspended till what I expected is the big major patch coming in March. 
---
Hmmm. . . Not sure then. The one time I moved, it made me scrap/store in a certain order. But when I was done everything was gone and that lonely strip of highway outside of Pleasant Valley Station was back to being lonely again. Perhaps it's a new camp bug that they're not aware of yet.
---
My definition is that griefer is player who attacks me, I respawn, run away and he searches me again up just to kill me. He is like the player who doesn't let you stand up in fighting game or spawn kills you in Halo. People who decide to demolish my camp or spontaneously attack me while I am traveling, I don't label those to griefers.  
---
From me playing, 100000 ammo of anything is ridiculous. Absolutly crazy and not needed. But ultracite ammo? What in gods name makes you horde like that? There is no way he spent real life time doing that. There are some stupid things you can do, but collecting flowers from server hopping for days then crafting ammo for 10 hours was not something that happened. 
---
I forgot about that! Does it stack with the Well Rested bonus? 
---
Those would both be awesome, but until it happens, try this;
---
1st let me say, that I enjoy playing on a team with others, and would not launch a Nuke solo.
---
Just prior to launch, I pull up the social menu, and capture a screenshot, I have also begun doing this before entering a Blast Zone, that way if you are DC'd you have an entire list of people to rejoin on.
---
Or just a shotgun build. 
---
&gt; This is cheating.
---
Mules aren't against the TOS. Having multiple accounts isn't against the TOS.
---
&gt; That comments literally shows it's impossible.
---
The comment that explains how to do it "shows it's impossible"?
---
What... interesting ways your mind works.
---
someone spending 300$ on their hobby does not mean they need to get a woman or a life. it's just rude on your part.
---
I agree with this. Stay way from 'cheats' like the lock pick, things that help you hack terminals, or any that use reshade or other 'plug-ins'. I've used all the item highlighting mods and the inventory sorter since December, as well as the power armor HUD fix and then used the known plans one until Bethesda added it natively. I play 3-4 hours a day, every day and have never had an issue. Just be aware they may break patches. So I always play vanilla my first load-in after a patch and then re-enable one by one to make sure nothing is broken. Make sure you have a nexus mods account so you can track what mods you've downloaded and watch for updates.
---
Most of the mods are strictly client side and only effect what you see. Things like map replacements, higher-res or clean skins, etc. These have 0 effect on the server or anyone else's game, so they aren't likely to end up with a ban, IMHO.
---
Overall my strategy is to not be the tallest blade of grass. If you're doing mildly gray-area stuff and not creating/buying/selling duped items, you shouldn't have an issue. But if you're doing a ton of sketchy things in game and with mods, then you might get on their radar.
---
Your junk falls where you died and you can come and collect it if you want. You don't drop anything else.
---
Dont ever use the call for help emote, no one ever comes to help you and they will jsut take your stuff. this applies to high level players being looted by lowbies and being on my lowbie alt being looted by high levels when i die near them. 
---
Yes, when in your Pipboy you can hit the drop button on a Power Armor Frame and it will make it so anyone can get in it.  And it wont get recalled since you no longer own it
---
I play on XBOX and I'm a bit of a completionist so would like all the achievements. I've got 100% on 3, New Vegas, 4 and Shelter ⚙️😁
---
So, I'm asking because I don't have any idea, but how do I bring this to their attention.? Is there someone we can tag here or where do I go to put in a "ticket"? 
---
How about using a gun to melee? 
---
Thank you! 
---
I tried. Unfortunately, Im not that computer savvy. 
---
Sure does  :)  
---
Do you have the keycard?   And have you deciphered the 8 code pieces?
---
We can take that into account, however there is also the huge amount of ammo of a certain type being collected. I play the game and I go through a lot of ammo and it’s difficult to see how someone would be able to collect such a rare item in that quantity. There is always the chance that you will inadvertently catch someone who really was just playing in a unique manner, however the likelihood is very small.  With any large organization, you may make a few people unhappy with your decision but it likely is worth it to bring order back to the chaos of the game. 
---
I like Breach and Clear I've done that a number of times now, Monster Mash too. I've neglected Workshops if I'm honest, only claimed 2 or 3. So I'll start doing more of those as well 👍🏼
---
Should be around now, within one more hour or so. Follow them on Twitter to know quickly.
---
I wish you didn't say that, because I'm willing to complete a raid for these armor sets withbonuses rather than spend even more money-time on an aesthetic skin that I might forget about when the next cool one drops.  
---
Yes. He was upset at me. We helped take down a queen and he killed another player. So I went and cowarded at the flooded train yard because I can’t do pvp. I suck horribly at it so I avoid it at all times. He died a couple of times and I’m surprised the dude that killed him didn’t find me. My friend came to my little hiding spot and was fighting the other guy on top of the cart I was in. I just didn’t wanna risk losing all the junk I was carrying. I’m a junk hoarder lol
---
That's not muling thats MULTIBOXING.
---
I won't elaborate further because you know what it is you're just being deliberately obtuse.
---
Great! I'll see if I can find the recipe. I just read that it's sometimes available in the Whitesprings Shop. 
---
Huge nerf
---
PC, sorry I shoulda mentioned that!
---
Damn I get home around 7, been looking for a team to take down the queen with. Maybe next time. 
---
But they dont. It would be even harder to believe that they have specific info on how *every single player in the game has acquired each item ever*. They wouldnt have had to ban only off of item count if they had that ability. I'm *pretty sure* even they've said as much about their inventory tracking (which is why it has been such a pain in the ass for them to track duping). That email pretty much explains that. If they could track items (as well as you seem to think) then it would **not** have read "*acquired* hundreds of thousands of ammo/mats *over a 30 day period*".
---
 It wasnt them saying they have specific proof. The item count tripped their algorithm that is based solely off of the number of time a player picks up/receives an item. They didnt specifically track a few items. They've kept a terrible, static count of every.single.time someone in this game "acquires" something. Even the legendaries. If you put one in your stash and pick it back up...you get that message every time like you *just* picked it up for the first time lol. That's how bad their inventory system is.
---
How is it cheating? He bought the game 3 times to do this lol
---
I'm on PC btw, I should have mentioned that.
---
What bro? Did you say you’re innocent too bro? Me too bro!!
---
So what do I look for now??
---
I'm hear with you, \#feelsgoodman
---
Still the better weapons in the game 
---
Rise up lights!
---
Someone who purposely attempts to sabotage others with no reward except the enjoyment of making others unhappy. Or uses deceptive methods on people in weaker situations
---
Eg. Attacking someones base doesn't reward you any resources, infact it puts a bounty on you. But they sit back and laugh, because it's oh so fun for them to destroy something that someone worked hard on rather than work hard on something themselves. Much like the child that kids over sand castles because it makes him feel big and strong
---
Or
---
Attacking their base to provoke PvP when they have a team sneakily waiting to kill as soon as PvP is initiated. Much like the douchebags who think they are tough when they stand with a big group of friends, but infact have less spine than a jellyfish.
---
Jim sterling is an idiot whose journalism is shallower than his personality. 
---
I'm on PC. The funny thing is, I was supposed to get it on Xbox so I can play with my cousin, but I accidentally ordered the PC version. I still plan on getting the xbox version eventually when I can afford another game or if it goes on sale, so maybe I can PM you when I get it?
---
Playing on a PvP only server or in retaliation for trolling you unprovoked. That'd be about it.
---
&gt; That's not muling thats MULTIBOXING.
---
And that's also not against the TOS.
---
More ammo, and materials to repair your weapons.
---
No, this game sucks ass
---
Ditto, I never got the problem with silo.  Either enforcer to disarm bots for free suicide nukes or just grind them up with melee.  I end up with 1-2 weapons worn down under 100% and haven't had to repair my t60 in last 5ish silo's.
---
Oh okay very cool! If someone kills me or finds my body they can loot me though?
---
They're still good. You might want something with higher DPS then a shotgun though. TSE Handmade's are good, or you can shift over to bloodied/Unyeilding
---
If you think that it is normal to go to pieces over being banned from a game that you put 900 hours in to, then I think it is clear that people like you are the real problem in the world. Get up off your fat ass, and add to society. This wasn't about the OP being prevented from volunterring at the childrens hospital or soup kitchen, it was a whining post about how unfair life is regarding a game that will have minimal impact in his life or our civilization. Look at you, thrashing about how you are being judge. Well,  you are being judged  at how pathetic and miserable you are. Instead of moving on to new endeavors, you dwell on something so ridiculous  and so inconsequential, that it boggles most peoples minds that are over the age of 18.
---
Even if that was true it's not what the user ever claimed so it's totally irrelevant anyway. Just more idiots literally making imaginary shit up to defend a cheater. Because that's what people do on the internet.
---
Yes, the event was flashing on the map.
---
Ill keep it uninstalled then. I dont know what the fuck theyre even doing. Such a small patch after 4 weeks. 10 devs on this shit or what lol
---
Huuuuge nerf
---
My tse shot was 1100 now its 250 or something
---
My tse gaus was 1200ish now its 300 something.
---
One shots turned to about 3 shots.
---
So if someone artillery strikes the munitions factory when I have it and then tries to take it and I kill them then they retreat to there base that is obviously close by is it ok for me to level it to prevent future strikes or am I a greifer? 
---
Ha! I totally understand. I'm still only level 3, but when I get more established, I do plan on paying it forward.
---
Sooey, what do you see  
---
The greatest hog in history 
---
I was the only one in there.
---
Actually, I believe that's already built in that you can't enter pacifist mode for a certain period of time after engaging in combat. 
---
What I'm proposing gets rid of the bounties and instead gives people a disease though. 
---
Hopefully a nasty one that leaves a stench and causes the player's character to be covered in boils. 
---
Ty
---
Most normal games don't have an ammo economy as tight as this and don't have exploits that allow players to bypass that economy and destroy the player market
---
Controversies dying down? They just released a patch that broke evn more things. LAWL
---
You think that's iffy, look who took the Outer Worlds sub, yes, a few of the mods from here.
---
Yeah no problem. If u ever get it on Xbox pm me and I’ll build you a high level base and get you some gear 
---
Haven’t been able to find him since patch where did you manage this
---
I watched a youtube video about sentinel armour and someone said cavalier is better because you can move with the benefit.
---
To my understanding cavalier is meant to only work when sprinting (not walking &amp; running) and you can't shoot when sprinting. He said it was not the case. Is he wrong or is this a major bug that grants near invincibility to moving players?
---
SBQ fight for me last night was really, really bad. Had her hit Regen about 8 minutes in, then by the time we got her to 10 minutes left, back to the half health point. Then, the server went to shit. Stimpacks wouldn't use, nobody could heal, Queen didn't drop to under 40% health. Broke my .50 Cal after using about 3500 rounds, but I could still use it until I was out of ammo, which was about 1500 more rounds. 
---
It really doesn't help that level 25s who can't damage her come to the fight and do nothing but run directly in front of you when you're firing, either. 
---
6 patches. There's been 6 patches and numerous hot fixes. They've also indicated a buff for energy weapons is coming. But don't come back please, we don't want you back.
---
HA! That's awesome. How do you see people level up? I only see people when I'm literally within view of them, and I can't see them level up. I am very new in the game.
---
&gt;That pic is about as pro vax as you can possibly get, as is the guys twitter feed.
---
Stop loosing point. 
---
It also helps if you have some sense. Not that a branch of discussion with "internet personality",  "government experiment" shit could have much of it left.
---
I'm not talking about this twitter guy. I'm talking about that particular tweet with a cartoon picture. You claim it can't be seen pro and anti. You claim it's clear on it's stance. I gave some pretty clear and more extreme examples how you could try to promote good values and good practices, by giving violance an alternative to them. That's fucked up, period. I would think even by American standards that's little fucked up.
---
But how then do you explain how the other person, claiming the twitter guy is anti-vax, misinterpreted him? I never took any stance on the twitter guy or any of this other stuff. I only mentioned that he has less obvious tweets about vaccinations, which seems quite reasonable the other person here saw that cartoon pcture, instead of the other tweet which was very clear on his stance on vaccinations.
---
Then the next 3 followup posts just went more and more stupid and off the whole point. Shame, but that's quite usual. I will disable reply notifications, if you want me to see your  retarted shit, you have to PM me. And then you won't get any upvotes for it heh. 
---
That's not just personally to you HeyImFluffy, for anyone else who feels like replying. I'm sure anyone who got my point, got it several replies ago already.
---
Your body disappears, you leave a paper bag with all of your junk.  You get a misc quest to retrieve your loot but it someone does before you the game will tell you.
---
I found a level 12 hiding in the guest houses taking pot shots at ghouls last night. I went further down the road and got about a dozen high level ghouls trailing me and led them right to the level 12. I'm pretty sure they got hits in on 5 or 6 as i worked them down with my tesla rifle. 
---
Maybe things will balance out eventually lol 
---
Awesome! Sounds great. My cousin plays and is waiting for me to get the game haha
---
I think taken locations are different than bases you constructed, as one is ostensibly permanent and the other is not. Also, in my opinion you already won that engagement, so I probably would have left it alone. I definitely wouldn't consider it a 1-for-1 when it comes to a base and factory or whatever other location you take and defend temporary on it's own separate budget
---
Okay good to know. Where do you respawn?
---
&gt; Even if that was true it's not what the user ever claimed so it's totally irrelevant anyway.
---
[Ahem](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900_hours_played_my_favorite_farming_locations/egoz986/?context=3):
---
&gt; I have 2 accounts. When i want to move stuff i open a 2nd game. gotta drop settings to lowest.
---
So other than the part where **he literally described doing that** he never claimed he did that.
---
Would you like to make any more easily disprovable claims?
---
I know inspiration did stack not sure if it still does though.
---
Actually bud, if you use Assassin’s you don’t need both (because you are a player) but I did equip both to make sure I wasn’t crazy. Still kill myself with Serendipity equiped. No serendipity amd it does 0 damage. Weird.
---
I'll do one better: I didn't play. Thus, no cheating; thus no ban hammer. Boom. 
---
Heavy weapons are fantastic with the correct build.
---
Fatman would do 0 damage bud. Tested it myself.
---
Bitch please I got 500 hours and uninstalled when metro came out. Even I, a big af fallout fan, am disappointed with the patches. Theyre small and broke alot in the process. On my AR character enemies randomly heal up since the patch before the last one. The patch team is too small and super slow, you cant deny that man
---
I'd like to see some intrepid souls make "movies" set in the world and You-tube them
---
Neither is ammo.
---
I think it would be cool to either have a camp or a traveling brahmin. You could have an optional quest in the future to choose between the two and the option to go back and trade the brahmin or camp for that and maybe a few caps. Make it so you have to be within camp area distance from the brahmin or it starts to return to salesman and you have to pay an abandoned fee and maybe have whatever junk you stored on the brahmin disappear.
---
Yeah. But only your junk. Nothing else.
---
Odd, didn't get a marker when I was in there.  
---
Maybe I got there in the 5 second buffer between the event ending on the map and me walking into the building?
---
Having to repair everything cost me resources however and my goal was the elimination of the threat.  I get your point however 
---
It brings you to the world map usually and you can select a spot, just like fast traveling.  Sometimes the closest location is free, sometimes it costs a few caps.  Going to Vault 76 or your camp are free.  You can also respawn at a team mate.
---
There have been a few times I did not get a chance to select a spot and the game picked the closest for me as well.
---
Yeah, I remember trying this one about a week or two ago, didn't work for me either
---
A game having bugs is a controversy?
---
From my experience it uses a diffrent map to claim the reward. I belive its savage divide #3. 
---
I collect maps and when i had a big chunk of em i went forest-&gt;ash-&gt;toxic-&gt;savage-&gt;mire-&gt;bog.
---
I noticed that when i clicked on the mound it gave me loot. I checked to see how many maps i still had since i was cooking atm and afked while the loot scrolled through. I saw i had three went to check on the food came back still had 3. Dug and it let me check my inventory still had 3. Digged one more time and saw that another map was being consumed and not the one for that location.
---
Yes and yes i believe so although i couldn't figure the description out so i just got the codes off the decyption site online
---
Oh i used it, that's the fun fact, one syringe every minute and a half to be sure even
---
I certainly hope so lmao
---
Honestly I don't take the yards and factories for that reason. Not a very good ROI in my opinion. 
---
If you hover over their dot on the map, you can see what level they are. If I happen to see a lvl 1 inside the vault, I'll just scan the map until I see them at lvl 2.
---
Totally **not** stalking, lol.
---
Last time. Using a mule to transfer items is not the same as having multiple accounts open playing simultaneously to farm items.
---
Multiboxing is almost certainly against the terms of service.
---
It doesn't really matter what I seem like, the fact is that people are regularly commenting having never tried the game for themselves, and it's often shallow and dismissive. They're welcome to their opinion, but would you take the opinion of a car from someone who hasn't driven it as seriously as someone who has?  
---
No arguments from me regarding Bethesdas corporate decisions though. They've been playing the situation as if they're actively trying to bomb the company's reputation.
---
I haven't been playing lately, probably not banned due to not cheating. Can't and won't confirm until I get my next itch to play... just haven't felt the pull lately. It will come back though.
---
The math has already been done, and it turns out that YES you absolutely could get that much ultracite ammo crafting mats in a week of grinding using multiboxing like he did.
---
Here is the numbers if you would like it explained how easy it would be to reach those numbers: 
---
It’s bugged for me too, I had 3 maps for that site, managed to dig on first attempt and got some loot, then I tried again but no dig prompt so I checked my inventory and there was still 3 maps so no reason not to let me dig again, I’ve been back on another 2 separate occasions but my 3 maps won’t work on that mound anymore, I wondered if it was because the first time the game didn’t deduct a map from my inventory but gave me the treasure. 
---
Here is some [video proof](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/zimrino/video/69816006) from Xbox, this many players and levels and her health barely moves.

It is not Bethesda's responsibility to make sure user made mods work so.....
---
A quest to make your own meteorite sword
---
First you gotta go to the crashed space ship, fight a giant hoarder of super mutants.  Then a large mutant would appear like triple  the size of others mutated by something. Once he is defeated he doesnt die but instead becomes a friendly.he then proceeds to talk about the sky has fallen and he has a strange rock. He talks about his travels how he found strange metals (idk what kind but special). He ponders if you can combine them. You then go on a long adventure across the map and you find a cavern. It is guarded and you have to pass either a speech check, or perception check. You then go inside the dungeon which turns out to be a large maze to find this metal. It is however guarded by a 3 large creatures. Deathclaw, behemoth, and one other large creature. A super mutant is there too and it controls these creatures. You defeat all and father the ingredients.  You return to the crashed  spaceship and speak to the mutant who us in awe you accomplished the dreadful task without  dieting.  You get 1000 exp and 100caps. You go to craft your new melee weapon and it asked you to choose which  legendary effect you would like. 
---
The end
---
You don't. They just nerfed Adrenal/Bloodied builds too. :)
---
GARY GARY GARY
---
4 months after release? Introducing new bugs witj every patch still? Selling an early access game at best for 60-200 dollara aadvertising it as live service and then not adding any content for 4 months but nerfing aspects of progression, damage and loot thus increasing the time players would spend with the game? All the while the atom shop is working perfectly and updated weekly? I guess your standards are different but I would call that a pretty big controversy. 
---
So... No.
---
&gt; Last time. Using a mule to transfer items is not the same as having multiple accounts open playing simultaneously to farm items
---
And neither is against the TOS. End of argument. The rest of what you've written is both irrelevant and wrong.
---
It's such a shame.  I had so much fun in this game, but every patch just drove more and more people away.  I really can't fathom how a development team just keeps breaking more things that they fix each patch...
---
You could scale awards based on level? 
---
I didn’t go to my first SBQ event until I was around lvl 70.  Having the right weapons and armor and perks makes all the difference.  Now at lvl 114 I’m in a different situation.   
---
A shallow opinion of a shallow game.
---
Yes. Yes, I would honestly.
---
High power per shot?
---
I use it as a primary weapon until close quarters, or I engage with my sniper rifle if I've got the advantage. 
---
It's slow, but it packs a punch, and ammo is easy to make. 
---
God I would love a two-shot Gauss. 
---
Wonder if they are the same person/player who proclaimed himself the endgame boss content...
---
Why do you think that they broke it on purpose?  Addons break all the time after an update, that's been a thing for many years.
---
Talk to the person who made the addon, I bet they're working on fixing it.
---
Fuck it I’m stressed rn I’m gettin on gta
---
Killed 8?!?! Saw my first and only one ever last night. Had just logged in and was gathering some wood to cook up some gourd soup for the night. Only reason I noticed him was because the music changed so I looked around to see what was getting ready to attack. It was near dusk and all I saw was a pair of glowing red eyes in front of me in some shadows. VATS locked on, I shot a few times then he took off straight up and vanished.
---
This could get me playing again. I like taking workshops, it's fun! It's really the only thing that feels worth while. I don't like being dropped from a server and losing it.
---
Hm I know in world of warcraft they could track every action back for 1-3 months and the player count was at the time much much higher than fo76. But yeah maybe I am comparing apples to pears ... seems fallout is not ready for the MMORPG table.

Uh, swapping ammo from your main character to an alt character isn't cheating. Not to mention if you read everything going on you'd see that he never had that much ammo, the problem is BSG is counting his ammo he muled over multiple times against him.
---
Not to mention that the amount of ammo he had is actually craftable in a weeks worth of grinding while multiboxing. Here is a thread where Aten_ra a well known and trusted member of this community goes through the numbers and shows how easy it would be to get the materials needed to craft all that ammo:
---
Those who gang up on someone, and exploit the game mechanics to kill &amp; siphon caps from them with no risk of losing anything themselves.
---
Example: Player A attacks a CAMP, and racks up a 400+ cap bounty, the owner responds and kills them but only collects a few caps, because they off loaded them before the attack, after player A is killed, there team mate (Player B) hiding nearby, then kills the CAMP owner.
---
They will repeat the cycle as long as you let it go on.
---
I think people just take them for the plans you get, or to try and initiate PVP, since the patch I've had a couple of workshops taken from me, but I just leave the area and then cancel the quest and move on to another workshop.     
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
I would willing to do in game activities for these too. Only issue about armor sets is that if new ones come out, then these become obsolete. 
---
It also isn't bethesda's job to pander to user-made mods
---
What economy?  
---
I only had one taken once.  But the person just  wanted to pvp, once i stopped the fight he left the server.  
---
next update or down the line?
---
I use chems frequently.  I've gotten addicted like twice and I'm over level 100.  
---
I have more Addictol than I'll ever use and I've sold at least half of what I've gotten so far.  
---
So, being addicted doesn't seem significant to FO76?
---
I paid $48 and have enjoyed the game. It’s not perfect, but I’ve had very few issues that people are harping about.  For the number of hours of entertainment I have received, this was worth the money. Go see a movie and see how much that costs per hour of entertainment. 
---
I take a few to get the extra lead and steal. More ammo is always good 
---
&gt;The question you have to ask yourself is, "Is it 'more likely than not' that the player obtained that level of ammunition through means that violated the ToS?" If your answer is "yes" then the ban is legitimate
---
The problem is that the answer is NO. The math has already been done and it shows that someone could easily reach that amount in a week of grinding, so in a 30 day span it would be trivial.
---
This happens to me too. Had to shut down and restart the game. Also froze one time as I spawned into my world, I couldn't move but a scorched killed me while I was helpless
---
There was lag when it happened to me at WS
---
Now, killing enemies and them disappearing is a different deal 
---
I think I found it at the red rocket near Harper's Ferry too, in the little side building 
---
Trust me, you want more than three. Like 5-7 is the right number.
---
Same for me.
---
"And yeah, pre-birth insurance isn't gonna get anyone killed!"
---
These insurances have no effect on how much medical treatment a child can have. Medical treatment has no effect on infantile mortality ect. Only death matters, because it's great to live with severe health problems.
---
Yes, of course. After all, it was you who has to use worlds  "internet personality" "government experiment " to make some obscure point.
---
Just go freely fuck yourself.
---
I have a big one take over a workshop any you like ( the further from your camp and vault 76 the better ) and use it to cut travelling cost pro tip use the travelling agent perk card and save a few more caps.
---
And when you are ready to log out fast travel to the workshop and enjoy logging in and taking over the workshop and making some xp, rinse and repeat 
---
That's about 90% of the player base. Unfortunately the other 10% can ruin the game, or at least make you leave a server.
---
Mine would always bonk my toon in the head on log-in like a reminder to turn it in
---
WOW! LOL I didn't even know you could see other players on the map..THANKS for that, although, I kinda feel it makes being sneaky or stealthy vs other players impossible?
---
Where are you getting this idea he had that much ammo on him at that time? Because everything I've seen and read from the emails and what BSG has said, it is just that much ammo went through the characters inventory over a 30 day period.
---
Keep in mind that means that since he was using mules and would transfer the ammo from his main to his mule to save space that ammo amount would be counted against him multiple times.
---
Which in other posts was shown that it's possible to have crafted?
---
Containers (garbage cans, etc) re-roll every time you server hop. Specifically if you haven't looted them yet. 
---
Nothing says he made or even had 100k ultracite ammo, it says he acquired that much in a 30 day period.
---
With two accounts and passing the ammo to his main account for SBQ fights then passing it back to his alternate account multiple times the flag to ban him would also be made.  Whether he has that much or not is on Bethesda, but they have stated they are tracking the items everytime you pick them up not with the totals you actually have.
---
Not saying this makes him by default innocent, but it does mean their methodology for banning people is flawed and will inherently catch SOME people who are in fact innocent and not exploiters.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
All of that aside, gathering flux to make 100k ultracite ammo is not hard if you know how to farm it.  You can gain hundreds in a matter of hours by server hoping to servers with a nuked prime fissure.   But again there is nothing that says or even implies he had that much ammo.
---
There is absolutely no way to release a product that is absolutely perfect in every single way. That expectation needs to be smothered to death. 
---
Ah okay, thanks so much for the info.
---
Oh scorchbeasts, I thought you meant the black powder gun
---
Are you the same person that posted this ?
---
I would say the same to since you seem to be unable to accept that people think FO76 is trash. But I remember reading how people with low self esteem often hang their value based on what they like instead of their own self. So if I look at it that way, your childish lashing out at disagreement is understandable. You should probably work on that.
---
Totally agree. If they *were* going out of their way to sabotage mods, I'd be surprised, though it's been done for mods in other games that trivialized gameplay.
---
It's much more common for companies to see a good mod, then just flat out steal the idea and implement it.  I'm looking at you WoW...
---
I would like a pacifist server tbh. everyone on there would just be up for helping each other. The Appalachia I want but not the Appalachia I deserve.
---
No, I'm saying that they're not relevant to the discussion of these specific complainers. They could be Olympic athletes. Who cares, if it's not relevant to this actual situation. 
---
Harpers ferry had the trappers dense plan, watoga train station had the combat/ marine dense plan. They might spawn other places those are the confirmed spots before patch.
---
100% it's not just a recolour this sets the bar high I know they won't always do things of that detail but I expect them definitely but more detail into em 
---
Please let us know if the adrenal nerf was intended or not in today's inside the vault.
---
I'd almost believe this...  its Badhesda after all!
---
It hits things like a bus and it can be suppressed. Good for sneaky snipey stuff.
---
New beginning friend. one that combats evil.
---
I'd rather pay caps than food/water. It's a bigger hassle to get and keep up with than caps for me already. 
---
They bug out. Sometimes when you have dug it in the past it will not leave your inventory, it then causes the rest of the stack to become bugged and unusable. You have to drop that stack it will no longer work. Once it is not in your inventory the next one you find should work.
---
Just because it's technically possible doesn't mean it's plausible.  Nobody is going around dropping tens of thousands of ultracite ammo.  It's also not something people are selling in that quantity.  Bethesda surely has more info than you do on this particular situation.
---
Shows that YT'ers just want "news" handed to them instead of doing the work themselves.
---
Hmm, I wonder if the Savage Divide 3 dig site will work with the toxic map 3. Gonna give that a shot.
---

---
You are welcome. The original link should be working now. Can you check it out and let me know if it is working for you now?
---
buy it for 76% off, maybe half off
---
The balance of crafting/looting ammo vs using ammo, based on previous updates it's an important part of the game that players don't have too much ammo
---
The original link should be working now. Can you check it out and let me know if it is working for you now?
---
I did that with some studded deep pocketed leather armor for a guy. He put it on instantly and kept heart emoting to me. Made me happy.
---
The only trash here is the shit you are typing.
---
Where does it say anywhere that he currently had that much ammo on his mule? The email said that he had acquired that much over a 30 day period, not that he currently had that much.
---
The issue is BSG's way of counting things you collect is screwed up and something you have can be counted towards it multiple times.
---
Easiest way to prove this is make a new character and go collect 10 wood outside of the vault and then take it and put it in a suitcase and close the suitcase. Now go check your achievement tab under collectables, the "collect 76 wood" will have gone up 10 from the wood you gathered and put in the suitcase. Now pull that same 10 wood out of the suitcase and then check your achievement again, it will have increased by 10 again. So it will show that you have gathered 20 wood on that new character even though you only ever had 10 wood total. They just counted that 10 wood twice. Same thing happened with this guys stack of ultracite ammo.
---
He's much better than pretty much any journalism website nowadays.
---
Thanks, ps4 or I would jump at the chance. Thanks for the offer though.
---
yeah those channels are toast once (if) this game shapes up. 
---
He'll that's not a joke, it's pretty normal on new code.  One of those "if your don't laugh ya have to cry" things that's drives programmers nuts.
---
Scorchbeast be like "I hope nobody saw me dropping some shit"...or it's the Scorchbeast version of birds shitting on cars
---
2/21 Update: Last night I attempted to resurrect my camp at least 16 times. The camp would not load. I built a very simple camp in the same location, Game would not load that camp as well. This is getting very frustrating since tuesday's patch. I have never had a problem prior.
---
I actually thought of that and if i remember correctly the answer is no. But feel free to fact check me. Its been a few patches since I did all my maps. I'm surprised the bug is still around.
---
I had this happen to me three times at white Springs last night on xbox.  Luckily the third time it froze for about 20 secrestait came out of it.  The other first two i had to quit and restart. 
---
it broke rule 11, don't hurt the mods feelings.
---
inb4 ban
---
There are loads of patches on the Nexus, even going back to right when the game first launched. Stability isn’t as big as an issue as it used to be
---
Bullshit
---
Lmao literally why do y'all care? 
---
You'll only hurt yourself when those high DPS unarmed unyielding non-PA players don't bother showing up for the fight.  I'm convinced 2-3 of these bloodied unyielding non-PA players can easily carry a whole group of PA wussies.  My main character is a PA gunner and while I'm contributing, I don't feel he's nearly as strong as those I've seen join in these fights.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. I LOVE the fallout universe, but they've centered a lot of their stuff around the *single player* experience. Even this game shows they took the same Fallout 4 engine (a single player game), copied most of the details and then tweaked the setting to be in WV.
---
I dont think the original plan was supposed to be an MMO and I think they weren't at all prepared for something like this. WoW has that shit down to a 'T' lol. I think it's mainly because they've been in the MMO business for a much more significant time. Hell, at least WoW has an auction house for players ☹ lol. And at least their GMs seemed kinda cool when interacting w them
---
That's a shitload of ultracite...
---
You have a downvote button and a comment box on the video, use it
---
I'll take you up on the offer. Probably won't be playing it for 4-5 days due to work, but once I get it downloaded I'll send you a PM to get you added. Thanks
---
I don't want people to know where my camp is.  I'd prefer if you got maybe a separate mini machine maybe similar to the camp so that I could pick a separate location for the vendor.
---
Preferably one I could fast travel to for free lol.
---
This is gorgeous. How did you manage to budget all the in? I can never get so highly decorated. I really love the little bar and grill. 10/10 would visit and hang out here. 
---
As someone whose favorite game is Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts, I've known this for years.
---
YouTube for the most part is just Popular Culture. There are some good genuine reviewers out there, but the algorithm punishes them for it. You have to dig through a lot of bullshit to find them. 
---
It's only gotten worse over the years too. Back when BKN&amp;B came out, pandering was just a way to leech views off trends and other popular uploaders. Now it's a fundamental part of the platform, programmed right into the core algorithm of the website. Daily clickbait uploads is the only way to survive. Subscriptions have been made nearly pointless. Not to mention sponsored content and "influencer" culture that is rampant on the platform too. Sponsors allow quality channels who haven't sold their soul to survive, but they also have a dark underbelly of undisclosed native advertising. A lot of YouTubers and Twitch streamers take cash to promote games to their audiences. Audible ads might be annoying, but at least they are disclosed obvious advertisements.
---
Thanks. Very helpful. 
---
Game is fine, it was released in good working order, this sub is also fine
---
Can't get banned if you don't play.
---
Time for some Awesome Opossum Bacon!
---
Who?
---
Dude, one word  
---
Outsorced
---
Last night I had two people run up on my camp with TSEs and wreck my camp and killed me twice before I could even react. Pretty frustrating. 
---
Lead and steel, specifically, have great farm locations that don't involve PvP, so if that's all you're after, you have alternatives.  But there's nothing wrong with your method either, you just have a choice.
---
Copper, on the other hand, I'd kill anyone for a good source :P
---
Some perks are passive meaning you have to press a button to activate them (triangle on ps4) like Pharma Pharma, and Can do there is more but I don't remember them off hand.
---
Yeeeey
---
It's not bad. There's clubs and discords to help find people. I usually collect a random teammate or two with random invites because I'm cheap and want to fast travel near them for free. 
---
But the problem is BSG is playing this game where they are trying to slowly soften people up the the idea of buffs being buyable in the atom shop.
---
It is obvious they wanted to have lootboxes in the game from the lunchbox fiasco, the only reason they didn't add those in is because of the HUGE backlash they rightfully received.
---
With this buff, what they are doing is using it as a way of slowly easing people into the idea of buffs being okay to be gotten from the atom shop. As for it being temporary? There are TONS of P2W games with temporary buffs that only last a short period you can buy with real money. This is no different.
---
It's funny I have 2 characters one level 96 and one level 20 and I still haven't seen one of these suckers.
---
Amazing! 
---
that's nice and all but where do i farm a nice cute relationship
---
I watched two streams today from different teams who used to regularly take her down easily. They found the silos more difficult and they gave up on the queen. One group were bloodied so the recent mutation nerfs/bugs have ruined their builds. The other group weren't bloodied but felt the queen was more of a bullet sponge.
---
Mmm yes befesba ebil
---
Had this happen to me. The wire can attach to the key pad by mistake through the door, this just keeps the door open. You have to be careful to attach only to the power connector on door this should fix it.
---
Perhaps. 
---
The fix is really fairly simple. I couldn't just write a 3 line post though, suggesting to make passive players immune to PvP damage as well as incapable of inflicting it. That would be boring and Bethesda likely wouldn't see it. 
---
Besides, giving griefers a 24 hour disease would really annoy them and would be much more fitting!
---
Also in a group with everyone wearing a costume that +15 stacks and adds up to a not insignificant buff.
---
The consistent and overwhelming bad press this game got and continues to get even months after its release has me wondering if Atari's E.T. was actually good.
---
In some  cases when it freezes i dont touch any buttons and after 5 seconds  or so it stops freezing. But in most of the cases i have to restart. 
---
Thank you! When it comes to the budget, it sort of turns into a little bit of tactical planning-- Trying to be as efficient with cost-heavy things such as lights. I also pretty much sacrifice defense over vanity- but considering it's in the Forest region, defending it is no issue.
---
I dont mind pvp. However I tend to overkill when it comes to retaliation lol. I grab the workshops so i dont have to actively farm resources.  I can go do events and stuff and let ammo and lead and steel build up at the workshops
---
[mothman vs mothman](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/manny-sandov/video/69754473) 
---
Surprisingly not. If you want, I can describe it 
---
This is excellent. 
---
I replied already but then I saw this comment and it's better. 
---
It wasn't just +15, it stacked for every member with a unique armor piece in the group which could add up to be a quite decent boost.
---
Sometimes I’ll take munitions factory for ammo. Usually if I take it, it’s for the quests and I’ll try to get as many as I can. While doing that I’ll build the resources I need/want since I plan to have it for a while anyway.
---
Hell, I'd just like to invite my friends to a team.  It works like once every 25-30 attempts.
---
&gt; The problem is, that Unstoppables event came and went away two weeks ago, and no one complained. No one complained because it was absolutely trivial and the bonus made no difference. 
---
This is demonstrably false, plenty of people complained.
---
Cool hat never seen that one 
---
I ended up putting a floor pad in front of the door, then added a second door that attaches to the switch.  So the user needs to stand on the pad and enter the code, then sprint through both doors before they shut.
---
I then place floor pads at both doors to exit.  Pain in the arse to wire up, but works well until they fix it.
---
You opened your eyes and looked around....I see Thor’s mighty ban hammer coming your way!!!!
---
Sweet thank you
---
Once again, people like you feel like you get to judge other people. That's why you are fucking trash. Fuck off. 
---
Sure, nothing wrong with that, I would just rather pick up a few drops that are easy to farm than have to worry about PvP in any way.
---
That's me though, you be you ;-)
---
(than again, I'm pretty under-geared and a late starter, so if I was OP I might mind less)
---
So I took it on good faith that you were right and I was remembering 
---
 wrong when you said that dropping and picking up wood keeps increasing your counter, as opposed to me saying it doesn't. So I decided to check it. I took 5 wood from my stash, dropped it and checked back my challenge counter. Did it a few times. No change.
---
So I was right and you clearly made up your claim. The game can distinguish between dropped and collected items and won't register picking up the same ammo as crafting new ammo, as I had previously stated.
---
Ey man the other dude didn't get banned so they can't ban me.
---
Last night I was experiencing some similar "strangeness" with a teammate.  Suddenly for no reason at all the voice speaker icon next to his name went black with an "x" beside it. We couldn't speak to each other / hear each other.  I went into the social menu to try leaving the team and then re-forming the team ... but that's when I noticed my friend's name with (Online) beside it, as if he was on a different server from me -- yet I was staring right at him standing in front of me!  I tried right-clicking on "Join" under his name and, lo and behold, I exited the server and went into a loading screen, then joined a world again and he was standing nearby and the voice chat issue was resolved. He was now showing in the social menu WITHOUT (Online) beside his name as if we were definitely on the same server.  VERY STRANGE!!
---
Do you have proof that this was intentional? Or is it pure speculation? Innocent until proven guilty
---
This is also a great way to get plans
---
My biggest problem with pvp is the revenge shit. If I kill someone 20 times make it so they cant take revenge anymore. Leave me alone dam it lol
---
&gt;It doesn't register how much you own but how much you got over 30days.
---
You're speculating that. Unless you work for Bethesda, you don't know that for certain.
---
When selecting Amounts use the L1 and R1 to jump 5%.
---
Or probably not to avoid the hammer
---
The problem is though that the mistress outfit also removed all your other armor while the actual bought gear that gave this buff was cosmetic and allowed you to wear your normal armor underneath. Thus making the free version almost useless compared to the paid versions.
---
I get that bug too. Not sure why but randomly I'll go to a area and when I get within "med range" of the mobs they will just all drop dead. Once this happens it will continue until I leave the area and return via fast travel or something similar (relog).
---
Makes me wonder how well he generally checked his topics...
---
The rare occasions I'm not full on caps I vendor 5-10 bulk copper each day
---
People complained here and in the discord. Just because you didnt see it doesn't mean it didnt happen. But hey, you keep working hard to defend this company, I'm sure they appreciate the free work.
---
Regurgitating facts and understanding what they mean are two different things.
---
What's the point of giving the buff for a short duration if the buff can't be bought a second time?
---
It's not griefing until they follow you to another server. 
---
I don't know about the level requirement being a no-no...you have to wait to level 25 to begin Miner Miracles, after all.
---
I have a medic that can help. Do I have gone to find some stims? Add tuchflufygetdizy - my psn
---
It doesn't make sense we all come out of vault 76 and there is always gonna be someone with a gun that doesn't seem right or armour where you literally can't kill them. 
---
If all you want is screenshots of campfires and vault boy standees, sure. I like that it exists but I hope they can evolve to more meaningful discussion without the trolls and shitty attitude.
---
I am OP until sent gear gets fixed lol
---
But then what? You PvP like that? If you try to wear a Power Armor on it, that removes the cosmetic along with the buff.
---
Is this new pasta I smell cookin'?
---
Your right, unless we pull his game accolades to see hrs played, we will never know. And if we assume this, it's only true to assume we wont know the duping part as well. But I fear that I may collect a crap ton of ammo and also get banned. I pick up everything to the point I'm slow walking somewhere. And when I play with ppl, they're dumping all the ammo I use and they dont quite often. I'm talking 1000 rounds per person. I ask the same of randoms I run into. What'll happen if I fall under that same unjustified ban? Thatll be some bs. (I get it would take a LOT of ammo to get to that but still something to think about)
---
Working like a charm. Again, copious amounts of thanks for your hard work.
---
I can sometimes do this one when the Swarm of Suitors event is active. That's the only way I've found of using this particular treasure map.
---
Nah PC but I'll be fine.
---
In patch 6, Bethesda disabled the ability for the Scaleform engine (what the UI runs in) to access the network. Prior to that, file system write access was restricted so the mod couldn't write changes to configurations to a local file. So, as a workaround the mod was using network calls to save and load loadouts. Now that network access has also been restricted, the mod cannot talk to its server to save or read loadouts. I think was Bethesda did was close a security hole, the sandbox that the UI runs in is pretty tight already. Allowing it Internet access was clearly a security hole.
---
I'm working with the mod author on Nexus Mods to help him design (and possibly implement part of) a solution that would restore full capabilities to the mod, but maybe it won't be quite as convenient as it was before.
---
Currently, the mod can read the local file system, so the loadouts could be stored in a local configuration file.
---
So, what we are working on are:
---
(1) a way to download your last used configuration and use it as a starting point for the mod's local configuration file
---
(2) a way to easily get a currently configured loadout configuration string from the UI so you can put it back into your configuration file. The current thinking is using a QR code you can screenshot or take a picture of with your cell phone, and then upload to a QR code decoding website to get the text, and then copy-paste the text into the config file. I'm thinking about building a mobile app that you pair with a locally running server to decode the QR code and automatically send it to the local server which updates the file for you -- however, that has a lot of working parts that might be tough to make work in all conditions, and tough to support if it is not working on some people's computers.
---
(3) possible compatibility with a build planner like Nukes and Dragons so that you can open your loadouts in that tool directly from the config file, edit them, and copy-paste the result back into the config file (that way you can edit your loadouts while not in the game).
---
Don't hold your breath. I'm not the mod author, just a software programmer and architect trying to help the community get back up and running with this mod by offering suggestions and help. Stay tuned for updates.
---
The entire map is full of things.. See through rocks on the bottom, vault doors you can see through the side, and much much more.. Bethesda is soo sloppy.. Even Fallout 4 had some of this.. they didn't even care if things was done right.. take a look at 4 player house.. the side door on the ground is not the same side door as in before. also across the street where did that carport back wall come from and the color of the houses is wrong. Bethesda doesn't care if things are accurate. I learned this from 4 that they are really sloppy at making games.
---
Buddy please, I know people with small penises often have anger problems, but you dont have to live up to the stereotype. You dont have to play bellow average games just because you have a bellow average biological set up. Be better to yourself and play some decent games.
---
Yeah, how dare they want a game they paid for and was probably excited to play to be better than this shit.
---
Do you not see how someone could end up feeling the way they do after the dozens upon dozens of screw ups BSG has done since this games launch?
---
There will always be someone willing to ruin other people's enjoyment and call it fun. Maybe some people think others would enjoy being killed in a nuke zone by a player while trying to help kill hordes but i do not.
---
Not at all. He panders to his patreon supporters with stupid communist shit like “fire bobby kotick because he makes a lot of money and his workers should get that instead”. His demographic is dumb gamers. 
---
Possible? Technically, maybe. Plausible? Not really.
---
Thanks for your thoughts. 
---
Thanks for the heads up,il make sure I drop them later 👍
---
Must be hard to go through life with crippling stupidity.  
---
I feel sorry for you.
---
What platform are you on?
---
* Sending team invites so you can fast travel to their base, then drop team and destroy their base
---
* Abusing mechanics so that you can initate pvp when not intentional (common sense has to come into play here)
---
* Intentionally causing bugs to occur for other players (pacifying the queen for example)
---
Interestingly enough that was active at one point when I tried it.
---
I’ve heard that scorched killer affects the queen but I’ve also heard that only the exterminator does. Anyone know the truth? 
---
Except it is because were discussing human motivation and reasoning and showcasing examples of such things that people do for enjoyment or a sense of fulfillment despite no actual reward or actual challenge. So its entirely relevant since you claimed knowledge on the human aspect and motivations and that no one would do such a thing. This is also just in the positive if we go into the mentally Ill category I'm sure i could mention quite a few things that also have no apparent reason or reward but that people fulfill. 
---
PC
---
If you're crouched/in stealth, it limits them being able to see you
---
I dropped a complete set or raider PA (lvl.15)with fusion core plus a bag of goodies at the vault. 
---
You realize there are lots of builds that don't use PA right? So those builds were still getting a +60HP buff, which is around a 20% increase in hit points. That is far from "an insignificant buff".
---
Greifing is prolonging an encounter past the point of enjoyment. If I have to disconnect, then your are greifing. If we can fight and walk away amicably afterwards, then it's just PvP.
---
I agree, pre TS nerf patch was way better. I get this wierd 2nd loading screen now as well. It looks like where im logging in but with out textures. 
---
Same here just nubbing it and no ban

---
For reference go read the other posts by OP, this isn't someone who wants to screw up the game, he just plays a lot.
---
Yea i like it, great ideas.
---
If you look at Despotak’s post, they clearly were doing *something* to adrenal reaction and bloodied which led to adrenal reaction breaking.  
---
If they have “nerfed” them intentionally then I will be boycotting my $20/month spend at the Atom Store. 
---
Oh multiboxing, so how many did he multbox, Two, three four accounts?
---
Perhaps he should be known as the 450 hour guy, the 300 hour guy or the meagre 225 hour guy. Because when you add multiple accounts it really easy to get lots of hours. 
---
I think it's all fake news,cause I haven't met a single person in the game that's been banned. 
---
If you dont get the statement that's the problem. I dont want to spend time fighting you.
---
I can’t remember the exact price they were. I think that the Silver Shroud and the rest of the costumes were all 800 apiece. I bought 2, but if there was a package deal that included all four for 2k, or maybe the four outfits, plus the comic stash,  and  maybe the Unstoppables bed for 2.5k I may have bought everything.
---
If they are going to continue this shit legendary drop deal, then a fix would be to let un scrap the damned things for parts &amp; a **small** chance to obtain one of the legendary mods. 
---
Take pile of crap, scrap down till you have all the useful bits, and equip to weapon of like build &amp; choice, then problem solved. 
---
They already have a slot system for legendaries that would keep you from build something ridiculous (sorry 5 star only-Furious Super-Sledge), and you can mod some to add a start with the Prime mods, so the bones are sorta there. 
---
Are u implying you know every person who plays fallout 76??? Did u go search every corner of the internet every corner of 76 and talk to every person that plays and ask do u sell this much ammo?? No didn't think so idiot
---
Shucks, I have a lvl (35 or 40?) 1* 2 shot gauss I could have hooked you up with, I'm on XB1 though. 
---
What are the Odds these two legitimately got both a TSE combat shotgun and a Handmade + QuadE double barrel....
---
My main is lvl 293 and I'd be happy if they wiped the servers and removed all these ill gotten loot.
---
So as long as I'm crouched I'm not visible on the map? Does it effect how people see me?
---
To lure people into buying something in the atom shop for the first time. Go look up any research done about p2w strategies. Psychology has shown that getting someone to purchase something the first time is the hardest, after you get them to buy something for the first time they are exponentially more likely to buy things again.
---
It is kind of like losing your virginity to P2W strategies. This is a well known tactic companies use.
---
I killed 7 or 8 last night too. But it was more like a 5 - 6 hours session.
---
LOL I might head back to the vault to see if I might find said bag of goodies! 
---
There's a way to beat any build.  No need to be rude.
---
No, you put it in a container and close the container and then open the container back up and pick it back up. Just like someone who would be muling the ammo over would do.
---
I also posted that this mod needs to be part of the normal game. I also suggested the Save My Stuff mod that made it so you can't sell/drop favorited items.
---
Someday maybe.
---
You're lying. 
---
Whoever designed these is an idiot.
---
As suggested, you have to put in an additional switch / pressure plate (preferred).
---
So the wire you were disconnecting to get it to close- put a switch on that line.
---
Before:  
---
[Generator]---[wire A]---[door, delayed switch]
---
After:  
---
[Generator]---[wire A]---[pressure plate]--[wire B]---[door]
---
Seems hit or miss lately. I just keep checking the map until I see it
---
I used to follow that asshole for years because of his awesome Skyrim movie. But the shit this guy spews out and exaggerates over the most petty issues proved too much. I unsubscribed back in Dec, haven't looked back.  No idea if his subscriptions have dropped but if they have, good! Karma's a bitch. 
---
West tek is still super good, and my build is an unyielding, bloodied fire axe build I’m doing 4K a hit with everything going she does real fast 
---
Yeah I hate having someone keep seeking revenge after killing them 20 times and no longer getting caps of there broke selves
---
I have my CAMP in the dried up lake near Lakeside Cabins, every time I log in I go and claim it for the XP and plans. I have been doing this for a few weeks and have never had it taken off me by a player, enemies yes (i never normally build defences tbf) but never another player.
---
I can't ever remember logging in and finding that someone else had it either.
---
XBOX btw.
---
That was like 50% of FO4 though, and you usually wind up saving some town full of strangers in other games too.
---
Why dont you go read all of that guys other threads where he talks constantly about his disdain for exploiters.  Just because he was banned doesn't mean he is automatically guilty.
---
Stop being a sheep and actually do some research, people who exploit don't sit there trying to improve the community with farming guides and run around killing exploiters because they think people shouldn't exploit.
---
At least get the information correct ffs.
---
72 years young you mean.
---
He had 3 accounts he was playing at the same time. His 900 hour number is just counting the hours played on his level 450 character.
---
Ok so *theoretically* i could trade 5000 of this special ammo to my mule for 1 cap. Why bother when i can just use a box though? got it. So thats the nuance of the discussion. thanks for clarifying all that stuff.
---
Eh no Im not and if you dont believe me I dont give a fuck. I recently hit the 500 hour mark, got 5 chars of which 3 are lvl 80+. One sniper one explosive heavy gunner and one BoS laser rifle char
---
Sure man here’s another sighting 
---
Mothman[here](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/manny-sandov/video/69748788) 
---
Use melee for now. You can still one-hit damn near everything in the game
---
It would also probably be a programming nightmare to have to factor in every type of food and water available in this game. There's only one kind of caps.
---
Outstanding.  Even has a tail!
---
so what? Your claim of "No. Single. Lie. Period." is incorrect.
---
Under the Misc Structures tab while building in a claimed workshop, there is a fast travel mat; putting it down within the workshop's boundaries will allow you to pick the spot you fast travel to.  A lot of people don't realize this.
---
I feel it comes down to trying to egg on or exploit someone into engaging in PVP when they don't want to.  Using slap damage/base damage to annoy someone into PVP, purposely getting in their line of fire, or using one of their defense mechanics to trigger full damage PVP mode.
---
To answer your question about workshops.  You are not a greifer to try and take a workshop from someone.  They are meant to be useful and something to fight for.  
---
However, there is a game mechanic with it that in my opinion allows griefing, which is that you can locate the player beforehand on the map, start the takeover, and then you or your team can fast travel and kill the person there.   Maybe I don't want to contest the workshop or I'm in the middle of mission and heavily engaged so I can't get away or even fast travel to the workshop if I wanted to.   To suddenly have a person show up and try to kill you then...  I think that's forcing someone to PVP who doesn't want to and therefore is griefing.   
---
I think workshop PVP should be limited to the area of the workshop only and/or fast traveling away from the workshop should end it, giving the person a way to give away the workshop without PVP if they wish.
---
This would have been easy to do in this time frame (before bans) you could be given or buy massive amounts if you wanted.
---
It could easily be abused.
---
How deep is this?  Are there pictures from the side?
---
Yeah i have 30 rounds of Ultracite 556. If they're counting ultracite as rare then that might be my problem. I know that the bag i found had around 90k ultracite in it. 
---
This is only a bug for 1/3 of the community though, you all forget the other 2/3rds dont have access to mods so it would probably benefit everyone to just join in on the make this a feature bandwagon the console users have been asking for. 
---
Its happened to me as well. It worked a long while ago. 
---
Went back a few times and it wouldnt let me dig, later (days?) I tried again and I could dig one time. Now im sittting on 5 maps that it wont let me use.
---
Have you tried storing the light and the switch and hooking it back up?
---
Yeah, but I always fantasized in FO4 that I was enslaving those settlements, producing resources for my own benefit, Neegan style, f*** yeah.
---
While I agree it would be nice to have a server browser, hell, even a ping display somewhere, Bethesda said pretty early on that we 'wouldn't even notice the server'. So they're trying to hide it all behind the scenes.
---
My (female) friend had a group of (male) friends that all gave her violet flux, lead, and steel en masse to supply her prime Gatling gun habits. She went through at least 5000 rounds a day. 
---
She didn't play for a few weeks because of KH3, found out this morning she is very banned.
---
Pretty sure that doesn't break any rules. =\
---
Anyone know how to get the Shishkebab up to decent numbers where it's worth using over everything else?
---
Agreed!! I’m telling you they fix something and then poof mayhem!! We all obviously love fallout we wouldn’t  be here sharing like this and supporting one another it’s what makes the fallout community special like no other !! But this is getting ridiculous!!! Why don’t they play test the dam game before they do public release on their Patch fixes!!?? I feel  like we are their test dummies that paid for the pleasure of in game torture !! I lost two lever action rifles in a trade and let me tell you I have the worst rng on earth !!
---
Before we quit yesterday I was farming legendaries at white springs the flowing ghouls where literally running in packs of 4-5 legendaries!!! It was a free for all almost no one there and loot a plenty !!! At the end of the day I had 54 items of garbage !!! Junkie this wood that all crap go figure hey anybody need  a junkies rolling pin? Answer  No!!! no one ever needs a fucking rolling pin or boxing glove ever!!!!WTF!!
---
Yes 
---
Welcome to the club my good man, 600 hours here and banned.
---
AWOL armaments? I don’t think I’ve ever done that one 😑
---
YouTube gaming channels are complete garbage these days.  They're more interested in revenue than anything else, its beyond pathetic.
---
My man!
---
That's my understanding, your pip isn't visible to other players on the map as long as you're in stealth. I'm not sure how status, or mob visibility affects that, I always just assume you need to have the [ hidden] status to be non-visible.
---
Not a Nerf is a bug. Don't spread false Info. 
---
Settle down, nobody has been banned for getting into the Vaults. 
---
&gt;Yes I'm sure a clan of people conspired just to make sure this one guy had ammo.
---
You do realize the guy was multiboxing, meaning he had 3 characters he was actively playing at the same time in a team.
---
Aten_ra who is well known and trusted in this community has went and done the math, as he is also a multiboxer and the amount of material needed to craft that much ultracite ammo is easily collected by someone multiboxing in a week, not even 30 days needed. 
---
Here are the full break down of numbers and how easy it would be to reach those numbers multiboxing:
---
How so?
---
That's more than I've played since B.E.T.A.
---
Servers are more stable... probably because less people playing on them.
---
They've broken more things than they fixed with every patch.
---
I'd wait another year... it's a dark time right now for 76.
---
I would have easily farmed 20-30k Ultracite ammo in 100 hours (after 50lvl), but farming such much leads to boring gameplay so I wasn't interested. This player has 900 hours played and with active trading he can easily get such amount of ammo if he is just working hard in my opinion. There are always people who can farm stuff in incredible quantities. These hardcore players spend most of their daily time just for playing and farming stuff. It's their choice. I do not judge them.
---
Bethesda logic to ban people is about the same like: Some one has 100k dollars in his bank account and he doesn't want to make a big number for everyone that he works 16-18 hours everyday in every month. Bank (Bethesda) decides to freeze his account because they think that a person who is just normal worker can't earn that much in so short time with his hourly wages.
---
I am not convinced yet that we know whole truth, but when considering how badly Bethesda has taken care of customer expectations and fixing this game  I wouldn't be surprised at all if they fucked this case as well.
---
These were only my opinions and if you want to be a blind Bethesda fan boy/girl its your choice. Eventually you will see the truth what Bethesda really delivers for the customers...
---
Been requested in a million threads, pretty much multiple times a day.
---
Sound mate add you later on tonight 
---
yea here's the problem: The duping and exploiting had gotten so wide spread and rampant, that the people who maybe ARE innocent are just casualties of bethesda getting rid of the ones who were.   
---
Confirmation bias my ass. Either explain a point ot GTFO.
---
Of you liked 4, 76 will suit your needs. It's basically 4 with a new map, new (albeit a bit dull) story and multi-player. 
---
Well, no one really knows. You got to wait for more actual info to surface.
---
At least that video wasn't an hour long thing criticizing how Bethesda is expecting us players to sit through hours of computer terminals lol.
---
(ref https://youtu.be/MlfRhpOy6Yc?t=971   )
---
Something dark and creepy, similar to that sewer with the tapes from FO4 or the Dunwick locations from FO3 and FO4.
---
My biggest problem with the game was how unintelligent the A.I. seemed to be, any comments on that?
---
Because ultracite ammo is used as currency on most trading boards because caps have a max of only 25k which most people have already reached the cap on.
---
Sandman definitely not working and I think I’m not getting the toast for sneak attacks (but the damage appears to be dealt properly for sneak attack).
---
Sorry clown daddy, I really do enjoy your material please don't hurt me down lol
---
I think I'm done with SBQ. I play solo too and the majority of times I join the event we fail. 
---
I can break two guns and spend 2000 ammo easily in 30 minutes. That would be fine if everyone committed. I often see people using the fight as an opportunity to trade. There are far too many people who don't pull their weight.
---
Speaking of which, I don't feel like I can pull my weight. I'm playing a ranged sneak character, but between the Two-Shot/ TSE nerf, Adrenal Reaction breaking in the last patch and the infinite caution/danger bug I'm not that useful. 
---
Even without those issues though, the fight is infuriating. The majority of times I end up tanking 90% of the trash because they seem to be more inclined to attack higher level players. I'm not built for tanking, so that sure is fun. Completely ruins my build when I have dozens of scorched running into my face one after the other. 
---
And then finally if you kill her, the loot is not worth it. It just isn't. Not for the time spent, and not for the resources you used. 
---
I disagree with you. It does not matter how miniscule or time limited p2w is. Those Youtubers, which you insult, have stated the truth. It is your personal problem how you feel about facts, not theirs.
---
Same with your presumption of his guilt.  Bethesda has stated it's a tally of items you pick up so passing ammo back and fourth would cause a ban as well.  He may have only had 10k ultracite ammo and just moved it between his main and alt account when killing the SBQ.
---
There is far more to the story that everyone is just to lazy to dig around and research.  Every additional piece of factual information I find makes his story more plausible.  Everything from his disdain of exploiters in his threads from months ago to Bethesda using picked up tallies as a Ban criteria. 
---
One example of the Ops dislike of exploiting the game, show me an example of something Bethesda has done in the last 3 months that should earn them any customer faith.  (And fixing bugs by breaking other crap in the game obviously doesn't count)
---
You didn't read the BGS email he had, which states that he had 255k Ultracite ammo. And even if you can get all that flux, which is unlikely, the steel and lead costs would be insane.
---
Save your breath.  These guys don't want to hear that this is an issue affecting a small minority. 
---
They should set it up like elite dangerous.  Problem solved
---
Not a bug, and **not** false info. They purposely lowered the damage% for adrenal per health tier. Look up the bugthesda notes in here from yesterday.
---
I'm assuming the changes in the patch are what bugged the mutation.
---
&gt; toxic circlejerk.
---
you're the one whose toxic mate. just fyi
---
We've killed her plenty of times since the TSE nerf. I haven't did a SBQ since the last patch though and it sounds a bit broken.
---
You need the Chameleon armor that when crouched limits enemies and people from being able to see you.  
---
That's what she said. Hmmm... That didn't work very well. :) 
---
vat crits are very nice though since it isn't just one shot it's like 2sec on a automatic
---
Neighbor 
---
You mean a refund? I got it on PS4 so I'd have to go through Sony for that I believe. Thats a nightmare from what i have heard. Much easier just to delete the game, pack up everything physical i have and drive to MD to leave it nicely at their door. 
---
At least Yongyea does not spout insults like you. If you do not like him, then attack his arguments like a decent human being, not him as a person.
---
Oh, so just going for the level 100 trophy? Honestly, unless your "done" with the game, and that is the only thing holding you back, if say just play the game and don't stress about trying to level. It will come. I mean, you can grind white springs or something, but that's a good way to get burned out. My advice would be just play the game. Explore. Do events. Collect plans. Clear some silos. Drop some nukes. There's a ton to do out there, and experience is a natural byproduct of almost all of it.
---
I build my camp near a remote oil node that has two ticks that always spawn right next to the camp.  9/10 times at least one of the two would vanish after a kill.  I just assumed they were so little that I was launching their bodies with my super sledge.  So yes, I've experienced this as well.
---
Not a Lovecraft reference, but a biblical one. In the Old Testament, in Judges, the Israelites used the word, “shibboleth,” to authenticate their own men from those of Ephraim. 
---
Even through patch 6, I'm still seeing T-Posing enemies when I run in.  Often times they don't move until I hit them...
---
The AI is pretty much the same from FO4.  With the exception of some Super Mutant Kings/Legendaries going into flee mode instead of actually fighting.
---
So, the AI is pretty dumb.
---
BEST

BASE

EVER !
---
Ahh so I would have the shimmer effect basically? Like elites from halo?
---
This is amazing, thank you for sharing
---
I usually toggle my flashlight pointing at the bag, and if they don't get it within a minute or two I might resort to profanities on voice :P
---
Nice, no idea what to do to get that much copper (though I usually just strip Whitespring Resort when I need a farm run or just want to kill off 30 minutes in-game).
---
I generally assumed that was an enemy that died but my client hadn't learned that piece of info yet, and the enemy's death animation plays when it does.
---
You cheated, you got banned. End of story. There are no currently running online games taht let you exploit and get away with it. That sucks you lost an investment from your poor decsisions.  
---
The "Everyone is doing it so I will to, therefor I'm somehow less guilty" argument. So brilliant. If you want empathy, you need to deserve it.
---
Holy crap really!! You just saved me a lot of time when I farm fusion cores thank you!!!!
---
Read the patch notes , depends what you class as significant , the game and servers run a lot smoother , it’s mostly bug and glitch free and there’s been a ton of balancing changes and quality of life changes , Ton of new atom shop items etc , if that’s not enough they’ve planned to bring out new game modes and DLC in the coming months , also not sure about this but they’ve stated they’re bringing out a DLC roadmap at the end of this month so that may get you interested.
---
Yeah message me
---
What? First off, the math has already shown that the amount of ammo listed he had would be craftable with a weeks worth of grinding as a multiboxer like he was. Here is the numbers broke down:
---
That post is by a well trusted and active member of this community who also multiboxes.
---
As for the claim that why would he drop it and risk losing it? How would dropping it in your own locked camp risk you losing it? I drop things on the ground in my camp all the time to make room when I'm crafting bulk steel and such. Does that mean I should be banned as well?
---
Also, if he was a duper why is it that literally on all his accounts the only thing they found in high numbers was ammo and the numbers weren't even that outrageous. Yes they were more than your average player, but someone who puts 900 hours into this game and multiboxes with multiple characters at the same time isn't your average player. So of course his numbers would be outside of the average, because you are trying to compare average numbers with a nonaverage player.

Releasing a product with bugs is one thing.

Releasing a product with bugs, and then penalizing people who operate within the bugged system is another.

You don't get to compound your offense with another offense and act like the good guy.

 Non VATS crits work just fine. The whole VATS thing amuses me. I've never used it as it seemed like cheating, and I don't.

There are so many more nice folks in game than azzhats... Its really nice to see!
---
If you haven't already left the vault, if you take a nap before starting out, you get a little xp % boost right out of the gate.
---
Now if we only had a script to toggle Pacifist mode.
---
I just looked and don't see it. Care to help with a source?
---
Great neighborhood, except for the mutants that keep dropping in from up the hill.  I think we heed an HOA...
---
Actually it says 365k ultracite ammo, but what you are missing in their email to him is that it tracks AQUIRED ITEMS and not items you currently have.
---
If you tool 10k ultracite ammo and put it in a container and took it back out 36 times (no reason obviously to do that,  but it simulates passing ammo to a second account) you would also be banned for the same thing.
---
If you want to proof they are tracking items picked up and not your inventory I can link them.  Many other items would have no reason to be moved that much,  but when your fighting SBQ and dont want to be encumbered unloading your ammo to your alt is very plausible. 
---
Everyone falsely assumes he had that much ammo, nothing at all even points to him having that much ammo.
---
I supose but it's nice to only use 20 bullets to kill a lvl 80 sb instead of 100
---
I had friends who are running low level characters and collected stacks of technical data. So, I have them follow me to Camp Venture, and trade them to me one at a time. I pop a grape mentats, and then turn in each one, and then give them the stuff that is rewarded. I get the caps and XP, they get items. Last night was a lucky turn in night, of 8 technical datas I turned in for a friend, 2 of them where Shielded BOS Underarmor Linings! I also found two cap stashes that after using Caps Collector 3 netted me over 200 caps each! The one SB Queen I dropped last night still gave me Ultracite Explosive Vents and my friend Ultracite Rusty Knuckles, so I guess luck does still balance out in the end.
---
A woke gamer who is SAVING the industry by EXPOSING gaming. Basically, he shits his pants for 11 minutes on why you shouldnt he allowed to have fun. Some times he raises good, legit points and concerns on a topic but his personality comes across as incredibly cynical and he fosters an incredibly toxic following that, in this example, spreads hate for the sake of doing it.
---
Great details!
---
What happened to the daily: queen of the hunt? Have not seen it over several hundreds of game play hours.
---
Pretty sure they were already dead, it's just that your client spawns them when you load into the area and plays the kill animation/sound.
---
Im not banned either but these post are nothing but trolling.  Move on, nothing here to see. game is dead...wish I didnt waste the $$ on the beta, it was a joke on me.
---
What are people doing now?
---
If they start selling legendary items THEN you can start bitching. Even I was telling my friend group online. “Man I wish I could buy something actually useful with my points like bulk junk...” when I was quickly met with “AAAHHH DONT START THAT PAY TO WIN BULLSHIT!!”
---
Really? When I’d rather spend my points on something easily obtainable with an hour of farming, get over yourselves lol
---
Bloodied unyielding with a fire axe with swing and strength and full dmg perks set up I’m on Xbox if anybody needs the help killing her jmay72

Giraffe dog ruining your dreams.🎵

Giraffe dog eating your knees.🎵
---
Not really. Just using .308 and .45 ultracite I never have to worry about being low on ammo. My main has 1 strength so I don't make more than maybe 5k between the two at a time, but when most of your shots are crits 5k is about a weeks worth of playing for me.
---
I found reequipping the cards helped but as I say it only lasted for so long 
---
Welcome to the "No Duh Awards". In this presentation, we will award the "No Duh Award" to a video game that has a gameplay problem with an easy simple fix. They have proposed a complicated fix however, perhaps overlooking much simpler one that wouldn't divide the player base. 
---
I don't use vats. Only for targetting enemies to know where they are located.  The legendaries makes it interesting. I  do it daily, visit whitesprings or watoga and see what legendary weapons i can find.  The nerf of TSE made the game a bit more fair again. 
---
We're gonna build a wall and the Super Mutants are gonna pay for it
---
I'm pretty casual so I'm not even level 50 yet but what I tend to do (having benefited from it myself) is that anytime I visit a vendor I dump duplicate plans and any surplus ammo into the various containers at that location.  My hope is that someone who needs it gets it.
---
I know I've benefited pretty heavily from generous players who do the same thing. It's always nice to visit Watoga and see a stash of yet-learned plans in a container.
---
I would like to think that keeping the current SBQ 3\* is fine... maybe upping it to 4\*, maybe. I think that would allow Beth room to add a real 4\* or 5\* enemies in a future update, say a Scorchbeast King or some other giant team based enemy that takes half the server to take down.
---
In fact I'd argue that it is even the SBQ that's the real problem. It's that after you've fought the queen a couple of times  and picked some flowers and gathered a decent smattering of legendary loot... there's no good reason to keep launching nukes. What Bethesda needs to do to keep the post game content fresh and interesting is to make it so Whitespring and Fissure Prime aren't the only things worth nuking.
---
And the best solution is to add more giant enemies besides the queen. For instance, what if the lesser fissure sites produce a giant legendary 4\* cryptid or mythic beast of some sort that takes the same sort of effort as the queen? Like a 40-50 foot tall deathclaw, mothman, megasloth or Grafton monster? And then non-fissure nuke zones produce a giant legendary 3\* mutated version of random mobs like radroaches, molerats or yao guai? I think that'd keep people entertained in the late post-game. How fun would nuking say Charleston or Harpers Ferry would be cuz you want to see what fighting a 50 foot long snallygaster is like?
---
I've never heard of it either so I googled it and it does exist. 3 waves of robots and a 15% chance of a Legendary reward. It actually sounds pretty good.
---
Let's be real. The PvP servers are 100% a cover for lack of new content.
---
It's the community patch notes from yesterday.
---
[Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asps77/fallout_76_v_1060_changelog_based_on_game_data/?utm_source=reddit-android)
---
Agreed, I just can't remember all the cards I need to swap in/out for each thing I want to do, and then I get 1/2 way though and realize I forgot something!
---
This really needs to be in the game, it significantly improves how the game works and keeps you from sorting a deck of cards in the middle of a fire-fight.
---
It's not just enemies.  Last night, at Camp McClintock, I was running through the course, and kept hearing bots dying (it's a pretty distinctive sound.)  I kept looking around for enemies that were killing them, but there was nothing (not even in VATS.)  But many of the Mister Gutsy army bots were just dropping dead.  Some were fine for a while, then just spontaneously popped and fell over.    By the time I'd finished the course, every friendly bot in the area EXCEPT for the main one you have to turn the quest into had suffered a mysterious, complete, catastrophic existence failure.....
---
Interesting.  From keyboard or controller and what hotkey would you want to use?
---
Maybe they figured out that the well of Whitespring loot has dried up. It’s a terrible place to farm now, no reason to be there
---
well, to be fair, i haven't seen any evidence linking that specific guy with anything more than an alleged picture. the picture of an email from bethesda was shared by him from the beginning, but he removed it (which is the piece of evidence we have).
---
but there were a number of logical assumptions to be made (i.e. the guide he used as an example of how to get the stuff he supposedly duped was made after the fact that he was banned, hastily, in just a day) and one of the bethesda community managers had responded in the thread (so we know they're aware of the (non)situation and didn't dispute his ban the slightest).
---
here's the thing: the evidence linking that specific guy was shared, obviously, by the guy said in question. why? i don't know. but he wised up and removed it. it's too late though and it's already out there. but i can't personally attest to seeing any evidence linked directly, because again, he removed it.
---
you can probably use any of the reddit archiving webpages to find the original post, as well as the original imgur link, but since the original picture also has been removed, it doesn't show what it was.
---
I like this idea. I'm so sick of just nuking whitesprings and fissure prime
---
why didnt you block them? go into the social right click their name from recents and click block they wont be able to follow you
---
He isn't wrong, you can easily do some research and see this for yourself. Go put a legendary item you have in a container and close the container and reopen it and take the legendary item out. You will get the pop up like it is the first time you got the item even though it is an item you already had. That shows that BSG does not keep track of if an item you get is one you already had, so them accidentally counting the guys ammo multiple times when he muled it isn't at all hard to believe.
---
I mean BSG hasn't been able to not screw something up everytime they attempt to do anything with this game. They completely broke the end game for a week making nukes unlaunchable, released their customers private information on their website for anyone to see, released an old patch as a new one, STILL have dev rooms that people can access, and every single patch has created a new bug. Why is it so hard to believe they made a mistake with this ban wave and accidentally had some false positives and banned some innocent people? I just don't understand how people can sit here and see BSG's track record of mistake after mistake and still think they couldn't possibly make a mistake with a ban.
---
 Cheating! ;) It takes me a lot I admit but it is what I do, hunt em', and I'm fine with the .45 for my Lever Action as there is so much just lying around. The only ammo I never make.
---
The work they're doing for PvP servers are also being carried over to the private server back-end. Having more tools at a private server's owner use is a good thing for all players that will be using custom servers.
---
HA! I guess I should start looking out for possible dump locations! Good on you.
---
Yeah, I think that's about right.
---
He didn't delete any comments he made, the mods of this sub did. That is why they say [removed] and not [deleted]
---
Hopefully they keep updating the game. I feel like I joined at the perfect time, after a couple of good patches and the community is established pretty well.
---
he used to be really insightful and engaging.  he's just become a caricature.  and his coverage of fo76 in that video was abysmal.
---
Pics from 94 are already online and well covered you should be ok
---
That font he uses in the title is so ugly.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
There is really no one in the game in general that's what I was getting at.
---
Happens frequently when I walk from the Whitesprings clubhouse toward the area where the creatures spawn, and I've got about a fifty percent chance to freeze walking from the flatwoods spawn point to the hotel where the lead weights are, always in the same spot by the life preserver on the ground next to the pool.
---
So far level 17  its fun!
---
had a GREAT, tense firefight with a NPC super mutant and his henchmen.
---
Recently saw (well heard) my first scorch beast while i was in the woods. Then it saw me and chased me down into an abandoned shed's basement to narrowly avoid succumbing to the onslaught of i think were sonic blasts.  then it landed and tried to GET into the house...glad there was a basement.  had to lay low till it got disinterested 
---
👀
---
send bobs and slot now bch
---
It's the DPS and accuracy, compared to the minigun it's ammo conservation is much better. But the first. 50 cal I ever got was a TSE so that could definitely factor into it lmao 
---
I've found that melee weapons are the most reliable way of trying to hit them. They're hurtbox is usually fully desynched from their model.
---
Pacifist has its place, especially at SBQ event and nuke runs in WS. Nobody likes getting tagged with "friendly" fire. 
---
If you're grabbing a shop though, all bets are off and PVP can happen at anytime.
---
As for the "extra" work to spin up PVP servers. Based on data mining it's always been in the cards to have something along those lines... not exactly battle royale,  but close. 
---
It seems sketchy tbh. Unless hes throwing them all to his main, throwing like 50 in stash and putting them back, racking up that many rounds doesn't seem possible. Even with transfers being counted as new rounds, it wouldn't be an exponential increase.
---
Whitesprings is fine I was just there 2 hours or so ago getting better rates than before..
---
Yep, I logged on last night for the first time in over a month because I wanted to see if things were getting better. Got disconnected 5+ times in an hour. Had trouble just logging into the game. Eventually took over a workshop and the first chance to defend it and there is 1 enemy under the ground. He eventually came out like 15 minutes later. Anyways, I did notice that my camp loads into the world faster than before, so that's a bonus. 
---
actually, he provided us with the email bethesda had sent which detailed the amount of ammunition (which triggered his ban). so, ironically, in the end he provided evidence 'for' bethesda while damning himself.
---
i guess that's why he decided to remove all of his threads related to the matter. you also don't see as many of his friends/sympathizers anymore because the whole thing is obviously very easy to shut down now with things having developed as they have.
---
How about this:
---
Everyone starts server in pvp mode.
---
Switch to passive
---
At any time and can no longer switch back.
---
Or vice versa 
---
If you can move your camp, even a few inches, it'll repair everything for just the movement cap cost.
---
Nice base. You're still an asshole for chasing me around and sniping me. I recognize you and your hat
---
You can rejoin if you have a teammate wink wink.
---
Just learned it, someone send me request, probably because I was in winding palace and there was event starting. Oddly he didn't come to kill the last 3 star super mutant, he was level 70 so I would have thought he know one shows up, tried to wink him to come and waited, but eventually I had to kill it alone :( We fought most of the other super mutants together.
---
Then he went on to crab some workshops like ammo factory and some junkyard on other side of map, and I went into inventory and perk management, which right now takes more time as the perk swapper mod wasn't working and god how long time it takes to equipt manually all perks you need for crafting, even accidentally crafted some ammo without ammo smith, as I only swapped intelligense and luck perks but forgot that perception also has crafting perks.
---
At some point my game just got stuck when opening a normal door, no crash, no disconnect, couldn't open any menu either like when the pipboy just gets stuck, I waited a bit but then was forced to close the game. I was really surprised how the game offered me to play with team when I started the game again to check if I had lost any loot as I might have been killed during the time my client was stuck, allowing me to rejoin that game. Even though technically I had no investment on that server. 
---
Yeah we do need a better option but that's one that's currently available.
---
Easy, go make a new character, collect 10 wood outside the vault then take the wood to a suitcase and put the wood into the suitcase and close the suitcase. Now go check under your achievement tab "collect 76 wood" it will show the 10 you collect and then stashed in the suitcase. Now open up that suitcase and grab that wood back out and check the achievement again, it increases to 20, counting the same wood multiple times. Just like his ammo
---
Didn't they fix 100+ glitches in the first patch? Have they broken 100+ things since?
---
&gt; 140k of ultracite on ONE character, at one time. His OTHER character had over 200k, at one time. Thats well over 300k AT ONE TIME. 
---
Uh... that's not actually what the email from Bethesda said. First, [a link to said email](https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz). I'd like to direct your attention to the following quote:
---
Pay attention to that last part, "within 30 days of game play". That's not a date range, e.g. "the last 30 days", that's a *duration*, a measurement of time. That says that over a 30 day period Mr. 900 Hours acquired 100k+ units of a rare item. If all Bethesda is checking is an instantaneous total of what someone has on hand, why would they include a duration? Well... they wouldn't. There's no reason to include a duration if it wasn't involved in the calculation.
---
Now I'm not basing my entire decision off of that way of phrasing the ban. Really, what makes me almost certain that Bethesda used some other method to arrive at that total comes down to logical reasoning and the motivation behind this ban wave. I mean, what was this ban wave supposed to do? **It was supposed to get rid of the remaining dupers ruining the game's economy** (and shitting up the game for the rest of us). Specifically this was aimed at the dupers who trade and sell things in game, emphasis on that last part: **sell things**. 
---
The dupers Bethesda was after don't dupe items to stockpile, they dupe items to sell them. You can't count on those dupers having unreasonably huge stacks of items on hand at any one given time, not when they can just make more whenever they want with minimal fuss. For one thing, it would make it stupidly easy for Bethesda to figure out what they were up to. Correspondingly, if Bethesda had only gone after people with instantaneous totals of 100k+ of certain rare items then they only would have gotten the stupid dupers, leaving behind the smart ones (i.e. the actual problem) to continue shitting up the game.
---
Even though I have my doubts that Bethesda's execution of this ban wave was perfect with no false positives, I am certain that their staff is *more* than smart enough to reason that they needed to identify dupers with a more nuanced check than "IF RARE_ITEM_COUNT &gt; 100000". Checking for total volume of items that passed through a player's inventory over a set duration would be a perfectly logical, reasonable, and effective way to identify the vast majority of dupers. Given that, it's not much of a stretch to think that a few (very few) incredibly die hard players could be caught up in that despite being innocent. That's not unusual at all with ban waves. Really, the only thing that set this one apart was Bethesda's opening volley starting with "This decision is final, and no further appeals will be considered."
---
And just to be clear, I'm not saying that Mr. 900 Hours is innocent or guilty here, but I'm saying that this situation is not as cut-and-dry as people would like to think.
---
It's all good.  I guess my point was, before the TSE nerf I had to think of new ways to take people down.  Made it more interesting.
---
Maybe now that group of players will finally start asking for this(just as console players have been asking for) instead of that "modders will fix it" bullshit 
---
Vaults will open in 2277
---
We’re just settling until
---
Then.
---
i launch it via steam when i wanna see the fps, just add the game as a non-steam game to the library and you can get the fps on a corner of the screen. needs to log in to the game everytime you go through steam though so i launch from the bethesda launcher every other time, on steam only if i need to know the fps
---
Spending $300 on non-tangible goods with absolutely no return is not only, foolish, self defeating,  irresponsible, but also childish.
---
And for what?
---
He's better off just buying pussy. 
---
That's the main reason I can't do workshops any more on my level 300. If someone attacks your workshop their teammates can do full damage and yank 300 caps. Even solo, if they're level 60+ they've hit max combat effectiveness and you have to be able to keep at least a 5:1 KD to not hemmorhage caps. I've made a low health crit guy that's mid 50s right now, but has gear from my main. Dudes sitting at like 22k caps from mostly pvp.
---
yeah I thought it had to be bugged or something, it literally kept spawning every 10 minutes or so as I was running across the map. I would have thought someone was messing with me if they had that ability real time :)
---
While a response seems like it would be nice, it is not necessary. It is likely that one or more of the representatives I tagged read what I wrote and took it to heart, for whatever that's worth.
---
It's defiantly not what it use to be, less nukes, less everything. 
---
The problem is people that don't play the game dont have any frame of reference to match the numbers these articles and videos throw out. 
---
Like people see almost 400k rounds of ammo and don't realize the stuff crafts in batches of like 40 max on average. And if you point that out they give theexcuse he just had a macro running to craft it all, entirely ignoring the time and effort just to get the ridiculous number of necessary materials just to craft it all. 
---
Start hunting the mole miners. Their scrap and hoses contain black titanium. 
---
Gun nut and weapon artisan perks my dude, helps out greatly 
---
I don’t care what other players say about games fallout76 has horrible reviews I have 600 hrs and I’m lvl 380 games get knocked to easy now from what I’ve played of anthem it’s super fun yeah I can see end game getting Grindy but there really isint one out there that’s not grindy now 
---
Why do you think they are unaware of the mod and the functionality it adds.  
---
Yes, I know they're working on fixing it, but it is being severely limited.  I thought I had referenced that in my post, but I see now that I had cut that part out.  I was trying to pair it down.   Anyway, if Bethesda is going to lock down something that mods are relying on, they should work WITH the mod community instead of just breaking some heavily used stuff and leaving the mod community to sort it out.  The mod community has given much to Bethesda over the years.  Expecting them to do better isn't as unreasonable as you are implying.
---
It's as if people constantly talked aboutt this, and it constantly gets  brushedd under the rug...

---
First one was right outside of Whitesprings, near the shack to the Northeast side, and I was headed up to Morgan-town. He re-spawned in the hills 3 times in 10 minutes and then again up near the penitentiary as well.  
---
I don't think the perk cards are meant to be swapped in and out all the time. They are there only to allow players to test things and respec easily, not to give them every powers. 
---
If you dropped 2k on a pc and don't know how to get an fps monitor, you might want to do some reading. Your ping(latency) would have almost nothing to do with your rig, thats all on your isp and Bethesda's servers
---
No, it doesnt grow with budget, you just have more available without turrets and with few lights.
---
This happened to me during the beta! I was in Charleston doing the Fire Breathers training course. I couldn't even start the course because I was a level 6 and they were all 60+. I still don't like going back to Charleston... Between that nightmare and the DMV trauma....
---
to matter worse, I have to "play" for 4 hours to get rid of it.
---
I can't just leave for 4 hours
---
Depends on the kind of acid we're supposed to be using. For example, hydrofluoric acid should only be kept in plastic containers.
---
Have you never watched Breaking Bad?
---
oh thank you, yeah that is it! I noticed that they were the same type. If I picked up a generic hardened sniper rifle it would equip instead of my suppressed legendary...Thanks for that!
---
I can't blame him.  It's way harder to believe Bethesda nowadays.  With how much bullshit the game has gone through I wouldn't doubt it if they actually did unjustly ban a non-cheater.  I'm not gonna pass judgement on the 900hrs guy as I don't know but I'll sure as hell pass judgement on Bethesda for all the ridiculous shit surrounding this game.
---
There are times when I shoot him he will do that, but most times, I will shoot him and he starts screeching and it is on :)
---
I’m loving my self portrait 
---
Not true 
---
 Turn on your mic. I talk to everyone and very few respond. Its probably worth it just to hear me babbling about my game. I got laughs at The Whitespring while fighting 3 level 80 Besats and babbling about how much fun I was having.
---
 I'm very old. ;)

Please be sarcastic

Oink oink bitch

* Bug fixes
---
* Bug free content
---
* Something to make 76 worth my $60
---
I love that concept. It would also make lots more sense when it comes to the story, in my opinion. Why would we all leave the vault together to *just* grief each other and break and steal what our fellow vault dwellers have?
---
So, it is possible assuming you devote 100% of your play time to crafting nothing but ammunition.  To what end?  Prove that you can be banned for ammocrafting?
---
My mate once killed a radscorpion and assumed he just buried it upon kill like an occasional ghoul. He found it on a roof of a shed that was at least 20 sec walk lol so worth checking the parameter I guess
---
I got mine from Corn Flakes. /s
---
It’s my self portrait 
---
you will get sick of shit loot because of the way enemies spawn pretty much anywhere else.
---
I’m surprised this hasn’t happened already. I think this is what Bethesda had intended to happen more or less. Perhaps when player vendors come, there’ll be some more development to encourage this. Would love a place where you could build, like a workshop, but only placing vendors or something. Places we could stand indicating we’re trading. 
---
I'm not surprised the apologists are here.  People can't express any anger, disappointment or frustration with the beloved Bethesda without someone coming in and saying that it isn't Bethesda's fault.   Except when it comes to mods, Bethesda enables the mods in the first place.  They benefit from the mod community fixing their problems, among other things.  Expecting Bethesda to work with the mod community to even a small degree isn't too much to ask.  Instead they cut things out with no warning. Not cool.
---
Don't feel sorry for me dude, I spend my time having fun playing good video games. I know these cleaver and witty roasts are going over your head, but just because you like FO76 which is a low effort game, doesn't mean your comments should be so low effort too. Come on, show me your better than Bethesda, put some effort on your roasts. Have some creativity, I know that's hard to understand since Fo76 has none, but that doesn't mean you should be as bland as FO76. 
---
This would only work if the friend hasn't gotten the quest from the BoS line yet. Once you've received it the game always consolidates tech data to a single item.
---
I guess I can help, but I am only level 30, so any lv 30 t51b power armor that you have laying around would be helpful

*I just want to be able to sell my junk ammo. That’s all I ask.*

I specifically checked this today. I had 10 flux that were at almost full health when I logged out yesterday. When I logged in today they were almost completely spoiled. I think the spoil function is inconsistent. I have also had food that did not spoil while logged out.
---
Sounds like this is the norm now and she is not even worth the time.... The hordes around her are more profitable than her in my opinion....I have seen groups of lvl 200+ fail at taking her down now, I am not going to try at lvl 68...
---
Only if the mods actually make good on what they said in the Banned Megathread and confine discussion to that thread. So far they seem content to let people make shitposts that top the front page and continue fanning the flames.
---
On XB1 you can already go to "recent players" and rejoin a server after a client side crash. This would simply eliminate a couple steps.
---
Agreed on opening up mods for all platforms. Once FO76 has private servers available and modding is allowed on those servers, hopefully they will open up XB1 and PS4 for modding. Until then, don't expect any support for mods from Bethesda.
---
There are plenty of people lobbying for changes from Bethesda already. And I chime in with upvotes and comments on some of them already. However, other than that, there's not much I can do there. However, for PC modes, I *can* do something. I'm a software guy and a FO4 mod author, so I can help with PC. So, I'm going to focus on making the PC experience the best it can be. PC has always been the meta for Creation Engine (CE) games (Fallout, Skyrim, etc), because the mods that are available on the Nexus fix bugs Bethesda doesn't, make the games so much better with QoL features like Perk Loadout Manager and Better Inventory, and add so much great content. Personally, when it comes to CE games, Because of that, I would never play CE games on any other platform other than PC.

The 900 hours guy used a main account and an alt for muling he said so himself, he never said he multiboxed a full team, as if he did that would blow his all ready stupid argument that he is supposedly a normal legit player even farther out of the water.
---
Also love that your source is so anecdotal that it litterally dosent even bother with math, it just said "look what I've supposedly done with multiboxing" but provides 0 evidence or even math as to how this is done, and that's ontop of even the fact that the original 900 hour guy said his alt was for storage not a multibox. both would of required at the very least similar amounts of ammo but one has nearly 500k more rounds.
---
Do everyone a favor and use math and reasoning not "look someone said something therefore they are right" I'm not saying it's impossible not by any means, but people need to realize he iether put in a stupid amount of hours just getting the materials assuming he did it legit(it's also very possible he stockpiled flux just to hemorage it this month but I doubt that hoarders  gonna hoard) and evrything he posted about on his own post was true, or he like many people only duped(or was given) a nest egg of a few thousand of all the rare materials/consumables and made the mistake of crafting too much in one month.
---
Absolutely true. The servers used to be full all the time...
---
I don't think it's working properly for me but maybe I should do more testing. I swear I only get 350 XP regardless of how many I pick up in the Enclave bunker.
---
I'm looking and it's code and name changes. I'm not seeing a specific nerf.
---
Now that you mention it, I did have one question whose answer really seems to demonstrate that Bethesda is sincerely attempting to differentiate itself from the GTA’s out there. 
---
Is there a way to access your PvP K/D ratio anywhere either in the game or in Bethesda.net?
---
Very tough to legitimately acquire 100k+ ultracite ammo. A good nuke run at prime would land me 5 to 6 stable violet flux. That means I would have to do 15000 to 20000 prime nuke runs while server hopping. Rare is putting it mildly 
---
I've only encountered a griefer breaking camps once in my entire time (also in Xbox). My base is out of the way, but I generally leave my door open.
---
I have a full size tree and large garden inside my highly visible, 4-story brick base, so I get a lot of curious people and thumbs ups.
---
I think Redditors are hypersensitive about strangers in the game, 99% of the people I meet in game are nice.
---
Might have something to do with banning 33% of the playerbase and another 33% of the playerbase losing interest. 
---
I know, seems they banned 3/4 of the player base lol
---
Didn't 3 games release this week?
---
It's possible *in a week* if you devote 100% of your time to ammo crafting. Extrapolating from that, doing so in a 30 day period wouldn't require an unbelievable amount of effort, certainly not for someone who plays the game so much.
---
I'm not going to read it for you.
---
The server is always full when I’m playing.
---
You can’t apply your perception to everyone’s experience as the only truth.
---
You're fucking ridiculous. It's up to the mod author to fix this, end of story. 
---
Are you on PS4?  If so I'd be more than happy to join you in fighting the queen sometime, I just need a while to do some farmimg first.
---
&gt; You're still going to hit 25k caps eventually
---
How? I barely keep 300-400, sometimes dipping below 100, just due to fast traveling around and having to pay for it. Maybe I'm just bad at playing the economy part of this game, but given that I'm still that low at level 60+, and spent most of levels 1-40 at under 100 caps barely keeping up with fast travel costs and occasional plan or junk purchases from the vendors, I don't see myself ever hitting one thousand caps, much less 25 thousand. With the low amounts of caps vendors give for goods you sell them and low caps drop rates, I'm not sure how people get enough caps to even engage in the kind of high cost trade with other players being discussed in this post. Which means most casual players won't bother with it, and will never hit that max caps limit.
---
u/ladydevann ???
---
Well I somehow got rid of my tse shotgun. 
---
I've never heard of this. Do you have a screenshot?
---
I’ll get back to you because I can’t remember which one, but there’s a certain train station that he has a chance to spawn at. Sadly you actually have to server hop to do it, but it’s how my friend did it more efficiently. 
---
I'm pissed
---
RTFPN
---
Because everyone got bored. I haven't played in almost 2 months because once I got to level 110 and had the loot I wanted it was pointless. I'm a melee build and past the all rise there wasn't much of a need to farm for a better melee weapon. The SBQ got boring real fast, the server hopping got boring, farming white springs got boring. Honestly, I just get bored when I think about logging back in. There is no more end game content to be played.
---
Its not my perception, I counted the players on my servers today... None of them were close to full so apparently their is more then 1 truth
---
I wasn't sold an incomplete CoD game full of bugs and devoid of content.  I spew hate about FO76 because I paid full price for this game and received a buggy, incomplete mess.  I'm a big fan of the franchise but being sold this mess is a slap in the face.  At least with CoD I can expect a polished game albeit one not to my tastes.  FO76 is a full of bugs, lacking lasting content to keep me playing, and has a serious lack of polish that is shameful for a AAA game in 2018.
---
Oh yeah that's true
---
Nah, I can't help it, I see you dumb twats repeating the same shit you hear back as some truism, completely unaware and apparently unable to form actual opinions on things.  I weep for the future of the race, because you are the perfect example of the reduction of the complex being that are humans to a simple consume and regurgitate cycle.  You are the perfect example of the regression of humanity into weakness and stupidity.
---
Lol. You counted the players on your server mid day there for the game us dying.
---
Just stop.
---
Yeah we tried that, I don't likr not having crafting plans so jow the secojdary character is only good for me to eventually get those 8 fusion cores I gave them back.
---
Did you just come up with 33% banned or is that actual numbers?
---
I guess patch and notes this week are good enough ,can't expect more from Bethesda I guess
---
By that rationale, wake up those awesome FO modders and lets see FO76 SBBE and Busty. ☺️
---
&gt; ***aqccuired*** way too much Ultracite ammo to have feasibly been attained legitimately
---
Not as good as a "Rejoin server", but recently I found that if you try server hopping a decent percentage of the time you are brought back to the server you where in. I think this is ether by design in a recent patch or by less players playing.
---
Also you can just server hop till you get back to the server you where on. This is also much easier to do recently.
---
Thanks for the confirmation that it is fixed. Please post any comments, questions, kudos, you have about the spreadsheet on the other thread. Enjoy!
---
I used to take 4 or 5, since they were empty. I'd never defend unless I needed food or scrap a d then server hop and do it again. This got me through my 20s and early 30s pretty fast. Now that I'm aware that this opens pvp up to me, I haven't hit a single workshop on weeks. No one ever challenged my workshops and the few times I saw people they asked nicely to use anything in the workshop. Never any pvp. 
---
If you server hop before turning them it resets the hidden “count” to 1.
---
I make sure to only pick up none or one if I plan on server hopping at Enclave a few times looking for good X01 mods during my vendor run.
---
I never once said the game is dying, I still enjoy it. Now you're putting words in my mouth.
---
I will not stop.
---
I sell you one? What do you offer?
---
It is not impossible. Do you even play the game?
---
The devs have no reason to work around some guys mod honestly. If they want the feature in the game, they will add it. Yeah it sucks and the current system is a boring chore to use, I agree. 
---
I think a huge reason why bethesda wont work with modders or use their ideas, it a legal/rights issue. Even if they have permission form the modder, there is still the risk for the company that the modder will cause legal issues by claiming that beth stole their code. They would need to write up a contract and have the modder sign it in person before even trying to implement their mod or they could get sued(I think, im not a lawer or anything. Once again, this is just what I think, im not sure). That would be a huge hassle i bet.
---
I got a couple of good 3 stars there today.
---
They aren’t the good guy, but neither is the person that exploits the software. It is impossible to make a game without some exploitable areas.  Perfection is incredibly expensive and if you exploit the game, you deserved to be punished. 
---
I've had so many people run away or server hop when I go anywhere near their base. 1 time I was dropping items for a lower level and he left. The other time I ran over to save a guys base from mutants and he logged out when he saw me shooting near his base. I get there are jerks that just like to destroy things to troll, but too often people are so skittish they wont stick around long enough to find out. My base has only been griefed one time in 250+ hours, and I'm right off a main road near Mononga Power.
---
Ive joined in at 70 a couple times since the latest, I know my role is pretty much crowd control. I go around trying to keep the adds off the heavy hitters so they can do there job, then break out my normal Dragon to do what I can to the Queen herself.
---
Since the update, Ive never seen her below 75%, even without the people hiding in the shed and the team being 150+
---
Your trying to make a statement that applies to everyone. 
---
You’re right. Continue being stupid. Lol
---
&gt;We have determined that this account has acquired over 100,000 (one hundred thousand) of one or more rare in-game items **within 30 days of game play**.
---
- Bethesda
---
The awful design of the perk system in general was obfuscated for me by this amazing mod. Now I'm no longer picking high level locks (swap out a level 3 card for 3 non-sequential lock picking perks? ugh), searching for extra food/meds and am frustrated as hell when I want to swap to my various camp/crafting perks. If I had multiple weapon setups I would probably down to just using one... oh right, I am. It's not even worth swapping to my explosives setup for using a TSE to clear packs.
---
This needs to be made baseline. And not in a "we disabled the mod and did a terrible job aping it's functionality" but as similar as possible.
---
If there is I haven't found it. I wouldn't mind being able to see a stats screen like FO4. We know they're keeping track of all that stuff, but the only way to see it is the challenges sheet.
---
I have these equipped but still breaks fast
---
Proof that he was a duper?
---
Let the good time roll! 🤣
---
I got bannee and never duped before help
---
How did my statement apply to everyone, I expressed how I feel about the game I'm playing. Your just being the only ignorant prick on this entire post.
---
You can't compain about getting drills and chalk from her, if you can't take her down.
---
yes
---
Oh thank god, you finally put some thought into a roast, I was beginning to think I was having fun with a bag of shit. Shame it took you this long to do so, you could have been much more fun if you tried this hard from the start. 
---
But hey, let's end it nicely with some good old irony. You ready?
---
Aww chucks Princess, no need to get your panties all tussled up over me. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings so much. Tough it out muffin ;)
---
We want the slot!
---
At level 60+ you can easily get 1400 caps a day from the vendors. You can reduce your travel costs with the Travel Agent perk and by sensible base placement/workshop ownership. There are plenty of posts and Youtube vids explaining how to optimise this with very little effort.
---
When you buy anything from a vendor make sure you have the Hard Bargain perk equipped and use a Grape Mentat + Beer to get it cheaper.
---
Huh?
---
At best I was discussing the plausibility of someone genuinely reaching the numbers quoted and have since seen the updated story unfold and retracted any sentiment towards the outed cheat. 
---
It has been documented that people at the top end of game time/level are often accused rightly or wrongly of cheating. That is isn’t something unique to FO76. 
---
You’re too stupid to even realize what you wrote.
---
You posted yesterday that you were banned, but you say you counted people on the server today. Riiiiight.

My wife is back from visiting family and my college work has increased. I have a lack of time, now. :(
---
I love a raider complaining about not getting enough cooperation from other random players.
---
I stay out of SBQ fights for now so I understand the frustration you experience of having other players mess up what you set up. But I also think it’s hilarious for someone with raider flair to complain about essentially the best way for low-level players to grief level 100+ players. Hey- they are just playing the game as intended. This is just their role-playing. Welcome to the wasteland, get used to it. It’s part of the game- you should expect it. Maybe you should’ve stayed in the vault. (Insert other ‘git gud’ snark you hear from raiders talking about their play style)
---
I sympathize with your point (and generally agree that a level cap would be a good idea) but I also find it hilarious that this is how lowbies can epically troll high level players.  
---
And when I do venture into that SBQ fight, best believe I’m gonna be firing on all cylinders (and the beast will still probably just fly away). That’s the wasteland for you ;)
---
I finally finished it when I found a bunch of the liberator robots spawning. they were on the links behind and to the right of the club house (when facing it) 
---
Id go there myself and they wouldnt spawn. Ive heard some people had a buddy make a toon, lvl to 10 and head over to spawn them, then you come in to mop them up.
---
Maybe the robots are a key since theyre low lvl.
---
Yes, actually.
---
On Feb 12 I stumbled across the SBQ while I was looking to see a nuke land. I figured since I was there is try and help out. There was about 10 people there and managed to kill her. Tried three times since then and have never managed to get her health below half way. 
---
I donated to the mod author yesterday, I hope he is able to find a workaround and get the mod working again.  Playing yesterday was super annoying without it.....
---
Crafting is one of my favorite parts of the FO/ES games. Making it a more viable part of the endgame would be fantastic.
---
That doesn't even bother me nearly as much as the guy that just shoves a bunch of stuff on top of a floating ladder 
---
I don't disagree with your view, I'm 1000% on your side.  Mods are ridiculously great, and Bethesda owes the mod community a great deal of gratitude.
---
My view/opinion is this:  The FO76 crew is hobbled, probably on purpose (YT a bit, the theory is a bit long to post here).  I don't think they are working *against* anyone, I think they're just understaffed to handle the job.  They're not withing *with* the modders because they can't spare the time...I believe they'd love to if they could.
---
Give than (and it's not a given, but it's what I think), they certainly don't have time to go to the trouble of sabotaging mods/modders.  And they (as you point out) have no good reason to.  They're not working to break mods any more than they are working to preserve them - it's just not on their radar right now.  They can't keep up with the basics of running the game, much less spite projects.
---
(I'm also giving them the benefit of the doubt that they're competent - it's arguable that this is incorrect, and that they just suck.  I don't believe that, but it would also go a long way to explaining things).
---
Again, just my opinion on the whole situation.  I have a really good understanding about how development works, but absolutely no insight into Bethesda in particular, so it's all just my feelings on the matter.
---
It's okay if you don't know how. I'm not very good either.
---
Exactly, I have a basic Lvl 45 with a silencer and its hands down better than any of the other sniper rigs I had
---
Damn I’ve been there
---
I know exactly what I wrote. Again you're just a dick.
---
This is what reddit is for, to express how you feel in words and to listen to see other peoples opinions in there posts. 
---
Then there are people like you who are just assholes for no reason, congrats on that.
---
I did have my area mike on but never heard anything from the two.
---
They are and it’s annoying 
---
Just want to add my comment on this thread :  Bethesda you are a bunch of assholes.  That is all.
---
Is it actually bugged, or is it just because they changed how it worked?
---
Yes,I have more then one psn friend.
---
Yes, he mention the Ultracite ammo.
---
Request sent :)
---
And hard to click where you are trying to go sometimes
---
I'll say it again anytime someone feels like starting one of these topics - please just stop talking about Youtubers.  All you're doing is gaining them more attention even if its in a bad way - they live for this and OP's just feeding the fire.
---
The average player/person has NO clue what these Youtubers are saying whatsoever - its you people who continue to talk about them that will get others curious to check out what the fuss is all about.
---
How does the mule story make any more sense? I'm pretty sure the Jim sterling video mentions that he was using Bandolier for the weight reduction at which point most ammo is weightless or only hits 1lb per 1000 rounds at the heaviest.
---
And even if he was muling the ammo why pass it back and forth so much? He makes the ammo on his main, passes it to the mule for storage and then withdraws some when he's running out. That should be it.
---
But even that doesn't make any sense because the majority of the ammo is recorded on the mule and not on his main. He mentions the mule being low level which is why he claims people report him for being a duper so If he were crafting the ammo himself, passing it off to the mule and then withdrawing it when needed then the ammo would be passing through his main twice and the mule once which would mean the amount recorded on the main should be larger not the other way around. 
---
Well at least you get to spend time with your wife!  Hope that is a good thing atleast.
---
Just keep server hopping on Whitesprings clubhouse. The bastards spawn more than often than I'd like em to.
---
I ran a treasure hunting play through the other day. this site never removed the map from my inventory (not sure if took a different one or not, I didn't keep that close of track). I could re-harvest the spot, but I also haven't been back since to see if that map still triggers the dig spot.
---
V.A.T.S. discussion aside,  I agree there is almost no purpose to being a crafter in this game.  Yes you can mod legendary items, but its not that big a deal.  There should be items that only high level crafters can make and trade to other players. 
---
Guy makes a generalization about a game that has had multiple failings in how it treats it's players and community- He is an idiot.
---
Subreddit makes a generalization about a guy who correctly covered every other fo76 issue and has been an ally to consumers of this game- X
---
Solve for X
---
Thank God for Jim Sterling
---
Alright, lets hug it out then.
---
Cheers mate.
---
That "one corner " is where we are supposed to drop our 1st nuke as far as the story goes. 
---
If it is, they've really missed the mark. Ammo drops like candy from a ton of sources.
---
Ultracite ammo is a different matter since it doesn't drop from anywhere, but that's yet another case of things missing the mark. As far as I understand the Anti-Scorched receivers are generally regarded as not worth it.
---
Have you thought about using other big guns aside from the gatling? Like having extra ones in your arsenal? 
---
I usually run a gatling, minigun, and .50 cal just so I can keep flipping through them for different situations 
---
These are great!  The lighting in that asylum pic is especially on point.  Where did you find a cat?
---
I'm sure they are aware of it. Nothing gets fixed over night. 
---
I don't blame the author or anyone helping him.  I lay the blame at Bethesda's feet for their on-going series of "unintended consequences" as they break things left and right.  This time they take something major away from the modding community.   Sure allowing network access could be a security vulnerability.  It would have been fairly trivial to lock it down without disabling it completely.   A server controlled allow list, could have been a start, instead of disabling network access completely.  They could allow network access on a case by case basis and they could control the whitelist. 
---
QR codes only work for people that have a way to read them.  (Most will, but not everyone.)  As a suggestion:  Consider using a URL shortening service.  If you can ask the Dev, how much space do the perk config files take up?  I am assuming they are very small and even if there are thousands of them, it doesn't take up that much space.  If you can fit them on a Google Drive, a short url could be generated for each user's config file on the fly and displayed to the user.  Only that user sees their generated short url and they can manually download their config file that way.   There are other hosting options that can work in conjunction with a url shortening service.  
---
Then again, if there is a need to go with the QR code, then perhaps there is an online converter that could process the screenshot and output the text for users that don't have mobile devices.    I think that might be what you were referring to in the scan/screenshot part and it took me a minute to figure out the implication there.
---
The other way:  Display a Unique ID to the user in-game and provide them a URL.  Plug the UID into the website and have the website spit out the text file.  Loading config files into a database keyed by some username / UID is pretty easy.
---
Just some thoughts for the brainstorming.   
---
I noticed this last week before the recent patch, particularly corn and tato. Even razor grain, which used to last quite a while.
---
I've never had liberators spawn? What level were you when it happened?
---
Trying to hit them in VATS is pure Fallout 76
---
Holy hell that bugs me.
---
Although, I like to think my giant frowny face is dissuading anyone from trying to take my workshops.
---
That's a very good idea. Thanks.
---
I've been slightly irked because in my experience there have been a ton of low level players hanging out at white springs causing the mobs to be low level. I got stuck on this quest like a month ago, now it's level 14 golfer ghouls everywhere for me.
---
Sound mate I will add you 
---
I got something 
---
As far as I could tell it is actually bugged. My damage on my Shishkebab could barely crack 500-600 with nerd rage active last night. 
---
It typically is over double that. Again, I didn’t test the workaround to see if it works or not due to time constraints and only logged in to check and see if I had been effected. 
---
Also if you have an nvidia card you can add an fps display from the nvidia geforce experience
---
Can it be after 4pm est?
---
Might be easier to explain what hasn't changed instead
---
Out of all of the crappy reddit references and jokes, this one actually made me laugh. GJ, soldier.
---
Love and kisses, you weren't as bad as I expected you to be. Have fun with FO76, not many of us can, but don't let that stop you from having yours. 
---
I only asked for this like 4 months ago.
---
If you're running into Anglers then you've probably gone too far north. The Toxic Wastes are extremely dangerous for low levels. Stick to the Forest area until level 20 if you want an easier life.
---
I did this the whole night to no avail. Thanks tho 
---
You might want to go back and look who posted that, aten_ra isn't just "some no name said it" he is one of the most trusted and active members innthis community.
---
I don't know where you got this idea he said he only played his main character and had a mule, his post clearly states he has 3 characters he mutiboxes (which is completely allowed, multiboxing isn't an exploit or hack). He said he has the 3 characters he plays and his mule. I'm not sure how you misunderstood what he said in his post. Third paragraph in he talks about how he plays 3 characters at a time and has a mule too.
---
As for the numbers go look at the post not just the comment. The post itself has the numbers.
---
Some people claim that clearing and reacquiring mutations fixed it, others that it triggers off of hunger now. I have seen the hunger part some of the time, not always, and I have not tried clearing and reapplying mutations.
---
I dont know what triggers them, but ive been there a couple times and its all diseased robots instead of the normal mobs
---
Im honestly so sick of hearing the term "Outrage"
---
it seems EVERYONE on the internet is OUTRAGED!!!!!! about something...
---
Also detestable is the coupling of the term with "sparks"  i.e. "Person sparks outrage by having opinion"
---
i think if i won the lottery, i'd retire to some little cabin by a lake, get off the grid, and never have to read/listen/watch another internet "hot take" on a current issue
---
I think you're reading too much into my statement. It's not to be taken litterily my friend. 
---
Also, I make good money as well, and never in my life can i rationalize having a spare $300 to blow on bullshit like that. 
---
I'm curious. What kind of job (save the wealthy) would a entire grown man have to have that would  have $300 seen as spare when purchasing computer generated clothing?
---
I can understand 10 to maybe 20 dollars. 
---
(Henceforth the Atomic shop are creation club)
---
And i get it..... Its a free country. 
---
But just because you can do,something, doesn't mean that its not a stupid choice. And thats my whole point. 
---
I hear you. Just would like a simple “hey guys we’re aware of it, it’s being looked at.”
---
Spewed my coffee on my desk. Have some silver.
---
The Marine Tactical Helmet should still be able to be crafted, it's plans are available in the wild.  I think the other one is called Marine Armor Helmet and that required people glitching into the Dev Room.  That one, I'm guessing, was removed.
---
In Confederate Hat news...my main character learned the plan pre-patch had it glitch and it's not in the list of craftables.  I had extra plans and learned it on a new character post-patch, he can craft the Confederate Hat. 
---
Afaik only ultracite ammo (prime receiver on a gun) will make a difference on the SBQ. Zealots effect and scorch killer only works on the scorched. 
---
Tybber42 specializes in being a dick to anyone who has any complaint about the game. 
---
Yep, pretty much same boat here for me!
---
True - that build can easily move into PA, but their unarmed output takes her down so much quicker - the fastest fights post all the TSE nerfs for me have always been from Drop Site V9 out of the nuke zone when non-PA players show up.  When the whole crew shows up in PA, those fights just take longer overall.
---
Aw, sensitive little guy
---
This one specifically has been bugged for a while. I believe it's improperly linked to map 4 and will consume that map. It's literally a typo in the code they havent fixed. 
---
I’ve got a 1* 2 Shot Gauss, and it’s the bees knees. Only thing preventing me from replacing my hunting rifle with it is a lack of a suppressor.
---
*Keeping in mind DLC are supposed to be free. Just in case anyone didn't know that.
---
Not to mention the logistics involved in coordinating 3 separate running instances of the game. Even if you're using macros and synced controls that takes skill.
---
Well, ill be a raider when pvp is a real thing. For now i just support. I have 2 different characters. 
---
Let's do it, lol.
---
i played it, alot , as a kid.
---
it was not good.
---
although the "cia/govt guys" following you did create a sense of tension like the resident evil guy following you the whole game
---
Can craft it on a character who learned it after the patch.  But my pre-patch toon also still can't craft the Confederate Hat.
---
While under level 50 I have participated in countless successful SBQ events, having leveled up multiple alts with different builds, only with a hazmat suit. I ,have taken out lots of adds, contributed many VATS wingshots with measurable results, and shared with melee. I have never hidden. Regular weapons absolutely can do significant damage if they are backed up with good builds, perks, and training.  There have been many posts since release describing how to kill the SBQ with standard weapons.
---
The problem is the lazy, selfish behaviour of the freeloaders.  I have seen plenty of higher level players hiding.  Instead of a level cap I prefer your suggestion that queen DR doesn't scale with number of players.  The best solution would be that players at any level get no XP or loot unless they have contributed a significant threshold level of damage.  
---
Not sure what a server browser would do besides you picking a server with not that many people on it. They try to fill servers.
---
You know, if you nuke crops, you get flux.... just nuke a farm.
---
There are also a bunch of dupers who never got banned
---
I've found two suppressed Gauss rifles this past week. One with a night vision scope. Such badassery. 
---
I'd argue online games ban anyone that dupes...
---
yeah, i knew some one would bring this up.  the acid we are using is for explosives and smelting.  not a chemist, but it seems to me, plastic is not a good idea.
---
reason?

It's a gross exaggeration. I would be shocked if it was more than 4% of the playerbase. Everyone is whining and claiming innocence, but that isn't gonna change the fact they are cheaters.
---
5-6 bags behind R&amp;G building (cliff side) as well.
---
I usually ran there, and then grabbed the 8 gnomes on the south side of Huntersville.
---
I don't disregard your POV here.  I just have a hard time seeing any team as being so blind to their unintended consequences as this one appears to be.  (I'm not even referring to mods here... the game in general is full of things that are screwed up because they tried to fix something else and broke something in the process.  Yes that does happen, but it shouldn't be happening this frequently regardless of the size of the team.   I think it has become clear that their version control system and their quality control is completely inadequate or possibly non-existent with how they published old code with old bugs that had already been fixed.   That is not how a small team makes headway on development.  That's how they walk backwards with their eyes closed.)
---
Yeah i tried but 50 cal and minigun are ammo eaters tbh.  That why i use a gatling gun.  I do unarmed with a deathclaw hand but with power armor on i cant use it. 
---
Out your shit in your stash, if I see a bag as I go by I'm taking it.
---
every time i play, i end up being the only person in the server.
---
The pvp penalty system is garbage. Friendly pvp is taxed at 50% by the game meaning if my group of 8 wants to spar a 4 on 4 for pvp practice we need to grind our 1200 daily alotted caps for less than an hours worth of pvp echange before we start "losing caps". 
---
What we started doing is leaving 1 player out of both groups and sparring at that players base. We destroy a wall giving us a 10 cap bounty so when we die in friendly pvp the cap loss is lessened.its lame because we end up destroying someones base after an hour! 
---
Next time we will use some random players base i guess. Thanks for forcing us to grief bethesda?
---
All to protect the carebears...
---
Did any of you do the math for yourself or are you doing what everyone else does?
---
What are you talking about lol? First, your lying and because I have played since day one and still play occasionally collecting rare outfits from events, I have experianced damn near every issue  those evil youtubers talked about. I have blue screened probably 1500 times, lagged out missions, and on and on. All my friends have quit the game, and the worst part is it shouldnt be like this in the first place.
---
Second, the stupid movie reference is dumb. I want a good fallout game that isnt shady and is actually successful, not a movie. I can do both because im successful in life unlike apparently some people on here that cant do both.
---
have you...brushed your teeth lately? maybe its just really bad breath
---
Hmm. There's a lot more comments on this post about people agreeing with the youtubers than I thought there would be...  Guess it's a legit decisive topic people care about.
---
I'm assuming it's a safety measure to prevent greifers from dumping their caps on an alt and killing people for the Lols. How much caps did you have before you died and how much was your bounty. 
---
Aha, I did not know this. Thank you for sharing!
---
Whitesprings during nuke events is a no no for me.  I almost always freeze out and have to log back in again, sometimes more than once.  I don't seem to have this issue at other nuke zones. 
---
On this subreddit was a post saying that unstoppables looked like a p2w 
---
Apparently flat woods has near 50 bags around the town if you look around.  Haven’t tested that it it was a previous post.
---
I love it when I jump in a horde to save a noob, get killed just as the last one drops and have him sack my bag and run. 
---
I'm not banned and  you must be crazy to find the clearly mindless repetitive content in this game fun enough to continue playing, I feel for you/hope you are trolling.
---
My camp is open so anyone can walk in and use anything, that's something I really don't care about and I think we should do in the game.  In fact I have stash box items outside my building for folks to use if they don't want to enter my building. 
---
I did get jumped on day when I was crafting at my camp which does feed my paranoia a little . Typical story you see here on Reddit, spent a lot of time "un-crouched" so my pip showed little movement on the big map in an isolated region.  I'm pretty sure the guy saw that and tried to sneak up on what he thought was someone AFK.  My buddies killed him but only after he got me.  I stay passive all the time but my buddy wasn't so after the guy hit him and he reciprocated I lost my passive protection and he blasted me. All I lost was a little junk and a few caps but it was a good lesson to learn from.
---
too large and unattractive. looks like a placeholder for broken image url
---
I had the most random encounter yesterday on the greens at Whitesprings while building my base. Two lvl 100+ were wearing cop uniforms identifying themselves as cops looking dirty dupers. They had the best south park cop accent too. They felt me up and frisked me several times but I was cleared of any duping. Great times.
---
I have not heard of this, if there are though I have never found a single one.
---
I'll have to look into this more and share it with my friends... thank you for sharing :)
---
Wat
---
Sound like we both need to put our shit up for sale. 
---
Use another persons stupidity to pay our actual "real world" bills. 
---
😆
---
right?! I agree, and if you want to do pvp then do pvp on the pvp server.
---
I completely agree.  Some of the workshop aspects need to be altered some. Yesterday I was trying to take it from someone and somehow he wasnt flagged for pvp but was contesting it. I was doing slap damage but neither of us where gaining any movement twords caping it. Luckily for me a grenade from a super mutant killed him and I was able to capture it. I do think if people arent in the build area they should not be flagged tho. 
---
Oh shit yeah, I never thought about unarmed with PA 
---
That's primarily why I use the gatling gun too, just got keep making those bullets man. Maybe set up your base near a lead deposit so you can start banking those materials 
---
Ok, that's seriously weird, although well within the possibilities of Bethesda's spaghetti coding. Makes me wonder if Serendipity increases the damage of anything else. Maybe test Scorchbeast sonic spam or exploding cars.
---
He's always one for a kneejerk look at me style reaction
---
*his disdain of exploiters in his threads from months ago*
---
Don't they also say people that cheat on their spouses typically act like cheaters are the scum of the Earth too?  That don't mean shit...
---
I disagree with you, summarily with the simple fact that they have already incorporated other mods into the game itself (Known Plans Mod was incorporated into the game itself.)    
---
I do agree that a company has to be careful with usage rights and copyright, but I would be shocked if they weren't already covered by the terms of service agreement itself.  I suspect that any mods to their game become "fair game" for them the moment you agree to the terms. 
---
Worst case scenario:  They simply have to see what terms the mods are released under.   Many modders for Fallout 4 were hoping that Bethesda would use their mod because they were focused on fixing many of the bugs and issues that Bethesda simply walked away from.
---
Bottom line:  I think the truth is somewhere in between those two extremes.
---
I appreciate someone who just plops their benches down in the middle of nowhere more than that.
---
Im pretty sure your 8 players can listen to the PvP radio station and PvP for free, or do one of the PvP events. There's no need bitch about people just because they don't like pvp. It's a fallout game first, if you want to play a game that caters more to PvP then find a different game.
---
When I quit Lineage 2 years ago I sold my account and gear for around $6,000. In that game it tended to be US military personnel that spent big as they tried to catch up on game time they had lost when on deployment. $300 is absolutely nothing to some people so I don't see why you would think it's a "stupid choice" for everyone just because you feel it would be for you.
---
My discord group did, because it stacked when using unique costumes and made group PvP more tolerable.
---
Same issue here.
---
It took about 1 1/2 hours just now to kill the SBQ with \~10 players. Massive waste of ammo and time.  
---
Must have come with the new patch. Time for a hotfix here, Bethesda!
---
It's just ridiculous how entitled everyone is here. Like are you losing sleep u til you find out they are looking into this bug? 
---
Of course they are. People on this sub are such spoiled annoying little bitches man.
---
The 76 community is like nothing I've ever seen in my life. 
---
It would have a huge effect on how people play the game. 
---
People, like myself, don't prioritise capturing workshops despite how valuable they are. Why not? Because you could just be DC'ed from a server and all your hard work getting them is lost. Being able to join a server after crashing could mean you keep those workshops, and any other progress in that world. 
---
Ever launch a nuke only to crash as soon as it hits? Well if you play solo, sorry all your work was for nothing if you can't get back to that server. 
---
Not to mention, it would create "communities" on certain servers of like-minded people. Interaction &amp; last decisions is what this game need to thrive and it doesn't exactly have that in the current state. 
---
lol, maybe i can trasnfer one of my spare plans and relarn it gona give that a trie
---
I did the quest when I was boosting a level 9 in my group, only me and him around and we seemed to get them spawn pretty often. Not sure if this helps or not.
---
The Marine Armor Helmet is still craftable. The Confederate Hat is not, whether you found and learned the plan before patch 6 or if you found an learned it post patch. That has been reported by everyone. You are the first person to post that you can craft the Confederate Hat. Are you sure?
---
The difference here is.... I don't really want to pvp, I just play default alone unpacifist mode.
---
If I run into this problem here by just following "Goals" then.... thats sort of a big deal
---
I would just like to thank everyone who committed.  I appreciate the feedback.  It is interesting to see peoples views on this topic as I see different post about the severity of the current greifer problem in the game.
---
What annoys me are other men that think they have to try and assert some kind of dominance and want to squeeze like they're giving birth.
---
You received your bounty for "Stealing" another player's Air Drop.  If you watched closely before you picked the lock, it would say "Steal From".
---
You received a bankruptcy penalty for not having enough caps to pay the bounty when someone claimed it.  I actually did not know they implemented this, but it is a welcome change (for now at least) since people would rack up large bounties by killing/griefing players and then not carry any caps on them.  They get killed, drop no bounty, and the wanted status is wiped clear with no penalty.
---
Nah, mate, they will just go on to the next game. There's always a new game to be mad at.
---
Yep :)  It looks like the welcome mat we can put down in our camps, but is actually a fast travel landing spot. Whichever direction the pointy end of the map is facing is what direction you'll be facing when you fast travel in.
---
My bet on "less than their level".
---
Yeah, because it is too much to ask that the developers include that functionality in the game itself.  The current perk system without that mod just works so smoothly and has zero problems, nutjob.
---
There is a concrete node at the workshop in flatwoods.  Easy as pie . Perfectly preserved pie!
---
So you think that's okay though? That Kotick makes millions upon millions, Activision brags about having its most profitable year, then fires 200 people? That's okay to you?
---
Don't know how much my bounty was (had a 10 after opening that airdrop) (Don't know if it went up after killing that other bounty player.)
---
Death bags should be marked as owned and put you into pvp with the person you stole from.
---
REBUILDING AMERICA... AS A PIG
---
I love seeing people's creativity btw it gets so bizarre, makes my day
---
FO76 is my first fallout that I’ve gotten into! I hit level 50 then bought FO4 and I honestly enjoy just as much, if not, more :D
---
I saw that red sign WAAAAAAY back in Fallout 3 when The Pitt first came out. It's where there are missing textures or items that it's trying to call up. Maybe you need a fresh install of the game.
---
Interesting. Wonder how it proc'ed.
---
Get a god damn note pad and right down your perk loadout until the MOD AUTHOR fixes THEIR MOD. It takes what? 3 minutes to shuffle the cards manually?
---
A Chargeback is basically a forced refund through your credit card company. No dealing with sony, just make a phone call and say "I can no longer access this product".
---
I hate that you're right, but right none the less. Have an upvote!
---
I want everyone to have access to this.   Did you just read the OP title and reply?   I said, " How many others think that the functionality of that mod should have just been built into the game from the very first day? "
---
So, yes, I DO want the console players to have this too.
---
Also, I thought Bethesda said early on that mods would be available on all platforms.  They haven't lived up to that yet.
---
I'm on PC and I use an SSD and the load times are brutal. Even exiting a building ( long load ) then re-entering the same building requires a long load time. Possibly better optimization on consoles because the hardware is more standard.
---
haven't found ANY paint skins in over 100 hours of play. I do appreciate the added stash limit with the latest update
---
"I was griefed once so Bethesda should redesign their entire game from the ground up." 
---
No.
---
Views, voting regardless if it's down or up, and commenting on Youtube videos actually makes it recommended to more people thanks to the majestic youtube algorithm preferring to recommend engaging topics.  
---
If it's something you genuinely don't want people to see - don't click on it at all.
---
I love just going through people’s bases and seeing the building because I’m a builder myself. But being level 100+ people get scared of me but it’s understandable :(
---
BOS Recon rifles?!? What is this and where did you find it?
---
I wanted to add that the posters literally mean "junk".  I think some people may read it in the vague sense of "all your stuff", but it's literally just your Junk category items.  Your weapons and armor and caps will all be safe and secure.  
---
This should never happen at all...just so sad...
---
My comment had nothing to do with rejoining a server when being disconnected. I agree with that it's needed and they're working on it. 
---
That's why my comment starts with "Not sure what a server browser would do."
---
Yeah you can't have it both ways OP. It's frustrating to not be able to explore areas because several level 100+ players are just lingering.
---
Noice
---
Probelm here, I didn't know it was someone else's airdrop, since i got the message go to airdrop near by.
---
So I’m not going to dispute that there is a fair amount of bitching on this sub. And that there is a fair amount of entitlement. 
---
But nowhere in this thread did I complain or bitch. In fact, I specifically stated that wasn’t “demanding” a fix immediately or throwing a tantrum. Rather I was looking for a confirmation on the part of Bethesda on a widely reported bug from multiple individuals. 
---
That isn’t bitching. Nor is it acting entitled. It’s asking for some communication from employees (who are PAID to interact with the community) to acknowledge arguably the most reported bug this patch has introduced. Which they have yet to do. 
---
I’m not here to trade dukes with you over the internet. If you want to be hostile towards me, that’s your call. But it’s objectively dishonest to misconstrue this thread as “bitching”. 
---
Oh, I’ve found suppressed gausses, I just don’t have the plan for the suppressor (yet). Once I get it, I’ll be in heaven.
---
If you didn't call it in, it's not yours.  And of course, the "Steal From" warning and a warning pops up on your screen when you attempt to pick it saying it's a hostile action toward the owner.
---
yes to both
---
I wired mine up this way:
---
Power source to door frame
---
Power source to floor pressure switch inside house
---
Pressure switch to key pad (outside house, wire clips through wall)
---
I think that was it, I'll check when I'm home. 
---
This arrangement makes it so i can just walk out using pressure switch inside, but have to enter code to get back in.
---
That’s a very specific circumstance, having large quantities of a rare set of resources given to her on a consistent enough basis to sustain 5000 rounds a day, that’ll probably set off a false positive.
---
Some people seem to think child porn is a great ideal too, and profit from it. 
---
Doesnt mean it's not stupid. 
---
Now the two comparisons are apples and oranges in terms of moral standards and American pass time, but my point remains the same. 
---
Bad money management skills on the buyers part. 
---
And it makes sense you profited off of military. Most of them are kids, or very  young adults fighting depression and boredom. 
---
Poor spending habits is a symptom of a larger problem they cant do anything about. 
---
Ask me how i know, I'll tell you. 
---
Did you hit the mole miners wearing a mining helmet and with a pickaxe?  I got mine there, but the huge creatures one isn't working - I've killed super mutant behemoths, grafton monster, mirelurk queens, scorchbeasts - nothing registers.
---
Yeah, I mean that's a good chunk of change for some data
---
I believe a community manager confirmed clearing it and reapplying fixes it, though you get a visual bug where the positive effect doesn't show up under your status even though it's working correctly.
---
Would be nice to not have to remember when you last used their caps.
---
Would be better (imo) if the they just reset at a fixed time every day rather than a cooldown from the last time you used it.  This gives you more flexibility in your daily play schedules without potentially missing out on a vendor reset.
---
Yesterday i gave away an entire Excavator set to someone who was struggling. The day before i crafted an entire combat armor set to give away.
---
There are ways of turning your buzz blade into extreme damage with artisan.
---
Every other player i meet wants a mod like MIRV or Cryolater.
---
Someone on the trading forums is selling modded PA for 5000 caps, and my clibrated shocks are very popular.
---
Maybe you're just not utilizing social media. Reddit and twitch are our MMO hub.
---
I just did what I thought was best to get rid of my bounty, even got rid of someone else’s 
---
We all know it's impossible to get a pie from the machine. It's just BGS trolling us
---
My base is next to Whitespring, where there's 3 copper ore deposits. I also get a significant amount at Watoga and Blackwater Mine. 
---
Well yeah... that’s the persona
---
Good bait 10/10
---
Dear oh dear.
---
I like the new game+ option. Being a total noob when I started I got rid of a lot of things that I should have kept. But I like my current load-out and perk options. So I've just been stockpiling levels (not spending any points) until I decide I want to completely change my build or something. 
---
I'd rather not start a new character - I have a nice set-up - I just want the option to redo the quests. With the increased stash size I can actually store weapons/armour and have ample mats to craft/repair with. 
---
Absolutely. If your job isn’t needed any more, give me a good reason why you should continue to be employed at that job? Why should activision pay someone to sit around and do nothing all day?
---
I logged into both of my 'alts' that recently learned the Confederate Hat plans and it shows in the list.  I didn't actually try to craft one, but it is there to craft...unlike my Main character where the Hat doesn't show in his list of items to craft at all.
---
No more sensitive than any other person on here requesting a bug fix.
---
I did block him, I just think I hopped back into the game too soon and it put me back on the same server.
---
And my camp was set up south from the top of the world, near that BBQ restaurant roses quests has you visit. As far as I could tell there wasn't really any player traffic. I think I just got unlucky with a bored player.
---
With all these foundation abominations everywhere these days, it's nice to see such a well thought out camp. Very nice.
---
When I was level 28 I got a message from a guy asking for help for this very thing.  The whole server practically showed up he’d messaged everyone,  it was the most fun I’ve had in 76 as we all fought them together.
---
Your role play challenge: choose a perk setup and you're not allowed to change it. If you need a pick lock you got to recruit someone using your social skills. Good luck!
---
The funny thing is, there were people who did duping, but didn't dupe a shit ton, and also weren't banned.  The people who got banned were definitely duping and duping hard.
---
I saw a red eyed lvl 35 one at my camp in the NW forest when I logged in right after the patch. I'm lvl 22. I ran into my camp and fast traveled to my teammate. Lol. I was surprised I could fast travel with him so close to my camp. I should have taken a picture. But I was too freaked out because he was so creepy staring like that.
---
Its not a nerf at all, its a bug fix
---
Fucking hate cheaters
---
Definitely busted. My build is fucked and I cannot afford serums for my 5 mutations back if I try to "fix" it...
---
1500?  gtfoh
---
bitch lasagna 
---
Make me keep my hands off. Maybe you should die less.
---
I'm not reviewing the game, or anything. I don't need to own the game to comment on it, or to be on this reddit. The downvotea don't bother me because they're from people who think this game is good, so they're basically worth upvotes to me
---
Your argument that it just takes 3 minutes is ridiculous.   Try changing your loadout 10 times a gaming session.  That 3 minutes just cost you 30 minutes of game play that you could have literally been doing ANYTHING else more productive. Say it only takes 2 minutes.  Great, spending 20 minutes screwing around with cards...I didn't buy Heartstone.  This isn't Solitaire.   The cards are a mechanism to enable game play.  When the cards BECOME the gameplay, there is a problem.
---
You made my point for me:  The perk system is overly cumbersome and a huge waste of time.  The mod made it manageable until they broke it.
---
If they were better at analyzing their code changes before hitting the publish button, we wouldn't have had a huge roll-back with old bugs being brought back in all over again.  If they were better at analyzing the consequences of their changes they would actually work towards a game balance instead of over-nerfing things. 
---
No
---
I never once said redesign the whole game, just add or tweak a few things for the players that don't want to deal with PvP aspects at all.
---
There are 3 waves of level 50 gutsys and each wave is capped with a legendary one.  When I solo it they're usually 2 or 3 stars, but with a few others it's 3x 3 star legendary gutsys.. it's got some excellent chances for good legendaries, I got both of my main weapons from this event.  It seems is very rarely shows up now... 
---
Most of the players are really nice people and helpful. Just don't get jaded when you run into a Raider D-Bag
---
Solo kills in 3 minutes with mele.
---
#Balance
---
Yeah did not see that just opened and looted because loot
---
I’m not sure how they currently scale her, but it seems it would make sense for her HP to be based not just on how MANY players are there, but their level.
---
So say you get a level 50+, that gives her a standard boost.
---
A level 30 turns up, she gets a 30% boost
---
And if a level 5 turns up, she gets a 5% boost.
---
These numbers are obviously completely arbitrary
---
I'd rather they spend their time stabilizing the game and adding more content. 
---
That's fine, more loot for us
---
Cap loss at death should be capped at 50 caps. Scaling with your level is dumb. Im level 120 and i avoid xp for this reason.
---
Bounties meh. Fine as is. Cutting them in half would be fun. 
---
We are from different schools of playing and im sure you agree with my above statement. 
---
This is what I like to see... What a nice pig. 
---
I did the same thing a couple of weeks ago and yep, same problem as you. Hardly anyone showed up and I broke all 4 of my melee weapons  attacking her in the process. We were not victorious.
---
I was not aware of this, if this happens again I'll make sure to try this!
---
How can you know something is broken you have never done?
---
Found him yesterday and was able to leave/rejoin 2-3 times, sure enough the plan eventually showed up - luckily it did on that last hop/rejoin since others left him so I couldn't rejoin the same server after that.  Got them now - Domestic Kitchen Tables - and also the Starburst Clock.  I believe I'm done with all in game CAMP items now except for Signs &amp; Letters.
---
That's really stupid. I dilute mine because I get twice as much healing that way - with Chemist, one blood pack will get me 8 diluted stimpaks. Good stuff.
---
Yep, that's why I wanted multiplayer Fallout. Not for PvP and worrying about some jagoff ambushing me and stealing my shit. If I wanted that I'd play more of The Division.
---
Also, bluntly, PvP in this game is broken and bad, quite possibly the worst I've ever seen, and that's including The Division during the early days. Even when I do get an urge for PvP, Fallout 76's PvP is not going to satisfy that urge.
---
I'm not sure how to express the level of flawed this suggestion is, but I'm gonna give it a shot.
---
Everyone had a set of level ultracite armor in the first place. Some people were accidentally destroying it because it wasn't super apparent what had happened. The plans were not a major reward from the queen, because everyone already had the armor.
---
**Ultracite mods** were the real prize of her ultracite plans, and still are. Can't get those anywhere but scorch beasts. Unfortunately, ultracite armor isn't all that special. It's good because it's one of the **free** armors you can get.
---
**Serum recipes** are still the real prize, because it saves you 17,000+ caps vs the enclave vendors now. 
---
**3 star legendaries**  are a real prize. She should be dropping them reliably, and at max level. Instituting a level 5 legendary to compensate for something that is broken means whatever plans exist for 4-5 star legendaries will be rushed and undermined. 
---
When you run a nuke as intended (Prime w/ 8+ people, battle in the zone, or right next to it), there can be a dozen legendary ads to the battle, further increasing the loot pool and everyone's potential payout.
---
hold up - he didn't post a screenshot of his hours played?
---
Yeah, I know that feeling. I wanted to give away a couple of my known plans (stimpak and deep pocketed trapper limbs) to a level 22 the other day just to be nice. He rejected my trade emote with a "no" emote and ran off without even seeing what I had to offer. While he was running away I shot a single .308 round at the back of his head then server hopped in hopes of finding a server with cooler people on it. 
---
Any game save for infinite MP shooters lack content after playing it for 500 hours. Especially if that game has not finished releasing its contents.
---
Which AAA gane in the last decade has had a 50-60 hour+ campaign? Most are way, way less.
---
Username checks out
---
There's a community live stream tomorrow?
---
Very true. I apologize.  
---
 Hell I have Excavator I don't want. I built it a while ago and its taking up space. I'll find a level 35 and give it to him.
---
 I do understand the various forums where trading takes place but I want it in game. I built a trader crafter who is just parked and her place is set up for trading and general community activities but there's no way I can make that work as it is now. 
---
Why are you here at all?
---
Seriously, this sub is for discussion of fallout 76, not how shitty Bethesda is. Go talk about something you like, anything else, so we don't have to keep reading moronic comments that just call the game shitty.  Clearly if you are still playing it, it's not shitty.  If you aren't playing it, go away and don't come back.
---
Agreed
---
If they want revenue, cut back on the absurd Atom gain by just playing and drop more cosmetics that players really want. A full set of Raider CAMP designs? More armor sets like the new PA ones that are coming out that are more than just a coat of paint? Flamers that spew green flames? People are much more likely to drop money on things that drastically change how something looks.
---
My first stretchy boy mongrel scared me about as much as my first mothman encounter 
---
I agree
---
&gt; thats your opinion
---
Good question! I always do - yesterday i convinced this L30 girly to attack a L14 @ the gorge with her buddy. She had never PVP'd before so it was pretty funny but the L14 got pretty salty kept following and attacking our high level group.
---
The reason we did all that was simply because Moth statues ARE NOT ALLOWED to be placed on her camp! So i put up like 12 statues at the shop.
---
Otherwise it is griefing if you don't keep their shops. I'd never do it unless i intended to keep it.
---
I watched a live streamer last night server hopping for shop PVP and it got pretty ugly. Rare to find anyone with a team who wants PVP.
---
Yea I care little for trading, I just want my remote pip-boy back so I do think gave to pause. And I miss the map.
---
Had a bad fight on PC last night at the V9 dropsite. Maybe 10-12 people there, level 80+, mostly melee it seemed. She didn't land that often. One time she touched the ground I had enough time to pull the pin on an orbital strike grenade but she shot back into the sky before I could release it. We got her to regen her health, and I watched her land once and everybody start wailing on her but her health bar barely budged. Usually I can dump a mag of my plasma gatling into her and see *some* movement in her health bar. This time it seemed like shooting a wall. The orbital strikes we did manage to land didn't seem to harm her either.
---
She flew away with about 80% of her health at the end. At some point I stopped firing because was super low on ammo and realized the cause was lost.
---
Adds were crazy, but not unmanageable. Maybe the high-dps folks were spending too much time dealing with them?
---
On a side note, was it ever confirmed that the whole health-regenerating thing with legendaries is deliberate and not a bug? It seems to me that the big guns hold back until the regen happens, but there's no gameplay indication as to when that happens or how to trigger it. It also comes with no perceptible difference on the enemy as far as a behavior change, as "leveling up" would imply.
---
They might use optimized closed server 
---
Even better give them a bigger pool 600 would be a sweet spot 
---
i actually heard in on this sub about a month ago, and i love it as well!
---
They said that’s what they’re planning on. I’ve been wondering if they’ll announce some new content today and show it off during the livestream tomorrow.
---
If I go to the server browser and join server X at the beginning of my session, then crash out of server X, I can go to the server browser and rejoin server X afterwards.
---
Paint cans should be useable as a craftable skin. 
---
Amazing! I used to build these all the time in Fallout 4. [Here’s one of them](https://youtu.be/cpSu7UbZSnk). Skip towards the end to see it from the outside 
---
It's level 0 so that the owner can open it without having to have any special perks.
---
It's locked just to keep the non-owners away from it, and allow for penalties to be applied to non-owners who open it.
---
Honestly I don’t care for the Bounty System. (I didn’t even what a bounty) but there needs to be a better way to just get rid of it
---
I get bored thinking of the game. Level 125 and I don't know what there is to do except just kill random stuff for gear, where 95% is junk I'll never use. Just doesn't seem.. fun.
---
If you don't want to be helped, get wasted!!! 🤣
---
I'm not that mean 😁
---
That'll be 2400 atoms please
---
&gt; A one off glitch where I just lost 50+ springs or has a change been made to server hopping in Patch6?
---
So you're saying you got a screw loose? /s
---
I didn't notice it in my post patch play, but I don't server hop.
---
Plans would actually be worth something again
---
Read through the sub and you will see. 
---
So basically you hate debates and refuse to change your mind or see it from another point of view.
---
Have you ever participated in a good debate? Or do you always feel attacked?
---
Dragon dps is just horrible. If you're running a rifle build then pick up a handmade with a perforating magazine. If the queen's currently unkillable then it's a giant waste of ammo, but at least try to do your share of the damage.
---
What stat does this "Social Skills" fall under?   Is that Charisma?  I think I have a -12 Charisma.   
---
If they start this, then why work hard for a weapon or armor.  Someone will just keep pumping out their 1 special item and put it on ebay to make money.  I see where you coming from, but this wont fly.
---
I'll be looking for this event. Thanks for letting people know about it
---
Yeah again did not know it was someone else’s, just thought it was a locked airdrop 
---
I would assume they didn't have enough caps on their person to cover their death penalty and bounty.
---
when is the livestream?
---
I haven’t gotten banned, but again I stopped playing a while back until they can get their act together too. 
---
Buys 25p game -&gt; asks Devs to not make it 25p -&gt; can't see the irony.
---
Complex = fun. Analogue = boring.
---
If you look at the update code extraction that Despotak posted, you'll see they made a change that "shadow nerfed" Adrenal Reaction. I am not sure exactly what all they broke in their attempts but the code is an interesting read none the less. [https://despotak.github.io/fallout\_76\_patch\_notes/v1.0.6.0.html](https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/v1.0.6.0.html)  
---
i promise that i dont either, i just want to know what u meant by "by you having more time."  i literally dont know what u are trying to say there
---
Some innocents might of gotten banned. Happens in most ban waves in games
---
Personally I call bull on these topics. I play every day solo and every day it gets harder and harder to do things with out others showing up or in the way. I use to forget it was multi player, now I just want to be left alone. If anything this game is becoming more popular.
---
Also if it doesnt give away too much what do we do once we launch? I have my key cards, I have my codes I am ready if I can do it by myself, (I dont have hacker 3 or lock pick 3) so if those are not show stoppers I think I can launch myself. But my real question is what do I do after? Do I run from site alpha to wherever I just nuked? Do I have to be there to get the XP? Im a bit confused on what the idea is once you launch?
---
Nah. I got this game for the pvp fallout they advertised. 
---
Ive want pvp on this engine sonce skyrim. 
---
Pve community especially here on reddit are arrogant, selfish, lame. Look at your comment trying to suggest i leave the game. Frig off.  Its a pvp game too. 
---
Bethesda wants us to play pvp. What gives you the right to suggest we cannot? 
---
Cant wait for survival mode....
---
Meh. 
---
At least now you know.  And it's not like a 50% damage vs players penalty is a hindrance to you while you play for 4 hours.
---
No worries m8. Have a great day!
---
I got my first complete set of T-45 power armor that way. I was working on Miner Miracles, trying to get enough black titanium to craft my first excavator set, and in the R&amp;D section of the Garrahan Mining HQ I found a full set of T-45 with a \~40% power core waiting there for me. That T-45 helped me gather enough supplies to make my excavator set, and I really appreciated that someone left hand-me-downs for me. Now I try to pay it forward. 
---
&gt;but I want it in game
---
I find it a toxic meme but it's the only way to get through to you people.
---
*sigh*
---
PC MASTER RAAAAAAACE NOOOB! You're trapped on your console unable to access forums / streams?! LAWL git guuuuuud!
---
But doesn’t explain the other thing 
---
It is super weird. I should test those. Hadn’t thought of that. I also recently acquired Unstable Isotope and was told today that it can kill you so maybe it and Serendipity triggering simultaneously is what’s doing it. I’m gonna remove some mutations anyway, because of Adrenal Reaction, so I’m gonna let Isotope go. Then, I’ll run some tests including cars and scorchbeasts. Thanks for the input bud!
---
Another dumb YouTuber.
---
Nothing new

I agree. The only reason I had to craft anything past lvl 100 was to break down stuff for a plan I just found. Anything to make it meaningful again would be great. 
---
What secrets does this mighty pig hold within? 
---
If I'm correct (and again, *IF*), it's a small indie-level team that got dropped into a half-assed AAA game, with the team that was promised to help actually scavenged to work on a bigger title, and they are trying to fix too many trees and can't see the forest as a result.
---
Than again, I'm always giving people the benefit of the doubt, it's a character flaw that I've never been able to shake.  And that particular conspiracy theory I picked up from elsewhere, so it could be complete bullshit.  But it fits the situation the way I see things.
---
A bit more, since it's lunch time...FO76 was developed by Bethesda Austin, which is what's left of Battlecry Studios, which wasn't affiliated with any other Fallout game.  The thought was that FO76 was sold to the higher-ups as an easy cash cow, and staffing was approved for that, then they were all siphoned off to either rework the whole creation engine, or to work on another title altogether (the details of which escape me at the moment).  That left the little Austin crew to figure out what was going on all by themselves.
---
So, with no real FO experience (and no real experience with modding or its modding community), they're running around trying to figure everything out on the fly.
---
That all may be baloney, but it certainly would explain a lot of the issues that we're having...missteps, short-sighted decisions, lack of progress and communication.  Take it for what it's worth, that's just what I've heard, I can't defend or confirm a lot of it.
---
If it’s still on schedule, it’s supposed to be from 2:00 to 3:00 EST.
---
What other thing?  The reason you got the bounty in the first place?  Cause you performed a hostile act toward another player.  Purposeful or not.
---
Exactly. I love Fallout and the lore and everything. I know it’s not supposed to be a “normal” Fallout game and I don’t even mind that. 
---
It’s just the fact that I can’t even recall how many times I’ve been grieved by these high ass levels that I have *no* chance against that are just bored. I know there are so many great people who want to just hangout, gift you stuff, and just run around shooting (the) shit, but I’m typically on alone. All of my friends have moved on from it and my SO simply sighs at the mention of it.
---
Right? I was very close to coming back just bc I knew I was all set up to log in and just roll out. No grind. Except they fucked adrenal reaction. So now the next time I log in first on the list is to find a way to get rid of adrenal reaction and then grind back all 9 of my mutations. No thanks. I don't like grinds without rewards and grinding just to make up for how Bethesda set me back is def no reward
---
All I know is nothing seems to populate around you when you load in. I made a base strategically located near some ore veins and they are always empty when I spawn in. I need to logout at vault 76 or a workshop I frequent in order to get those bad boys to load in for me.
---
Shame the average player has to suffer due to server hoppers.
---
I have one 😏
---
Still haven’t seen any caps.... starting to think it’s linked
---
Thanks for the offer.  I got that first kill in a while back so now I pop in mostly for violet flux or to kill a gaggle of big critters.
---
I don't know if i was banned, haven't played the game since about a month after release.
---
You didn't invite him to your team?

Dear Bethesda Family, ( u/BethesdaGameStudios_, u/Valseek,  [/u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann), [/u/lonevaultwanderer](https://www.reddit.com/u/lonevaultwanderer) )

Yes- I consider us a family. I know Bethesda doesn't technically support Mods for Fallout 76, but Fallout 76 does support mods. You've seen the impact (non-supported) user mods has on the game, Known Plans comes to mind. In the past you've even gone out of your way to clarify you weren't banning players who use QoL mods. I ~~ask~~ beg of you to consider "helping" the Perk Loadout Manager mod. It's a beautiful mod that really makes playing as a high level player with so many Perk Cards available, more enjoyable. Since patch 6 and the closing of the network hole that Scaleform used the mod no longer works. There are so many of us who still play your game but have been playing less or stopped playing altogether since the mod no longer functions because it's so tedious trying to switch out lockpick perks or hacking perks or weaponsmith perks or happy camper perks or... you get my point. You can see the impact the mod has had and the support people have been giving to the Mod Author on his [Mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124?tab=posts). PLEASE consider allowing access for this Mod and/or some sort of acknowledgment that you understand the importance this mod has to your family.

Considering that a common thing to say in the threads about the ban wave was that people should have known better than to accept a trade for 65,000 nuka grapes and they deserved to be banned. Oh and that stuff about trading being bugged and cheaters stealing items during the trade, which never had proof but was widely publicized. As a new player the game probably doesn't seem exactly friendly to legitimate trading. They might even think, what if Bethesda chooses to ban anyone with a duped weapon, even people who got one through a friendly stranger gifting it to them?
---
I launched a nuke at fp last night on ps4 and the whole server came,literally the whole server. I had a few frame drops but no disconnects. We killed her with 12 minutes left and her loot loaded instantly for me when she died! Twas a good time!
---
You are buying a license to play a game. That license has terms and conditions and if you violate those terms, your license is revoked. You would have many people exploiting your law if they can play the game many hours then break the rules to get their money back. 
---
The fiscal impact of enforcement would also be huge. There is no reason to do it when there is an existing system that works just fine—you agree to the terms and your license is revoked if you use your license in a manner inconsistent with those terms. If you don’t like the terms upon your initial review, then rather than agreeing to the terms you return the product. Simple. 
---
I was saw a link somewhere saying probate servers would be through Bethesda, so not really a private server or a very modable one.
---
I cheated.......but it was on my wife. I'm in the clear!!! Wooooooooooo
---
Once again "he said it therefore he is right" it's called a "call to authority" and it's an argument falasy why is why I said use numbers cause I honestly wouldn't care if he was a Bethesda employee that dosent inherently make him perfectly knowledgeable on this subject or any subject.
---
Went back and read read the math I missed as you only linked the comment thread not the whole post and math is sound though once again even your proof states it would be around 11 hours minimum per day of perfect farming no wandering no potty breaks no sleep to get all the materials for even the cheapest of the ammo listed in the ban sheet. That's not 11 hours doing fun things that's hours and hours farming lead in luckyhole mine, hours and hours server hoping for nukes and the math is literally dependent on utilizing an acid extractor as otherwise you'd need around 300 a day to maintain material consumption
---
I just went back and read read his(900) whole post at no point did he say he multiboxes... He said as I did he used it for extended storage post carry weight Nerf. 
---
So I'll state this again, am I saying he couldn't do it legit no I'm just stating it would iether take hemoraging rare resources unless you are 100% dedicated to farming them(like 2 full time jobs dedicated) or it would take a rather large group effort, niether of which he mentions which is why I and many others see it as highly suspect
---
Also side note multiboxes are allowed so long as it's a mirror not a bot. 
---
Caps only drop from certain types of enemies.  Vendors only have a limited stock that resets 20 hours after you consume them.  Cap stashes are not guaranteed to spawn or even have caps in them, etc.
---
Sorry wrong person 
---
It's just odd that a company that is bragging about having their most profitable year, that pays millions upon millions to executives, to then turn around and fire 200 people. I mean there's always turnover in companies, sure, but that to me doesn't speak of a company that's doing well, that to me speaks about a company that's either re-structuring to avoid going out of business. And if they're not suffering financially, then they just callously fired 200 people instead of working to re-train them. What company does well and then fires people? Contractors are one thing, but these were full-time employees. 
---
'Congratulations, we killed it this year! K you're all fired now'
---
Cryolator, then melee.
---
Questions like this can only be explained the way Ancient Aliens explains things that are weird.... "Could it be Aliens?
---
The only luck I've had with them is when they attack someone else. I can use my exploding shotgun to destroy large areas, and randomly manage to kill it eventually.
---
I just use the dragon because its my best weapon stat wise. I havent been really chasing legendaries, have a vampire 10mm pistol, my silenced pipe revolver rifle I crafted and the Dragon.
---
Ive been meaning to work on a "build" but teh perk system is a bit confusing for an old man casual, so i'm probably not doing as much as I could, hence why i try to help with crowd control. lol
---
Sure you aren't loading into the same server?  There's a lower population these days.  So less servers up.
---
Also, a one off night doesn't mean you didn't land where someone else already cleaned up the springs before you got there.
---
I've heard there is some mechanics in play that prevent world spawns from showing up to you if you've collected them that day.  But, I never had to farm a spot more than once every other day so I can't be sure.
---
I think the PvP crowd should be able to bring their character to the PvP server but never bring it back to the adventure server. 
---
Dunno but my servers were full this morning when I played (9am - 11am U.K) maybe it’s more to do with matchmaking, in respect of whitesprings if the map shows a low level player I leave them to it in case they’re after unruly golfers for the quest, if they’re high level then I leave them get their XP, legendaries etc and when it’s free of folk I go there spawning a mob of my own to kill and loot so maybe others are just taking turns at whitesprings too? Who knows?
---
&gt;I believe it is a anti-cheat measure Bethesda added so players can't be carried easily and not a bug
---
Lolol the delusion is real. 
---
I'm still playing. 
---
Dude, I just want your acid and steel.
---
I never have a problem with the SBQ. In fact last night just 3 of us took her out. The formula is simple. Shoot her wings to make her land. As soon as she's on the ground everyone opens fire on her belly with the most powerful weapon you have. With this method we can usually take her out with several minutes remaining on the timer. 
---
Well, in the lore, certain Vaults split into factions or tribes and fought each other. So, to some extent it makes sense but they should have had PvE and PvP servers from the start. It’s dumb not too honestly.
---
Right? Regardless of whether Mr. 900 is innocent or guilty, I dont see why Bethesda deserves the loyalty. I personally really enjoy FO76 but it is a flawed product and has a ton of issues. It's not a stretch to see them accidentally ban some innocent players.
---
Yep, watoga is where I see it most.  Really sucks when one of the bots explode after dropping dead - you know it was legendary.
---
I have noticed that if the bots are attacked by a mob such as a mutant or scorched, it seems to fix the bug - the bots stop dropping dead on approach, even the ones that weren't fighting the mob
---
I don't need to read I've actually killed the sbq and it has been great. 
---
Anthem was it for me.
---
I'll be back in 6 months or so. Unless bannerlord comes out.
---
Those are expensive ears... I like it! 
---
Does anyone have like a map of his walk through is?
---
can confirm is just had this problem so is started swinging my supersledge around me and i got a xp earned message
---
I don't think you're wrong, but I also don't think that is the whole story either.  Throw in some good old fashioned mismanagement with a healthy does of clear and present screwed up priorities (which is what I think you meant by the forest and the trees, but that is too nice to be completely accurate and I don't think that version of it is being mean.)  
---
I've read some things that says there is much truth to what you are saying, but there is more to it than just plain old ineptitude.
---
Own two TSEs I'm almost positive were duped... No ban here
---
The game is actually good but you just shit on it to join a bandwagon not because you find any flaws.
---
I think you missed a zero
---
How do you view these???
---
I showed you my pig tail, please respond.
---
About 9 at night English time
---
It's mid morning/afternoon on a Thursday...
---
I have been booted from a server I believe 3 times. Annoying but not apocalyptic. I’ve seen creature heads stretch upon death and I’ve encountered the slow loading times for corpses a few times.  If I’ve encountered any others, they were so unmemorable that I can’t even think of them because they just weren’t that big of a deal. 
---
Your gaming experience isn’t a slight, nor is the lack of perfection the worst thing to every happen in the history of everything so stop whining like it is.  If it’s truly so bad, go play something else and don’t buy another Bethesda game. 
---
But did you know you can buy real world Ultracite?!?

Am I missing something? Wasn't this change specifically in the patch notes?
---
i'd be interested in seeing the AM Best ratings for Fallout 76...
---
I'm honest with u. U may enjoy fallout 76, but it's a fact, that it's a bad game. That there TONS of games like fallout 76, just better. Go and farm other games dude, don't waste ur time with this game. 
---
Maybe the roadmap will specify 
---
What? Why would I lie?
---
Actually she presented situations in which you could easily find something ironically cliche to say. She spared us the cliche using the technique of synecdoche.
---
Are you one of those nerds who abuses literaLEEEE 100X a day? Maybe you didn't get the memo but words don't have to mean anything anymore. Just 4 syllables of human barking because we're in an age of Doublespeak-Idiocracy.
---
OP's post isn't ironic just entitled. If you want content head over to the role play sub and post your contact info; it's that easy. The reason it's 25p it's intended for us to make our own game modes.
---
If it's Wade airport, then no.
---
Just use an old save file. I can't think of the name for it
---
That or a small shared stash between characters even 30 lbs would be better then now
---
I got a 4 star from it
---
It happened to me while in the last cave of the BoS mission. Scorched came in after me and they all got stuck at 1hp
---
I just posted in another thread regarding this. My friends and I don't have a problem killing her. We have a system. Everyone shoots at her wings to get her to land. Once she lands we all go for her belly. When she's on the ground her weak spot is her belly. 
---
"revert" means to return to. Use an old save file
---
Anywhere with a kitchen usually has salt pepper and spices.  
---
It was a fucking health bonus. I can guarantee you 200% that not a single person who bought any of these outfits did so because they desperately wanted a minor health boost for a week. 
---
No, I was right. Revert an old save. Use an old save file. 
---
I.. what? I never said anything about the price. Where are you pulling this? I've been enjoying the game for what it is, it's other players that can ruin the experience. 
---
Are you just upset because I don't like PvP? Your username makes it seem so.
---
I joined on the tail end of someone's attenp (maybe 5 mins left?), I think it was just me (lvl 127) and another lvl 97. With just two people we should have seen *some* damage down....but no, not even a bit.
---
I was busy doing other stuff for a month (Far Cry New Dawn), I'll be back soon.
---
His good is anthem? I've heard a lot of mixed things
---
Yeah but who cares we already know the loot will be equal to or less than what we already have. If Bethesdas wanted us to have more powerful stuff they wouldn't have nerfed shit to begin with
---
That's awesome! Wish people could set up camp in someone else's camp... it would be fun to have a little town!
---
"ThE aMoUnT oFf OuTrAgE bEtHeSdA hAs SpArKeD bEcAuSe Of ThEiR cOrPoRaTe ToXiCiTy Is PrObLeMaTiC" ...
---
I agree with you but also wanted to add "toxicity" &amp; "problematic" to the list 
---
Honestly, I think survival mode should be separate characters with NO ability to repair anything.
---
Legendaries wouldn't be your go to item... instead the ones you save for emergencies.  That would be way more interesting to me.
---
what u are saying is hypocritical.  players are not welcome to engage in pvp all they want if there is pacifist mode available on that server.  im sorry you feel like u've been sold something misleading, so do all the pvp players. we are in the same boat.  the OP suggests fixing pacifist mode instead of giving us our separate servers to only appease the carebare players and none of the pvp players.  "they are paying for the product too".  sure do OPs suggestion for adventure mode, but to suggest scrapping survival mode all together is ridiculous imo.
---
That doesn't mean that it spans over the entire 30 days, which would require them to scan and rescan accounts at multiple points over the 30 days in order to track the aggregate amount.   
---
 That means that at some defined point over the past 30 days, Bethesda scanned your account, and found you to have 100,000+ quantity of an item at that point. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they spend most of it trying on fantastic Atom shop items.
---
It’s not bragging, It’s an investor’s call. They’re obligated to discuss quarterly finances. How can you say the layoffs were callous? Are you an insider in Activision?
---
How do you know the company has room to retrain these people? Are you the CFO? Do you know corporate finance?
---
You’re assuming an awful lot from the two facts you cited. 
---
Just a heads up for the Mike - some of us would like to use it all the time, but have to respect roommates etc. and can't use it sometimes. It would be nice if they add text chat !
---
There are a few locations that will always spawn PA.
---
Really you think since day one its gotten more popular?
---
Your efforts to help Keretus are most appreciated.  Honestly if the mod didn't even have a means by which to import/export easily, and required manual editing of a config file to save loadouts, it would STILL be a million times better than this steaming pile of dung method of manually switching your cards that's built into the game.
---
That says a ton about how badly the in game system is designed.  The top PC mods (PLM and Better Inventory) are absolutely something that should have been in the game from the start.
---
You cant get one shotted with slap damage, it's a myth... not unless u are already &lt; 10 health. If you own a shop, all bets are off, there is no slap damage, wherever you are 
---
Probably too busy fucking up the game.some more today
---
 WTF are you babbling about. I have never owned a fucking console. I can't work a controller and my present machine is about to be replaced by the ninth computer I have built. 
---
 I will keep my GTX 1070 and it goes in my new Ryzen machine that will hit the road in about 3 weeks.
---
 I want my fucking trading in game. Is that too much for you? Then use your brain to communicate with me.
---
It's like you are compairing counterfeit money laundering to jaywalking. 
---
One negatively impacted everyone's play experience, while the other can be slightly be abused in very minor instances, is mostly used to create new and interesting things
---
Scorch beast stew? 
---
No need to get salty mate I'm just stating my opinion here like everybody else. And i did buy it and played it a lot, and that makes my opinion even more valid so excuse me but I won't shut up. Also, they do not need to break promises to keep revenue coming in.
---
&gt;  Even when I do get an urge for PvP, Fallout 76's PvP is not going to satisfy that urge.
---
exactly, most of us will play overwatch, battlefield, cod, one of the millions of battle royal games, not Fallout. Most people love fallout for the universe it has created and the story telling (unfortunately 76 lacks this imo) and just having an undying love for the series. I'll admit, 76 disappoints me, but I don't hate the game, I just play it less.
---
How is new dawn? Seems like far cry made the same game over and over with a different map for a bit there but heard new dawn is good
---
Lossing junk is literally the only penalty to dying. Dont carry junk you are not ok with lossing. Some people may leave your bag alone but many will see it as free for the taking.
---
Thanks! The cat's called Murgle, you can find her at a little shack just North East of Welch Station :)
---
Maybe it was just my time of day
---
Does everything something negative happens to someone in this PvP Game really merit a 3 page essay?
---
I fast traveled to a level 49 player and dropped my fully-kitted level 45 Medic's Handmade Rifle for them. They gave me the heart emote and I ran off into the distance...
---
Some people want to earn their items. I was told that it takes some of the fun out of the game to have them just given to you for free. I was trying to give away excess disease cures that were weighing me down. I saw it as taking the tedium out of the game since collecting the materials for disease cures is tedious to me.
---
No they aren't, they mentioned Halloween candy too which you csn get thousands of per hour legit
---
More evidence he's never played the game.
---
If I may ask, why did you overwrite the Excavator armor rather than the X-01?
---
has there been one yet?
---
No its all at the Launch site apparently. I only need other players as after reading up its meant to be very high level enemies inside in staggering volumes.
---
They keycards is apparently the easy bit 
---
That's not at all what I claimed. If you can't make your argument without strawmen, or lying about what other people say, or throwing out irrelevant red herrings, maybe your argument isn't very good to begin with? Now you're trying to suggest that the people who were claiming "false ban" are mentally ill?   
---
Just stop, you're embarrassing yourself.
---
I have 1, just got it the last day or two.  It was in the school at Watoga, not sure if that one has better odds or not though.
---
&gt; Because everyone got bored. I haven't played in almost 2 months because once I got to level 110 and had the loot I wanted it was pointless. I'm a melee build and past the all rise there wasn't much of a need to farm for a better melee weapon. The SBQ got boring real fast, the server hopping got boring, farming white springs got boring. Honestly, I just get bored when I think about logging back in. There is no more end game content to be played.
---
Same situation here. It was a fun experience until I launched my first nuke, but then the "end game" just became me farming glowing ghouls and dumping hundreds of worthless legendaries on the ground. Since there's no real reason for me to respec, and the storyline (did all side/main quests already) is completely linear, there isn't much point to re-playing as a low-level character like I would for a regular Fallout game. Made a pimped out base (that does nothing), explored most locations, tried a little PvP (bleh), farmed mutations, but eventually just wasn't feeling it. I haven't played for weeks now; not because the game is bad, but I've just exhausted the content and I'm no longer feeling it.  
---
Like Fallout 4, when they release new content I'll come back to play it, but FO76 doesn't lend itself to dumping hundreds of hours into it like Fallout 3/NV/4 did. Can't mod it, there are no branches/choices in the storyline to explore, random encounters are sparse, build diversity barely exists. It was a good one shot, but there are other games to play and explore.
---
Only a single texture to worry about
---
Fraps my good friend.
---
That's along the lines of what I should have wrote if I didn't have that damn -12 in Charisma.
---
Purely speculation on my part but I have severe doubts that people will be able to host their own private servers. I believe it will be servers that Bethesda sells and mods that Bethesda sells, just like the creation club. Actual player ran servers would completely undermine the Atom Shop and I just don't see that happening. 
---
I went and took a sit on someones sofa the other day. They decided to shoot me despite me being twice there level and then locked me in there base. Had to kill them. And also got a bounty despite me not being the instigator lol. If I wanted to attack them I would have. I was just checking out there base which I like to do if I see one. Its always cool to see how other people build
---
Top of the Monorail Elevator.
---
Ignore the haters... 400 hours clocked and still playing. If you enjoyed the exploration, scavenging and building of Fallout 4 then you will like Fallout 76. It's not "hard" to find people to play with but not everyone is necessarily looking for multiplayer. I have met everyone I play with in-game just over the headset mic. Lots of people will play if you simply talk to them.
---
It is a somewhat fair request. In RPG-like game as this, there's huge power disparity between players specced(gears, specials, perks) into PvP, and those who aren't.
---
The slap mechanism tries to address something but it fails quite badly.
---
Blocking a player does precisely chuff all.
---
Raider PA can almost always be found at Blackwater Mine in a shack near the entrance.
---
Alright so there's not enough space in this oje spot on the map for both the Mega Sloths and the Rad Toads, so you need Animal Friend 3 to start this quest and you pacify either the sloths or the toads, and fight alongside them to drive out the others.  Your biggest reward is that whichever side you pick will be friendly to you for like 5 hours in game, and have a greater chance at randomly spawning.  Makes it easier to find and tame one.
---
Camden Park.  The infieldd of the roller coaster

Also (can't remember the name of the bar) by Charlston Fire and Belching Betty mine.
---
glowing fungues puree..most of my diet was the glowing fungus soup..so this is better:
---
* 60 hp
---
*+35 energy resist
---
* radiation resist
---
Yeah, but juicehead is a compete clickbait twat though.
---
Yes...they look ridiculous
---
Given the criteria for this one I think the line distinguishing the two is very clear
---
Are you sure this isn't just how they are doing their beta testing now?  It wouldn't surprise me.
---
I now like the thought of having meteorite cannoballs for a broadsider.
---
Yes, extremely annoying. They're really trying to get players to buy icons for some reason. This update and before I'm always getting messages when I log to "check out the atom store for a new icon! "
---
It's supposed to come out near the end of February
---
Gnomes.  Seriously, search around a little in the sub here, there are groups of them in certain locations, and a lot of places that will have 1 or a few in easy reach.  I saw 8-10 in one spot in Huntersville just a day or two ago.
---
Ok that sounds cool but such a waste lol
---
Putting out a couple outfits that when worn as a group gets you a basically pointless amount of hp is not breaking any promises! It wasn't pay to win! People are so sensitive and so quick to jump on the hate train. 
---
You act like some spurned lover who's been cheated on or something it's childish and ridiculous.  
---
They broke no promises by having a little perk for people running around as a super hero team. It was to encourage  group play and drum up business for he Atom Shop.  I see noting wrong with that.
---
Your poor poor heart. I'm so sorry you were lied to and deceived.  Cry baby crying over plus 15 hp.
---
The items themselves didn't even give you the perk you had to be in a team. That soft little dorks like you think they were actually lied to makes me laugh so hard
---
Let me try this again *clears throat* I am all for rejoining a server after being DCd. Not sure why that's being thrown at me considering I didn't even mention it in my first comment. 
---
If I drop something into a cache, I just wanted to make sure someone else can get their hands on it, and not waste those items if  I log out. Often I'll drop stuff and log out, but if those items disappear as soon as I log off none will benefit from it.
---
Thanx for the info folks.
---
Rejoin would be great, I also really appreciate the new "find new server" option when it can't place your CAMP. However, seems like it would be even better to give us a preference we can enable to never join servers that our CAMP can't be placed in.
---
NOBODY FUCKS WITH FLORIDABOATGUY'S TUBA!
---
NOBODY!!!
---
I'm not saying you're wrong but what save? '76 saves are stored on the servers so what are you doing?
---
Everyone uses an almost identical system to what you're describing and I've haven't seen it take more than 10 minutes total to bring her down. One guy was blasting her with his Quad Cryolator which ended up keeping her grounded longer from being frozen. We had people dropping orbital strike beacons, blasting her with Bunker Busters &amp; meleeing her belly while she was frozen on the ground and barely scratching her health bar. I don't know what platform you're on but as far as PS4 goes it's not going like it should. I've jumped in on Scorched Earth about two dozen times and 2 of the 4 times I've failed that event happened today.
---
I know but I would totally start using a broadsider if I can shoot meteors out of it.
---
In a team of four, that's a 60 point boost.
---
So excavator PA uses a single texture and X-01 uses multiple?
---
I am at almost 600 hours and the only time my base has been attacked was when someone wasted a nuke trying to destroy it for some reason lol
---
No need to get salty mate I'm just stating my oppinion here. So excuse me but I won't shut up. Also there are absolutely no need to break promises to keep revenue coming in. If they really wanted revenue, they could actually make new stuff or more varied skins etc. Instead of selling mostly stuff that we already got for free in Fallout 4. 
---
Bethesda and free can not be used together
---
I feel that a lot of players are used to getting more than 80 hours out of a fallout game, or at least I am. I got probably three times that out of four having done different runs with different factions. There is no set rule that 76 needed to match that expectation, but it was a disappointment for me.
---
IIRC you have to unlock the mod for the .50 receiver.
---
It shares with team? Regardless they are late to it happening and are complaining 
---
Wow, that's the first time this has been reported. Thanks for sharing. I wonder if we can figure out why it works for you and not for everyone else. Did the plan you read drop post patch 6 (i.e. a world drop, not traded)? Did you read the plan post patch 6? You also seem to be lower level.
---
Press F for FloridaBoatGuys Tuba
---
It's a meme. You were being petty so was i. IDGAF that you're too petty to use the forum to organize.
---
Funny.  I have been on full servers every day.
---
last night my wifi was out for like 10 mins and it  said login authentication failed so i had a minor heart attack but it was only because of my wifi..it was annoying tho becauese i was at harpers ferry with my level 26 alt about to kill a level 62 charred ghoul he had one more bar of health left..and..disconnect..login authentication failed..due to wifi
---
You should have to remove the legendary from an existing legendary, and it will consume the whole item,  and then you get a mod you can place on any compatible weapon.  
---
I’d say it had to have a cost as well, you can’t remove the “vampiric” from a level 5 lead pipe and put it on your level 50 Gatling laser, it would need to be some kinda witches brew, a weapon as powerful as the mod, multiple mods to get one, etc.  
---
My union hat was learned pre patch
---
So are we thinking that 900 hour guy spent about an hour a day doing nothing but crafting ammo?  The calculations in https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aset43/ammo_crafting_math_re_is_it_possible_to_craft/ assumed quite a bit more time.  
---
In fact, it assumed that 900 hour guy was spending 3 hours a day farming flux and another 8 hours a day farming steel.  Even if we assume aten_ra's god-like farming skills, 900 hour guy would be using almost 6 hours a day farming nothing but ammocrafting materials.  In addition, he did this over an entire month.  With no breaks.
---
This sounds... far fetched.
---
We are not even accounting for outages on servers and client disconnects.  All of these makes single client play annoying.  It would be a nightmare on multi-clients.
---
And the map. I forgot the map. How could I forget the map?
---
Ha! I'm at like 6 Charisma... on my best day.
---
I never said "price" either.
---
I'm using an objective determination. It often confuses the literals.
---
Yeah, probably. Though the chance of private servers and mods is what made me buy the game and still give it the benefit of the doubt that it could be better once modders get to it.
---
You on PC? I'll buy one off you.
---
Nah, I can't progress to locked or blocked parts of the vault.
---
I need a max level 3* Instigating Drill with 40% swing speed &amp; 90% reduced weight.
---
So you agree that he did mention the ultracite ammo quantity and acknowledge the large quantity of other ammo, contrary to the above posts, correct? The tone of your gatekeeping comment was purely to glorify your own narrative bias then?
---
are u ps4..i can mod some stuff for u
---
Firstly, I really liked the first sentence, Everyone want to look like a gritty badass. Amazing. Secondly, The women with longs hairs have some disadvantages like if there is a crazy wind outside then their hairs got really messy, If you don't tie there hairs properly then it can look weird sometimes but they also have some advantage over short hair peoples. They can style there hairs so beautifully, They can look so gorgeous that anyone can fall for them. I have seen my females friends in such amazing hairstyles that I couldn't get my eyes off. I have also seen some really great hairstyles for women with longhair that can make their personality really impressive and I think you should also try some. Here are some [Hairstyle Ideas For Long Hair](https://healthycounter.com/15-best-hairstyle-ideas-for-long-hair/) that can help you actually look like a human being as you said.
---
They just can't please all the people all the time. Sure some people are fine with workshops opening them up to pvp but, if this sub reddit is any indication, there are certainly those that think that any pvp is a form of "griefing."
---
Nah, I would rather Bethesda become good again and in order for that we need you people out of the way. 
---
I like this idea; a basic color skin craftable by the user. If you want the fancy ones then get it from the Atom Shop, but if all you want is red armor, go find some red paint and have at it.  It would be interesting if you could have red arms, blue torso, white legs, yellow helmet all on one set.  Chrome should be an option as well, I can imagine my character polishing his armor in his down time. It would just be part of keeping it maintained. 
---
Anyway I can get you to make me one if i give you the mats? I'm on PC.
---
Sir, thank you, sir!
---
Oh, and then you reverted to your last save in a multilayer game where you aren't in control of saving or reverting saves? Oh.
---
C- for your reading comprehension. 
---
I'd love to be able to craft better items based on my INT.  none of this weak temporary-durability B.S.
---
i usually can find salt with no problem..pepper is not that easy..im gonna go search for the best place
---
 I'm not being petty. I'm calling for the elimination of Legendaries and VATS, you are just another asshole.
---
 That would make traders far more important.
---
Do not buy this game. It’s a trap. It seems and feels fun at first but the more you play the more you realize how empty and pointless it is. Oh and there’s all the bugs. Don’t do it. You’ve been warned.
---
&gt;The problem is, that Unstoppables event came and went away two weeks ago, and no one complained. No one complained because it was absolutely trivial and the bonus made no difference.
---
This is not true.   A lot of people including myself expressed how it is wrong to do what they did. 
---
I had a level 112 grief my then level 11 new character. He was following me swinging on me trying to get me to fight him. He was all decked out with a super sledge and power armor, clearly a losing fight for me. I still swung back and wanted to battle for fun and lost fair and square 3 times, lost my loot, the whole deal. My fourth time I followed him back to a makeshift camp he had, he got out of his power armor and I sniped him and got my revenge, and took the loot. he then followed me, spammed me with party invites and was telling me basically I better not store all that junk. I took 20 steps away from his camp, slapped down camp, threw only a stash box down, stored it, and left server. He followed me calling me names all night. I just laughed. Unfortunately, the way pvp is set up in this game, it just makes a breeding ground for griefers. That's why I am ok with the pvp servers, most of these jagoffs are going to be there and not wasting their time on the PVE servers, leaving them to the lovely people like you and me.
---
Hit her with an endangerol syringer drops her damage resistance by 25% for 2 min, I always hit her when she lands and quick swap to my main damage gun. Hope that helps!
---
They can put it on the shelf right next to their "What Were You Thinking" award for always on voice chat.
---
&gt;what it feels like for people who have nuked fissure prime, killed the queen and crashed before looting her
---
We know what rage tastes like.
---
This isn't true in the EU just so you know. If you can't access the game within the first 3 months then you can get your money back. I'm just saying it should last forever.
---
I'd say you make it while in the Workshop zone PvP is enabled. Someone can come up and put a claim on it. If you don't fight, then it transfers over. If you leave the area during it being contested, it transfers over. That way you only fight in the circle. It could almost be community workshops. I need Lead and I'm going to claim it an the owner might just let it go.
---
As you approach the door into BOS headquarters (Fort Defiance) there is a Terminal on the wall to your right, you can download the schematic from the terminal that allows you to craft BOS Combat rifles at any level.
---
They are significantly better than Hunting Rifles.
---
A whole 18 sentences seems like a 3 page essay to you?  Maybe you, too, are being overly dramatic.   Pick up a book sometime.  It might help your reading speed.
---
Its more about Paint Jobs. Excavator only has a single paint job. X-01 has a few different ones (More if you bought some from the Atom Shop). Its easier to find all the files that make up the excavator than the X-01 which is why i used it for this. Same for Ultracite as well.
---
I agree but I’m just calling this guy out for his idiotic bullshit. He’s seriously sitting here and whining about being called a griefer and being reported when he himself said how much he enjoys griefing workshops, especially with the fact that he’s playing on Xbox Live and has in fact broken a rule in the XBL TOS and had a report put against him that is actually valid with the terms agreed upon when you join Xbox live. 
---
I think it’s stupid to purposefully go around and mess with people and then act surprised when someone doesn’t react kindly to a troll.
---
There's usually most of a set in the Wendigo Cave. Also what is this Plague Rider? I haven't played for a month or so, is this something new?
---
I like this idea, I don’t pvp, but would like to know who took my shit so I could exact revenge. I am guilty of hitting innocent people on occasion when I thought they scooped my stuff. 
---
The T.O.W.N.S idea has been floated before and it sounds great, but could the server really handle it?
---
I thought I was the only one seeing stretchy boys! I saw a VERY stretchy feral wolf a week ago. Could see it wiggling around and whenever I hovered over it with my rifle it said it was a feral wolf, thought I was having an in game stroke 
---
Yup. I will randomly open a fo video, realize its him and go no thanks. He doesn't play the games so hes basically a "game journalist" throwing poop at a wall till some sticks. And usually it's trying to find negative things.
---
As an IT Proffessional, you dont realize how buggy other things are until you work with them. Microsoft (OS and Office products) will take 5+ years to modernize a simple task. Patch notes for word or excel is stupid to read, and there is literally 2 guys working on it anymore. I commonly look up how to do this only to find people have been complaining about it wanting a fix for 5 years now, then you get a ms expert that will just pop into a thread and day "well technically your not suppose to use it that way, try using it as intended"
---
At least game industry (in some level) try and fix and continue to reinvent themselves (paid loot boxes can literally suck it)
---
modders would get it right within 10 minutes- or less.
---
you saying the team behind the game is less competent than random strangers on the internet?
---
Nah, dude. You're just out of luck. Bags are fair game.
---
Always make sure you deposit your junk before going into a dangerous situation or have friends watching your back.
---
Wow, that's the first time this has been reported. Thanks for sharing. I wonder if we can figure out why it works for your alts but not your main or for anyone else. Did the plan you read drop post patch 6 (i.e. a world drop, not traded)? It sounds like you read  plan that dropped pre-patch 6 and just had stored. Did read the plan post patch 6? You also seem to be lower level. I'll take a look at the COBJ record in the ESM and try to learn something from it.
---
paul you are the man. thank you for this info very appreciated 
---
This is a weird one, people drop bags legitimately all the time, especially after big events like the SBQ where you end up with a bunch of junk.  I admit I do like to go through these and see if someone else’s junk is my treasure, or at least snag something to sell. But I’ve come across player death bags before and there just isn’t a way to tell the difference so your in there snagging stuff and suddenly you realize, wait this is just normal crap, oh shit.... then I zoidberg run away...
---
It be really nice if purposefully dropped things where in a different container then death dropped.  
---
where exactly? i heard about this but forgot to check this out
---
Its an upcoming Atom Shop item. [Here is a Thread on the other sets that are coming out as well.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asralt/post_patch_6_new_pa_skins_data_mined/)
---
Next time, you should blueprint the stairs with the upper floor. Then you can either blueprint the foundation alone, or build it anew at the new location. 
---
If the foundation is stored in a blueprint in Store, then you should be able to select it, then chose store, and it should break down all of the components. Just make sure to break down any blueprints that automatically stored under the Store tab. You might have your whole house stored automatically in a blueprint in there. That is, if I'm understanding you correctly.
---
If you think it's a functional problem with the software, then send Bethesda a ticket.
---
makes sense, thanks
---
Yep.
---
People defending that behavior is exactly why "Corporate Bethesda" are such clueless little assholes. 
---
Some silly joker is gonna pay for it no matter how bad the content or the product. 
---
I usually find them together.  Check any of the restaurants on the map they usaly have them on there tables 
---
You can answer this for yourself. Just ask yourself.
---
Does my suggestion slow down the game for everyone or bring Bethesda more money in the atom shop?
---
If the answer to both of those questions is No then Bethesda won't be implementing it
---
I get it, in 99.9% of these wrongfully banned cases I agree with you fully.  Do me a favor, read through the glarfs previous posts, it shows a trend of his past behavior in the game that goes back to launch.  Guilty people rarely act in the way he has, that doesn't add up.
---
If it was almost any other item I would agree, no reason to move it a lot, but ammo that's useful on the queen would be a totally plausible item to move often, especially with two accounts cause it wouldn't be inconvenient.   You wouldn't want to run around with that ammo constantly even with bandolier, it would add weight that makes farming more of a pain.
---
I get the skepticism,  but I simply am trying to bring to Bethesdas attention as well as skeptic people that there is the possibility some people were banned wrongfully, due to the way they chose to track items for this ban.  It would suck for you if you got banned after accidentally looting all on a brown bag that had 1million steel for example,  even if you threw that steel out their current ban method would result in the server flagging your account as an account that was exploiting.
---
In your initial response you stated, "not sure what a server browser would do"
---
Knowing which server I was on, It would allow me to easily reconnect to a server I disconnect to. I really don't know how else to say that. That's what a server browser would do.
---
Way too much of a damage sponge rather than any fun or interesting mechanics involved.  Spend 20 minutes throwing away a shit ton of ammo, only to have her either not even get below half health, or die and drop fucking garbage loot.  There is absolutely no point in killing SBQ whatsoever.  Nothing to gain at all.
---
I agree with others.. Usually in kitchens. 
---
A quest called, "Find all the hidden bugs".   The gist of the quest is that the bugs (radroaches) are the size of buicks, glowing bright green, and can be seen from miles away.  Your quest is to find them and eliminate them from the game.   Is that a little on the nose?
---
1200 seems wrong I think 3 is closer and handmade gun is the rifle lever is the same name 
---
I typed my username in wrong and login failed and I panicked for a moment. 
---
yea probably, I'm not saying blocking him is the end all solution it just makes it harder for him to joint the same server. I have never had an issue with anyone in game prob because i don't make camps at all i just move around and drop a workbench when i need to do something and then move on. Sucks people think this kind of behavior is fun kinda sad.
---
its makes the game fun..we are all alone in the wasteland..but it feels great to help others..im over-generous
---
Stop pretending like youtubers are supposed to be smart.
---
I had someone blow down a wall to use my base once, but I had my base locked at that time so I wasnt really mad. I liked having a door with a keypad so I just put the code over the door so people could still enter and use my benches, no problems with destruction since then.
---
Well, together we make a -6...
---
It's just nuts it is taking this long that's all. Either way, I am excited to see what's on it.
---
I was having that issue alot.....Its really bad around the Poseidon Energy plant all the way over to Riverside Manor.   I ended up turning the custom graphics preset to medium.   Then left the draw distances alone but amped up the the other preferences to high  or ultra.....Really helped.  But I still get the occassional freeze.   
---
I also have this game on PS4 and i notice in same area it freezes up briefly but then picks back up.  So def something on Bethesda's end needs to be fixed.
---
*Snoop voice*
---
WHO?!?!
---
I can somewhat confirm this. I hit Fort Defiance almost daily, and sometimes when I walk in it's been looted. I reload a new server, things are there. But after I loot, nothing will respawn for the remainder of the day.
---
Try this for the ticket.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Oh shit, yeah you're right. I forgot about that. Maybe I just server hopped then? I haven't played 76 in a month or so
---
I think it's pretty obvious the tram is less competent than the modding community.  Who in their right mind would argue that?
---
Just to clarify, I believe it's been stated the FO76 DLC will be free, but in general DLC doesn't automatically equal free everywhere.
---
Hopefully that's what you meant anyway.
---
Houses.  Diners. Kitchens.  Schools.  Randomly on dining tables inside and outside of buildings.   Laying on the ground...
---
Btw my account isn't banned nor do I have any personal relation to garf, never played with him.  Just after reading a long list of threads from him and from Bethesda evidence seems to support that his innocence is absolutely plausible. 
---
You can submit a support ticket on Bethesda's website, but unlikely you will receive any sort of response.
---
Never cheated, bought really good weapons with caps off some trader. But I stopped playing because the game is boring. So I gave my stuff to my friend until the game is better. I dont have high Hope's it'll be quick, maybe next year it'll have enough content for everyone to really get back into it. Assuming Bethesda doesn't pull the plug on it prematurely. 
---
I agree, but no ability to repair would be kind of shitty. Even if repairing was harder or less effective, you should still be able to repair your guns 
---
Oh yeah? How'd you go about fighting the scorchbeast queen for an entire hour after she left?
---
I hate liars.
---
It isn't that rare but I feel your excitement, bro! Enjoy.
---
What's your gamertag? I get bored easily and just start scavving.
---
The farms and houses in Toxic Valley are usually good for concrete. 
---
I got "Handmade" plan in watoga for 1500ish caps. Its the handmade rifle, its just called "handmade".  
---
As for Gauss, I cant remember the price off the top of my head but I always see it in the Enclave bunker.
---
I dislike the square. If there were round they wouldn't be as bad
---
Giant creatures spawn when you nuke their area 
---
Item for CAMP that draws in local creatures(like the violent night jukebox), we then can run a tower defense game with our CAMP
---
Inventory management, I’d like to see something like the “disk space wheel” apps that show you the percentage of each item(stack) is in your weight. 
---
Vats is a part of fallout. Take that away and it would be even less a fallout game then it already is. As for legendary items getting rid of them would make 90% of the game pointless seeing as how most end game players spend there time farming for better legendaries 
---
Duuuuude, yes.
---
Well that's possible, but it's also possible they aren't tracking anything that's not displayed.
---
Consider. F4 had all sorts of rather trivial things to track. They didn't include that here. It didn't accidentally drop off, it was excluded.
---
So why would they track it, without displaying it? I could see if they want to introduce it as new feature, that they might track it, but not just currently show it. Hell the tracking could have been even clientside only because it's mostly meaningless, and only track atom criteria things server side.
---
Outside of planned future update, I don't see why they would track things that aren't displayed. It's not something that is required or useful for internal mechanics, it's just trivia to the player.
---
Fuck me dude, I'm sorry. I haven't played 76 in like a month. I believe I server hopped. I was on the final mission of the BoS, and I just bolted to the cave with the scorchbeasts inside of it. Scorched followed me, and I couldn't get them below 1hp. They just wouldn't die. I know I fixed it, so it must have been just quitting my game and restarting it. 
---
How about having to grind for 10 of every pure flux to build a paint can, the hair of 1000 yao guais for a brush, and then you can buy the actual paint from the atom shop for 2000 atoms (one time application, cannot be traded.)
---
PC? Xb1? Nintendo DS? Any details? Can you replicate the glitch?
---
&gt; So are we thinking that 900 hour guy spent about an hour a day doing nothing but crafting ammo?
---
Shit, I've done that and I have an 8-5 M-F job. I can't play nearly as much, but I play co-op with my wife and she loves her heavy weapons. We churn through a ton of .50 and 5mm.
---
&gt; Knowing which server I was on, It would allow me to easily reconnect to a server I disconnect to. 
---
But that's the same thing as a rejoin server option so you wouldn't need to know what server you're on if there's a prompt that pops up asking if you would like to join that same server after being disconnected. 
---
Yup.
---
Also I have the BoS Combat armor chest piece but I can’t find the others anymore
---
ya this “items passed through the account” has gotta be one of the worst metrics for cheating I’ve ever heard of. So some random player who doesn’t look at the subreddit every day or constantly follow news about dupes finds a suitcase at the train station with insane amounts of goods in it. They’re excited and think they found a treasure trove and pick up the items. That person is banned in this system. The system lends itself to false positives because just having or touching an extreme amount of items does not instantly mean that player is a duper. It is more likely to be sure but the people assuming Bethesda is 100% accurate with this are extremely misguided and don’t understand simple logic. What’s terrifying is these crazies are allowed to serve on jury duty with this terrible reasoning!
---
But if us 'sensitive cry babies' never said anything. And we all just didn't care when companies broke their promises, like you obviously dont. Then the p2w aspect will only get bigger. I don't get the name calling and talking down to me though, people like you usually stay away from Reddit. That's why I like this place. I'd rather have a serious discussion/debate. But have a nice day Filthy76CasualSex. 
---
Obviously I was just saying the wrong thing. Why you being such a dick? 
---
They could add the ability to craft legendary mods for an crazy amotof resource or something 
---
Uranium fever mine place has some too
---
I've had 1 visitor flatten about half of my camp suddenly and without provocation after they hung out, played my instruments, and looked around.   Everyone else has been totally fine.   I try not to let one douchenozzle make me worry about what other people are going to do most of the time....though I must admit, I do have my black powder rifle selected, loaded, and put away, along with some plasma grenades.
---
Someone who irritates other players for the sake of irritating them, especially when they want no part of it.
---
Sorry yeah it's on PC and it's Everytime I log in. They never save. For instance I always keep one gun saved to the first slot but it's never there when I log out and back in. 
---
I literally made my reddit account to try to disprove all the fake shit going around about the game 
---
Flaming meteors!
---
The reason why I had this quest because in breach and clear I've gotten 2 1 stars. I wanna scrap and build one better
---
True there. 
---
I'm looking into becoming a billionaire with a Rocketeer style jet pack to add in a future update to my summer space station home.
---
Name calling was unnecessary I agree and apologize.  But you need to get it our of your head that this was pay 2 win. That's my issue here. How preposterous and overblown people are making this outfit thing. You tubers are now reporting it 2 weeks after the fact like it's some big news. 
---
It was NOT pay to win. Get it through your skull. Jesus. 
---
Destroying other people's bases is a game mechanic and its not broken in anyway. You could have prevented him from doing so by simply logging instead of staring at him in "shock." Go raid someone else's base and get into the spirit of the game instead of calling for global changes to suit your play style? 
---
Actually 1771 times to be exact ;)
---
It says other players may initiate PvP. It could say that on main  screen too, because any given time other players may initiate PvP. They don't require your permission or co-operation on the matter. 
---
If they mean something else with it, they could have sure wrote it better. I think they meant something like PvP without slap or whatever.
---
&gt; lack content after playing it for 500 hours
---
500 hours is a lot.  And the appeal of CoD is it's MP.  The mechanics are meant to be solid so it keeps you coming back.  The campaign is more of a side attraction.
---
And which AAA game in the last decade had a 50-60 hour campaign?  What about FO3 and New Vegas?
---
I was working on my camp once when someone shot me-- turns out I had a new neighbor that was concerned I was so close to their camp. I didn't have a mic at the time so I just ran over and waved repeatedly and sent hearts. Ever since then when I get close to someone's camp I do a wave to signal I'm not there to wreck their camp.
---
has anybody nuked the beohemoth?  he has a pretty much guaranteed spawn point. 
---
I posted a whole thing on this and a video a youtuber did with ideas to better the legendary drops. You kill a 3 star enemy in the game it can drop 1 of 342,000 different things... that's stupid high. I'd love the mod deconstruct or perk cards required to remove/add effects. But even something like make specific bosses or enemy types drop certain types of weapons/armor. Or certain types of legendary effects. Give ppl reason to go hunt bears or gulpers or bugs. Not just whitesprings/SBQ only. 
---
This would give purpose to all those crap items ppl get and just drop in bags, someone could use them finally. And it would be nice when you get a good effect but on a crap weapon.
---
Fair enough. I just think a lot of people will buy everything if they think it gives them the slightest advantage. 
---
I nuke Lewisburg a lot I tend to find it good for legendaries and fighting enemies 
---
What exactly is the issue your worried about with the SBQ?
---
The queen is still kill able, people just have to use more tactics like the cryolater and keeping her stunned/staggered on the ground to get in damage, rather than the brute strength previously used.
---
Make sure your team is repaired and ready at the drop site before you launch, you can leave one person @ the silo, who has a back up/repaired gun for the SBQ fight and once everyone is ready, they can launch the nuke and join the group who has already started the attack.
---
Just like the silo, speed is key. You want to get as much damage in as quick as you can after she spawns. As more people show up to the SBQ fight her health gets buffed for each new person. Hopefully you dont end up with too many &lt;50 duders and you'll succeed.
---
The one time I did Breach and Clear I only got a 1 star Nocturnal armor piece, when I was level 90 sonething, and none of the loot from the drill loaded for me.
---
Somebody build a script to randomize this! Hit the button = here is your challenge
---
.50cal is the most durable out of the bunch. over-repaired it lasts for as long as my shotgun.
---
Goooooooood yes now I shall be the greatest deacon wannabe in the multiverse!!!!!!!
---
Its not working then lmfao. Maybe its because people have played it and experianced it and have spread word of mouth......hmmmm crazy theory right?
---
When they take away the chance to miss when my cross hairs are absolutely dead center body of mass, I'll stop using VATS.  Or make bullets easier to come by ;-)
---
I only use VATS at close range since my only good weapon is a sniper with a long recon scope, and the hip fire accuracy on that thing blows.  I do need a nice sidearm, but haven't run across one yet.
---
Wow you really went back and added it up. Maybe you should write a few more essays so you can learn how to summarize. Let me do it for you
---
You: "I bought a multiplayer game that's working as intended but what I should have bought was FO4"
---
You can make the workshop claiming cost 600. I don't know where it max but 500 is fairly easy. 
---
I don't know if the PvP can be initiated by destroying workshop items, avoiding the claiming price.
---
All those hate videos are pathetic. Most contain no constructive criticism it's just a video guaranteed to get views as people subconsciously live negatively and it makes them feel better to crap on something. 
---
You really need to get a life. It's really sad that a game you hate so much lives in your head rent free 24/7.
---
Move on
---
If you are killed in the build menu, then they didn't contest the workshop. We can already contest workshops from anywhere in the area now, which is clearly indicated to whoever owns it currently.
---
Thanks for your dedication. Modders love me you have made the Fallout what it is today. 76 is the game that needs modders the most!
---
They should take on the SBQ with 2-5 sub level 40 players hiding in the warehouse!
---
Here's how I would tweak that build: 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=69445df&amp;d=pp2p02sg0c72lk2lv2lr2l10l21au1a72am2a00a30ar0er0ic4pd0pk0pl0lt2sd0sp0so0s01eh2a80a40&amp;w=&amp;n= 
---
It looks like you're going for a VATS build so I kept that mostly in tact. The second and third rank in any damage perk are a bad investment in my opinion. You're better off getting the base/expert/master at level one, putting three ranks into Bloody Mess and using the remaining three perks elsewhere. That will get you to about 150% damage for three less perks than it would take to get to 160%. You're also going to be spamming criticals all the time so you probably won't miss that little extra damage anyway.
---
You're also going to be hurting on strength with only one point. You're going to be constantly over encumbered and it's going to get annoying very quick. A few more points in strength and Bandolier will help immensely. You'll still be encumbered a lot though.
---
Shotguns are fun did the extra strength points will also help you in that area. 
---
Fireproof will help against the scorchbeast attacks. If you find a dense chest armor mod you'll be basically immune to them.
---
Born Survivor is nice to have as a solo player since things can kind of get away from you at times. It's definitely saved my life a number of times.
---
Other things you'll want to have but won't leave active all the time: hacking and lockpick, ammosmith, chemist, armorer, super duper.
---
Which is not ideal, but I still would prefer they give as many tools to the people that run the servers as possible including turning on or off PvP mode entirely based around that server's targeted demographic.
---
#NO!
---
SOME OF US WANT TO PVP AND WANT TO PLAY IN SURVIVAL MODE TO EACAPE THE TOXIC PVE CAREBEARS. 
---
#JUST LET US LEAVE ALREADY!!!
---
Yeah the new game to hate is Anthem. Fallout 76 should get less heat in March.
---
I like the size but I wish they had a border.
---
It's never going to end. Besides, if someone is going to let an angry manchild think for them then the game is probably better for not having them around.
---
Maybe, just no repair on legendaries then?
---
It was 1200 before the patch that changed all the vendor plan stuff.
---
Do you have 100k colas?
---
He has said that people have often screwed with him while moving items and that he has dropped it and picked it back up with the same account fat fingering alt tabbing to the main account.   2k rounds of shotgun ammo weighs over 10 pounds with bandolier maxed, 10k rounds of ultracite would way a lot even with bandolier,  especially in a game where weight is so limited.
---
In most scenarios you wouldnt have a reason to move ammo back and fourth, but if you only carry the ammo for the gun you are using right then you would have reasons to drop all the ammo from that gun off then pick it back up later when you go back to that gun.
---
I'm not saying he didnt cheat, I'm simply pointing out  that the evidence as well as his past history for months of his posts suggests it's more then plausible that he was wrongfully banned.
---
If you accidentally looted a brown bag then found out it contained a stack of 1mil steel you would get banned.  Even if you took that steel and dropped it, you would still be banned because the system would show you aquired it.  The system should guarantee the ban does not also target innocent players, or if its terms are like they are now, the system should allow for appeals with Bethesda looking at every claim of wrongdoing.

I currently run a Stealth/Sniper Build on my main Character, but am planning a Heavy Weapons built for my next.
---
My Main uses Rifles SG, &amp; Unarmed (DC Gauntlet), Don't even have a Melee weapon on him, High PER, &amp; AGI, Low CHA, &amp; END, and balanced on STR, &amp; INT.
---
A Heavy Weapons build will require giving up some PER &amp; INT for Max STR. 
---
To be fair, humans are very selfish animals that revert to baser instincts when faced with life or death survival situations. 
---
Also, just think about the dozens (hundreds?) of the best and brightest (read: highly competitive) people all cooped up in a very small space for twenty years, sure there will be friendships, but I'd be willing to bet tensions were getting pretty high.
---
That's why it absolutely makes sense that some of the vault dwellers would group up and others would fight amongst each other for resources, etc.
---
Once a week you can potentially get Heavy BOS Combat Armor pieces off the corpse of Lizzy Taggardy at the end of the Glassed Cavern. For raw protection, this appears to be the best armor you can get outside of legendary.
---
I would love to have free fast travelling 
---
Ah ok makes sense now. Hope they will add it. Any idea where to farm for union hat plans?
---
That’s not true, it’s spreads by a false rumor popping up (lunchboxes) someone makes a click bait YouTube video, this leads to more clickbait YouTube videos, and then gaming “news” media outlets get ahold of the false info and spread it. 
---
I want an item like the “one violent night” jukebox that draws in local wildlife, you could then setup traps and turrets and make a tower-defense game in your CAMP
---
I never saw the camp as being a base. When you go camping you just take essentials with you, not an entire house (well some people do) so I never saw it as that. Fallout 4 called them settlements and they fuctioned as such just as how the camp functions as a camp. This doesn't mean I disagree with you. A lot of people wanted better building and to have settlements similar to fo4. I do think it sounds awesome to be able to do that, but I didn't expect it from the advertising. My group built our camps somewhat close to each other to be neighbors, but to your point, you still have to be somewhat far
---
Now you're thinking like a Bethesda Dev.
---
Go back to playing Fortnite ,and leave us alone already with this bs.
---
I didn't say you should leave the game, I said if your looking to PvP you might want to look elsewhere. I don't think Bethesda knows what they want. PvP is a broken mess where guns can ignore slap damage and trolls can grief you even if you don't want to fight. This is my opinion, but anyone who says they enjoy PvP, only enjoys it because they get to bully people and feel superior. The balancing is a joke, the fact that your forced to use a certain set of weapons just to be viable is a testament to this games lack of true pvp. Hell even ark has better PvP and that games a shit show. I'm calling it now, if survival is made to cater to people who just want to kill players and set their progress back, this game will die far quicker than people already say it is.

/u/jessBethesda will there be an ITV today?

But the rain effect makes skin in 76 look uniformly glossy and desaturated, almost like chrome.
---
It looks wrong, tbh, kind of like the shadows in the Savage Divide.  It wouldn't surprise me if it was.
---
Still? I mean, hasn't this outrage already come and gone? 
---
I have thought about this as well. It was the unsung hero of FO4 to add another layer of the universe in RL. 
---
You would be ignorant to think nothing is wrong with this game. I enjoyed it and still play time to time, but I couldn't recommend wholeheartedly. As far as convincing the masses, good luck, people like to hate.
---
The atom shop purchase unlocked the headwear category but still no dice on the Confederate hat. Someone else in this thread mentioned the plan itself is bugged so I'll wait till they get around to patching that one.
---
I was offering an peaceful option to not contest as I stated in my above post.
---
Yeah I think that would be more interesting, making legendaries unable to be repaired and acting as a one time use. Actually that's a really good idea, would bring an end to the meta or running only legendary gear.
---
"You were accused of murder so you must be a murderer" - the logic of this subreddit.

Most likely, they were in a xbox party together. Game chat is sometimes spotty, so parties are the way to go.

Scorchbeast queen.  Legendaries glow green at first when they spawn in.

I'm spending every second finishing a mission/gathering resources. Fighting off another player who is bored and or looking to stroke their open doesn't appeal to me. In fact its frustrating I dont care if its immersion breaking for you if I'm not frustrated just trying to play a game.
---
Ooooo get em 
---
K. Good to know.
---
Pretty sure all of them were pre-patch drops.  I've been moving plans to other characters and had 2 stashed.  One alt each on 2 accounts.  I think one of the plans was actually the original 'glitch' plan my main read, but then the plan didn't consume it just changed to Known in my inventory.
---
They both learned them yesterday because i spent some time moving a bunch of crap around.
---
Wonder if it's level locked.  199 read pre-patch, can't craft.  15 and 5 post-patch and they can craft.  I guess if I level them higher and it vanishes, then we know.  But I'm not leveling them fast.
---
thanks, I just cleared it and reapplied and it is working again.
---
Likely, it makes no sense to hand out server software for large title like this.
---
The Crosshair, a teeny tiny raider camp at the very tippy top of the map northeast of the lumber camp has a reliable set of raider power armor.
---
Blackwater Mine, a quick jaunt from Whitespring Station should have a set of raider armor in one of the sheds.
---
Clarksburg, just northwest of Grafton should have a set of raider armor in a repair shed.
---
But as kind of a general rule, if you're on a raider armor hunt, a lot of the raider camps in the Savage Divide (Seneca Camp, Ripper Alley) have a chance to spawn raider armor.
---
I got one from a rooftop there was a chair with a table and a pie. Never from a machine
---
If you don't want to contest it, you'll have to leave.
---
Or, you can max your remaining budget out with rocket/shotgun turrets and dare them to take it.
---
How do you keep that in budget?
---
High luck helps them to be collected 😁
---
Balistic vs energy resistance maybe? 
---
Many cheaters didn't get in trouble, many innocent people did. Same with every banwave ever.
---
Which is exactly why this ban system is ridiculously stupid. I feel bad for the devs since they’re obviously working with limited tools since this game is still about six months to a year from being ready for launch but to use this as your ban method is pretty poor. You can tell how little control over the playerbase they actually have. 
---
I blundered into a ScorchBeast battle being fought by much higher level players.   One of them died, so I stood guard over his bag until he respawned.   Since I shared in the XP, it was the least I could do.

---
I normally have fairly good experiences with it. I unlock them all, loot, and I'm normally over weight or near it when done.
---
The funny thing about the swords they are one star but have 3 effects on them
---
Yeah, I believe it also assigns them in alphabetical order.  When I have Anti-Armor, Instigating and Vampire Combat Knives, and had the latter two assigned, it would always default to Anti-Armor each login.
---
IDK... The second thing you said seems more like a strategy and not a grief
---
I have this problem if I have 2 of the same type of gun saved. One is always un favorited
---
I haven't launched a nuke yet (level 93 here), because I've been playing the game over-encumbered and couldn't make it there in time. I have helped kill SBQ once since I was in Watoga and was able to get there in time.  I have the access card so I'm ready.  I am working on reducing weight with the new stash increase.  I probably shouldn't carry around 200+ stimpaks.  :) 
---
assaultrons wreck me in every game, usually i can take mr. gutsy’s with a melee build 
---
I have eagle eyes and covert operator, and use calibrated receivers.
---
I've never see Sneak Attack crits report anything but 2.5x. I swear that VATS criticals used to report the multiplier, but have said Critical Strike since the stealth change which messed up AI audio detection.
---
Or just drop it on the ground. Apparently that causes people to get banned.
---
One other thing, when building your Camp, if you decide to go big, build narrow, tall, and wide at the top, if you want to. Why build tall and narrow?   Because a lot of the land is uneven and surrounded by trees and a narrow profile structure fits better.
---
I'm pretty sure they have some Anti-Armor property on their shots.
---
As a follow-up, this is not intended and we're investigating the issues surrounding Adrenal Reaction that sprang up following Patch 6 release.
---
The reset is 20 IRL hours after you have affected a vendors cap stash.
---
If you visit a vendor during the reset period and affect its caps again by buying/selling, it resets the cooldown period. This cooldown is shared with all vendors of that Faction.
---
Ie. You clean out a vendor at 6 pm, that vendors cap supply will reset to 200 at 2 pm the next day. If that same first day you visit that vendor again later at 9pm and buy/sell something to him, the new reset time for that faction is 5 pm instead of 2 pm or 20 hrs after 9 pm.

Here's my biggest beef as a filthy casual player of fo76:
---
T-Posing baddies are back. The bug that was in the so-called "B.E.T.A." on day one and was fixed before so-called "go live" has been back since 2 patches again.
---
Walk into a room, there's a t-posing ghoul, shoot at him and suddenly he's getting up off the ground, and your shot missed.
---
Thank for apologizing. I'm not frustrated or anything. I have just seen how companies like EA, Activision and Ubisoft slowly get more and more aggressive with their microtransactions and p2w, so slowly and sneaky that people don't notice until it's too late. It's honestly just because I'm a Bethesda fan that I'm even writing here, because I don't want them to become that. But I'm outta here now. Not enjoying the vibe in this thread. Have a nice evening folks, I'll probably try out the new f76 patch tomorrow.
---
I suggest looking at The Crosshair...
---
[https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/The\_Crosshair\_Power\_Armor](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/The_Crosshair_Power_Armor)
---
That's where I went to farm Raider PA in the past as a low level, but if you have a higher level character then Wade Airport and Gorge Junkyard trailers are locked and most lower levels can't open them, so they have a good chance of having the PA spawn still intact.  Be careful approaching the trailer at Wade though, there's frag mines inside that I've activated before so if you don't have Fireproof/dense torso it might hurt!
---
If you don't want to defend your workshop, then you leave. If you don't want to contest a workshop, then don't activate the claim function to contest it. Same results, less overhead.
---
The vegan one shouldn’t restrict you from killing animals if they are trying to kill you, especially the scorched since they are pretty much trying to make you go extinct.  
---
You can already craft higher durability items as your int factors into it.  A low health unyielding crafter with 30+ int can make items with vastly better durability than you can possibly find as a drop.  
---
So there already is an advantage to crafting PA specifically as this is the only class of item that has zero legendary effects, and the top end PA is always crafted.  
---
That said I like this idea, and imo would give crafting a nice niche though they would need to cap the level at some point as you have people with 500+ levels and beyond.
---
r**i**der, not r**ai**der, people.
---
Mods on?
---
fandom has a great mobile app too
---
That is not entirely true. I complainted about 2 weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anrgea/_/efvywdf/).
---
The real problem is that Bethesda promised multiple times that the atomic shop/microtransactions would only contain cosmetics. And what have got? Some skins with an additional bonus (for a limited amount of time). TBH there would be a much larger uproar if they would have sold them with a permanent bonus. But you can also see it that way: After a week those skins loose their bonus - or it gets patched.
---
Nevertheless, they sold something which increases our stats. And health is one primary stat. It is no minor stat like stealth detection or something like that. This stat effects every build, independently of our playstyle. Further, FO76 is an always-PVP game. You can't turn off PVP. Even with pacifist enabled you take some (minor) PVP damage. So an additional bonus (even for a limited amount of time) is a huge deal.
---
And at last you **have to buy** different outfits if your are playing in a team and want to **min/max** during this period of time. If you are short on atoms or lazy, you have to/can buy them with cash. And per definition: if you can buy something, which gives you an ingame advantage (and **additional health** in an **always-PVP** game is a **big deal**), it is **PAY TO WIN.** Yes, you can theoretical farm the ingame skin for the bonus, but what if the RNG-god doesn't like you?
---
So?! Shitstorm incoming?! Because I think when we would allow Bethesda to break their promise for microtransactions, we will get:
---
* more of this shit - more atomic shop items with (temporary) ingame advantages
---
* this shit for a longer time - increase the duration for 2-4 weeks or even permanent
---
* shit, what would have been free otherwise - I have the bad feeling that they will start to sell us Fallout 4 skins for atoms, instead as free giveaway
---
I thought it was funny too.
---
Let me explain what military strength is to you. As a biological organism you should probably take heed since this is realistic.
---
If you are a military contractor - like the famous analogy of working on the Death Star - you have the same status as a active soldier. You're an active participant in combat even if conscripted.
---
You're shopping and building and becoming more powerful thus you're a threat to other players.
---
Instead of whining @ Bethesda the smart thing to do is find a team. Have at least one of them stand guard.
---
Find 2 teams! Why not post your contact info so 8 players can protect each others workshops? Find 25 pactifists and fill a server!
---
That is objectively why Bethesda should not change; realism and you already have the power. Debate me...or get emotional and just downvote proving me right.
---
Glad you got your mods removed!
---
Mother.  Fucking.  Health.
---
NO ONE see a minor health bonus available for one week and says "Oh shit, I need to drop $8 on that right now!"
---
Standard Attack vs Power Attack damage ratings.
---
This also happens to me PC. I was keeping guns in slot 1, 2, and 3. Every time I logged on the active gun is moved to slot 2 and the other two were off the wheel. I just dropped down to carrying two guns. Tonight I’ll see if the game likes that better. All three guns were identical except for the legendary effect. I think this is what triggers the glitch. 
---
"anyone who says they enjoy PvP, only enjoys it because they get to bully people and feel superior"

You are wrong, toxic, arrogant and have no idea what youre talking about. Please leave me be.

IF YOU COMMENT FURTHER YOU ARE BULLYING ME TO FEEL SUPERIOR
---
I prefer to refute these claims when I stream.  These youtubers who do this simply hurt the game.  Its important to make sure people know the truth.  I feel as a youtuber I need to assist with getting real info out.

Right, “in game economy”..... that’s hilarious.

Glad you're back and that sounds... right.

---
So no you don't need server browser. If you have a server browser, the next thing you want all sorts of other metrics.
---
Here is a list of the most petty suggestions ever. Added yours to the list.
---
Bethesda needs to hire new people.
---
We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
Anyone feel like FO/76 would have been considerably better as co-op only and not PVP?
---
Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
Passive mode should make it to where other players can’t kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable
---
Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
[Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
I’m quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
Please let screws be one of the materials gained from scrapping weapons, like in FO4.
---
Free Fast Travel between stations?
---
All Bulked Items Should “Weigh” Less than the Sum of Their Components. 
---
Travel Agent perk-lvl2 move your camp for free or at a reduced price. Lvl3 fast travel while over encumbered(free or pay caps)
---
Instead of expanding the storage limit, how about craftable Stash boxes with weight reducing properties? 
---
Give. Me. A. Fridge. 
---
For the love of god make VATS stop targeting friendlies if i'm in passive mode. 
---
The studio's enthusiasm needs to match the player community or we won't have the stamina to last until changes are made
---
Bethesda please give us the ability to either sell or scrap ammunition 
---
My one wish from Bethesda is more stash space
---
Now that all the duped items are gone, can we get an increase on vendor cap limits?
---
Let technical data stack, and give us a bigger reward for more data.
---
Try relogging
---
I find him entertaining and occasionally insightful. However, in the end I suppose it really boils down to "just another youtuber."
---
Makes sense, unless you're someone who randomly attacked a much weaker player, stole their scrap, and now their only recourse is to make your life miserable the rest of the day. 
---
Well if you play PS4 and need a pack mule let me know then, with the right perjs equipped ajd in my Excavator Armor I've got like 500 carry weight, and I can drink Whiskey with Party Girl 3 to make it 530 if needed.
---
The game has been out for 3 months or so.  You want the highest possible weapon ranking to be available already?  What about in 3 months, you want them to introduce 10 star weapons?  I would prefer a way to craft your own star weapons.  Right now you can create a 1 star weapon by adding the sacrificial blade to a machete, but there's no way to get other ones made.  I want a way to take the RNG out of it and design my own legendary weapon.
---
It happens when you have multiple weapons of the same type, but with different prefixes (like Instigating Combat Knife and Vampire's Combat Knife).  One will always be deselected every time you login.
---
Bethesda knows of it, and that prefixes are the issue, but didn't fix it in Patch 6.
---
No thanks, it is too much work to level two characters. 
---
Upvote for creative, downvote for Whitesprings camping
---
As someone mentioned before.  Check your RAM profile/timings if you have overclocked it.  
---

---
Can't even help if we don't know what system you're on. Things have been fine on xb1. I haven't had that issue in awhile. 
---
I too, did not cheat. Those of us who have not, are awesome. 
---
I think some of you are missing my point which is valid. As a fan of the series since 97’ you had an option to play the game with peaceful options. It’s a suggest since it tagged as such. I’m not whining to Bethesda. 
---
and people defend this game to the death LOL.
---
I beat one last night, with maybe 20 seconds left on the clock. It was super close. A team of maybe 8-10 people. all high level. TSEs were being used among other guns. I was using an AA gatling gun. 
---
It was oddly the most difficult SBQ fight I have had. the off putting part was the distinct lack of other spawned legendaries for the mobs. 
---
Then there was a whole server glitch, while I didn't get kicked, it took a full 5+minutes for scorched earth event to register on my screen and for rewards to list. I could immediately look the SBQ, but it took that same 5+ minutes for it to register in my inventory. Meat piles took up to 10 minutes to register loot. 
---
It was pretty odd. Something happened. 
---
Thanks. I'll give it a read
---
Thanks for the thoughtful advice. I will without judgement until I try it with my team and will definitely keep your tips in mind. 
---
Shoot them in their thruster... If it doesn't kill them in one shot it royally screws with their ability to hit you.
---
Another thing I was too dumb to realize quickly: When you take over a workshop build extractors.
---
Endgame= relocate camp every day lol
---
Sorry you didn’t bother to post from a real account so I’m good on “debating” you.
---
LMAO.  Slight abuse, but would be hilarious for them to use dev tools to TP them into the event XD
---
All we ever wanted was some damn communication
---
Notice when you ask for proof they all just shut up and don't reply?   This dude got the banhammer.unfairly.    
---
Hell I had to.fight Bethesda for a month to get my account back when they told me "no one.should have 3500+caps" and accused me.of cheating.  I had to literally walk them day by day through my entire journey from vault exit.to ban telling them what.items.i thought I sold to the npc tradebots or other players in my friends list before.they even looked at unbanning me.  
---
I find it hilarious that how many people complain about the depth of the game and yet cheat their way through it.
---
Not just better durability, but better damage resistance as well. Looks like each point of int adds 1 point for DR after you hit craft.
---
Not really worried about the cloth, it's only 1 per hat.  :) 
---
The new PA Armors are listed as R**i**der - Plague Rider, War Rider, Black Rider, Pale Rider in the files. I need R**ai**der armor to do the other armors.
---
&gt;It is cosmetic. There was a weekly event buff.
---
Oh. I completely didn't get that concept.
---
Soo...if they sell a skin, which "gets buffed" to increases your carry weight by +1000, it would be also fine? Let's say this "buff" lasts for 1 month or 1 "season". It would be fine, because the skin has no bonus, but gets buffed?!
---
If it's working as intended, then why do they seek input and make changes? Pretty weak argument.
---
Thank you. I am using xbox1.
---
Like i said i plan on doing all of them.
---
That would also work. But where would the loot go? Back to your stash? I'm for this or it can be anti griefd.
---
Did not re-apply mutation, kept old mutation.  
---
Starved to zero, had some rad meds active.   
---
Drank some waters.  
---
No effect on damage, high or low hit points. 
---
*Comments* 
---
It’s not useful to say “I don’t need to read” honestly. I was going off what I had read in many threads and comments on this sub about the queen being possibly buggy. However other comments I’ve now read are saying this may not be true which is good. I’ll reserve judgement until I try her myself. 
---
I understand how workshops work. I was just suggesting a new feature.

No they are both prefixes. Zealot works against all Scorched.

Well that sucks, everyones gonna be at work. I realize *they* are at work during that time too.
---
Except for mr. 900, he'll be there lol.
---
I agree. I posted above we did one with around 20 seconds left on the clock. It probably would of been more like a couple minutes but it too until 10 minutes left for the crowd to start actually focusing on the queen. When she would land only about half of the group started gunning her. 
---
Strategies need to adapt. I know people want to milk adds, but it looks like the fight got a bit harder recently. 
---
and it isn't a TSE nerf, because I did some SBQs right after that and was easily killing her around the 10 minute mark with \~10 person groups. 
---
Very helpful - thank you. I like the idea of staging someone at the silo to help later. 
---
Too cool, I haven't come across one yet.  Thank you for the info!
---
I'm not suggesting scrapping survival mode at all. 
---
I'm saying PvP all you want to, but with people who want to. 
---
Kind of like real life. If you want to take up kick boxing, feel free, but there are people who don't want to be drop-kicked and if you violate that expectation, there are REAL consequences. 
---
So, i'm saying the current consequences actually encourage you to be an idiot and attack random people, so we should change them. Attack someone who doesn't want to be attacked and you get a disease for a full day. Alternately, if you don't want to risk a disease, just change the settings so you can't screw with pacifist people, since clearly you must be incapable of exerting any kind of self control over your actions. 
---
Not real?
---
Yeah, thing is, on PC we don't.
---
Actually, does that survive actual client crash like you say? I don't know how consoles work. On PC we have recent players list, but that only survives disconnct, not game client crash or restart. But anyway you can't join their server.
---
I agree that you’re a ridiculous tool.
---
holy shit playing the game permanently overencumbered sounds unbearable. That's why I only wear the excavator armor, cuz fuck that
---
It helps if you are wearing mothman gear from the atomnshop as well 
---
Yeah i used to do workshops but then the game freezes and i lose everything so no workshops for me untill theres so feature when you can get back to the server u were on. 
---
I am totally that guy. Floating ladder with two couple platforms to hold the crafting stations.
---
Minimum effort...but I do it because I move frequently.  
---
Big bases are good when you reach the end game and tend to farm a specific loop or near nuke zones. But they aren’t much use for someone exploring and leveling and aren’t spending long in one place. 
---
Bud, I'm in no position to argue this. I'm just saying that several people in this thread have already said it happened to them. 
---
Oh absolutely, that's why I/she/we aren't really crazed about it.
---
Just pointing out that there could absolutely be some fringe cases of mistaken bans.
---
I realy dont get why people cheat. It makes The game boring. The only game that got funnier by cheating was GTA san andreas 😅
---
been using dxtory since release to lock the fps.
---
New Vegas has a 60 hour campaign? Lol.
---
Anddd...... now your banned for being piggish
---
You obviously never knew anyone with compulsive gambling issues. How serious it can be. These are plentiful among gamers, and especially the so called 'whales' that do play a lot. I'm just worried it's gonna  escalate, again I don't think the buff itself is the issue. Have a nice evening. 
---
No, bad idea.  The BOS plan will come back I'm sure, but the point of a different character is different knowledge.  Personally I thought they should have limitations on what plans you can learn.  You have to have a particular Perk card leveled or min Intelligence to be able to learn the plan.  
---
Why should a 1 Intelligence caveman know how to build a Fusion Reactor?
---
Mr Gutsy's are the biggest threat in the game. If you get 2 together it's painful, if you get 3 firing together, you die before your dang stimpack can proc.

There is no handmade *rifle* plan, only handmade *gun* (the AK-47-looking thing with the shovel handle for a stock). That's the one you want. 1530ish with Hard Bargain 3 at Watoga or from Harper's Ferry.
---
The wheel seems to be broken after patch. I had a hunting rifle overriding my two shot sniper.
---
nice, I will try there!
---
&gt; I can guarantee you 200% that not a single person who bought any of  these outfits did so because they desperately wanted a minor health  boost for a week.
---
Funny. Because /u/chirpes said a few posts above, that:
---
&gt; My discord group did, because it stacked when using unique costumes and made group PvP more tolerable. 
---
And health in a always-PVP game is not a minor stat like sneak detection. So there are a bunch of people for sure that bought that just for that "fucking" health bonus.
---
He means you can't bring your main character across. Would defeat the purpose of survival if you could bring your level 100 plus with xo1 and all your TSE weapons 
---
sorry dude dont know what to tell ya, im not a PVP player who fights anyone outside of workshops unless they are wanted. i dont fight random players i come across.  thats why ur statement made no sense to me at first, if u didnt want to spend time fighting players u wouldn't own a workshop. i want more of that action, and u want none of it.  this is why we are asking for separate servers to cater to different styles of play.  changing pacifist mode only solves the problem for players like you, not for players like me.  when survival mode launches we wont be on the same servers and that solves the problem for me, but if they dont make this change to pacifist mode, maybe it wont change it for you.   we need both changes to appease the player base, not one or the other.  that is what OP is missing with this post, it only caters to the anti-pvp playerbase.
---
Happened to a pretty full team last night as well. 
---
I agree that the queen shouldn't. Be easy to kill. I don't have enough experience to really comment on it. 
---
That's a solid shot! Great job!
---
I noticed this happening when I keep a single razorgrain growing inside my cabin to repair my fertilizer produer outside. I have left my camp picking the razorgrain and dropping in my stash very last so it will be ready to pick when I return and upon return I have no razorgrain to repair with. XB1 player
---
The one and only time I was attacked by a visitor was when a very low-level guy straight out of V76 came into my open CAMP and started whacking me with a board or something.
---
I just stood there in my tuxedo and looked at him.   Eventually he ran away.   My Marine Armor was effective.
---
Only saw him once last night, flew away when I shot him.  I've only ever killed him once in 200+ hours.
---
&gt;I've heard there is some mechanics in play that prevent world spawns from showing up to you if you've collected them that day.  But, I never had to farm a spot more than once every other day so I can't be sure.
---
I have personally seen this. I scoured a nearby location one morning and then revisited it that evening. Somethings were there but most of the better things and even some of the farmable junk (things with steel, springs, etc) were not. Additionally none of the containers had anything.
---
This is so great!! Thank you for sharing!
---
Have you tried your system since the patch?
---
Need to walk up to bodies and search em like ya would with butchers bounty perk. On xb1 it's y button. You draw it that way.
---
Lol they aren't listening to the community. Don't kid yourself. Temporarily the communitys goals and their goals lined up for like one patch and now everyone thinks they listen.
---
Ah i forgot about flux too. yeah that'd be tough. Well, we'll see what happens I guess. Not even sure i want to play anymore now anyway. 
---
Cool. That's what I was hoping but I didn't want to spend my hard-earned caps without confirming. 
---
Haha nice 
---
Fire rate with armor piercing rounds
---
Haven't used it much but it doesn't feel slow. Rate of fire seems decent. Not fast as all semi-autos of course.
---
Slow are bolt-lock and PB, worst being the Dragon.
---
Containers definitely don't reload for 20 hours... that was a pretty early patch, 1 or 2, IIRC.
---
You can also force respawns there by playing with friends and I tend to do pretty well on getting good drops by doing that 
---
Just look at the history of your account. Unless you are just new to Reddit then welcome to the interwebs.
---
I hear you, that's the main reason I replied, it's become something of an urban legend. 👍😂
---
Yep. I was a victim to two lvl 50’s. My ego told me they were no threat. 
---
I don't disagree with the premise, but BGS has been pretty adament about their intent for workshops to be PvP features. I  don't expect they're going to change it, even after PvP specific servers are introduced.
---
I don't take them for PvP purposes, but I am willing to defend them.
---
You can use a 3rd party overlay but that breaks the Bethesda Launcher after about 10-15sec it freezes. Gotta figure out if you want the FPS meter or launcher to work.
---
My main had the plan glitch too. I read it, it reappeared in my inventory as known, and I traded it away. However, my level 277 friend found a fresh plan after patch 6 and read it and it didn't glitch. So, yeah, maybe level locked. However, I don't know how to interpret the xEdit record to determine if any if the bytes / values represent a level lock. I'll ask on the xEdit forums / discord.
---
The thing is, if you were banned you clearly triggered the system, so even if you claimed to have not duped, you probably looted a dupers bag or picked up a crap tone of colas from a random suitcase. I doubt anyone was truly innocent 
---
Mind if I snag one?
---
I post my PSNid / twitch - Enterres. You're the posers who don't get how reddit can be an organizational tool.
---
Ahhs. Well there goes my dreams lol 
---
I saw the lever action plans and bought it.
---
Looked at my weapons and realized I will NEVER make a lever action rifle. 
---
Botting isn't multiboxing. 
---
I also just went back and double checked yes he does clearly state he has a second character he was also leveling up. Even his explanation includes more than just his main character and his mule. I'm not sure why you are ignoring these things unless you're just looking for any excuse why the guy is in the wrong. I mean you even just tried to tie multiboxing with botting. So it seems like you're just looking for any excuse you can find or manufacture.
---
The numbers on the OP of that link isn't including the things aten_ra points out that with multiple characters each kill gives multiple drops because drops are instanced per character. So with 2 characters that doubles the drops, with 3 it triples, etc. Knowing that these things are true isn't a "call to authority". It is just pointing out that yes this is possible to reach those numbers in a week.
---
Not that any of that even matters as he nevef had that much ammo to begin with, BSG screwed up how they count items you "acquire" and don't differentiate between items that are new to you and items that you had and then transferred to a different character.
---
This can easily be proven quickly if you don't believe me by taking a legendary item you have and putting it in a container like a suitcase, close the suitcases menu and then reopen it and take the legendary item out of it, you'll get the pop up like it was a new item you found. Likewise if you create a new character and then right out of the vault go collect 10 wood and check your achievement tab you will see under collectables "collect 76 wood" will show the 10 you gathered. Now go take that wood and put it in a suitcase and close the interface then open it back up and collect the 10 wood out of it and check that achievement again, it will now say you collected 20 wood, even though you only collected 10 wood total, it will count that 10 wood twice because they have no flag to aee if the item you picked up is an item you already had.
---
Two lore-friendly words: oral tradition. You see, this caveman comes from a line of nuclear physicists, and they pass down family recipes of the fusion variety.
---
This is a good idea but my opinion is that everyone would play the BETA instead of Adventure. People would still be upset about updates they don't like, just 2 weeks sooner than they normally would. 
---
Might work better if BETA was an opt-in lottery, or perhaps forced people to make a new character to play BETA mode with no crossover to "normal" modes. Makes it less gimmicky. 
---
Really like the in-game bug reporting. Frankly it would be a great addition to the esc &gt;&gt; Z) Menu 
---
It isn't rare, I know where 4 sets spawn in Watoga alone. But even still, it is exciting to find either way. Especially the sets you don't know about out in the world, its always cool to find them.
---
Ah i see. Ill have to look into that.
---
i know you arent the OP, but that is what the title of this post suggests, which is why i keep bringing it up.  i do hope most of the adventure mode players dont really want survival mode entirely scrapped.  maybe OP was exaggerating with the title, maybe im a little slow today and being too thick about it.
---
&gt;thought I was having an in game stroke 
---
The game is becoming too real. Did an in game ambulance show up later? 
---
Oh I move around. 
---
I just use a tent. It is called a CAMP after all. 
---
Though I did turn it into a tent "city" last night 
---
Requires reworking netcode and server infrastructure. So I’ll say it again (like I always do on this sub):
---
Making another umpteenth million thread asking for the same thing will not make them work faster. So stop. This sub seriously needs to update it rules about beating dead horses. 
---
I find it odd that they used Pale Rider and Plague Rider as these two are more or less the same. The more widespread of the color vs rider is supposed to be:
---
* White: Pestilence/Conquest/Empire Prosperity (Depending on the iteration)
---
* Black: Famine
---
* Red: War
---
* Pale: Death
---
Even in Fallout Shelter they got the colors vs riders right. I completed the Horsemen of the Post-Apocalypse quest line myself and got Death's Jacket.
---
Yes, there is a risk.  Bethesda hasn't really said addons are OK (though they haven't said otherwise).
---
IMO, the risk is pretty low though, if you're not using it to gain advantage in the game, they likely won't care.
---
There have been menu mods out for a while, and there's been no action against those.  There's even mods that highlight certain objects in game, making them easier to find, which are still around (though I'd maybe be a little leery of ones like that).
---
The ban wave wasn't to sort out the influx of duped weapons, it was more to stem the tide of accounts hording items. While I wish they did do something about the weapons, too many innocent people would lose their items and it wouldn't be good
---
Livin' ain't easy in the wasteland kid.
---
Yeah, on the system itself it remembers recent players and you can join from the xbox home menu not just the in game social tab.
---
Your experience is valid, of course, but it's far from universal. I've been playing since Beta, I have a single character, and I've never traded anything with other players or come within spitting range of hitting even half the max cap limit. To me if it's not built-in to the game then I don't really engage with it, so I'll never go through trader forums or use out of game communication methods. The equipment I use is limited to what I find myself, whether from drops or at vendors. That's just my preference.  I suspect, though I have no way of proving this, that there are a lot of other players with similar experience.
---
I don't begrudge the play style that you and others at the high end enjoy, as it doesn't really impact my experience of the game at all. However, we're all sharing the same finite pool of developer resources. I hope that Bethesda continues to address high-end play, but I also hope that they don't neglect adding more content up and down the chain for those who play more casually.
---
I don't even have tse or notable legendaries aside from chameleon armor.   I'm not willing to relevel a new character.  They already said we can bring our current ones over.   
---
Sure logically it makes more sense but caps are a lot easier to come by than food and water in my opinion. 
---
I did search all the bodies. I am on PC and search is E. I'm going to test again when I get home but I did do that. 
---
Because it's the trade off instead of having to find bottles to fill like in FO4. It's not that big of a deal.
---
Then guess what, they're fucking idiots.  The bonus lasted ONE MOTHER FUCKING WEEK at which point all they had were some neat looking clothes.
---
ONE. MOTHER. FUCKING. WEEK.
---
It works with tick blood, I use it all the time on them 
---
Id rather rip me of their arms off than an assaultron head.
---
Sounds like me with Deathskull Radscorpians. No other NPC in game can kill me as quick and efficiently as those jerks. Even with a medic pump torso. 
---
Can you elaborate on how it should be reported? I want to make my bug reports usable by Devs. 
---
It looks like the armor has the Herps on it.
---
Or you could have just made friends with a duper and got that item that you wanted for free.
---
Wait, they have a cooldown? Who thought that was a good decision? Set reset times works just fine. At best you can get 400 caps from a vender if you time it right, but you then have to wait 24 hours till the reset. So what does it hurt?
---
Tested on 2 servers and all good
---
There's a second search option that will appear, like with Pharma Farma or Scrounger. It's a separate key/button than the normal search option.
---
I don't think they did, unless I missed something as I haven't read the most recent vaults. In the past they mentioned that while it was in beta characters would be seperate. With how survival works, it would be a really bad idea if that was the case and you could come and go as you please.
---
Reboot console. Had this issue a week ago and this fixed it. I found looking at the ground and letting the world load in help freezing. Im on the cheap xb1. 
---
That is stupid. A set 24 hour reset would be better IMO.
---
Couple of three stars? I only get marginal one star crap. Did you do something to help extra stars drop?
---
Finally got around to it! https://m.imgur.com/a/59lfdkx
---
But I agree, PC needs this option as well as in game text chat, on xbox we can send messages to each other pretty quickly..I use the app on my phone (so it's just like texting) and can quickly communicate to other players on the server. 
---
When they announced it they said we could bring our current characters over.  
---
Whales may have compulsion issues but they aren't fucking idiots.  It was a MINOR HEALTH BONUS that lasted ONE MOTHER FUCKING WEEK.
---
A whale player is INFINITELY more likely to throw their money at the limited time offers in the atom shop than over a shit temporary stat boost that they're never even going to notice.
---
Ok , had a little trouble confirming for myself its working. What system are you on ?
---
I have positioned my camp in a heavily trafficked location, with an obvious area for players to craft and collect purified water. I see dozens of players pass through every day. I have had one really bad experience with a destructive troll, but countless others with encounters with players who were encouraging and friendly. Nature of the beast I suppose. 
---
Yes. We killed one last night in fact. On PS4
---
Wow, remove an entire feature of the game to cater to PvP? Terrible idea. I don’t want to do PvP so therefore I can’t take workshops? 
---
Got ya, I didn't see any prompts like that but I will keep it in mind when I get back to the game. 
---
Awesome photos, thanks for sharing these.
---
Anything else it might be useful for?
---
Well, I'll be.
---
PC, ad is not shown in display, but working
---
Have a nice day. 
---
I did not get banned nor did I even consider duping. The adverse affects of the duping can literally spoil the experience for EVERYONE on that same server. It’s really a selfish thing to do. 
---
That's apples and oranges, sure they are both fruit but that doesn't mean they are exactly the same.
---
The guy has a long history of playing a ton, of writing about bugs so Bethesda could fix them, and about disliking people who exploit. 
---
People who are cheating on their spouses don't usually act all high and mighty until they get questioned,  they also often constantly accuse the other of cheating.  They dont write guides about how someone can find out they are being cheated on.  With this logic Bethesda must have a ban process that's flawless because they said it is......despite the fact nothing implemented thus far has been done without having something screwed up with it. 
---
The reality is the implementation is screwed up, and is just another on a long list of mistakes Bethesda has made with this game.
---
Just hop servers.  Every time I do a new build I have to deal with the high level stuff in low level areas.  The trick is to hop servers until they spawn in low.  Its not really that hard.  
---
Also, when I get on a server with my high level characters, sometimes there is low level stuff.  Again, I just hope servers!
---
Ok , only had adrenal reaction for a while so i pretty unfamiliar . Thanks 👍
---
No, but I was wearing a nurse outfit so I could have the full hospital healing experience. Was 10/10
---
Im on ps4 but
---
ahh okay thanks, I have been to the launch site many times and fought inside, I just have not initiated the launch yet because I am confused what I need to do after I do that? Do you get XP for what you kill when the nuke hits? Do you have to run there to collect all the loot? I know these are all noob questions but I am a bit lost with this... :)
---
I got the log-in error yesterday and panicked until I realized I had the caps lock on lol. I did notice and thought it was interesting that the server I was in was almost all low level (like under lvl 20) players. First time  I’ve seen that since beta. 
---
&gt;Why dont you go read all of that guys other threads where he talks constantly about his disdain for exploiters. 
---
Complaining about it doesn't mean he didn't do it. You ever notice that it's always the homophobic politicians and religious leaders that get caught with a male prostitutes? 
---
Np, it is not as strong as it was before, but still good
---
I haven’t had any trouble with them but I also haven’t run into a level 50 one either 
---
Thank you! I will give it go!
---
I am General Joseph Tecumseh Dawson, 5th Division, Reconstituted US Army.

We’ve also gathered key intel, liberated cities, and made patrols and relief missions to safeguard settlement of Appalachia.

---
Another glorious day in THIS MAN’S ARMY!

---
Thats the way it was forever for me, every time I saw him it would just dissapear. Then recently I run into it all the time and can kill it multiple times...
---
In Watoga, it's common for 4 Lv 50s to come after you.
---
Pain in the ass.
---
He wrote the guide after being banned.  Its not a stretch to have someone make thenselves look better to get a free pass
---
I’m kind of in the same boat. Claiming workshops is one if my favorite activities in the game, but not at all because of the PvP aspects. In fact, admittedly, when a workshop of mine gets contested I either just let it go or switch servers. 
---
Obviously, some workshops are much more hotly contested than others. The munitions factory is probably the most hotly contested one, and I’ve pretty much given up on claiming it (especially since I decided to strictly focus on my melee build character rendering munitions nearly  obsolete).
---
Holy shit salty cheater tears.
---
Had one spawn inside my main CAMP building.
---
The Fallout 76 GUI is [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaleform_GFx). AFAIK the mod includes modified copies of the game's own .swf files. Bethesda can't make any meaningful updates to those files without breaking it.
---
If Bethesda had an ongoing beta for upcoming changes, that might give modders a heads-up to fix their mods before release.
---
Exactly. I think that Bethesda is trying to push their limits what we will swallow. Reminds me of the Creation Club. They tried to sell things, which already exists by modders in a better version for free. It backfired the first time they tried. But sadly this is a thing now - they recently added a $12 "DLC" called Forgotten Seasons.
---
There's no math there, it's just a dude spewing gibberish about how he multi-boxes and can collect 250 flux in an hour. 
---
Take the Monorail elevator to the top there are like 5 or 6 bags there spawn is very likely to be there.
---
u/ladydevann
---
#justinit4theflux
---
There are exceptions though.
---
For example, I run a high INT/high LCK build. I can craft T-51b helmets, so I tested the Condition from high Intelligence versus the Condition found on world loot because of high Luck. I collected 10 T-51b Helmets in Watoga, with 15 Luck, then crafted a Helmet with 30 Intelligence. 2 of the Helmets I found had the same (or pixels of difference) length for their Condition Bar.
---
its true, they are too large, its hard to see what actual players are near the area as the icon takes up so much space
---
Watch them fcking crash
---
I asked that on the post where that table originated, that OP said its for strange in numbers perk
---
hahaha
---
IS pharma pharma button e too? Its an extra action. Draw blood sample. Idk. Spitballing here. But do you already have em lol and just forgot? Not insulting shit happens lol
---
I agree. If the updates were more consistent in just fixing things with no unintended consequences (like this past P6's adrenal bug), ppl would live on BETA. But until BGS can manage that type of quality control, having a BETA mode could do that job for them. Quality testing, or lack thereof, is really the only reason ppl are even suggesting test/Beta servers or modes.
---
I, honestly, wouldn't come back. In fact, I'd contact my credit card company and try a chargeback; what is Beth gonna do? Ban you? XD
---
Only?! That’s almost a full-time job!
---
Yah, the article says that. My glib point is basically that bethsoft could have very easily had their sister dev who are experienced in online games(in the same state, an hour away) give their wonky ass design doc a once over and had a decent start as to what does and does not work instead of having to iterate over the course of several months
---
Power armor and stabilized work together if you go heavy guns. The gatling and 50cal are good mid-range guns.
---
 Invest in luck for bloody mess and one gun army and charisma for tenderizer and supressor. 
---
The west part of White Springs, has a tennis court right by the golf country club. Just south of the tennis court is a domed gazebo with a water fountain inside. When you drink directly from the water fountain, it cures all your diseases. I just showed it to a couple of high-level players today. It is really one of the best kept secrets in the game.
---
They are doing that live stream tomorrow, so prob not
---
i have spent so much time chasing low level players through the forest, lol. I just run at them screaming into area chat "I WANT TO GIVE YOU THINGS!!!!" and they run away...
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ I honestly only it switch it on after I kill some just to loot the blood
---
For real, there's a reason I didn't subscribe, just lurking to find out stuff and help some weary travelers but overall this place should be renamed Fo76 Witch Hunt cause you're all seriously lacking morality in the name of entertainment.
---
The live streams aren't replacing inside the vault
---
Yes been out for 3 months. Currently the game is loosing players like crazy. People need meaningful content not nerfs and reintroduced bugs via fixes. 
---
I do like the idea of being able to add Legendary effects to items but what's the point eventually everyone will have the same Legendary rolls and there would be no point to trading anymore.
---
Yeah 5☆ might be overkill and honestly at this point I'd settle for 3☆ Legendaries actually dropping 3☆ loot. Seriously why even have 3☆ enemies if they don't drop the corresponding loot?
---
melee vats works every time on them
---
Haha thats a hilarious image
---
wowwww.. thx bruh
---
Would you like an explosive weapon?
---
So I can swim though water without any rads gained. But if I pick water up I get rads?
---
pc, but i appreciate the offer!
---
How did the damage resist compare from the crafted +30 int to the found +15 luck versions? 
---
then we’ll get executioner’s nocturnal exterminator’s berserker’s ghoul slayer’s lead pipes
---
Lol you're like the gun fairy
---
Ah, I see by your own admission that counting is also as difficult as reading is for you.  I should have guessed.  Maybe that book you pick up should include some rudimentary number skills so you can see that it only takes a few seconds to count to 18.   Then again, it probably takes you longer if you have to take of your shoes and socks to get there.
---
I didn't know how, he ran off anyway.
---
60 is an overexaggeration you chose.  A more modest number would be 40 and I'd say it definitely meets that.  New Vegas had a whole lot of quests and FO3 as well.  FO76 can't hold a candle to the amount of content NV and FO3 had.  And most of all the games were captivating enough to keep me playing.
---
Yeah I tend to play cautious, yet friendly.
---
It's pretty crazy that someone can't answer this question. It's literally one word either way. Yes or no. Such simple communication.
---
I removed and reapplied AD and it is working properly, although the positive effect is still not showing (tested on several servers)!  
---
I suspect that it was the rebalancing that caused it to bug out, but idk.
---
Might be ballistics. Energy weapons are the worst.
---
we get excited when we see a new person come out of the vault. I'm actually kinda surprised only one person gave you stuff!
---
Other thing I thought of is if you have butchers bounty slotted pull it. Could be game is confused.
---
Thanks but I'm xbox and dont need it, appreciate it.
---
Whats funnier is all the "why is everyone still talking about the 900 hour guy still" posts and then people continue to complain about this occurring as they are doing it.
---
I am glad it has gained allot of traction though, Bethesda is free to break things again and again, and now that their continued mistakes potentially fall on user accounts they should not be able to continue their constant screw ups with impunity.
---
Why are people sticking up for this 900 hour guy??? It’s highly inprobable that he did that legitimately. He also has a post where he found over 22k aluminum scrap, then in another one of his posts talks about how he’s set on screws,springs, and aluminum forever. But all we wanna talk about is how he moved ammo back and forth. I have 682 hours on this game and can confirm I’ve moved over 100,000 rounds of ammo to my friend. Guess what, neither one of us got banned. There’s more to this story the guy is not saying. 
---
As a fo4 player I totally get it haha
---
Inside the Vault today or no?
---
yeah Watoga is a PIA with those and the assaultrons.....
---
Was thinking the same thing, it shows how sheepish people are when a smokescreen is in front of them, blindly following others for lack of deductive reasoning.  People are more concerned with defending what has been done, despite that Bethesda has admitted that they allowed the exploits to make it into the game in the first place.
---
I strongly agree that people abusing those exploits just because they can should be banned, but when you screw up that bad (Bethesda)  then instead of creating a metric that bans even innocent people, you write a code that bans those in possession of that many items.  Sure this let's exploiters who dropped it all off Scott free, but it also prevents it from occurring again.  The goal should be to create a more stable enjoyable experience, if they only banned people currently holding obscene numbers of those items the exact same goal would be achieved with far less collateral damage.
---
Bethesda screwed up in the first place, so in fixing the screw up (which I'm all for) they should ensure to damage faith in them as little as possible.  But like most fixes Bethesda has implemented so far,  it was done in a way that introduced numerous other problems that now need to be fixed (people banned who shouldn't be).
---
Lmao but still slightly better that the stalkers switch blades I keep getting from her
---
Right, but I dont think theyd do both same week.
---
Also, I dont think they've posted an inside the vault the same week as a patch before
---
No problem, we Responder always help out our fellow Vault Dwellers.
---
Do that for someone who just hit level 20. They get the whole emotional rollercoaster from "OMG! 50 extra lbs!" to--three days later--"what's a ballistic fiber?"
---
On the tables are napkins and by the laundery toilet papers
---
I’d just like to have all the items we had in fallout 4 added. It would be so much content and Would be easy for them to add
---
Mayor for a Day quest fixes that
---
No problem.  User name is same here as in game on PC.
---
Since patch 5 - if you try to save favorites with weapons of the same type, it will get very very confused and only 1 will save.
---
Its a fallout game, VATS is a novel real time tactical combat system for an RPG in a 3d environment similar to turn-based combat systems in 2d RPG games.
---
The game play, base weapon damage, and weapon modifications are optimized with the expectation that you will utilize VATS. Depending upon your weapon type, you are seriously dealing 1/3-1/10 the damage aiming down sights.
---
I will agree with your basic premise that crafting is stupid. Without being able to craft specific mods as separate entities to sell, or mods that are as good or better then legendary effects, people only craft &amp; scrap to learn recipes to modify their own crap. the MMO player base has spoken for over a decade, they want their purples.
---
Cap slot you mean.
---
There is nothing to fix except people who dont know what they are doing, and the loot table.  
---
F!!!
---
No they have. It’s supposed to be every week.
---
ok, but if i'm level 10 and a level 100 runs up and tries to trade with me, like what are they going to steal from me even if they could? "No, you leave my level 5 machete and my 18 caps alone!!!"
---
8 worked well in that PC mod.  I'd say 8.... then again there are 10 number keys, so I don't see a reason why there couldn't be more, especially if the slots can be named.
---
I'm a bos mothman t60
---
Its epic  😉
---
Why spend that amount time for a 1 star pool stick?
---
They were all over the place, though none were at the 200% you'd hit with 20 INT. That said, you can hit 200% just with the "Fix it Good" perk. So either use Luck and Fix it Good, or High Intelligence. Either way, you'll get that 200% which gives you that 86 DR instead of 68 on a helmet, until it dips below 100% Condition.
---
Not at all, and his guide on farming locations was indeed written after he was banned before he knew that he was banned.
---
The thread I linked however was written over a month ago,  so instead of arguing your point blindly take a couple minutes and read through the guys older threads.  I've read them all, they all support his story of being a guy who just plays a crap ton of FO76 and doesn't like people who exploit on the game.
---
&gt;Perk Loadout Manager Mod is a MUST HAVE
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ofwn6V6.gifv
---
Imma find you and deposit all the pre war money,   barbed cane and pearl grip mods
---
\#1 and #3 are critical for me.  #2 would definitely be nice to have or better yet a preview of the power armor chasis mods on the inventory screen showing the component names would be fine too.
---
If you want yellowcake, your best bet is to drop a nuke on Monagah. Park the nuke so that the power plant is just inside the SW corner of the blast zone. The village as well as the hills to the east and north of town are fucking covered in rad berries and iradiaroots. There's also a fair number of red hot blooms for crimson, and a decent number of gloam sap trees and boom blooms for cobalt.
---
I dropped one there yesterday and in the span of 30 minutes I gathered almost 300 yellowcake, 80+ crimson, and 40+ cobalt.
---
If you're looking for enemies it's not the greatest, but for those types of flux it's awesome.
---
No insult! I started this when I was a lower level and came back to it. I'm now level 30. I was worried I needed an item I forgot. The waypoints for the quest are still there so I must lack the samples. I never saw a seperate action button. 
---
Hit Escape (Map), Z, then look in list for Challenges.
---
Watoga is terrible. You get some fun creatures on the south edge but the city itself is just the usual robots, with no mass/fluids. Might be a more interesting nuke down there if you don't slap it on the city.
---
Harper's Ferry is surprisingly good for violet flux due to the strangler pods and ferns around the edge. Plenty of monsters in the middle for legendary and mass/fluids farming. Probably helps if you roll ghouls. Not many interesting monsters though: There are probably better Mire nukes for that.
---
Before this patch I could hop and it would almost always reload all the items. It doesnt seem to be reloading items as often or at all anymore since this patch went live
---
I get off work at 5 EST so will add you around 530. IGN is ascott38
---
I don't use that perk actually. 
---
Easy to kill stretchy boi with melee. Trying to find the loot afterwards is a nightmare though!
---
Haha they advise to beware of ~~dupers~~ counterfeiters
---
I need to get the Camp stuff for Mothman so badly, Mothman has always been my favorite cryptid so getting this stuff in game is a must for me but I don't want to buy the atoms.  I need that statue!
---
I'd suspect anything Anti-Armor would be decent.  I have an Anti-Armor Tesla Rifle and while it takes a few shots, it does the job on Gutsys, in part because it doesn't miss even as you're bouncing around dodging their shots.
---
nocturnal wood chest piece
---
I've seen them sponsoring hockey as well
---
It can be as there is an atom challenge to scrap 76 pieces of power armor...so people will grab it and scrap it! :)
---
ty ty. I'm learning a lot about how crafting works from this.
---
T series ain’t nothing but a bitch lasagna
---
yeah he's one of the best really. This sub just hates him because he's critical of 76 but by and large his coverage is pretty good. 
---
It’s not a must have.
---
Just play the game like you’re supposed to. Christ.
---
On xbox last night, I looted a new legendary db shotty (exterminator iirc). Later on I tried switching to my quad db I have favorited, and it equipped that new one.
---
I know I didnt change anything prior. Also, I couldnt get the quad to automatically go into favorite wheel from the pipboy (usually when you favorite something itll just put it in the next available slot)
---
&gt;I'm just a whiney bitch
---
See? Why use many word when few word do better
---
sometimes i remember to take off my power armor to be less intimidating but then i'm running around in my tattered mole man outfit which is probably just as intimidating, if not creepier. Once or twice i just leaned into it and pulled out my flaming chainsaw to add to the image. 
---
How or where did you get an anti armor tesla rifle?
---
Bags stay, just as the stuff in containers, I have 2 Xboxes and regularly "Drop Trade" stuff between Characters, I usually drop a bag with something worthless (Spoiled Fruit, 38 ammo), then transfer stuff for pickup and then leave the bag with worthless stuff in it, only to find and use it again several hours later, when the Character that dropped it has been logged out.
---
Good to see what Bethesda is really investing their time on
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
Do you know if an ITV will be released today/this week?
---
Dude it's so cool. I wasted my points  on the mothman paint and poster. I been hoarding for so long
---
Yes. People complain online, but I've not seen any reflection of it in the game. Internet warriors make up a very small percentage of game players.
---
They're the only reason I'm keeping 2 Troubleshooter's spare pieces on my alt character to use for silo runs.
---
It was a 4 star machete of course I don’t have pics of it I sold it that shit for 3 k it was worthless
---
I had a problem a few times last night on xbox. Ads and can't see.  Let go and repeat and then i can see through my look long scope. 
---
Danke! With Fasnacht around the corner, I've got New Helvetia ready for it!
---
Indeed, that was totally justified!
---
Nope none 
---
Exactly! ;-)
---
I'd add T-Flip-Flops (to reduce the amount of gates you woud have to place and wire\^\^)
---
and things like a container that unlocks when powered. So you can reward other players. Well, basically somthing to control with the circuits you build...
---
u/valseek can anyone give some better info about the adrenal mutation? We just want to know if it will be fixed. Should I try to reapply? Is it a nerf or bug? Not complaining but id like to go in over the weekend and know what to do with my build. Really hope I don't have to gamble with the mutations I paid a for with caps/time but I will if I have to. Please don't leave us in the dark over the weekend! 
---
We talking about the guy that dresses up like some kind of anime fascist?
---
I blow all my atoms on Camp items, the list of items I want would cost me over $50 just to get the atoms for them unless I slowly grind for them.  I now realize how dirty "slowly grind for them" sounds.
---
Ok, I will use it then, I actually only use reshade to make the colours a bit more bluish as it looks so much better to me.
---
Okay yeah cause it's with my sniper and hunting rifle 
---
"There was this one time, at overseer's camp..."
---
I never said it was broken, just that I'd like to opt out of having to deal with it, whether that be PvP specific servers, or PvE servers, or literally an option to opt out of all PvP period, pacifist mode is a half step towards that already. It's not like I'm saying "OMFG REMOVE PVP OTHER PLAYERS ARE THE WORST AND SUUUCK" 
---
Also notice how I didn't insult the other player, just called them a despicable person in jest, because they way they're playing is inherently rude, that's the point of destroying other people's stuff.
---
I really do hope that guy had fun destroying my stuff, maybe he was making up how I was reacting in his head and that made his experience better, idk I'm not him. He was just playing the way he wanted, and all I'd like is a way to not have to deal with players like that. 
---
A lot of people are getting real salty about me not liking PvP. It's honestly amazing me since it seemed like for the most part those playing this game don't participate in PvP too much in the first place.
---
F
---
What about ultracite power armor? Will that ever get paint jobs?
---
I'm ok with someone being banned for being a cheap whore.
---
Thrill of the grill daily. Speeds things up a little 
---
Proof he's not a duper? 
---
(Goes both ways...)
---
I have been playing since the BETA and i feel like within the last week the PVP and "Douchebaggery" Encounters have been on the Rise and really think this boils down to there being nothing new to do so people are trying to make there own fun.   which if i learned anything from the internet is terrorizing other people and destroying they're stuff in the name of "It's Just A Game" so i get to be a shitty person.       
---
Hopefully this doesn't happen to you again Lancesanderson and hopefully bethesda puts out some new content to keep people occupied.
---
Yes! So much added functionality with so little added content. Give us the tools to make functional circuits and more uses for them and *we* will remake Appalacia. 
---
I haven't seen it mentioned specifically but I would assume so.
---
I find the brahmin in Flat Woods dead a great deal of the time.   You can use it to still harvest some meat from their corpses.    Not as much meat if they were still alive but better then nothing.
---
No stealth nerf
---
Logged in again today. The bug isn't there anymore. No idea what happened yesterday... Thanks for tracking :) I'm good again
---
As others have said, it's not particularly rare. There's probably 50+ places around the map that reliably spawn PA sets. What kind did you get, and did it have all the pieces? If you tell us what it is we can tell you where to find the other parts.
---
Yeah I know the loot table and the sonic scream attacks were buggy. It’s also possible people are overloading the SBQ zone w too many players who don’t fight, but like you said if ppl don’t know what they’re doing it’s gonna be a fail. 
---
Why is everyone writing essays about this?
---
[Indeed](https://9gag.com/gag/153794/the-gun-fairy)
---
Bruh, do you even haiku? 
---
Our creators have abandoned us.
---
GaAaRrRyYy.
---
I'm somewhat in that category, I like earning my own stuff through wacky adventures. 
---
The creation club was so hilariously bad on release. So is the built in mod browser for FO4, it's pretty sad that third parties can create better mod browsers than Bethesda
---
Honestly, no, that wouldn't be fine. But that argument would carry a lot more fucking weight (if you'll forgive the pun) than 15 health per party member for one week. You can pretend not to see that all you want, but deep down, you know you're just being silly. Not to mention that that's a terrible example, because carry weight could be seen as purely QoL/convenience and is still not really pay-to-win. 
---
Want to argue that it's a "slippery slope" and whatnot? Cool, go right ahead. And you're mostly right about that as well. But in this instance, anyone who sees the Unstoppables event buff as p2w is objectively wrong, and I am 100% using that phrase correctly. 
---
If they keep up with improving the servers and optimization, I could see it happening- and I certainly hope it happens!
---
There should be Morning wood armor 
---
did you move that ammo within 30 days or since beta
---
Three bags with the Watoga BOS vendor. And a gnome. 
---
I've been looking at a few mods (menu mods, maybe some higher-res textures, things like that).  I haven't pulled the trigger yet since the ones I am looking at always seem to break with new patches, but honestly I'm not terribly worried about using them.
---
For texture/color mods, you're probably OK as far as updates go, but I'd look into what it would take to revert them to normal in case they cause game issues in the future, it would suck to have to reinstall the whole game if one of your mods broke something important.  But for what you're doing, I think that's a bit unlikely.
---
I never said the guy was innocent, I've said numerous times that based on substantial evidence, the facts add up in a way that makes it very plausible that he is innocent. 
---
In this scenario part of the fault lies on Bethesda and their implementation of not only this ban metric that's flawed but on their implementation of most every fix they have done so far (they all introduce more different issues).
---
The example you have isn't even relevant, in those scenarios no one is guilty of anything, someone is embarrassed of who they are.
---
A more appropriate example would be a murderer who kills gang members, hes doing something to someone who is bad, but that doesnt make it ok.
---
This ban is the same as a cop saying you were driving 2 over the speed limit for an hour so that's an additive total of 120 over the speed limit now I'm taking you to jail.  Its asinine and makes no sense.  Punish people based on what is done, like having 200k bobbleheads still in their inventory,  not maybe u passed ammo to your friends or your alt or anything else that supports the idea Bethesda implemented this wrongly.
---
ITT: pieces of shit that think cheating is "just playing the game"
---
I won't surprised if an alternate currency emerges, but screws and springs are purchasable for caps at many vendors, so there's a limit to how far those values can diverge. 
---
Interesting. I've done it probably a dozen times solo, and it only consistently spawns a legendary gusty in the final wave. Though it's always been L50 with multiple stars. It's definitely on my short list of events I'll drop almost everything to fast travel to.
---
But what about the other 400k in conventional ammo? That takes quite a bit of lead, steal, gunpowder...over a 30 day period.
---
Seriously? I walked out of a whitesprings nuke zone with around 60-70 of each, hardened mass, glowing mass and irradiated fluids just last night. I spent about 1 - 1.5 hours in the zone just walking a big loop from the golf clubhouse, to the houses row, to the whitesprings maintenance building. I burned through one full Fusion core, down to 10% but got plenty of that stuff, more than I usually even use. I could have gotten more if i didn't get kicked from the server randomly
---
All Shared perks previously stacked, including Chemist and Super Duper, this I know for sure, but they no longer do.
---
No you didn't but you stated a price and tried to make an argument shutting my stance down using a completely unrelated topic. You're right, it does confuse the other person. But not in any real useful way. It just makes it seem like you don't know what you're arguing, and are just trying to argue something else entirely. Why bring up any kind of price when my gripes have nothing to do with the money I paid for this game.
---
I think you click on taking some action, but can't remember clearly.  It's not just lijke getting a sample the way you would loot. 
---
And I was surprises me how few people know about that fountain and how useful it is. That water has cured me of so many rad worms.
---
Which negates the point of playing this game entirely. Having all the leet items the moment I want them sounds like the worst possible way to play this game. 
---
Or do what “monster mash” does and temporarily activate PvP until claimed then again if a player tries to take it.
---
My friend and I always leave goodies on the body right outside vault 76. That wholesome kinda content makes the game a little more enjoyable for me. 
---
Ya.  It's 20 hours since you used them.  Not sure if it's from when you first consume part of their 200, or when you clean them out... I always sell 200 caps right away when I visit during my daily runs.
---
Lol yep
---
Sometimes I'm really proud of my C.A.M.P. but then I see some on here and then mine is dookies.
---
It's just a simple little 2 story with recreation up top and then living quarters and benches down stairs.
---
It's not in a very great location but it is home (for now). Trying to get far enough so I can move it to another location more convenient.
---
How about a timer for how long a single player can stand in front of vendor freezing out everyone else who wants to use that vendor?    I've been running into this more often of late.
---
deals 200% more damage between 7:00 and 9:00 AM. Forwardly increases character hitbox.
---
I just posted about this issue this morning. I am seeing the same thing and it just started this past week. They are correct, if I have my TSE and another vanillia version of the same weapon I picked up, it will equip the vanilla version and not my uber weapon. This happens every time I log out. Lets hope they fix it in the next release...
---
In my case severs are not completely full, but about half full. I know all resources are still scarce when I go on a lead/steel run.
---
It sees to working so far! Thank you for the advise. 
---
reshade is banned in most online games because of how easily it can be used to cheat, without anyway for the game to know that you're just making things pretty or color correcting for your color blindness.
---
Because it's not as cut-and-dry as people would like to think. :P
---
Lol
---
Subnautica &amp; soon Anthem I’ll be on, I too have already gotten my end game loot from SBQ, and is now waiting till March for new content.
---
Thank you, I will try that if it happens again. I ended up rebooting my Xbox, and it seems to be working as of now.
---
I'm still sitting at 5/10 and I've been playing since day one of beta.  And I from there like daily.
---
Just atom store things! The only thing that has been going on is Bugthesda banning players...again...&amp; again...&amp; again. Try back next year, lol.
---
Plasma guns work pretty well for me. I have an instigating sniper plasma rifle that decimates critters pretty well. There is another post out there if you search where a guy describes how to get the most out of plasma weapons including an interesting plasma flaming weapon that is fun to use.
---
Outside in meat space.
---
Every server I've been in has been picked clean in the spots I regularly farm and I'm getting irritated. I dont server hop to farm I'm being forced to now just to find one that has even 1 piece of junk I need. I get the idea of playing the game to get your loot but I'm not finding loot WHILE PLAYING THE GAME. How can you consider this a fix if your punishing people who play right. No plastic at the highschool no uniforms at the cemetary no outfits at the golf course no fans at sugar grove no typewriters at the herald screws are so fucking hard to come by and that's a great place to find a good amount and they are all empty because someone has already grabbed them and nothing is respawning. So I'm suppose to wait an ungodly amount of time to get the items I need to repair my gear build my camp so I'm suppose to run around with broken gear to hunt for shit that isn't even there??? What is this nonsense.
---
I like the new feature because pvp is so lacking in this game and this makes it more fair because you’re both tagged as enemies the second you contest. 
---
I also understand the pve players who don’t like this but hopefully the survival servers come out soon and most pvp players will be on there.
---
Thanks, I don't have an inherent problem with PvP it can be fun. But I feel the game does not emphasize fighting others, and just wants players to work together.
---
 I would just like it if pacifist mode meant that I can't participate in PvP in any way, that including other players attacking me and my stuff.
---
We just killed the queen. Oddly she was the only dead body I could loot. There were about ten players but I didn't check for the shed boys.
---
When you forget your keys but you dont wanna turn back. 
---
What Pedro said. Using a TSE required no skill, build, research, or time invested.
---
I think Bethesda should probably reconsider the ban on ammo, instead maybe they should just stick to a ban for using 
---
mule characters to circumvent the stash limits.

WARNING: Do not eat this can or its contents
---
Or, you know, read last weeks ITV but then again reading is hard so...
---
Which unstoppables costume can be obtained for free and where do I get it?
---
Where is this daily at? Over 100 hours and I've never seen it.
---
You might actually be onto something, did you try adding it again after it was removed? I read elsewhere it has to be completely removed and you can re apply, it will work but pipboy will not show it. This may be a way to remove that specific mutation.
---
Correct.
---
Don’t forget to pop some grape mentats and daddy o to get your charisma up as much as possible. Or wear unyielding armor and get low health before you buy, that should knock a couple hundred caps off the price 
---
Preach!  I agree.
---
In that case... the morally right thing to do is to let them eat you.  They are obviously quite hungry and allowing them to starve would be wrong.
---
Ok, so you didn't get a four star. You got a three star that you put a sacrificial blade on.
---
I was referring to the lack of appeals; IANAL but as far as I know Beth needs to be able to cite where OP broke terms. If they’re insisting that no appeals can be made, I suspect they don’t have all of those records. 
---
I'm plotting out some fun events to run through! My favorite is "One Violent Night" so I'm really hoping to do that on stream!
---

---
I only play on weekends and i mat have over exaggerated lol 
---
Yeah, I've said for a while that they need to retune Int and crafting. Like 3 points of Int (for the overrepair perks) and 15 luck just does what 15 points of Int does but kind of better.
---
Hemlock Holes
---
Confirmed it's the "powered gates" plan for 240 caps..... It unlocks all those doors for you
---
There was a guy that had an exel data sheet of them on this sub somewhere. Keep looking and you might find it.
---
You think that means you didn't cheat? Lol
---
Can I get guns for hire quest? Be pretty cool if I could post as gun for hire in game play as body guard for low levels wanting to explore harder areas or be paid to kill that player that kept wrecking their camp or something bringing players together really
---
Also do you use the targeting hud for PA? My game was freezing a lot and someone mentioned this to me, after I took that mod off my game stopped freezing as much 
---
Omg ppl like you supporting trash devs, should of been boycotting from the get-go 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
^^^(nice)
---
I leave my camp open. However, I was inside at a workbench and startled by two folks standing behind me. Both were under level ten. The first thought was “I hope these aren’t the alts of some griefers.”  
---
We emoted and I played the banjo for them. They probably looked up my dress. 
---
Then they waved and wandered off. I hope they grabbed some water for the road. 
---
Thats awesome. When i was lvl 3 i was surrounded by ghouls and i was out of ammo and hiding in a bus. Someone came by and killed all the ghouls and kept going without saying a word. 
---
I always try and help out lower levels when i see them needing help. Just paying it forward. 
---
Yes. There is literally no point to it other than the novelty of fighting her, which is gone after the first or second time.
---
There is no real reward to killing her, at least, nothing that is worth the effort. It is literally a waste of time and money. The sheer amount of problems to get to the fight, between common glitches and such, plus the actual fight itself, just makes the whole thing a bother.
---
Super bored farming whitesprings (my nuke), me and a friend are trying to pull multiple hordes into the tennis court but randoms are running into the building.
---
Keep at it for a little bit but now there's maybe 25 glowing ones surrounding 3 players in the clubhouse dining room. They're melee killing them and preventing me from tagging all of them.
---
Resolved the issue by standing in the window with a TSE 50 cal and burning through my 250 round clip killing everyone in the room.
---
They tried to retaliate but baited them with my teammate a few times and stole all thier loot for good measure. 
---
I was just sprinting through Charleston on XB1 and my game froze. Had to quit and restart.
---
This is why there is no inside the vault b/c they don’t kno what to say after being CAUGHT STEALTH NERFING AGAIN.
---
Events pose no more challenge than the rest of the game does so I can't comprehend why 90% solo players would have any trouble. Run up to the enemies face, punch em in that face, repeat until everyone's dead...it's exactly the same as every other encounter so what am I missing?
---
I really like those foundations as walls, they look better than most of the walls in this game imo. Kinda has a bunker feel too which is cool
---
Ima scrap together a Nobel Peace Prize out of those tin cans for you. You did it. You did that. This guy. These upvotes.
---
So you are writing essays to defend someone that you have no real insight into? You automatically assume that he is innocent because? 
---
I am also not code savvy, so I am not sure how much help this will be but there is a list of all available plans in the game.  [Complete List of Plans in Fallout 76](http://incendar.com/fallout76_plans.php)
---
yeah... the famous golf club is a trap for new levels 
---
Those dirty bastards. Kill.Them.All.
---
Are we going to get an "Inside the Vault" today?
---
Not following the meta like a total nerd does not mean your build is "flawed". 
---
i have no idea what are you saying but i think that is good :P
---
Didnt say anything about meta..

I actually really do appreciate your offer of hooking it up with an explosive weapon and I do thank you very much for that. But I'm more of a hard work kinda guy. I like to see the culmination of my efforts. I really don't mind the grind of FO76; it helps to keep me coming back. Finding that TS .50 Cal was great. Never found a TS weapon before in FO76. It's not a great weapon, it's only lvl 35 and I have no specs in heavy guns. But it's nice to have found anything remotely decent in the game. But as far as explosive guns go, I just for whatever reason don't like them. They kinda kill the experience. Both PVP and PVE. PVP they're just too exploitable to where everyone gets one shotted all the time. In PVE, they light up a room killing everything before anyone gets a chance to hit and loot the mobs. I feel like if I had an explosive weapon, I would not only use it to basically grief people (intentionally or not) in PVP or PVE situations, but also, it'd probably make all of my other weapons obsolete and I would exclusively use it. And that kinda kills it for me too.  They're just too damn sweet. I mean, I guess it would be stupid of me to decline such a generous offer of such a rare weapon. I'm actually a lot more torn about this than I ever thought I would be, haha. I just want this game to be fair, fun and long lasting. I feel the explosive weapons really kinda deter a lot of players from many of the facets of the game. My name on PS4 is HarveyOsbourne. Shoot me an add. If we're ever on at the same time, we can play. I may take you up on your offer. Regardless, let's be friends. I really appreciate the fact that you're trying to hook it up in order to make my experience more enjoyable. Kudos to you friend!
---
...... how do you sleep at night? Wait don't answer that.
---
What's life like as a +RAIDER? How do you maintain your wanted status? Can you get anything done with people constantly hunting you, or do you get used to it like you get used to any PvE trying to kill you?
---
Static like same time every day? Time zones are probably the reason why it isnt a static time. As far as I know you can have people from around the world in the same server as you.
---
The 20 hr cooldown is better than a 24hr one, because it allows you to catch up if you log in later one night than normal. With a 24 hr cooldown you are constantly pushing your reset timer later and later, til you have to miss a day and get your reset time back into a normal time.
---
A lot of global games adopt the 20hr cooldown vs have a static time, but both work well if you know how to manage it.
---
Yeah but what does the 900 hours have to do with anything? It's over a 30 day period. So even if they played 12 hours a day for 30 days that is 360 hours.
---
I think we can all logically surmise that this player didn't play 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 30 days straight.
---
And if that is his claim, let Bethesda figure it out, because they can see his actual play hours over the 30 day time frame. They can also see a lot more data then what they posted in the message.
---
He would have been better off saying he found it all in a container in the world somewhere and just picked it all up. Or that a friend gave it to them.
---
That would probably only get his characters wiped and at least he could still play the game.
---
this is one of the reasons i made another build for pvp, at a certain lvl it only hinders u to continue leveling up.
---
So You get Bonus Damage on Weapons or DR on Armor based on the total condition of items.
---
At 100/100 you get no bonus. If you craft an item, you gain a bonus to condition of 5% per point of Intelligence you have. At 10 Intelligence, for instance, you'll get an item with 150% condition (So there will be a white line through your condition bar that stops exactly halfway through). This caps at 20 Intelligence, with 200% total condition.
---
The bonus to Damage/DR is a ratio, and at 200% it's around 15% higher than 100% (it varies from item to item). As the condition lowers from 200%, the bonus decreases too, until having zero bonus at 100% Condition or lower.
---
Another effect is that when you craft Fusion/Plasma Cores and their Ultracite counterparts, they'll have a bonus to charge equal to your Intelligence stat -1. So making a Fusion Core with 21 Intelligence will result in a core with 120/100 charge.
---
I would point you to my original response of "creating communities" and things of that nature I already mentioned...
---
Well if you wanna give me some of your hardworking caps than I'll part with it lol we are actually still doing this on a server with maybe one more workshop left unclaimed 
---
Sometimes I forget it's only been 3 months since release. From all the bugs, disconnects, crashes, and legitimate fun I've been having along the way, It feels like it's already been a year (mostly because of the disconnects and crashes).
---
I got rid of it and reapplied. Still no luck. Tried the hunger aspect and saw effects randomly 
---
You deserve a medal for teaching “the golden rule” to another person, let alone TWO people.
---
The things that power the power armor, fusion cores, can be rare if you don’t know where to look but the armor itself spawns pretty regularly. I still remember my first set of lvl 15 Raider PA I found, felt invincible for a while, then the scorch beasts found me..
---
It is a tally count on ammo picked up. That means, if you only have 10k and pass it back and forth between two accounts, the tally counts it as you picking up 10k every single time.
---
So you might not have ever had more than 10k and the tally will count it as 100k. Because Bethesda couldn't be bothered figuring out a better way to deal with the problem so they just laid down a nice and easy blanket solution.
---
when they destroy workshop items it makes them wanted.  so building a lot at ur workshop definitely makes it more costly to initiate the pvp one way or the other
---
Same!
---
Its weird, I dont see all those salty PVPers bitching online every time they have an interaction that doesnt live up to their expectations. I do see you complaining about a game mechanic that is fairly well worked out. We have perks that allow us to do more damage to players bases. The resources required to rebuild a destroyed base are well balanced and constitute next to nothing on top of the damage being entirely temporary with as little as moving your camp and no one can raid your camp when you are offline in the first place. 
---
Its a bit fallacious to call on the idea that "people playing this game don't participate in PVP too much" as you ask for further removal of PVP interactions. I just put Fallout 4 into my PS4 and it still works. Give it a shot on your end. 
---
Sorry, but I can't agree with your idea.  And I am somebody who hates PVP.  This was what was laid out from day 1. Getting caught with your proverbial pants down is just bad luck.
---
I was stuck at nine for a long time. Then one day I noticed it was gone.  Now I see them constantly at the clubhouse at lvl 92!
---
Can I lead a scout detachment? I already have our uniform in mind
---
This might come as a shock to you, but Bethesda doesn't owe us any answers about somebody else's account. 
---
No wdym? It didn’t have sacrificial blade on it? 
---
&gt;and also that bulk junk is autoscrapping again
---
Not again.  Still.  This was a bug from the hotfix a month ago for the patch about scrapping mods.  It just hasn't been fixed yet.  And they said that it will take a bit longer cause they have to come up with another way to do it vs the mod scrapping issue.
---
That’s awesome man. I’m pretty sure Signs and letters is not a world drop. You’ll either have to save up the 8-10k caps or buy a dup off someone.
---
Fo67 crashing and drowning in a lake, nice one Beth.
---
&gt; So you are writing essays to defend someone that you have no real insight into? You automatically assume that he is innocent because?
---
I see you didn't actually read what I wrote:
---
&gt; And just to be clear, I'm not saying that Mr. 900 Hours is innocent or guilty here
---
Makes me wonder how much sound reasoning is behind the conclusions you've drawn elsewhere.
---
Not really, this character is only lvl 10 I run up and hit enemies and run while my turrets do the rest
---
I thought they were dropping dead in fear of me, but your explanation does make more sense.
---
This person gets it
---
New ideas are nice but it would only throw off the main course of what the U.S. Army Faction stands for. Let me know when you're interested.
---
ya pacifist only server! while we're at it lets remove the SB/Scorched, supermutants, and ghouls while we're at it so its a more peaceful post apocalypse. 
---
i don't think its rare, but people are server hoping to do it, so it is completed within a few minutes of it popping up, because its one of the few events with a nearly guaranteed 3\* legendary item. I've never seen more than the single 3\* legendary mr gutsy that spawns in the last wave.
---
Just because you did something that did not result in a ban indicates there is a flaw in the logic surround this guy?  I don't get that logic.  Before the last week, I knew nothing about this guy.  But I knew with almost 100% certainty that Bethesda is incapable of making ANY change within this game that goes smooth,  there is always some other unintended thing that comes out of their patches/fixes.  Why would their effort at identifying and properly removing the correct people be any different?  So I will continue to give this guy the benefit of doubt.  The guy was out of work from some medical procedure, it sounded like he literally did nothing other than play FO76, and even if I do consider he was a duper, your telling me the only thing he decided to dupe was ammo?!  
---
I made a little counter for trading, but I'm just not getting anyone. I'm even at a busy location. People in FB Groups have said they want some of the things, but then they never meet up. I'm running out of space. It's too bad. I've got some nice items that I think others would use. Maybe things will be easier when we get a real vendor system.
---
https://imgur.com/a/rrN37Te
---
He does point that out. Also, did you also leave out the part that the Ultracite ammo that the e-mail point out was a pick up tally, not a numbers of units in his inventory? 
---
As in, if you have 1k and pass it back and forth between characters it counts each time? So you could never had have more than 1k, but the system will count as if you dealt with dozens of thousands of Ultracite.
---
Because the system can't treat stacks as uniques. It can't assign an individual ID to each stack, so each time you pick up that same stack the system will count it as the a different one, because it has no way to know.
---
This is what happens when you try to take the easy way out to fix a problem like Bethesda did. It leaves a lot of holes.
---
Literally 3 weeks ago, have the PlayStation 4 messages for it as well. This is almost as believable as super duper getting people banned for mass crafting. Everyone that was banned on my friends list did some sketchy shit at one point or another (ex. Drinking 3k nuka colas.) I’m a full mele build since beta and my friend is a bloodied/vat/crit/ pistol build. He gets all my ammo, and any ammo that the rest of my group gives him ammo. 
---
Sorry. I have been responding to 2 threads, both about the same thing. Thought this was a response to mine. 
---
&gt; while we're at it lets remove the SB/Scorched, supermutants, and ghouls while we're at it so its a more peaceful post apocalypse.
---
is there an option to remove you?
---
I have a 3k dmg fist weapon, it used to take 1/8 of her health in 1 power attack, now it takes barely noticeable slivers, yeah something got changed.

This happened to me last night, I went to Camden park and looted all the plastic cups on the ground and picked up at least 25+ but somehow only walked away with 9 plastic? This happened at Watoga high school too so idk it seems like the game didn’t register some of the items I picked up or something 
---
Server Hopping and Fast Traveling seems to take a toll on food CND.  But it seems to have always been that way.  Can't say for if it's faster.  It's all "feel" at this point cause I don't have any numbers to support one way or the other.

Ah, you are correct sir.

I'm fairly sure that's not right. It's either from when you first visit them or when you first sell something to them. I had a situation last weekend where I visited one on Friday night and sold a little bit but wasn't on very long. Then I was on again Saturday afternoon and cleared it out. Then it refreshed later on Saturday evening.
---
Yeah. Hard for me to argue with someone who swears it has happened to them and describes it in detail. Makes me wonder if there isn't some buff glitch that can cause it. 
---
yeah lol... i would probably back out of this conversation right now if i were you too lol... i read yoru original post. I know what your stance is... my post is what shoots that down, on a point by point basis. I can only assume you have no response because you cannot come up with one and this realize how crazy you sound.
---
If you look at the comments section of any video covering this, it's 100% going to be a out "lol banned the one person who liked the game" or something along that margin.
---
"Well I've been playing a total of 2 hours and have everything I could ever want. This game is stupid and there's nothing to do GG"
---
I agree with you "feels" I always have Ribeyes on me and if I hop servers thier cnd takes a hit
---
They're apparently ignoring this question. All it takes is a yes or no but radio silence.
---
Exactly this. I'm kind of a roleplayer at heart. I wanted to be an Enclave scientist. I just wish more people took on roles and had gimmicks and personalities and, like you said, not everyone just a BOS with explosive game enders. I was really hoping for more variety out of the faces of the waste. Some raiders with some machine guns and rippers, Enclave soldiers with plasma guns, some random wasteland wanderers with a rifle and a neat little shack. But it's everyone using TSE weapons in power armor living out of floating EXP farming bases. Meta. Meta is laaaaame. I just want the wastes to have some soul. I wanna walk down the road and find a bar with some riff raff and a kind bartender desperate for caps. Some Enclave soldiers roughing up some BOS settlements. A band of raiders New Gad just making it happen. I don't know. I wish we had a server list and had some official RP servers or something. 
---
I'm more interested in seeing a public realm livestream where you get to be griefed by players getting around slap damage and pacifist. You know. For science, to see if that feels like a nice balanced play environment that needs no fixing.
---
Its not easy its a job but for real reading the page takes 5 mins normally 
---
Yeah the only thing wrong with the queen is sometimes she’ll bug out and just sit there but it makes her easier to kill imo, also the fact that lvl 35 players just sit there and do nothing but raise her health kinda sucks. 
---
Idk how to fix it but you shouldn’t be able to fight the queen until you’re lvl 50 because you can’t use any of the loot till then anyways.
---
That is 10/10 btw. 
---
Time to go John Wick on their asses. :D
---
Shoot me an add. I'm at hard work right now, haha. 
---
YET *queue dramatic music*
---
Sorry I might have confused you there, your planning to do the silo as a trio or something right?
---
Your probably gonna use up/break one or two weapons during the silo, leaving one person who is ready for the SBQ fight and doesnt need to repair or has the lowest dps, this allows the rest of the team to repair and restock for the SBQ fight, than get into position at the drop site. The person @ the silo than launches the nuke and fast travels to the group. There is a weapon bench in the room just before you get into the launch room, in the room you repair the servers to open the door, or FT to your camp than the group.
---
The more damage your group can do before the rest of the server shows, the better you will do.
---
Uncooked food in your stash? This may sound silly but did it spoil?
---
did you read the one where he saw 22k scrap, and the next post talk about how he doesn’t need any of that anymore? Just because he’s saying something doesn’t mean he truly believes it. If mods were on the site and you’re doing something sketchy you’re not going to flat out say it. I don’t know ONE person on my friends list that wasn’t banned for an actual reason. I refuse to believe this guy did nothing wrong when they have all the things he’s ever done in files. 
---
i feel like this is likely sarcasm, but i kinda feel this exact way whenever i read a survival mode related post on this sub.  its not as bad as having your camp destroyed, but its discouraging seeing the non combative players be so combative on reddit.
---
We tried last night and it was a fiasco. A pretty experienced team, with me tagging along. I broke my 50 cal MG, fixed it, then ran out of ammo, then ran out of MIRV frag grenades then alternated between various melee options and rifles, mostly just absorbing damage from all the extras. 
---
Made a bit more ammo afterward, but am out of steel and lead. Gonna have to spend this evening trying to scrounge stimpacks and other resources before I try again. 
---
Keeping players is adding new content.  Just bigger guns means they need to increase the difficulty of mobs or nerf things again.  I get really annoyed when there's a power creep in online games and they're constantly having to rebalance.  Adding 5* weapons now would make future content added too easy as the weapons would be too powerful.
---
Even the lvl 35 ones i ran into at robco were shredding me in all of my Lvl 50 power armor sets, I may as well have been wearing no PA at all
---
You've never multiboxed I see or the lingo has changed a mirror is a program that duplicates imputs by the user to multiple programs, a bot is well a bot they are different one gives no program advantage while the other does.
---
He said he was leveling A alt not ALTS that dosent mean he was multiboxing it means he was leveling an alt which needed gear and ammo(of varying levels) so he transferred gear and ammo to it hell didn't know my kid brother leveling on PS4 was multiboxing by leveling an alt.
---
To quote him "I started leveling a SECOND character for the first time" it's his only alt baring his bank
---
It's a call to authority when you say stuff as you have like "that's (person) and they are y therefore x" 
---
but once again he never in that entire post said he multiboxes just that he uses his alt account for self trading as it's far safer than attempting a drop trade with yourself
---
And you want to know the biggest hole in your theory? His alt and main accounts generated nowhere near a similar amount of ammo which his alt ferryd it's missing something like 350k ammo roughly counting the non ultracite "only" like 85k ultracite ammo
---
Lots of info if you search "adrenal" and sort by new. 
---
Its broken
---
It currently stacks on hunger/thirst but only sometimes.
---
Can be fixed by deleting mutation and applying a new serum that was crafted AFTER the latest patch. 
---
Once fixed the positive effects are still broken and dont display, but they are working
---
I tried it. 
---
It was fun but only a few people showed up (2-7 over a couple of hours).
---
Some probably had problems getting in the server (doesn't take long to max a partially filled server).
---
Some probably didn't have mics and couldn't communicate effectively.
---
**They really need to add Player Vending terminals all in one place and make them indestructible.**  THEN you'll get a hub with a lot of trades getting done.  BONUS, once you're done browsing there, you can server hop and check those terminals too!

My girlfriend and I play this game together, and did so on launch night. The first guy we ran into started shooting my gf, so she attacked him back (so pvp triggered). I ran over and helped, and we killed him. 
---
He loudly complained over the mic about how unfair it was we 2v1'd him, calling us bitches, yadda yadda. So your first player encounter was way better lol.
---
Just did this an I went from 0 stims to 86 diluted. Wow 
---
HaHa. I was in the process of doing that quest when that happened to me.
---
ya the beta version comes in march, its called survival mode.  check it out!
---
Sounds like something a duper would say**™**
---
This game really has a fantastic community full of great people. I love hearing stories like this. I always try to help out lower level/newbies however I can. 
---
A friend and I had control of most outposts around the map yesterday, by passing them over between friends, we managed to hold them on the same server for 24 hours. I saw there was a guy hanging out not too far from my camp and he had been there a while, so I decided to check it out. He was a new player and he was building his own camp. So I grabbed what was in the extractors in most of the outposts and brought it up to him, along with some camp plans. He was very apprehensive at first, but when he saw I wasn't trying to do him any harm, he was cool. 
---
Regardless of the toxic people who are slating Bethesda for how this game is at the moment, it still has an awesome following of people who really enjoy it, its bringing people together, making friendships, and bringing out some real creativity in people. 
---
Stay awesome guys. 
---
When I first heard about it, I was expecting a fountain with water jetting out of the center.  Can we add a request to Bethesda to place an information robot there? “Welcome to the sulfur Spring”
---
Any easy way to test to see if it's working?
---
There are no 4 star weapons that are dropped as 4 star weapons.  You can get a 3 star machete and add the sacrificial blade to it which adds poison or bleeding, I forget what, which adds a 4th star.
---
In order to damage another player you have to turn off Pacifist mode.  Doesn't matter if they are aggressive toward you or not, or wanted, etc.
---
Makes leaving Pacifist mode on slightly dangerous at times.

Nuked Harper's yesterday and it wasn't too bad. Had someone check to see if super mutants were there first but after nuking it only ghouls and scorched spawned. The gas station to the south was still spawning mutants at least. There is also a farm between the substation and Harpers that has cobalt and crimson.

---
If people can play with PvP in mind, why should I not also have similar resources to not be involved in PvP? I don't think changing Pacifist mode to make it so that you can't damage other players and their buildings and vice versa. 
---
I have made it obvious in other comments that I was not aware it was more simple to fix your base, I know that now and even with that in mind I still think I should have the option to opt out of PvP period. 
---
I only make the argument that people don't seem to be PvP focused because in the 26+ hours I've put in each player I've run across has been friendly or minding their own business. I've also seen many posts on this subreddit being mainly co-operative focused and only talking about PvP when it comes to workshops, something that makes sense to fight over compared to just destroying someone's base because you get a bit of a chuckle out of it. 
---
They should've scaled the queen to the "number of people" AND the "levels of people" there.
---
If the legendaries actually scaled to player level it wouldn't be a problem.  I could see a level 10 with a pipe pistol plinking away and think "hey, good on him, he wants to fight".  But now all I think is "hey, here's a moocher who is making the fight MUCH MUCH harder for the rest of us".
---
But ya know, that doesn't make the grind harder, and Bethesda is loath to add content but MUST MUST MUST MUST increase grind at EVERY single opportunity they can.
---
Why not use the search bar to find out
---
Well, as 99.999% of the people here have no way to answer that with any real certainty, it's not really that crazy.
---
Usaly it's the other way around. People pick a fight with me  I kill them then they just keep coming back for more and I will be dammed if I leave a server because they cant screw off and deal with the fact I beat them lol.
---
I am 10 Nigerian princes. Please pay accordingly

I had 50+ springs. I checked before I went to camp. When I got to camp, after a couple server hops, they were gone from my inventory. I was so frustrated because I still havent made the excavator armor, and I wanted to make a max level suit. I just want the power armor blueprint for my camp
---
Move your camp again, break down any blueprints in stored then build up again from components.  The way the camp system is I will never lay down another blueprint...  always work from single components!
---
Lol.  I never claimed I was good at this.  Feel free to write your own!
---
No need to be tongue-in-cheek, you know I'm not the CFO. My point is that if they are reporting a profitable quarter/year then go on to fire a bunch of people, those are contradicting actions. Businesses that are doing well don't typically lay-off a shit load of people unless they are not actually doing well. So either Activision is full of shit and they're not doing well or they fired a bunch of people to make a little bit extra money. Callous means having cruel intentions or disregard for others, so if the latter is true then they are absolutely callous. Maybe not to you, but to most people, they are.
---
I don't think someone who is paid well should be fired, nor did I ever say that. Bobby Kotick has overseen both the most profitable years in Activision/Blizzard's history but also the slow but steady decline in quality of their games. He's done a good job of leading Activision as a profit-making enterprise, so if that's all you care about then no he shouldn't be fired, but as a video game game company he has overseen the fall of both Activision and Blizzard's credibility and competence. For that alone I think he should be fired.
---
And I have no problem with people being paid well, but are you honestly defending people like Kotick's salary? The dude makes what, 30 million a year? Let's do a bit of simple math. Let's say the 200 employees who were just laid off made 100k a year;  that's a stretch most likely but for sake of argument it's a good number, hardly hand-to-mouth money even in CA. All 200 of them make less than Bobby Kotick. You think 1 person = 200? If so, god bless, but that's not reality, that's corporate greed at its finest. Also, let's say the starting salary at Acti/Blizz is also 100k. Again, probably too high, but for arguments sake, why not. That means Bobby Kotick makes 300x more than that entry-level person. Do you think Bobby Kotick does 300x more work than that person? It's literally not possible. 
---
Hell yeah! Been playing since day one.

I dont know if it was intended or a glitch but I was in a nuked Whitesprings with Pacifist on someone started a fight with one of my team members and there name became red and I was able to kill them even tho i had pacifist mode on

You might not care about PvP servers, but others, like myself, do. The entire slap mechanic imo is immersion breaking, but I can understand why it was implemented. 
---
I play a lot of Destiny 2, and my favourite thing about that game is the ability to take your PvE rewards into a PvP environment. I would love that for fo76, provided balancing is addressed. As it currently stands PvP is a completely redundant mechanic of the game. It needs hardcore servers to become relevant again.
---
It is a good game and worth the money, but that is my opinion. Your mileage may very.
---
mega lol
---
I dont have the ability nor interest to remove and reapply my mutations just because bethesda fucks up things.
---
With how much it cost now and how much smoother it runs. Yes definitely worth it 
---
Yes,  this is how I farm stim packs.
---
I selected it, stored it, and was able to scrap the individual pieces. Thank you! 
---
End game? That don’t exist around these parts boy

That sucks, I've been griefed a few times but never had my camp destroyed.  My friend had his camp attacked recently, and there wrre four of us.  The one who owned the camp was level 50 at the time, I was just under 100, we had a 115 and a 150, and this guy managed to keep killing us even though he was level 60.  They need to make pacifist mode make you and your camp PVP immune, and fix the damage scaling because now way the four of us couln't easily take out this level 60 if the damage scaling wasn't so messed up.  We had to switch servers just to ignore him.
---
It is really good. It has some bad bad issues around load times but that was fixed in the last patch.
---
No.  Provide picture of it, I can guarantee it's not 4 star.
---
You do have the option to just walk away.
---
You literally just...walk away.
---
Am at a BBQ pit. Did I do it wrong? Think I did it wrong.
---
Nicely done, how come the roof looks like the top of the foundation .. is the top and bottom of the foundations the same ?
---
Anyway to make it so you could remove a block when you come home in build mode so it is completely impenetrable ? I assume they can blow your door out .. I was thinking if you could delete a block when you come home, enter, put it back when inside .. I want to do something like this as well.
---
I think it'd be better if they had a border or were round, and if the images were actually scaled down correctly so they didn't look so compressed. 
---
Scariest moment was on a Mr.handy horde event. 15 Col Gutsies spawned on top of me. I didn't even get to react.
---
&gt;stupid communist shit
---
Username checks out. 
---

---
Are you on XB1? I’ve got some extra springs you can have. But yeah I think this patch messed something up because I hadn’t looted those two locations for days so server hopping shouldn’t be played a role, yet after picking up 60+ plastic plates and forks at watoga I walked away with 17 plastic, it’s just weird. 
---
But on my alt it worked fine so idk 
---
Shit, I sell this one and have eight or nine I know where made last sunday, so I guess the flux used to craft those was wasted.
---
Yeah, new Subnautica will be good. I've played the beta, but it is VERY incomplete. I will miss my cyclops though :( 
---
I'm from Pennsylvania but traveled through West Virginia often as that's where my father lives. I got giddy when I saw the Berkeley Springs sign on the game. My parents met mid way there to exchange us in the summer. So cool to see that in game. And the terrain of the game reminds me of where I grew up. Gives me feels sometimes (I live in Louisiana now and it's HELLA different).
---
This is cute. Love it.
---
Plus you’re arming everyone against the threat of the Scorched, if indirectly. Gotta support that.
---
It could be server-hopping because I have been doing more that in the last few play sessions, trying to get in some SBQ fights.
---
Normally my Appalachilli would last days, now it seems to spoil in 24 hours.  Ugh.
---
I'm bored with the whole game at this point.
---
Done tons and tons and tons of queens.  Even followed around a group that would "triple nuke prime, then server hop".  They'd literally have someone solo the bunker while we were fighting so they could nuke faster.  They all QUIT.  Why?  Probably got bored.
---
They need to add other bosses.  Let's say you launch at Charleston, you get the Super Bohemeoth King there.  Maybe it's a different loot table.  ADD MORE LEGENDARY ENEMIES in that zone ffs (even if they're only legendaries after a nuke drop).   Right now the only two places to nuke for good results is Whitesprings and Prime.
---
Oh, and add more content.
---
And finally, quit spending 100% of your FREAKING time trying to squash 100% of the bugs, nerf things everyone liked, and chase the endless dupers around.  FYI Bethesda most of them are GONE.  I used to see "selling items for cash" on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar constantly.  I can't remember the last time I saw one of those posts.  You're literally tilting at windmills at this point.  GIVE US CONTENT &lt;----------------------
---
Exactly! Even a build with multiple high minimum level perks will have all of them by the 60s at the latest. Then in theory a higher level will let you get better gear, or you could get unlucky. Or they could get lucky. Or you could trade for gear. Or my favorite, you make a character with all the QOL perks to farm weapons and gear to keep up with the latest meta and keep a level 60 maxed character to switch onto if someone is harassing your party. My new guy isn't maxed out yet, but post TSE nerf there isn't a counter to bloodied revenant etc. melee using stealthboys to troll vats. 
---
I've put a couple of hundred hours into it solo. Still play daily.  If you liked previous fallouts, you will enjoy it.  A beautiful world to explore and although it has its bugs n flaws its well worth picking up. Especially on pc as its like 8 quid/bucks.
---
Nurgle approves
---
Sure man. You are writing essays to concern troll Bethesda we get it. 
---
Yeah, I had a stack of mutant hound meat that I wanted to cook up with the second tier recipe but kept forgetting I didn’t have key ingredients like salt and berries. By the time I had fast traveled around and collected it all, it had spoiled.
---
There's more evidence indicating that he might be a duper than not. If I remember correctly, he was found for having 140k Ultracite ammo on his main a count and 225k Ultracite ammo on his alt.
---
Even if it's true that it keeps a tally of only what you pick up, it doesn't really make much sense for the discrepency, where the alt account (level 2 apparently) somehow recieved more ammo but not from the main account.
---
If the main account crafted only 10,000 Ultracite ammo, he would have had to transfer it back and forth across characters total of 13 times in the last 30 days to make it show up as 140k, according to his theory.
---
If he crafted 50,000 (he said he's not had anymore than 36,000 of any ammo by the way) ultracite ammo, it would only be about 3 transfers which correlates with his story about how choosing specializations and such. 
---
Ah i haven’t played the new one, and it’s in early access still I believe?
---
Ya I’m pretty late to the Subnautica seen, but have been enjoying &amp; taking my time with the first one.  
---
Currently exploring Aurora 😬. 
---
NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! ::brain explodes::
---
Good points, sure.   But then there’s this point:  technically) it is impossible to write proper haiku in English.  The 5-7-5 is an approximation, and never a rule. Far more essential is the logo, or nature reference, which in this case is the SBQ, rich irony considering that she is an abomination to nature itself.   
---
I bought it two weeks ago for $28 "used" on Amazon (no shrinkwrap, code still good). Probably put in over 100 hours since then and I'm planning on playing more tonight. Definitely worth it in my opinion. If you go into it with lowered expectations, it will definitely exceed them.  
---
Unless you're expecting an end game. Because there isn't one. I'm level 42 now; I've seen screenshots from level 450+ players.
---
Presumption of innocence is a core tenet of modern jurisprudence. Why do you automatically assume he is guilty? 
---
Pacifist mode prevents you from unwanted and unintentional PVP encounters. Beyond that, you made a conscious decision not to engage the guy attacking your base, thus saving you from entering into PVP. You already have all the resources required not to engage so long as you don't claim a workshop, which is clearly intended to be a PVP activity. 
---
How much more neutering of PVP is necessary to check all the boxes?
---
Becoming wanted is irrelevant to most griefers, as their friends can clear all of that off. What matter is how they initiate PvP with someone with a workshop. If the workshop is built enough big, initiating the claim, would force them to pay more than they might be intrested in paying.
---
What I asked if they can avoid that by just shooting and now with current rules, destroying a workshop part. If they only become wanted, without triggering full PvP with the workshop owner, the latter can just mostly ignore it.
---
Everybody moved on to apex get with the times mannn
---
350 hour gang
---
Lol u really think ur build would get nerfed if u shared. Who the hell do u think u are lmao 
---
GO NAVY BEAT ARMY!!!!! 
---
You’re spreading false information- it does not go away with relogging, at least on Xbox. The status may show otherwise but my Bloodied build is still doing 760 per shot (Gatling gun w/50% limb dmg bonus) at 10% health like it was before the display issue.  
---
It does however seem like you need to have a lower health for it to start proccing.
---
Yes because we did the same exact thing he did as well, and were not. I think they are removing the correct people because everyone on my friends list that duped or associated with duping was punished. Not the friend and i whom traded ammo every day. I’d you sit down and do some math you’ll also see how improbable it is. Do you understand how many nukes that would be on the scorch beast queen a day/ whitespring/mongo farming, not to mention of efficient you would also have to be at that. So yes I refuse to believe this guy, and if he only duped ammo? Yes he still deserves a ban. I don’t think you understand how these things work. Especially when ultracite ammo was one of the main targets for dupers. I know people who ONLY duped nuka Cherry’s to buy them self plans. They deserve a ban too.
---
::eyes suspiciously::
---
That’s good to know. I have a team of 2-3 others I usually play with so I will coordinate with them for the SBQ fight. 
---
I once had one of those enclave events where instead of scorched, or honey bees, or mutants, it was ALL Yao Guai.  Now as a ranged player, you can marsupial around and deal with it.  Not so much with melee.  One swipe gives a nice 1-2 second stagger you can't get out of.  Another swipe, another 1-2 seconds.  I was running, jumping, hiding, stimpacking, it was a HARD fight and very enjoyable (despite dying twice).
---
Too bad the Fun Police aren't interested in making some events "harder and more rewarding".  Something FUN!
---
They're too busy chasing bugs, nerfing things people like, and tilting at duper windmills.
---
You cans definitely get good hours for the price tag. There is lots to do and explore. If you take your time and find a decent group to run with you can get a lot of play.
---
So your theory is that I'm an anti-Bethesda troll?
---
Well that's a first, I do have to say.
---
Innocent untill proven guilty haha
---
Can confirm
---
Does it have unskippable cut scenes or in game scenes?
---
I got so VERY sick of that in the previous far cry games.
---
In other words, you cheat so everyone else does.... riiiiiiigggghhht
---
They're stealth buffing energy weapon builds by making everything else equally shit!
---
level 118, i connect 5 mn early my gatling 2 shots explosiv disapear....
---
good game !
---
They did change/lower the damage table (someone else posted it, probably why it bugged out) so it takes lower health to kick in (I think), but it is still potent sub %20 health.
---
Also, the positive effect still is not showing and the negative effect will be suppressed not show up for the first hour after taking the mutation.
---
That’s good to know, thanks! I noticed last night a couple letters were up in the command center. 
---
I'd argue that only bad games allow dupe bugs to remain, relying on automated enforcement to "fix" the issue after-the-fact. I know it's a lot to ask from Bethesda, but maybe they should just fix the damned game so shit like this is a non-issue. 
---
carry only one fertilizer in your junk tab.  that way you can have a good laugh if you die because you will "give a crap".
---
&gt;Did he also leave out the part where 900 hour guy had way too much Ultracite ammo to have feasibly been attained legitimately?
---
I find this to be a very strange post considering the person in the video [literally calls out the exact specific amount of ammo Bethesda says the banned account had.](https://youtu.be/bT8STHunM8k?t=124) 
---
Sooooo....I'm confused...did you not watch the video before posting your response to it?  Or? 
---
To be clear, I'm not saying I agree with the video, I'm am however saying that this post makes you look...uninformed at best. 
---
....to die in 10 seconds. 
---
Yeah how about no.
---
Problem with SBQ, you know where it is, you know how to ring her doorbell. For a lot of people that's fairly trivial thing.
---
5 stars should be far more random, far more suprising to encounter. I mean sure there's some good points to it. But still.
---
just shit
---
Thanks for that, any suggestions on where would be better in the Mire? Post above suggests General's Steakhouse which seems right on the edge of the bog/mire
---
the meat piles have directional buzzing if you end up waiting for them to show up. pretty useful!
---
Thanks, gonna save this for reference. So many berries in the Savage Divide...
---
It was.
---
Then the bugs....
---
And the nerfs......
---
And the lack of content.
---
It's hard to get excited by a patch when you see there's nothing FUN to do or see or experience in there.
---
So yes, you can get a couple of hundred hours of play out of it.  Then it just turns into a boring grind where you log in every day to do atom challenges, trade a little, mayyyybe do an event or two you aren't totally sick of (yeah I'm over Uranium Fever after the Legendary Scaling to Your Level nerf).
---
Apex Legends has been out for a couple of weeks.  They already have a new GUN in the game.  They've got a Roadmap.  People are excited.  I want to go play it right now.  I'm looking forward to when they release new characters.  In other words, I'm not BORED.
---
Nice, let me know how that goes!
---
Doesn't like most of this sub have a burning hysterical hatred for dupers and anything that looks like dupers though?
---
I'd also love to be able to simply upgrade a current weapon to a higher level at say, maybe 3/4 the cost of making it from scratch. 
---
You have been mistaken.
---
Not really though.  As soon as they contest it they can kill you.   The user wants the option to “seek revenge” or “give up” on a contested workshop.  
---
Personally I like the idea to just give up and let the person have it without a fight. 
---
i get what u mean about wanted not mattering if they have a group member clear their bounty, and return their caps.  however if u kill them before their friend does u get those caps.  this may only be mildly discouraging for 'griefers' but it is an added level of protection even if its small.  right now im testing a panic room,  player who wants to take my workshop will have to blow his way inside a building with multiple layers of walls (creating bounty) to get to me and kill me to remove me from the workshop radius and thereby successfully claim the workshop.  giving me time to react or server hop, costing the other player caps for trying to claim the workshop and giving them a bounty.
---
I thought you still had to go up to the work bench to initiate it. 
---
Or is it as soon as a random player walks in, it’s free for all. 
---
Actually same. I didn't get any notification my base was being attacked. Thought I just missed it
---
Do you understand what objectivity as a philosophy means at all?
---
Your essays are top notch concern trolling. Not sure what else to say. You either meant to do it or you didn't. Functionally you wrote a big post half in half out defending this guy. Out of concern that Bethesda is banning innocent people. With no real information other than that provided by the person that was banned. You're writing essays using biased information. The effect, intentional or otherwise, is that you are concern trolling. 
---
All they have to do is adjust the formula:
---
SBQ health and resist x Number of Players = Result
---
to
---
SBQ health and resist x Number of Players x AVERAGE PLAYER LEVEL = Result
---
Done.  Fixed.  There's your solution.  I should get a job at Bethesda!  Oops, scratch that, I don't want to be part of the Fun Police :(
---
I take it the inside the vault for today hasn't dropped yet?
---
We're currently planning to post this week's article tomorrow!
---
theyre on tuesdays,,,
---
Depends on what you are expecting out of the game, really.  
---
Imo it's worth the cost if you enjoyed fo4.  You can play the game solo or otherwise through the main quest and between exploring the map, outfitting your character, doing events/quests, building camps and so on there's enough content to justify the cost.  
---
The main issue I have with the game is lack of endgame content, but it will take you many hours to get to that point and I feel I got my moneys worth.  
---
It's definitely vastly better now than at launch.  Game used to freeze up/lock up/crash constantly and while it's still not perfect it's pretty solid.
---
Theyve been on thursdays for the past month, soo.....
---
They’re identical to modded hunting rifles. Just a lot cheaper to make. 
---
Cool. My PSN is the same as my reddit.
---
From anywhere in the workshop.  They other player just opens the build menu to contest it.  It was changed so people couldn’t build indestructible bunkers around the workshop bench and stop people from trying to take it over. 
---
Same i was too prior to about 30 mins ago.
---
Possibly. I didnt kill anyone.
---
No you don't.just to get a chance of higher loot drops off enemies.
---
Just get the code online and go for it. I think its possible solo with good guns 
---
Oh yeah, especially since the armor will let you grief people alot more efficiently. That alone is worth the money for some. It is arguably the best archetype of armor, but paying almost five times the brand new price of the game?
---
I just hope they bring back the dudes who done the Nuka World live stream. It was hilarious. 
---
It hasn't.
---
They [changed it](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asps77/fallout_76_v_1060_changelog_based_on_game_data/) so it starts kicking in at a lower point and has a different scale. Tested it last night and it seems to work as the changes imply:

So, before it would start kicking in at 90% damage. Now it doesn't start kicking in until you're below 60% hp, and doesn't start making a noticable difference until about 30% health. You also don't get the full benefit until you're below 10% health instead of getting it at below 20%.
---
On the case of the biggest ban thing with the 900 hours guy and your statement on the 100k ultracite thing. I'd point out that he did say:
---
&gt; I don't think I've once held more than 36,000 ammo at one time
---
That's any ammo actually, not just ultracite ammo.
---
Oh that’s dumb. Should still have to walk to the bench and do it, then run away. 
---
Hey there! We will post it tomorrow.
---
I saved up bought the fabled handmade plans then looked at what i made and wondered why. But i'm probably just doing it wrong.
---
More than a month even!
---
Sorry lockpick and hacker level 3 is handy ! But not neccessary
---
I had an issue yesterday where the first floor of my base was destroyed by a rat. This happened right in front of my eyes. One minute the base was fine the next a piece would disappear, then another, and another. The odd part was that I could not see the rat until I targeted it in VATs, no sounds of attacking creatures, and my turrets didn't target.
---
Luckily it was only the first floor which is minimal compared to above.
---
It's coming out tomorrow.
---
She seems a lot more tanky than she used to be. Takes twice as much ammo for me as it used to and I break multiple weapons often but she still goes down. Seems to be even less worthwhile than before.
---
I mean, you can’t play like that if you want.  It not vegan though. 
---
I hate them too! Their guns need to be nerfed like everyone else’s!
---
Well done fellow wastelander, always happy to see people helping others!
---
Wish they would fix the Guerrilla perk though, auto-pistols' are hella dope.
---
That could be good, so long as you know the crafting plan for the item, and it still shouldn't work on Legendary gear.
---
The aim is to make plans actual mean something for end-game.
---
I think if world enemies attack there is no notification. ie a Scorchbeast and Scorch Horde attack
---
Only new thing coming is the new PvP server mode next month.
---
Planning on before or after the stream?
---
Have you tried New Vegas yet?
---
yeah thats pretty cheesy
---
No, i genuinely dislike the community here and feel they are such a small outspoken sample of the actual player base. Its a shame bethesda reads and responds to the aweful suggestions here. 
---
Soft outspoken weenies.
---
I pve, pvp and run a roleplay guild with over 40 members and hours worth of custom quests i give out to players who love the content we have created. Much of these carebears love what i do on the roleplay side but would hate the pvp side. I let them do my quests but we stopped accepting redditors into the guild due to their bickering over "ediquette". Like not killing players? 
---
Imo there isnt even griefing in this game. Aside from chasing someone to another server or blasting music/ear cancer or unnecessary harassment over the mic. 
---
Ive had the type of peoe join my discord. The average pve redditor carebear. We have to boot them for cursing at minors who were pvping calling them griefer lowlifes and way worse curse words. Who says that shit to kids? Carebears are bullys man. Its kind of ironic. 
---
Cant wait for pvp servers with chill players who dont cry about junk it takes i minutes to farm. 
---
My base is a castle. It is a big target. Always players there, high traffic area so we can pull people to do our queats. (NEW GAD AREA) It was destroyed 10 times this week, 6 were nukes aimed at us by butrhurt pve care bears or raider gangs who lost a fight at our camp. Fallout fanboys in denial about the game they are playing. 4 were by pvping "gangs" we were engaged with casually breaking walls during the exchange to lower cap loss at death. . And its not a big deal at all to repair my castle. 170 wood/steel and 15 or less of ther assorted junks. So ive spent over 1200 steel repairing my camp this week. Literally it's no big deal and i wasnt mad about it once. 
---
Now im ranting lol.  
---
Came here to say this exact thing.  I've done it twice.  A Scorchbeast destroyed a few walls one time and Molerats ate my Fusion generator.  Rather than repair it all I just moved my CAMP a few feet.  Thankfully nothing was floating so I could use the blueprint it creates when moved. 
---
Anything for page views.  Literally.
---
Move on then. Quit giving a game you hate so much free rent in your head. Play something else.
---
How in any way is allowing players to opt put of PvP neutering it? The players (such as myself) who would choose to opt out, already don't engage in PvP. What would be lost? 
---
Just because PvP is a mechanic in the game, doesn't mean that the developers intended it as a focus of the game play. I'd say that co-operation is much more emphasized by the game and not fighting each other. 
---
I may have not done anything do them, but they were 98, and I was 29. No matter what I did it wouldn't end well. If I engaged him.before hand and he then attacked my camp that'd be one thing, but this was unprovoked and out of nowhere.
---
If you're a higher level player and don't have anything else to do but PvP keep it with other players around your level, don't attack someone a third of your level. At that point it's not PvP, you're just being a dick. 
---
I'm also not alone in feeling this way look at the other comments here. People share the same opinion as me. 
---
I'm not calling for the end or neutering of PvP, just an opt out. 
---
I got a legendary broadsider, knuckles and armor piece off a bloated at Whitespring yesterday. Nothing worth keeping.
---
Lol, Im a WK dont go there. Im doing easy time, and i dont mind it. This is all for the best
---
Wild Appalachia too
---
This is awesome, thank you so much!
---
It's probably just because they changed the AD damage table and that when a mutation is applied they are "compiled" in some sense, linking to specific memory location instead of variables (probably done so that the code will be able to execute quickly/real time). 
---
Removing AD and reapplying fixed AD, NR and bloodied for me.
---
Nah
---
We're shooting to have it up before the stream tomorrow. It's finishing up being localized for all languages now.
---
You're welcome :)
---
Not for the Gutsys.
---
They are a random hostile spawn.  You can go there dozens of times and not encounter them, then the next time they are there.
---
Also, a Charred Feral Ghoul pack will sometimes spawn within the city.
---
I would love the increased spawns, I like a bit of a challenge and gutsys are about as deadly as they come.  Your server hop explanation doesn't quite work for me, because it's not like I see it pop up and vanish quickly... it just never showed up.  Before it was about once an hour, but in two separate two hour sessions it didn't pop up once.  How does someone server hopping to find it cause the event to just stop triggering in the server I'm in for over 2 hours straight?
---
Who has time to read when you're busy being outraged?
---
That's one reason my first floor consists of a concrete foundation and 1 set of stairs (at least as soon as I can finish moving my crops off the ground).  Too many things sneaking up and chewing on the walls otherwise.
---
Now, if I can just get the super mutants to stop shooting at me from halfway across the valley...
---
PVP zones and peaceful don't really go together.
---
No, right after I beat FO3 that's next. I figured I should do FO3 first, buzz around the water cooler is that game is pretty sweet as well =D. 
---
Removing and reapplying AD has returned AD, NR and bloodied to normal for me (tested on several servers). 
---
Same haha! Enjoying my 8 dollar unstoppables costume! I think I'm gonna buy 3 more!
---
So, let me get this straight: You guys ban someone who bought your game twice and played legitimately for 900 hours because he played legitimately for 900 hours.  And this is after you *scammed* purchasers of Power Armor Edition and Nuka Dark Rum among so many other things.  Fuck you, Bethesda.  Fuck you.  I am never spending another cent on anything you've touched.
---
The problem is nerfed drop rates on top of already bad RNG tables.
---
In the 400+ hours I've played and all the hours my friends have played, I've found exactly ONE meta weapon from a drop.  War Drum (max lvl) / Instigating / Swing Speed / 90% Reduced weight.  Most of the drops I get are useless for both me and for trading purposes.
---
Which is where the dupers came in.  The black market existed (past tense) because players were sick of such shitty drops over, and over, and over, and over.  It wasn't fun, it wasn't rewarding, it sucks.
---
Now that 90% of them are gone,  you're back to even MORE NERFED drop rates.  Don't believe me?  Hit the Golf Club during a Whitesprings nuke.  It used to be "shoot once, then run like HELL to get up high somewhere" because 20-30 or more ghouls were going to come POURING out of that place and you'd get a 3 star, a couple of 2 stars, and a ton of 1 stars.  Try that today.  Shoot, don't bother running though.  Easily dispatch the 10 ghouls that show up.  Feel lucky if you get a single 2 star suppressors / blocking damage rolling pin.
---
It got to the point where I see a nuke coming down and I'm like "meh, why bother".  It's not fun, it's not rewarding, and it feels like you're trying to dry hump your couch.  It's not exciting.
---
Maintaining wanted status? Find a settlement, break a wall. Say "send me the bill sucker" into your microphone while running away
---
Getting things done... Sure, its more like you're pretending to get things done while anxiously looking every direction
---
The funnest experiences I've had have been in taking workshops and being Wanted. I had 15 people come after me once and I killed them all, but with hand on the controller. ::sits back in chair smugly::. Yup... bunch of noobs they were hah hah hah.... 
---
&gt; Your essays are top notch concern trolling. Not sure what else to say. 
---
Please put my name into google before you say something even stupider than what you already have.
---
If your mid level, Nuke zones are still the best way to level.  I'll spend hours leveling once solo, or level 3x in a half hour in a nuke zone.  
---
Instead of bitching about people playing the game, it's probably better to educate.  Lowbies can help by taking care of mobs, grounding SBs with shotguns, reviving high levels, etc.

modders can do a better job.
---
Bethesda has responded and I am deleting this post. 
---
How do I go about that? Always looking to diversify my revenue streams. Great idea!
---
milk truck just arrive
---
Didn't cheat, not banned, but not getting banned doesn't mean you aren't a cheater.
---
I will say that once I hit lvl 200 I’m definetly
---
Going to make myself a full non legendary set just for the fun of it. I did that at 50 to revitalize gameplay a lot
---
I would SO spend the atoms on these....
---
I think you will enjoy it if you just want to explore around and do the quests (which I did find interesting). Do listen to the holotapes too. 
---
If you play it only for the end game... well don't. Just savour the real content.
---
Thank you I was worried I wasn’t explaining my idea well enough.
---
if u are on ps4 plz let me join ur roleplaying guild.  i just built a texas red roleplay character and now that Playstation will be allowing us to change our PSN in the coming months im changing mine to Texas\_Red or something like that, so people see my bounty and name on the map and have extra reason to come after me.  my plan is to reward the rangers with loot ive got banked.  i feel like we are kindred spirits or something
---
Whats Fortnite? And why would I leave you alone, you are too much fun fanboy.

Hate to break it to you, but I’m betting survival mode will have increased legendary enemy spawns, just like it did in FO4
---
Well duh.

AMD and Nvidia both have fps (and other) monitoring built in to their software.

You should not have to throw away any parts of a $2000 pc to play Fallout 76, unless you were mega ripped off!
---
I haven't played 76 for months but how was a couple playing together in the game? Aren't the servers random?  
---
I feel like it would be worth buying a second system so my husband and I could build our camp together.
---
Video*
---
As someone that does know how to code,  ican't wrap my head around how they break something that was previously working. And then release it to stable build with no QA. But sure go on.
---
I think it is loading in on the same server sometimes. Its getting harder to find fresh servers or ones that havent already been farmed by someone else

Better not be another timed Atom Shop item.

---
You also have to consider he had 3 100k+ flags. Not just one.
---
Not saying the 900 hour guy was legit don't get me wrong. Play time doesn't equate to innocence, but I bet if you took like a stack of 2k ultracite ammo and kept trading it back and forth it would hit a flag, but the amount of time it'd take to transfer that much ammo wouldn't leave much time for other stuff.
---
They've played Fallout 76? 🤣
---
Thank you 🙏🏻 
---
As of right now she's the top dog so she should be a decent fight and level with the average player level for the server. I'm sort of a veteran with a dozen or so Scorched Earth events under my belt. I know it's far less than a lot of other players but I know what it usually takes to bring her down. Today on 2 separate occasions it took 3x's the effort to get her to mutate and bring her down to half of her health bar afterwards. Then she didn't take any damage after that whatsoever.
---
I don’t know for certain, but after leveling a few characters it ‘feels’ that food begins spoiling more quickly as you rise in levels
---
**I have a very specific quest.**
---
Find the person(s) on the Bethesda team that thinks focusing 100% on bugs, nerfs, and small QOL stuff while adding ZERO new content is a good idea.  My friend didn't quit because of bugs, nerfs, and small QOL stuff.  They quit because they're BORED.
---
Make them find a new job.  Preferably at a place that sells Whoppers or Big Macs.  It'll be hard for them to suck the fun out of that.  I'm sure they'll try, but having someone supervise their Big Mac creation will remedy those errors.
---
I respect your opinion.
---
Wrong. All those youtubers prevented those lunchboxes....err delayed them because they are still coming. Still in the code, and your lord and savior bethesda has not denied them lmfao....pls dont tell me you arent perceptive enough or possess critical thinking skills sufficient to understand this lmfao at your comment
---
I would hold on to them until after they fix it just in case 
---
Nothing wrong with suggestions. Thanks for your input.
---
Thats why i havnt raken a workshop in months
---
If your teammate had it off and the other person becomes wanted it might explain it, although when Ive hunted wanted players I have always had to turn it off so it might also be broken.
---
It works for me, but it won't work if you're stuck in caution. Crouch and see if you flagging as caution. I don't think they fixed that bug. If so, relogging should fix it until it gets stuck again.
---
Healing factor kicks in when you are out of combat. Recent bugs make it so you are in combat in strange places. Try ducking, see if you are in [Danger] or Hidden.
---
So having all 5 of you fanboys being the only ones playing a game that is supposed to have millions playing? Good logic, real mature 
---
I'm not great with app creation, but this seems simple enough. Just need a time and make it count 20 hours right?
---
I agree. I've dabbled with basic 3D modeling. It's harder than it appears to do simple shit. I love this game because within its environment I've made some new friends worldwide.
---
No they can’t. Not even remotely close. Also, it’s unfair comparison, the dev teams have hundreds of tasks, some guy (or group) that is fixated on a single task is of course going to be able to resolve or improve whatever singular issue they are working on.  
---
I’ve never once seen “original content” from a modder that comes anywhere close to the people that actually create the game.
---
Just had a read they are streaming tomorrow so maybe no inside the vault today
---
I dont remember the spanish inquisition from history of the world. But i do remember a monty python skit where they said "noone expects the spanish inquisition" and Terry Giliam jabbed some old lady with a soft pillow. Michael Palin was the leader and asked him if he had all the padding at 1 end.
---
Thanks a relog fixed it.
---
No self respecting AAA game company would allow such a hackneyed quest.
---
Save some schematics for a concrete bunker and build it on top of them the moment you see someone.
---
Trust no one.
---
No one was wanted. I have tried killing wanted players and forgot I was in pacifist mode and ruined my surprise attack
---
&gt; That’s not the issue at hand. I’m pretty sure that he had more ammo than it was feeble to make in the time frame. Plus we all know that having lots of a particular item puts strain on the servers
---
Then Bethesda managed to fuck the game's code up more than their previous games. Because that's bullshit. And definitely not something "we all know." On account of it being the result of the utmost incompetence.  
---
Storing lots of the same ID should take hardly any resources.  
---
People have billions of resources in other games. The only thing that should be affecting the servers are having lots things that aren't a single ID. You know, like all those holotapes and keys they put in the game. Or the silly legendary system they made worse resource wise by making it multiple tiers.
---
I've only noticed the Hunger seems doubled. Not sure about the health. 
---
Yes! Thats the main reason I ended up getting carnivore. i started to test it myself and I now only use level 1 cannibal instead of using 2 or 3 like i was before. I use almost no stims except in emergency combat situations.
---
The idiots that believe this shit are as bad as anyone of one book.
---
Cool, no worries I’m good on plastic but have way too many springs lol. My GT ATXlien, I should be on around then so just shoot me a message there! 
---
You’re the first person I’ve seen besides me using that ridiculous fucking lid
---
I understand your points but you do realize practically your whole argument is anecdotal right?  Even the part about doing the math.  I found math that supports his ammo counts as being feasible.   I think it highly likely Bethesda made a mistake.   Given they have a history of this, that is not anecdotal.  I am on trading discords and there have been plenty of traders who were known dupers that did not get banned, so anecdotally that seems to cancel out your observations.  
---
  Again which you completely ignored in your response, Bethesda screws up over and over again.  Why would this be any different?  
---
The 20hr cooldown thing works consistently for me.
---
The other part is a hypothesis, drawn from trying to get x-01 shocks from the enclave vendor. And having the vendors cap stash reset differently than the rest of my vendor loop when all were zero'd within an hour of each other. I bought other mods while trying to get the shocks. And than again when I was farming the lever action plans and having the responder faction vendors reset later than the rest of the factions if I had affected the cap stash, and reset at the same time if I only accessed the vendor but didnt buy or sell anything.
---
Your welcome to test and get back to me.
---
This still makes me laugh.
---
First they nuke workshop output to make it less useful.
---
Then they leave the Workshop PVP Exploit in for no reason.
---
Instead of fixing that, they now allow you to bypass ALL the workshop defenses and be able to claim it from a deserted corner of the build area.
---
Do they not even discuss these changes with anyone?  Think it out a bit?  Or is Milton in the basement with his swingline stapler muttering to himself "uh, hmmm, change workshop, hmmm, uh".
---
You can still do the "teleport"
---
Lol ok. I don’t code. But I know a few people that do, and one of the most common jokes floating around those circles is “fix one line, break ten more.”
---
That's the plan. I would sell that one until I know for sure.
---
Well, for most things you are right, but sometimes there are bugs that can be fixed with a single constant change. I think that's why some people can be frustated. Those issues I have in mind have a huge "QoL if fixed / time spent fixing" ratio. 
---
For example, plasma gatling could last x10 more, flamer fuel could be crafted by 200 for the same price instead of a few units. All perk cards could display actually percentage instead of reading "increase chance of [...]". 
---
sorry haven't been on twitter in awhile since school and work. Yes there are a few and one im even part of. You have to be recruited in but ill send a recruiter your discord name, just message me it. The outcast one has died off since only a handful of people participated and no point when there is bigger and better ones that are way more active. 
---
Ooh, I see. So I guess it's broken then. It should not be the case.
---
Couldnt have said it better i love modders to death but they work on one thing and do that thing while a dev team has to deal with a ton of things and this angry ass sub all the time 
---
Oooooof
---
Innocent until proven guilty.
---
After hearing about duping? No, i would have left it. Besides, i use normal guns i make myself, so i have all the ammo i need. I usually carry about 3000 of 308/38/5.56 combined. 
---
&gt;You've never multiboxed I see or the lingo has changed a mirror is a program that duplicates imputs by the user to multiple programs, a bot is well a bot they are different one gives no program advantage while the other does.
---
Uh, seems you don't understand how multiboxing works. I multiboxed back during WoW with 5 toons at once, the main and 4 followers.
---
You do not need any program to split the input of the keyboard or mouse, you can easily set multiple windows to windowed borderless and have them set to half or 1/4 the resolution of your monitor or monitors(I ran 3 monitors when I multiboxed) all you have to do is set the programs to "always be on top" and they all will receive the inputs from the keyboard and mouse as long as they are running. No programs at all needed.
---
Once again, none of this even matters as the issue is BSG is MISCOUNTING the ammo for every time the character picks it up.
---
&gt;And you want to know the biggest hole in your theory? His alt and main accounts generated nowhere near a similar amount of ammo which his alt ferryd it's missing something like 350k ammo roughly counting the non ultracite "only" like 85k ultracite ammo
---
Why would they have to be anywhere close to one another? Did you even read his post? He clearly said sometimes he even fat fingered and picked the ammo up and put it back multiple times because he thought he was on a different character.
---
So lets do the math, say his main has 36k ultracite ammo, and he stashes it in a container(which he said he did in his post) and then uses his alt pick it up, now both his main and alt show 36k ultracite ammo. Now lets say his alt puts it back down and he alt tabs to his main to pick it up and not paying attentin goes back to his alt and picks it up again, now his alt is at 72k ammo. Afterwards he notices that he accidentally didn't switch it to his main so he drops it in the container again to give to his main, now both his main and alt are showing 72k ammo. Now lets say he had that ammo because he was using it with a TSE weapon and the TSE nerf comes through, so he once again mules it over to the alt, now the alt is showing well over 100k ammo and his main is showing 72k. So now he respecs and tries a different build(wouldn't be hard t respec when you are level 450, means you could have respecced nearly 10 times if you count a full build to be level 50) and transfers it back over to the main character, now the main shows 108k ammo as does the mule. Now lets say okay so he starts that new character and mules the ammo from the main to the alt and then to the new character, the mule now shows 144k the main character shows 108k and the new character shows 36k. Now if he mules it back and forth between that new character and the mule it could easily push the mule well past 300k and the main character would only show 140k(which is the number that does show).
---
Yeah same, I'm lucky to have a few friends playing with me so I can transfer stuff back and forth. Most of them have quit now, but I can still convince them to log in to help me. It's so nice having multiple toons to play with different play styles and needs. I tend to have short supplies of lead on my heavy gunner but the other toons are swimming in it. Ballistic fiber isn't a problem for my heavy gunner, but my 2h build eats it alive. My pistol build just doesn't really need much, it doesn't go through ammo very quickly and it doesn't use up much resources. It's also not terribly potent compared to the heavy gunner or 2h, but that's mostly because I don't have a good gun yet. I do have an instigating black powder pistol and that 1 shots most things that aren't in a nuke zone, but still. Not so much fun to play vs the other two.
---
It's more than tanky if you ask me. I seen her totally stop taking any damage whatsoever after mutating and half her health bar afterwards. Like I said in another comment; cats were freezing her with a quad cryolator so it'd take her twice as long to take flight again, calling in orbital strikes &amp; unloading with missile launchers &amp; other heavy weapons. It was absolutely unreal the effort with zero reward. A guy I met on reddit that I trade with said there's been other posts on here about her not dying.
---
My habit for shooting anything red is what made me notice this. I always keep on pacifist in whitesprings because of tesla rifle
---
Did you mod FO4?
---
Exactly. 
---
Is that all you got lol? Terrible put down, you need step your game up my son. I can teach you how to be an OG and not so generic and boring. Ill bet you only wear white tshirts lmao
---
Are you interested in joining?
---
If we’re talking inescapable concrete foundation bunker then I might have to give it a try lol
---
Are you interested in joining.
---
Changing the adrenaline reaction damage table resulted in it not working, but removing and reapplying it fixes it.
---
Probably what is happening is that as mutations are applied they link to specific memory locations instead of to variables with the obvious benefit being real/run-time execution performance.
---
It would have been nice if they could have been able to perform this fix to all affected accounts, but there are probably performance reasons why this was not a feasible option as well.
---
My fave thing to do is lure a SB or other nearby mob to them, pop a stealthboy and enjoy the sweet sweet junk :D
---
lol no one trying to kill you is going to stand still long enough for you to drop a blueprint 'around them'
---
Ya! Just wanted to make sure I could keep my starlet Sniper outfit before messaging your army’s go-to guy
---
I read something in the patch notes if i remember correctly that becoming hostile now affects the whole team. Something to that affect i briefly glanced over. 
---
But we only mainly wear Army Fatigue mostly.
---
I've always found the asshole redneck neighbors shooting off guns without any concern for what they might hit (or deliberately hitting the nicer place they're jealous of) the most realistic part of this West Virginia simulator.
---
I agree with that. I like making cool stuff
---
I know it makes it so the hole team is hostile but I wasnt sure if I was supposed to be able to kill people with pacifist active 
---
You can get a set from finishing Rose's Raider quest line. 
---
So you're saying the nerfed without putting it on the notes and thinking the community wouldn't find out? LOL no way the would do such a thing!  
---
You should be able to 
---
1. “Disenchant” precious stuff you found 
---
2. Add a single star to customize a weapon with a known enchantment once or more in its lifetime. Perhaps at the cost of being able to subsequently traceable/sellable (like atom shop stuff). 
---
What is your point? God made people such that they can bleed. That doesnt make it ok to stab them. That isnt even the point. The guy was duping and selling. He was 1 of the 1st people banned, ergo he was probably 1 of the biggest or most prominant offenders.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/HTisMpC
---
Apropos.
---
whatever the fuck that is, lmfao
---
New California.
---
and the "fixes" in the patch notes are far from hundreds, they're something a modder could do in an afternoon- and not break anything else.
---
what you're saying is categorically untrue.
---
Shocking, I know. They were so great about *telling* us that they would be more transparent that I was *certain* they would never do such a thing again.
---
Oh yeah good point.  That's why I'm wondering for workshops since the update if someone starts shooting me if i have to go find somewhere safe to switch off pacifist and die by the time i back out the settings. 
---
It's gonna be wild
---
There you go...proving my point...
---
I don't see how this is relevant to the discussion here. Are you just trying to make me look stupid? That shouldn't be the point of this, we're not discussing what I do and do not know. 
---
If you're trying to make the argument that my talking points don't matter because it's coming from a place of frustration and not 100% objectivity than I don't think that matters. The point of a game is to have fun, if your players aren't having fun than you as the developer misstepped somewhere. If you look at the rest of the comments here I'm not the only one who feels this way, and I doubt your not the only one that likes open ended PvP. 
---
I suggested on Bethesda's forums that they add the Perk Loadout Manager (like they did with Known Plans) to the game.  They almost immediately flagged my post as "spam" so no one else could post on it.  LOL.
---
Exactly, you'd be scared to take it.
---
Not knowing about things people not knowingly talking about. You see where this argument is going? Answer being nowhere.
---
He created the website Giant Bomb.
---
I noticed there's been some kind of delay to some shit hit youtube and gaming news, it's been some time since the 900 hour dumbfuck ban and it only really got big the last two days on the places I use to keep up.
---
I don't know what it means, just saying, it's weird.
---
Maybe get a friend and test that out
---
Nope, because who gives a shit if you're capped? Caps are useless **because** there is such a low cap. Making sense now?
---
I had an entire thing planned out to respond until I remember reading that you’re in trade discord’s with dupers and they’re not banned. Obviously you’re going to stick up for this guy, I shall not waste my time with you. Have a good one! 
---
Yeah it would definately need to be organized as well as advertised.....example...you could find 3 deignated volunteers for each system to run it each week.... PC...xbox...ps4....
---
Let's say we use vault 76 as the trading ground and we use Sunday between the hours of 6pm est ending at 8pm est...
---
The whole week leading up to Sunday we could leave posts on different trading forums reminding everyone where and when it would be encouraging buyers and sellers to attend and adding whoever volunteers as a friend so that they can join server and participate....it would definitely start off slow but would add some type of socialism to the game that's very much needed plus something a lil different and fun
---
just a thought 
---
You already have an opt out, two in fact. Pacifist mode, which is a passive safeguard and the active measure of not tagging anyone back when they attack you or your base.
---
In your example, both worked flawlessly as you were entirely unharmed and never became flagged for PVP.
---
No one is saying that destroying another players base is the focus of the game or that it should be. But it is PART of the game and it has various related mechanics to support its function and solidify the intentions of the developers.
---
The only reason anyone is pushing back on you is because you are asking for a solution to a problem that doesn't exist and want that change implemented for everyone. Of course allowing further opt outs impacts people looking to engage in PVP, as it removes one of only three or four actions that can trigger such an encounter.
---
I personally play cooperatively 99% of the time and go out of my way to assist other players I run across. But part of the game is also being able to interact with players competitively, and believe it or not, destroying their base is a pretty effective way to get someone to shoot back - everyone already has the option not to. 
---
You had a point? Whoa dude, this is serious stuff here, you should elaborate. I will accept nothing less than a minimum 1000 word essay, APA format, and it better be compelling. 
---
The game is wonderful overall.  The world is beautiful, with many secrets hidden among the landscape to discover even when you thought you had seen it all.  There are some pretty awful bugs too but none that have caused me or my husband to quit so far.  Once everything is completed can be a bit of a struggle finding new and exciting things to do, but there are a few options like building, pvp, and dailies to keep you occupied, if only for a little while.  Hopefully some new content for both sides (pvp/pve) is in the works!  
---
All this being said, I would probably still wait for a sale before buying.  
---
Maybe they could just replace the workshop icon with a round version of the player icon. 
---
I like pacifist cause i tend to get excited in vats like oops.  Especially when my adrenaline and gun fu is kicking in. I try and be careful in nuke zones solo.  Sometimes it auto targets the next victim of a player instead of the sbq. 
---
No he didn't, the mods of this sub did which is why those posts said [removed] not [deleted].
---
&gt; i can't wrap my head around how they break something that was previously working
---
1. Find bug, branch off on your own to fix.
---
2. Deploy fix.
---
3. Main branch updates and gets posted.
---
4. ...
---
5. ~~Profit!~~ Disappearing fix.
---
Not that hard to wrap your head around.  Dumb?  Yes.  Preventable?  Absolutely.  But not hard to see it happening, given everything else going on since launch.
---
Thanks y’all for the answers :)
---
Hence why I inquired about being a specialist team. I’ll always help you guys out when I can and wherever I see ya.
---
Don’t have anything at the moment, but I’ll PM you if I ever do!
---
Anytime. We all looking out for a better wasteland
---
I like play in this fallout world as much as I liked 3, 4, and NV.  Very fun. That said I will be glad to see the separate PVP and PVE servers come on line. Most every player I’ve come across has been friendly but it will be nice to know guys that want PVP will have a separate place to play. 
---
Touche!
---
You are missing the entire part where even the 900 Hour guy admitted that he wrote his guide to how he did everything after he got banned. The thing is he was already lying about the timing of his ban  as he said he got caught in the duping ban wave but he contradicted him self because he also stated he wrote the guide after being banned but he posted the guide at least a day before the whole ban wave happened.  
---
 Not only that he admitted in the guide he uses a macro for harvesting because it tricks the game into giving you more items than it should. Ironically that is almost the exact same way duping for the ammo and stuff is done. 
---
 To add to that in his guide he never mention any perks other than ammo-smith and super-duper perks for his gathering and crafting. The shear amount of time it takes just to gather stuff for ultracite to craft is out of this world especially not using perks like green thumb to help i mean just think about how many nukes has to be used alone . Also his 900 hours do not come into play as everything he was caught with was for a 30 to 31 day stretch not the entire 90 days he has played.   
---
Even if he was banned for all the ammo passed through his account his main account would have the ammo listed that he passed through and it only had ultracite 140k worth. His mule account had a lot of regular ammo and 255k of ultracite. So even if the amount got inflated it dose not account for how he only had ultracite on his main account.
---
The fact he has a character past level 450? 
---
=(
---
The reason you post to reddit is to debate, or at least meme. You'd post to Bethesda if you had a reasonable suggestion. Reddit is for fun.
---
Is objectivity offensive to you because... you're American? Is it because you refuse to debate anything and just want an echo chamber?
---
Hmmm, I believe you are correct haha Mel Brooke's has a spanish inquisition scene as well that I was confusing this reference for
---
You’re not wrong, but I think there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes and certain things take precedent. I’m sure those things will be addressed.

Who would screenshot and save 1771 files lmfao? Man you gits are hilarious! I am getting a little tired schooling you fanboys, its too easy. Also, there used to be allot more of you fanboys silencing opinions like little communists, but not as many replies as I was expecting. You guys are dwindling, this is worse than I previously thought
---
Honestly I've leveled a few characters and by far the fastest leveling 1-40 was from event hopping.
---
&gt;Except you missing the part where his main account would have more items listed and inflated numbers than his mule account yet that is not the case his main that he says he used to craft and pass to his mule account only had 140k worth of Ultracite his mule account had 255k of ultracite + all the other ammo. 
---
Yeah. They're much tougher than protectrons or robobrains. 
---
Assaultrons on the other hand are even worse. I have gone on two bunker runs with some seriously strong players and even they have a serious respect for the assaultrons. 
---
The thing about the gutsies is that they generally travel in packs too. ... And their ammo  *must* be armor piercing. 
---
Maybe even a mod system for crafted weapons and armor to add certain keywords? Make it to where only 1 mod can be added per piece.  Then randomize the mods.  So say I find a two shot explosive weight reduction mod for a combat shotgun.  After applying that mod, you can't apply anything further.  So we could create our own legendaries with limits.  I would even like if we could brand our names to it.  So if someone likes the item, they know who made it.
---
That’s not entirely true, as I stated before we’ve moved over 100,000 rounds of ammo that was considered flagged (none unltracite) and nothing happened to us. But you are correct, trading that much would leave very little time to do other things, not to mention the amount it takes to run a silo and drop nukes and be disgustingly efficient in every single one. Even if he did clip through silos to make them faster, his story just doesn’t add up. He’s not telling us something. 
---
Except when you’re talking games you’re talking game engines. Game engines really simplify most of creating a game. Especially when most of that game was created for fallout 4. 
---
Bethesda isn’t creating new compression algorithms or creating new complicated network schemes or doing anything new or innovative really. 
---
That’s why it’s baffling when something as simple as say fixing energy weapons comes up, because that should literally be as simple as changing values and then testing if said values meet the desired outcome.
---
Now any good coder has run into a time when one change culminated into hours of frustration trying to figure out what and how that change fucked up five other things. But this is a triple A game studio, they are getting paid six figure salaries to get it right, and they aren’t getting it right a majority of the time. Also it appears there are no play testers left, so the devs either spend half their time doing a job that someone else should be getting paid a lot less than them to do, or there’s just no testing done at all and I’m confident in saying it’s the latter.
---
The post showed it was possible to do it in a WEEK over a 30 day period it would almost trivial.
---
I don't care about and will most likely not participate in PVP, but this idea is trash. PVP can only really work with less restrictions not more, so having a PVP only server is actually the best option for that. Trying to maintain this weird balance and doing things with half-measures is worthless for everyone.
---
That dude you are arguing with is clearly just a griefer, but instead of doing it in game, he does it on reddit.
---
some people have nothing better to do, sorry bud.

This is awesome info. Thank you so much. It helps a lot going forward.

I'm looking at staring a bravo run at 2115 UK time, need help anyone available? Ps4 add: Sweetdeal2010

You can try it.
---
I'd recommend advertising heavily, and NOT telling people what the in-game name of the Trade Leader person is until the event has started.  Otherwise they'll get spammed with requests now, and won't remember why they added the person later.
---
That Trade Leader person will have to server hop like crazy to find an almost deserted server.  Then stay there so everyone can join off of them.  Or maybe you have 2-3 people that are Trade Leaders, so you have it going on in 2-3 servers.
---
Also encourage people to leave once they're done trading so that others can join.  Look on Trade Leader's friends list if people are saying "server full" in reddit, you'll find people who haven't left the server yet.  I have that happen with a lot of trades I do (they stay in my server), but since I'm doing mostly 1-1 trades it doesn't matter.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
When you pose an argument you have to prove yourself, not force your opponent to prove themselves. So if I were to claim that he was not a duper, I would have to prove that he was clean of the “crime”. I wouldn’t ask someone else to prove me wrong cause I haven’t proven myself right in the first place. Once the person who started proves themselves you can then raise questions/facts to debunk their proof/lies. But if someone starts off with “prove me wrong” or something similar then it’s best to move on and assume they’re full of shit and don’t actually know what they’re talking about. Whether they are full of shit or not isn’t your problem either, they started it, you don’t have to humor them by trying to prove them wrong if they can’t even prove themselves right.
---
They actually fired 800
---
Pretty sure the mods pretty openly said that only people saying they were banned had to stay in the megathread. And that people talking a crock of shit about the people banned are free to do so everywhere.  
---
I mean, that's literally what the megathread says for the body.
---
It’s a known bug, if you do too much damage then the game can’t register it and sometimes actually heals the enemies. As far as the legendary monster is concerned, they do refill their hp bar once they’re at about 30% health.

They banned a bunch of ppl for no reason and dont respond for shit to the tickets

I don’t believe that’s true in the slightest but here we are at impasse, I’m deeply sceptical that he didn’t do something illegal and you are confident he innocent. Although in the end probably doesn’t matter. 
---
It's more like if they can't make money off playing the game, better make money talking shit about it. These people are not interested in the good of the game, most of them are not even Fallout players.
---
It's not that I'm defending Bethesda, I couldn't care less to them, but I am interested about the game and want it to succeed, that's why I stick around.
---
the creator is looking for feedback before releasing an update  
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124/?tab=forum&amp;topic\_id=7413426&amp;BH=0](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=7413426&amp;BH=0)
---
Duping involved intentionally crashing or lagging servers, that affected many players in a very negative way, not to mention the grief Bethesda took over their server stability, when most of it was caused by players intentionally doing it to cheat.
---
Duping also devastated the in game economy by flooding the Player Trading market with Cheap counterfeits of weapons that were meant to be extremely rare, and using duped items (Bobbleheads) to generate off the scale Damage, robbing other players of experience and loot.
---
Foundation stacking Camps cause no instability to the game, or deprive other players of anything except, preventing griefers from costing the CAMP owner resources and time to rebuild,
---
My experience with 90% of the players that attack camps is that they are already exploiting the games mechanics to cause grief without risking anything in the first place (huge bounty, but has no caps), if those (A$$hats), players get mad &amp; quit playing, I wouldn't mind at all.
---
&gt; and chances are you will never find your very specific drop.
---
This isn't true. I've got 1 of every kind of build and I have my very specific drops for all of them all found myself. Those builds are as follows rifle, pistol, heavyweapons/explosive, shotgun and two hander. 
---
If you mean to say that a simple bloodied/furious/instigating/aa weapon isn't good enough, that it also needs to have 40% swing speed or vat crits or some other 2nd tier legendary modifier then you're absolutely wrong. All of my toons function just fine with normal 1 star legendaries. The only toon I have that has nice 2/3 star weapons is my melee toon, the one that ironically needed it the least. Actually my pistol toon has some nice ones as well, got a aa/explosive western revolver but I don't like playing that toon much tbh.
---
Legendary enemies if not killed in 1 shot will have a health Regen when 75% or so dmg is done. Totally normal.
---
Go home and cry to mommy you little baby bitch
---
Wait everything is regenerating health? Try relogging. 
---
I wish everything you ate had an animation like cannibal, I really only do it to scare my enemies because dog food is so plentiful and with the good doggy perk heals a ton of hp
---
&gt;Even if he mentioned that what he failed to mention is that His main account should not had just 140k of ultracit If it was in fact just all the ammo that passed through the accounts. His main account should of had the regular ammo also listed and actually more since it passed though that account more. As he would have crafted and passed it to him mule and then from the mule back when needed. 
---
XP exploiting was a very big thing. Level means nothing, but you can check under Challenges for total play time.
---
Yeah, but he had over 300k.
---
I’ve never flown a helicopter. But if I saw one in a tree, I could still be like, ‘Dude fucked up. It’s not supposed to be up there. That’s pilot error.'”
---
Where does it say it was an instantaneous scan? Where does it say his account "held" those items, or anything remotely similar? All it says is that the account was "exploiting" those items, which could mean just about anything. It sure as hell doesn't counter what I'm suggesting.
---
Talking about fallout 76 IS talking about how shitty bethesda has become in the recent past.
---
People really don't understand that, unfortunately.  Being a YouTube channel 'host' and building a following is a skill.  But not all YouTube hosts have any other skills.
---
I watch some channels where vocal coaches talk about technique.  They'll react to a performance and tell you in technical terms what is going on with the singing.  That's someone whose opinion I will put some weight to.
---
I watch some channels were professional mechanics with decades of experience talk about how to work through car problems, and how to fix things when they go wrong.  That's someone whose opinion I will put some weight to.
---
But the hosts who've never had a 'real' job, ranting about things they only understand from an outsider's POV?  It's just an attempt at getting eyes on their content.  It doesn't mean anything and should have no bearing on anyone's opinions on anything.
---
Also combining camps with teammates would be awesome, you could really build a settlement then 
---
Have your expectations low and you’ll have a great time. The press is bad yes but the media always talks about the negatives. Get the game and discover the positives for yourself.
---
Because the mods don't care about that. The megathread is literally only for people saying they were banned.
---
I was just hacking at him with my black diamond so that makes sense 
---
WK = Waffle King?
---
Well shit. Some mods just want to watch the world burn, I guess.
---
OK! I didn't know this LOL
---
Now, as the defender, you just have to build an impregnable, fortified bunker and hide in it until the raider goes away.
---
And then you have posts like this which is free advertising for them.... Wonder if OP got paid to post.
---
I like how instead of replying they downvoted you. Y'know, because you're right and that isn't okay with them.
---
Speed Demon also broken. 
---
Sounds like something is glitched a bit then. Hopefully we'll get a hotfix. 
---
Thank you.
---
This could be easily be taken advantage of by people. Do destructive shit and turn on pacifist to be protected. Separate servers are the best choice. Everyone gets what they want 
---
That's pretty much just a tesla rifle. The anti armor effect only decreases ballistic resistance but you're hitting them with energy damage.
---
i dont share my own camps anymore, but i do appreciate quality craftsmanship and job well done.   keep up the great work!  ive been toying around with a similar idea, but requiring someone to swim their way inside the camp.  hope that gives u some more inspiration!
---
&gt; Certainly a few lines of code are more efficient than creation and maintenance of separate Servers?
---
What do you think seperate servers are? They're literally just a few lines of code to add a different queue onto their already scalable server cluster. The only thing that the other server has is a changed rule set and that doesn't require maintenance or anything special other than thinking long and hard about how to set up that server to please the most of your userbase. Like literally the other "servers" are probably just two separate .ini files or something of that nature.
---
Nowhere is there any proof 900 hour guy exploited or duped. You are just making that assumption under the idea that bethesda is correct and didn't make a mistake in the way they counted his ammo.
---
The problem with that is, you can easily do a couple quick tests yourself to verify that they indeed to have a pretty bad bug with the way they count items you have acquired. Create a new character and collect some wood outside of the vault, take that wood and place it in a suitcase and close the suitcases interface and check your achievements under "collect 76 wood" you will see the number of wood you just collected and put in the suitcase. Now open up that suitcase and take the wood out and check that same achievement again. That wood gets counted twice toward that achievement. Which is exactly what happened to this guy with the ammo. He said he never had more than 36k ammo at anytime but he did mule it back and forth between his main, his mule and his other characters. So with how they count items multiple times depending on how many times you pick them up and put them down that 36k ammo could get multiplied dozens of times and end up showing insane numbers on bethesdas end while he never actually had anywhere near that number.
---
I do that too. I have signs posted like "we're all in this together!"
---
Some crops growing, two water purifiers, a couple beds, and I leave bags out front. Set up bridging the river just north of Morgantown high school

No shit I didn't watch it... I asked the question so someone that did would answer it
---
You're a regular fucking Sherlock Holmes
---
I don't believe so, they are in a different category with the Queen. But I could be wrong. 
---
&gt;Everyone had a set of leveled ultracite armor in the first place. Some people were accidentally destroying it because it wasn't super apparent what had happened. The plans were not a major reward from the queen, because everyone already had the armor.
---
Isn't X01 better overall better? I've just gotten into the whole PA thing when I got excavator. Nowadays on trading sub I see people seem to into T-51b, as it's best on ballistic and they can afford it, and it's easier to fully mod it too because of vendor plan changes.
---
&gt;Ultracite mods were the real prize of her ultracite plans, and still are. 
---
Yeah true I guess. But I didn't see a lot of people actually buying them. Sure selling as in listing them many, as well as prime receivers, but I didn't see a lot of actual buyers. From the few times I've done queen I've unlocked some ultracite armor parts, not all yet, but at least I had personally no intrest to craft any. Sure not using PA outside of nuke zone is contributing that, but if I've had a sense about crafting one and then selling it would be likely profitable, I would have done it.
---
The ultracite mods seemed better reward but still most of them were quite useless. Same thing with primes, seem like most people already have most of them.
---
&gt;Can't get those anywhere but scorch beasts. Unfortunately, ultracite armor isn't all that special. It's good because it's one of the free armors you can get.
---
What do you mean free? I don't have done the Brotherhood quests yet, do you really get a free whole armor from it? Or just the plans like patch notes say, and then you have to craft it like excavator?
---
&gt;3 star legendaries are a real prize. She should be dropping them reliably, and at max level. Instituting a level 5 legendary to compensate for something that is broken means whatever plans exist for 4-5 star legendaries will be rushed and undermined.
---
I agree, it sould be guaranteed 3 star, I mean the loot. Way too many times I kill fairly badass 3 star super mutant and then get some 1 star. You can farm so easily a lot of one stars in WS golf club that I don't like seeing them on 3 star enemies. Normal 3 stars should be 2-3 stars and SBQ is good candidate to be only 3 star. I think the Queen always is, but I'm talking about the loot of course.
---
So you have no proof of that exact number.
---
Keep lying, cuck.
---
I've nuked the dry lake bed in the toxic valley. Not much for flux but a fair amount of legendaries. The corporate housing was stuffed with glowing ones. I'd do it again. 
---
Nuked the grafton steel mill, tons of enemies, few legendaries. I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Best part about nuking Monogah is taking the workshop and powering up the station, IMO. All my experiences have been "meh" in the town itself. I intend to nuke Thunder Mountain at some point. 
---
Nuked Lewisberg, best part was clearing the mines. More legendaries down there then topside. I plan on nuking more of the Ashlands.  
---
Had a good experience in a nuked Harpers Ferry. Definitely going to drop one there myself. 
---
Hit the Top of the World. Wasn't very exciting. 
---
I'd like to nuke Charleston. Also the Nuka Cola plant. 
---
The first TSE I got in the game was a Gauss, 3\* with RW, but they were bugged early on, and would not hit anything at close range (Went straight through enemy with no damage).
---
I traded it for a TS Combat SG that has such terrible accuracy I later sold that for 1000 caps.
---
Wouldn't mind having that Gauss back now.
---
Then popping one of your tires when you go in for an oil change, and 2 weeks later fixing the tire they popped and people here were making posts thanking them for fixing your tire that was working until they popped it. 
---
They got you Frosty?! I gave you the TS plasma the other day. Sorry to hear man, see you on the market. 👍
---
Whitesprings sure. SBQ, no. There is a huge difference. 
---
weird some plans arent listed, like hatchet, Machete; unless we start the game knowing those.
---
and when that was met with very poor response from the player base BGS responded by saying more or less "its not set in stone, we are still working on ironing out details, and player input is invaluable"
---
I think the initials U.S.A.F. are already taken - though, they don't seem to be all that active in this post-apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Another idea would be craftable protest signs that you can mod with "Free stuff 4 U" "Oops I F'ed up" "LFG (sadface)". 
---
Reminds me of the old bugs bunny cartoons. Might be easier to code and there's potential for an atom store cashgrab.

Release the Kraken!!!
---
I do a shitty impression of Bane. 
---
This would be useful feedback if you explained what you meant by it. As it stands, it just reeks of smug, elitist bullshit, the reason so many people are wary of online, multiplayer games.  
---
However, I'll guess you've just been subjected to a lot of whining and are sick of hearing it/jaded with other players, and, judging by your post history, you're pretty mad that Bugthesda fucked your own build up for you, which is extremely valid-- just don't take it out on me.  
---
Do you have any *real* suggestions for me that aren't just 'get better at the game lol'?  I made it all the way to level 53 completely solo, so obviously I've been doing *something* right, i just need a little extra guidance.  I'm not asking for handouts; I'm genuinely asking for advice.
---
Got an instigating, 50% limb damage Mole Miner Gauntlet there about a week ago and it has been my primary weapon since then. Can 1-shot almost anything. 
---
There is info for the Fo76 Trading Discord around here somewhere.  Might be a good place to check out.
---
It’s happened on a couple of servers over a couple of days 
---
Pacifist mode only effects my actions, not the actions others have against me. 
---
I get that attacking other people's bases is a part of the game, but what did this guy get out of this experience? Nothing but a quick laugh, where's the value in that when the negative and positive cancel each other out?
---
You say PvP is to help make players competitive, and your not wrong, but what's competitive about being a complete dick to someone a lower level than you and with less resources overall?
---
I still stand by my point, that if given such an opt out the players who choose to do so wouldn't engage in PvP in the first place. You wouldn't really lose that part of the playerbase. 
---
I would say that this is a legitimate problem, that does exist, I may be one of the  but I'm sure it does exist, trolls and assholes are in every game. 
---
I would feel entirely different about this whole situation if I personally did something to provoke another player to attack my base, but as it is I was just another asshole minding my own business and some jackass who thought it'd be funny came through and destroyed my base. 
---
You're acting like I'm calling for the end of PvP and I'm not, again I'm just asking for a way for me to play this damn game in peace and not have to worry about xxPussyslayer69xx (obviously an exaggeration) destroying my shit.
---
Again if people get the resources and perks to be able to engage in PvP in better way, why should I not be able to have the option to not engage in PvP at all, even if it's being forced on my by another player. Pacifist is a half step, not a solution.
---
Yeah cause everyone not wanting PvP is weak or something. It has nothing to do with the Fallout series never being about PvP. Who is the true immersion breaker. I do agree with separate servers which is what they should have done at launch
---
But that is just it, you can easily go test the things out and see that bethesda does have a MAJOR bug with the way they keep track of items you acquire. Easiest way anyone can go test this is create a new character and leave the vault, go collect 10 wood from right outside the vault and then look through your achievements for the "collect 76 wood" it will show 10 wood collected. Now take that wood and put it in one of the suitcases laying around by the vault and close that inventory. After that open the inventory back up and take the wood out and look at that achievement again, it will have increased again to 20, because they don't flag items you've already had in your inventory. Which is why this guys 36k ammo that he muled around a bunch ended up looking like over 300k to bethesda, because each time you swap it and pick it back up in their tally it gets added even if it was already counted before.
---
They also seem to ignore armor, because on my main in my Ultracite PA set which I use for the queen they fucking melt me whereas the qeen hits like a wet noodle without any defensive perks whatsoever.
---
I doubt they will care about pvp servers as long as they can still grief in normal ones.  
---
Is that the implication you think your post conveys?  With those writing skills, you must have a very successful professional career. 
---
Can a mod pin this? This is wonderful. Thanks for making it. 
---
Well you wake up in this cart....
---
Dude, he’s just giving his opinion, no one is forcing you to read it.
---
I would say that this is a legitimate problem, that does exist, It may currently be a rare occurrence but as more and more people reach end game and get bored these kind of problems will crop up more, trolls and assholes are in every game. 
---
Of course, they have already passed judgement on the 900 hour guy. So when glaring evidence to his innocence is brought forth they want to ignore it and make it go away. 
---
They don't actually care about the truth, they only care about what they FEEL is the truth regardless of what is right and wrong.
---
They're not going to change anything
---
when she lands are you getting VATS torso shots or just aiming for her belly?
---
For a guy off work stuck at home with a disability? This is hardly the height of people doing something faster than people think is plausible.  
---
Not to mention it isn't accounting for any time before the 30 days. It just says over the course of 30 days he has had these numbers.  
---
And the game recounts anything you pick up everytime you pick it up. Which makes their whole method deeply flawed and laughable in the first place.
---
I'll send a request when I'm on tonight. I'm on a regular schedule of evening play. Everyone I've friended are hardly ever on since they've moved onto other games.
---
😈 Sell them 😈
---
You can't if you are wrongfully banned, like he was.
---
I'm sorry what? Why is any of this relevant?
---
I've had this issue for a couple patches now. Annoying but not the worst to deal with
---
My wife and I play together as well.  You team up in the main menu.  Then the team leader joins a game and all team members get loaded in with them.  Alternatively, if your significant other is already in the game, just join them via social, then team up there.
---
Feel like you need to to nut up and learn the hard way 😂
---
It will just be another let down so why does it matter?
---
Its my own fault, I try to hard to actually discuss these issues, and most people don't do the same.
---
It will just be another let down so why does it matter
---
Because I am on a discord where thousands of people trade and some of them are known dupers that means I am sticking up for the guy because I side with dupers?  Where did I say that?  I think you are projecting..  Your said previously in your response that you had known dupers on your friends list.  So does that mean they missed banning you, because you obviously are a duper, because I say so based you know, it's clear because I say so. /S
---
Helped a dude once cause one of them had a bounty and I was feeling like an asshole and they were 50 levels below me. I shot the one and he died instantly. His friend came around the corner saw my level and he walked over to his buddy’s corpse and I just stood there and then walked off slowly. His friend respawned and shot at me again and I shot and killed him again. At this point his friend took some pot shots at me and missed as I just walked off. 
---
X01 is better I believe. I don't have full stats memorized. You have to craft X01, which is the big difference. It's not free. T51 is better in a lot of ways, cheaper to repair, can be scrounged in the wild, etc. Being able to craft it is nearly impossible for legit players, because the plans for pieces are in an awful event loot table. I've gotten 4, and a 5th that I already had. Also a single t60 piece plan.
---
The only high tier players I've seen wearing ultracite we're doing it for cosmetics. Mods are cool, but the armors stats devalue them pretty much entirely. I was excited to find the ultracite welded rebar plan until I remembered I scrapped my set for being useless, and unpaintable.
---
When you finish the brotherhood quest you receive a PA frame with zero weight. When you deploy it, it populates a leveled set of ultracite armor. If you scrap the frame, you don't get the armor. There's a set of raider armor with the same problem from rose.
---
I'm from Northern Virginia and WVA is us what Lake Tahoe and Yosemite are to Californians. Dolly Sods alone is worth the trip. BTW Dolly Sods is a mountain top with a rare alpine environment. All kinds of unusual plants and cold as hell.  
---
Unfortunately, no Yau Guay...
---
I would love to see the camp budget extended as well.
---
Wow it's crazy.
---
Toit
---
&gt; but hopefully the survival servers come out soon and most pvp players will be on there.
---
For a short time, at least.  Until they realize that playing against players who are always ready for PVP and also prepared to fight back all the time isn't as fun as ambushing unsuspecting workshop owners and people who didn't have pacifist on and misfired in a nuke zone.  Then they'll come running back to where they can find the easy targets.
---
Wow good suggestions especially number 1
---
With the special Ashen (+30% damage against Deadites).
---
Carlos? 
---
Exactly. Just two gutsies can kill me if I’m not careful. In fact, it seems most enemies do dumb damage. Even low level enemies hit harder than I think they should. They should release higher level gear. That’d be great. Considering we fight higher level enemies as we progress. 
---
His post was actually removed by the moderators after they instated their megathread.
---
If you're on console I think it's still available on redbox, rent it for a day and try it out. 
---
What about the people that were hunting dupers for a while? It wasa huge thing for a while.... Find a duper kill them, steal there bag dump it in a river..... I'd call that innocent!
---
No. Only a small percentage of players want this. It is a horrible idea. 
---
Indeed we should get a hotfix very soon. Scorched Earth is the main event of this game and as of right now there's no point in even trying to complete it. 
---
Most bugs should be caught in QA via regression testing or by the developer in their own unit testing. There is no reason fixing a bug that causes another bug should make it through in pretty much every patch so far. Upper management would have a melt down at most companies if you continuously caused issues or had down time at a production level on a money making product.
---
Because ultracite ammo is the main currency used in most trading forums as caps max out at 25k and most traders reached that cap long ago.
---
Na, just cap it at one workshop per team, maybe have ownership decay to unowned if they don't go back in a half hour or so.  Same for critter attacks, if they don't respond promptly it goes unowned.
---
Go to nexus mods and grab the text chat. Have to wait for update from recent patch but it's definitely worth it and the community spirit in there is great. Like the best of Reddit, but in game while you play.
---
i will add u
---
I just ADS for the belly. 
---
You have to disable pacifist to deal any damage. 
---
Yeah but I appreciate the new aspects of the patch. If you take a workshop you should be ready to defend it otherwise just gather the resources by hand.
---
I do agree with the nuke zones being no pvp zones tho. Can’t tell you how many times vats Auto targets someone and and then it’s on like Donkey Kong 
---
My theory is that the condition doesn't properly update as you're playing. So you could've had this item for a while and it should be down to half but it's still showing as full. Then you either fast travel or go through a load zone or server hop and it updates to the proper half condition. Just a theory though.
---
I do have an issue where if I have 5 of the same item at different conditions and one spoils, I get one spoiled meat and the rest disappear.
---
Be careful with that. A charge back will get your PSN account banned immediately if you bought it digitally. Try contacting Sony support first, but if they turn down your refund request then that's likely all you can do.
---
sounds like the pvp mode will be easy grief city, attracting the bottom feeders of the game
---
I mean, if you purposely picked up a dupers stuff, even with the intent to get rid of it, your in the wrong 
---
Proceeds to tell people they don't know shit but conveniently leaves out you don't know shit either.
---
From what I have seen, you are correct!  It appears you are able to craft them at a weapons workbench without needing plans as they are listed as defaults.  There is a very helpful article about all of the plans in this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
Mostly because pvp in 76 has almost no balance.  If one party can't  reasonably fight back it's probably going to get called griefing.
---
Yeah but I took like a basic level class in college. I know what I'm doing /s
---
this please!
---
Yeah would save so much time. 
---
No. I disagree... Bethesda knew this was happening and should have considered this before the ban.
---
Hey man... I took a semester of Visual Basic in high school. I'm very hip on the cyber. 
---
Seeing more and more of this lately with players creating alts, and looking to level them up quickly.
---
I have been in 2 queen battles recently with 5 players, all over 100 and killed the SBQ in around 10 minutes each time.
---
Went to a Queen Battle Tuesday Night, with 10+ players, after about 5 minutes of Pounding on the SBQ with hardly any damage at all, I checked the map only to realize my 135, and another 82, were the only players above 40, and most were less than 20, so I bugged out.
---
I seldom nuke Prime, and then only with a team and significant number of High (100+) level players on the server.
---
Agree 
---
Oh I remember that. I was one of the people who pointed it out since I found it rather unfair that the thread where he was defending himself got nixed, but the one that amounted to "ha ha point at that guy and laugh" got to stay up.
---
Separate of anything, I'm not liking how the mods seem to let mean spirited posts stay around so long as it's mean to the "right people".
---
Seriously people?
---
Half the folks on this forum dont think Beth can program an alarm clock to ring.
---
Yet, in this 1 instance; we are supposed to believe they came up with a program that can simultaneously scan all the items inmany thousands of accounts in real time and keep a running total over a month?!?
---
It is far more likely that they spent 30 days programming, testing, and debugging a system which; can take a single static scan of all accounts at a point in time when they were all frozen. (Read the longer than usual maint on the 14th) and then started banning immediately after as they analysed the results. (And that took all weekend).
---
I bet yall dont kill it post-patch without dev magic. 
---
In this specific case, that certainly may be true. However, anyone saying this is a good way to ban people is moronic. There is a huge margin for error with this and its because they lack the basic tools to manage an online community. That's the point, but sure, completely ignore that because you found one guy you're "pretty sure" is cheating.
---
I love eating my downed opponents. Favorite part about this game
---
Just because you read too far into something doesn't mean I'm the asshole. Try again, toots. 
---
Never become a cop. You having any form of power in anything worries me.
---
I'd rather have the legendary crutch removed altogether and the game rebalanced around regular weapons/armor.
---
We shouldn’t call it “disenchant”. 
---
We should call it “take it apart and try to figure it out” in fallout. 
---
On that, we agree.  Yes, you are.
---
Build a castle. Get 1 friend. Pull players to do quests you made with your 1 friend. Invite them to a discord dedicated to quest design and quest giving afrer they complete your quest. 
---
Simple formula for you to make your own guild.
---
Nope it was the only legendary in the place and none outside
---
Stealthing seems to be the consensus, yes, and I'll give it a try after I've leveled up a little more and worked on my perks.
---
Here is a quick look at the T-51 one. [Pale Rider](https://i.imgur.com/q1xwD3t.jpg)
---
Oh look, the fanboi brigade downvotes :)
---
I used to be one of you.  I'm not anymore :)
---
you will get approximately 9-10 hour avarage per day if he played since the beta. (not accurate calculation) so he must be a cheater 
---
People are still reporting that this is occurring, most recently during SBQ events. Maybe it is supposed to be 5hp, but I am not confident that this is a bug free experience.
---
I do not. I will try them and see if it helps.  I've solo'd this far, I know I just need to re-evaluate what I'm doing and do some management on my perks/gear.
---
&gt; Bethesda screwed up in the first place, so in fixing the screw up (which I'm all for) they should ensure to damage faith in them as little as possible. But like most fixes Bethesda has implemented so far, it was done in a way that introduced numerous other problems that now need to be fixed (people banned who shouldn't be).
---
This is a big part of the point. Mistakes happen. The people who make these games are human beings and I understand that. However, when you make a mistake, don't cover it up by making the mistake worse or punishing others for your own incompetence.
---
One thing you can do to minimize the number of leeches, is shift the Nuke North, I like to get Watoga Station in the Blast Zone.
---
Level 20s can't fight that deep in a blast zone, and don't show up to hide in the shed.
---
I got 3 weightless armor and the one was great, it had reduced weapon weight on it too
---
I suppose it's not the most far-fetched conspiracy I've ever heard about. Easy to accomplish, and there would be beneficiaries (i.e. all the other games out there). That said, it's still easier for me to believe that incompetence (i.e. Bethesda) and greed (i.e. dupers and maybe Bethesda) led to an epic calamity.
---
In the end, the only thing I *actually* care about is my experience which has been pretty positive.
---
Hope it's good.
---
You’d start losing the hardcore RPG part of the audience if you try to dumb the game down. 
---
Remember Fallout caters to several distinct groups of players, and should simultaneously balance it for all of them. 
---
That’s why you have weapons you can just pick up and go (like the 50 cal) that need no tinkering, alongside weapons that need extensive tinkering to be just as powerful (handmades, plasma gun or Gatling laser for example). 
---
Yes, your tribe would rather see less mechanics. 
---
Kinda off-topic but I haven't found a solid confirmation/denial on this: if you put the scorched receiver mod on a weapon, does it do more dmg to the queen/Sbeasts or only to the humanoid scorched?
---
Yeah to fail and seek revenge. 
---
Are you interested in joining or not?
---
There are several things, I'd check to see if super mutants are spawning in and around roboco, if they are people are going to check if a 3\* super mutant is spawning in the "CEO" office. I don't know if the event can spawn if anyone has been there recently. I've only seen AWOL come up once in the last month, since everyone on youtube had to create a best legendary farming video, which i attribute to players server hoping.
---
there are a ton of people server hoping farming AWOL for 3 star legendaries. it can be completed in under 4 minutes. so you can easily miss it if you aren't checking the map every 2-3 minutes. I'd like to see more events like AWOL, but with far more of a challenge and half dozen higher level legendary spawns. A better version of Mount Blair that is difficult for level 75+ that lasts long enough for more people to join, and gets harder and more rewarding the more people join.
---
"how you're supposed to".   Is that what you said when Bethesda stopped fixing bugs in FO4?  Just play it how you're supposed to with quests that can't be completed and assets that don't loader properly or work properly because they gave up development? 
---
Answering a subjective statement with your own subjective statement and nothing to back that up isn't really a discussion.  It is a drive by "nuh uh".   Gg.
---
So what with timezones? It resets every 24 hours regardless of where you are. Yeah that reset might be in the middle of the day, or the middle of the night, what does that hurt?
---
As it is with a 20 hour cooldown, you could unknowingly keep resetting the timer and end up going a long time without a reset.
---
It isn't going to work out. Sorry.
---
The suppressor is bigger than a train car ! 
---
&gt;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s\_razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)
---
I'd also support this from the standpoint of encouraging different CAMP locations.  For the sake of making Caps, it is objectively advantageous to camp somewhere that allows easy access to Watoga and Harper's Ferry because they are "one-offs."  It doesn't help if you're in the Forest and nearly every vendor is Responder.
---
I am referring to other people posting their experiences with this problem as recently as yesterday, who did not own a workshop. I was one shotted three times before the stacking bobble head issue was patched, but not since then.
---
This is a bad idea. It’s already insanely easy to max out the 7 (8 if you can find Grahm) vendors, so if all 22 vendors could give 200 caps, would just ridiculously hyperinflate the price of everything as people wouldn’t have to work as hard to get caps.
---
I can buy gold with cash, and cash is a representation of gold... springs and screws are the gold to cash. :)
---
You hold fire to charge it up, fyi. Slower than a sniper but so much more powerful 
---
totally agree this isnt a pvp game is and rpg with PVP elements and thats what i feel a lot of users dont get. Fallout 76 is an RPG period its not called or classified a PVP RPG. You can chose to be an ahole or you can team up to rebuild the wasteland if you choose to be an asshole its not cause its a game mechanic its cause your just and asshole and you CHOOSE to be one period.
---
I have a couple ghoul slayer bats, cant think of the other effects I'll look later tonight and let you know.
---
I haven't used workshops since they were nerfed and play entirely solo. It is pointless to put resources into a workshop just to be kicked from a server as soon as it is set up.
---
Perk swapping isn’t fucking bugged you useless twat. That’s the topic.
---
The ability to swap abilities on the fly is a privelage that is in place INSTEAD of some sort of paid respec. You can adjust your perks to your play style. 
---
Changing your perks to match any situation completely negates the reason to limit the amount of perks we can have equipped at one time.
---
It’s a challenge.
---
Rise to it.
---
Ferals are basically deadites anyway, so yeah. 
---
Yep, regardless of your meme.   You can easily eat up a ton of play time switching perks back and forth without it.  When you have a couple hours to play a couple / few times a week, you don't want to spend 20 minutes throughout the game session dicking around with the perk cards just to be able to hack something, unlock something else, oh now it is time to craft armor, but the cards are different for weapons...on now I need to craft some serums so I want to have super duper loaded, so I have to constantly be moving cards around.   Just being able to switch between melee and firearm based perks is a huge time saver considering how many times you have to switch between ranged and melee weapons to take down the SBQ if you're a melee build.
---
Why are we assuming when they say acquired, they don't mean in one fell swoop? 
---
Ok, cool
---
Spot on! 
---
That being said, here is the extent of my coding knowledge. 
---
t('.'t)
---
Honestly I thought that was only folks in the cap zone when you kick off a capture.  I didn't expect it to be forever in workshop area.
---
I think there is something similar already in place. I’ve often wondered how the game renders workshops that have been “abandoned” by their claimers. When I claim a shop and it already has turrets, resources set, etc., I wonder if the original player is still on the server or if they left the server altogether. Since it says “unowned” on the map, I would think it’s that they left the server. But if that’s the case, when does the game decide to reset the workshop to original condition, with all original loot respawned (including Cap stashes) and original enemies to take down?
---
Not that having any of this knowledge would change anything but inquiring minds want to know. 
---
Honestly, the next nuke I launch is going to hit the DMV just because I have to go to the RL one next month and want to vent my annoyance early.
---
In that case, there may be a bug that is being disregarded because of the belief that one shot slap kills are impossible.  People are still reporting this is occurring, which should not fall on deaf ears at Bethesda.
---
Kinda makes sense that if you fast travel to a location such as a nuke bunker, whitesprings service entrance, a specific mine or a building, it’s more likely than not you want to visit the inside of that building, as opposed to fast travelling to the outside of the building to go somewhere else.
---
Should have the option to either fast travel inside, or fast travel outside though, so both bases are covered because there’s nothing worse than fast travelling to a bunker and having a 90 sec load screen, only to enter another load screen as soon as the first is over.
---
Before the scorched drew their attention to other matters, the combined forces of the Responders and the BoS nearly destroyed the super mutant menace in Appalachia. Nearly. In this three part quest, you're going to finish the job. 
---
*Part One: Then Who Is Phone?*
---
You learn from Rose that something is interfering with her radio signal. The overriding message is from someone called Master. Having just been submerged in FEV himself, he finds himself connect to others like him. Still distressed and confused, he calls out for help through the psychic powers granted to him by the FEV(this isn't an asspull, it's apparently a thing that happens sometimes in fallout cannon). In doing so, he awakens a powerful entity that heeds his call. Rose, annoyed by the interruption to her radio supremacy, sends her most favoritest lackey to go deal with that little problem. She can't figure out where the signal is coming from, somewhere out west, but she figures the response signal is being amplified by a long forgotten listening post in The Mire. Upon arriving at the bunker, you find it overrun with not only your garden variety super mutants, but a strange tumorous growth running throughout the machinery of the bunker, somehow controlling it directly and preventing you from turning off the amplifier via terminals. You realize that the only way to disconnect these strange creatures from the machinery is to burn them out. So, you head to the generator room and flood the fire control water lines with fuel, and leave with a bang. Upon doing so, you find clues among the mutants that lead you to believe that special batches of FEV have survived the initial disposal done by West Tec employees all those years ago, and have pooled in caverns under the mountain. Competing this quest leads us to... 
---
*Part Two: Community Service*
---
You head to the West Tek Research Facility and discover, once again, numerous super mutants, behaving in an unusually organized way. You see that they have utilzed salvaged mining tools to dig a mine down to where the FEV has pooled. Fighting your way through the mine, you reach an underground lake being guarded by a huge super mutant behemoth, one of the original test subjects of the FEV project who escaped and was able to grow unchecked. Upon defeating him, you use samples from the lake to craft a neutralizing agent similar to the one's used to pacify the original vats. But upon doing so, your mind is assaulted with psychic energy, which leads us to...
---
*Part Three: The Toxic Revenger*
---
A pounding headache brings you too your knees, and a voice from seemingly nowhere shouts into your mind "You may have undone my plans, but you will still die for what you have done. You can not hide from me, and you can not run. Once you're dead, I will rebuild". You rise to your feet and realize that whoever that was is coming for you, and you have mere minutes to prepare. With the subterranean lake cleansed, you're given access to a workshop, and have three minutes and limited supplies to build fortifications. You can choose which tunnels to barricade, and place a limited number of traps with the materials provided. When the timer hits zero, waves of super mutants pour into the tunnel, each one harder than the last. The final wave features many powerful mutants, all being led by the great and powerful Doctor Elias. As big as a behemoth, and as smart as a human, Elias has clad himself in nearly impenetrable scrap armor. To defeat him, he must be damaged enough to be brought to his knees, and doses neutralizing agent must be poured into his visor. After being exposed three times, he'll finally fall to the ground defeated, ending the terror of organized mutants in this region forever.
---
Why are you here then?
---
To warn others 
---
Do they also have a joke "Release a build that you can't even open?" I've never seen a game do that before.
---
It sure does if legit players are getting banned or if their system is failing in some capacity. A little something called public relations.
---
I just killed 2 SBs by letting super mutant groups with miniguns do their thing for 5 minutes
---
You also fast travel and, perhaps, server hop more often at higher levels which both seem to accelerate the speed they spoil at.
---
That's how I thought it worked.  Then I got murdered when I joined a defense event on a workshop I didn't contest the cap on earlier.  Still have no clue how long it is before you can safely enter the shop area again.
---
Just need jewel crafting, inscription and frost sabre mounts, and we can have a FO76/WoW crossover.
---
Do the Order of Mysteries quests, and you'll get one!  :D
---
Many people have already maxed out and have reached the limit..... with inflation really be such a bad thing? Everything would cost so much more, thus, making the economy flow even better. Legendaries would cost 12000 to 15000 when they cost about 5,000 now. That means you'd be spending more of your money rather than stockpiling. 
---
Nuke them from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
---
Seriously though they struggle to dodge explosives. They have a purpose again!
---
I’m just glad it not like Anthem. There would be a full load screen every time you go to a crafting bench. 
---
Please add a straw as a melee weapon so we can drink that murderous water in one go
---
Yes I even took off everything but the mining helmet. 
---
I 100% agree. I am guessing that the reason that items drop in a little baggie instead of remaining in live form has to do with limiting the assets so the servers aren’t overwhelmed, but be that as it may, being able to put Cue balls on the billiard table would be a start. Decorations on shelves, Hell, even sheets and pillows on the bed would be friggin awesome. I mean seriously, why doesn’t the ornate bed come with sheets and pillows? What are we, savages? ;)
---
&gt;talk about how modders know more about the game than those who actually created it 
---
To be fair, modders come pretty fucking close... The things that the modding community has done with Bethesda games are just crazy insane.
---
Seriously, if you can code a scrip extender that enables the game to have 10x as functionality over the vanilla game, you're getting to that level where you *might* very well know some shit about the game engine that even the staff at Bethesda doesn't know about.
---
He must love his Reddit points or something because the need to make ALTS for these posts are getting old.
---
did u not read the second terminal in vault 76? did u listen to the overseers logs?  PVP from a lore perspective is explained before even leaving vault 76 and reinforced throughout the game.  your claim isnt logical, this is the first online fallout, of course the series wasnt PVP focused before, it also wasnt co-op focused before because IT WASNT ONLINE!  tell me this have u ever played a fallout game without a human enemy?  is there a fallout game where every enemy is a ghoul or a supermutant?
---
Same. Moonshiner's shack and lumber mill with butchers bounty, chemsit, and rank 3 super duper can get me 30-40 stimpacks in 15 minutes.
---
I really wish they would minimize the size of campus though. It doesn't let you build too close to someone else's camp and gives you an insanely big build area. A literally greedy area
---
I mean... I could literally repost the entire thing I wrote. I laid it out pretty clearly. If you want a TL;DR: because that wouldn't catch most of the dupers who are actually causing problems, because those dupers don't stockpile things, they sell things. 
---
You don't need to keep 100k+ of any one item if you can duplicate it easily, especially if it makes it easy for Bethesda to find you and ban you.
---
Beats nothing, still thing starting off with both pve &amp; hardcore survival servers would have been better though.
---
Have you ever tried the creation kit ? It's very easy to create a new id rather than replace and existing one, as per the mothman headlamp stuff-up. 
---
The "coding" isn't some jarecote rocket science, the programs they use lay it all out for you simples. It's just incompetence from the devs, and ever worse not having a test server.
---
Agree. My camp is 99% full and I can't even add items purchased at Atom Shop because they will not fit. If Bethesda wants the Atom Shop to make sense, with all that items, the CAMP budget increase is a must. We should talk more about this because for me, the limited size is breaking my experience. P.S: I love to construct in Fallout
---
and your source for that is?
---
I just shake my head when I see how many people who code for a hobby think they can make pronouncements about how easy it is to do this or that.  When you are coding for your paycheck for a project that generates tens of millions of dollars or more in sales things are at a whole different level with a lot of factors influencing what you can do and when you can do it.  It is never as simple as it appears.  It should be, but it is not.
---
Everything costing more wouldn’t help the max cap limit at all. We need better money sinks in the game between players and server, not between players themselves because no money is leaving the game, and 5k would be added every day per character per account, so a guy with a few alts could easily max caps in a good day of playing.
---
I’ve found 3 by the white springs golf course. It is also where I have my camp. It’s place a tad above the spot on the map where the road says 83A on the map
---
I've had this issue with my sneak attack build since launch.
---
today i dumped in x1000 5.56, over 400 .45s, and around 200 2mms from a gauss. The dps on our end was poor, but the will to take it down was high, and  we took it down at the last minute.
---
My loot was a 1* vampiric deathclaw gaunlet...
---
Feelsbadman. All that effort could have been spared by a legendary ghoul and 1 bullet at whitesprings...
---
Something happened to me yesterday at a workshop and I can't tell if it's related to this or to the adrenal reaction hunger/thirst damage scaling.
---
I owned a workshop and was standing around with my team after a defense event. Another player (over 100, but not in power armour and using a deathclaw gauntlet) approached and started attacking a teammate but as far as I could see was not contesting the workshop. He was doing way too much damage to my PA wearing teammate for it to be slap (like, 1/4 of hp bar per hit) unless he was exploiting the adrenal reaction/hunger/thirst thing, but he wasn't appearing red to anyone on my team. My teammate who was under attack never hit him back but just stood there stimpacking while we tried to figure out what was going on. After a while, a 3rd teammate tried to attack him he was only doing slap.
---
Any idea if this might have been related to the whole workshop being a PvP area now?
---
The "coding" isn't some hardcore rocket science, the programs they use lay it all out for you simples. It's just incompetence from the devs, and ever worse not having a test server.
---
 So the three Scorchbeasts I killed today, two ran and hid, I killed with 1/3 to 1/10 damage must be just a magic thing only I can do.
---
 I hunt the fuckers. Its my game and I never use VATS. I kill a lot of em'. ;)
---
 The first one today was at Camp Venture I killed 90% of the level 65 one there. There was a guy in PA, level 48 I think and i dunno. I kinda called it by shooting at it but he either was busy or hid, I dunno. He finally joined in the fun and I was stunned how little damage a 50 cal machine gun does. ;)
---
Nice! Karma from me! I also love how people react in craziest ways. Instead of acknowledging the good work, there's a bunch of people counting... 
---
Fine! I’ll make my own Army! With blackjack and hookers! You know what?! Forget the blackjack!!!
---
They should gate the SBQ but probably too late to add such a change to the game.
---
I would like it if our CAMP size acted like our stash size. Seeing the total size allowed and the value of each item.
---
Currently we don't know how much of our CAMP budget each item uses so having values assigned and visible did make this easier.
---
I do, however, know how decimals work! Remember when the power plants made 0.8 cores per hour for a couple weeks?
---
My understanding is that unclaimed or taken over (by critter) shops slowly take damage until camp stuff is cleared out.
---
Hmm it looks so familiar.
---
Seems Nostradamus didn't see that one coming!
---
Raw meat and veggies spoil really fast and always have. If you sort your aid tab by spoil, raw food will always be at the bottom. Even below cooked things with just a little sliver left.
---
Hope so.
---
Well... we already know that there is a limited log of actions that the servers keep. This has been shown with previous ban actions, particularly against griefers deliberately crashing servers. It's not like they'd have to have something running in the background constantly evaluating every single action, more like running an SQL query against their logging database checking for specific actions.
---
That's true. But regardless of that, it still seems pretty obvious that you are indeed an asshole. 
---
This is much better. Before you were just a sitting duck,now you can hide and ambush and it's an even field.
---
No more stimpaks? Bug or deliberate? I did the major for a day quest for the stimpaks.
---
Should add as well, as soon as I shot, he must have been spamming Stimpaks really fast
---
If they were to buy a second system wouldn’t one of them have to start from scratch? I want to do this with my bf but I feel like having to start over will be pretty trying and I’ll lose interest In the game. Although I’m pretty low level so now would be the best time to do it. 
---
Aaah Helvetia , it was such a nice place before the war.
---
 I hip shoot Scorchbeasts out of the sky with a Level Action. No VATS needed.
---
No light metal arms in sight...
---
Really both systems end up offering the same thing.  If you login between 5 and 9 every day both systems will have been reset and ready for your use.
---
A static reset gives the peope that have that reset time during their play period a slight advantage because they can do their stuff, wait for reset and do it again, essentially stacking 2 days in one.
---
Im not saying one way is better than the other, both work well and different games use both. Clash of Clans uses a 20 hr cooldown, Runescape uses a global reset.
---
Bitch at the Devs if you want it changed, im just trying to inform you of how the option THEY chose works. Your more than welcome to develop your own game the way you like and make it any way you want.
---
Pretty keen on defending Bethesda, aren't ya?
---
I suppose there may be an anecdotal link between people who dupe and people who grief.  I wouldn't surprise me at all if many of them were one in the same.
---
 Yeah I would be pleased but I do understand its not really aimed at me. ;)
---
Can anyone help me out. I have been wondering where to get the Plans for the Disco Ball (Mirror Ball maybe?) and the Plans to craft a Shishkebob sword. I thought Grahm had them but I finally found him last night and he didn't. 
---
LOL you should see the new one. Literally LOL
---
This would totally work with my RP for my current playthrough. I'm playing an unarmed specialist who has the carnivore mutation and took points in cannibal. And for whatever reason, I've gotten parasites multiple times in this playthrough. So my head canon is my character has begun the process of mutating into a wendigo, like the leader of the Gourmands did. I intentionally never cure parasites (I'll cure other diseases, just not that one) because it helps keep me prowling the woods for people to eat.  
---
This mutation would fit right in with this character. :)
---
Bethesda is telling those affected to submit a ticket.  Is anyone getting any response from them?  I’m seeing folks who say it has been 5 days with no word. 
---
Don't forget that generally modders on the scene are single people or small groups not Entire Companies working on their projects, plus not every dev program is put out available to the modders so they have less to work with. 
---
Put them on equal ground, and you'd be very impressed. 
---
Plus I feel like you don't have an extensive knowledge of community mods out there for Bethesda games.
---
They’ve been trying for almost 4 months to patch this game. It may take awhile.  
---
You have to refresh Grahm still by reloading into the world multiple times until the  mirror ball plan shows up. He is the only one who has it.
---
The fact that they haven't changed deployments of patches even when people raised concerns.  Only made changes after.  
---
Where are the plans for the awning?
---
Every day I do my vendor run to all 7 vendors just to get net about 150 caps or so taking into account fast traveling. I really don’t mind it as it is kind of fun but having each have their own 200 would be awesome. 
---
I think I would also love the ability to sell known plans to vendors. I think I’d rather have that than ammo. 
---
So the damage that I see when I view the weapon is the damage done when I don’t charge up the weapon
---
Lol ***wow*** easy there tiger might slip up and cut yourself on all that edge
---
Too true. Being skilled at building a following and being skilled at creating content do not always go hand-in-hand. 
---
Can you explain how to do this process without having to find him every single time?
---
Expect my upcoming thread: "Obvious Signs Of Bethesda Ball-Washing From r/FO76 Users"
---
I think I just added you, but I’m not sure... I’m getting no ps message replies 
---
You can buy it at Harper's ferry now... it's the "powered gates" plan for 240 caps
---
I don't believe revisiting and buying from the vendor changes anything. I've bought from a vendor, and resold to them an hour before the time was up and revisiting them an hour later showed them with 200 caps. 
---
Oh are there other mods that work in multi? 
---
They've been fairly cagey about what level of quality of life mods are acceptable, but I've been using Reshade for over a month now. Couldn't live without it. The horrid overlay they have on everything in the base game gives me migraines.
---
&gt; You horrible despicable person you. 
---
You need to get over yourself man. The irony is being that high level means your hunting rifle would probably two shot him.   
---
SMH people don't make whole posts when the lose to raiders in Fo4, why would 76 be different.
---
There are a bunch of gnomes out in the garden at the General's Steak House as well.
---
1.) you have to not be expecting it
---
2.) Mothman will find you
---
3.) Search dresser for clean underwear
---
I always seem to find them in the savage divide along the cliffs, but I think they can strike anywhere at anytime.
---
Thanks. Do any vendors sell BoS combat armor mods or plans? Cuz I can't find them anywhere.
---
&gt; After patch my bloodied build does literally 33% less damage than pre-patch.
---
33% ok, do you mind telling us the raw damage number? Because if that's still 1000, the nerf is deserved. 
---
[Okay](https://i.imgur.com/X87ww3a.jpg)
---
Yup the few people who spend most of their lives together in a vault and were the best and brightest and started families want to suddenly bathe in each other’s blood the moment they step outside. Makes total sense. You do you
---
I've done it twice since the patch. each time \~10 people showed up, and it was obvious that me and the other Sneak/Crit/VATS rifle player were the only two doing any significant damage. one melee guy did some decent damage when she landed if he could break out of the mob pile. everyone else in PA pretty much did zero damage and were constantly overwhelmed by the crap she spawns.
---
Is there a scheduled time for this? Is on the Twitch? Where could I find more info? Who Censored Roger Rabbit?
---
What’s troubleshooters do?
---
I Break down my base almost once a week cause. I find a new area I like better all the time. I finally found my permanent spot though. I now want to make it perfect by setting up everything I have. I Love base building toooo hahaha. And yes this is a confession of sorts cause base building is half the game for me
---
No. There are three "levels" of legendary effect. Prefix, Major, and Minor. 1 star only have Prefix. 2 star have Prefix and Major. 3 Star have Prefix, Major, and minor. You can see the list of which things fall into which category [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects).
---
I'm pretty keen on idiots realizing that a handful of hp in a game where you can spam the shit out of stimpaks is NOT PAY TO WIN.
---
You mother fuckers are running your mouths as if Bethesda is selling the best guns in the game with permanent damage bonuses instead of fucking trenchcoats and tights that gave people FIFTEEN FUCKING HEALTH FOR A WEEK.
---
He was probably using a stealth boy and some people have armor that automatically uses a stimpack at like 20%hp. At least you learned your lesson, some people have really good gear and builds so just be selective with your pvp I guess 
---
Awww...did mommy not pay enough attention to you as a child?

Don't fast travel walk around and you will find him

“Florida man burns down town over Tuba.”  Florida man strikes again.

Anyone caught exploiting has been suspended until Bethesda has patched said exploit. I love it.

I've wondered that myself.
---
I'll get some pictures, because typing it would take too long/be confusing.

I have the excavator armor, the level 25 version. I should probably make a new one, or start using my Ultracite armor.  It is level 50.

I know my gear is crap.  I have the plans to make the handmade rifle.  I actually made one, but need to scrap and remake a level 50 version.  Would that help me?  Would perfect storm help me?  
---
If I need to respec, I'm fine with that. I figure I do anyway, because I dumped too much into INT.  Suggestions there are okay too.
---
My build is built around vats lol so I wouldn't be very happy if it got removed 
---
Ha I'm good, not selling stuff at the moment. I need to transfer caps and shit to a mule, but I'm waiting on a replacement power brick so I'm just treading water at the moment anyway
---
No, but I play on PC and we seem to have far fewer griefers than XBox.
---
Thanks for this, OP!
---
Is anyone else having problems with certain plans not showing a (Known) tag? For example, I am positive that I have learned the Mentats recipe and the plan “Water Purifier - Small” but the vendors don’t display the tag.
---
The awning is actually a part of this shack he builds into
---
Better than spending it at the bar.  60 dollar investment for 900 hours of entertainment sounds cheap. 
---
It's not just enemies, player health seems to fully refill when they complete quests. It's strange, but I kinda like it, should save on stimpack usage
---
The map itself isn't a direct map anyways. It's designed like a tourists map. The proportions are off as it is. Does not bother me. It's simply their artistic direction.

Doesn't Grahm share his cap pool with the Wandering Responder Vendor Bot and Watoga Station Vendor Bot?
---
I don’t know what that means this is the first time I’ve posted on reddit so I don’t get the jargon 
---
Not sure I completely agree. I REALLY like the fact that we can fast travel OUT of interior cels like Enclave bunker or West Tek, and feel like if they made the ability to fast travel in that the tradeoff would be removing the ability to fast travel out. 
---
I think it’s part of the building at whitesprings he built inside of, some structures let you incorporate them into your camp
---
I just wish they would bump the cap to 400-600 and have it add 20/hour until cap.  Would help the occasional player and frequent player both.
---
The prices on the serum are incorrect.
---
No idea. Only found him once when I was super low level, and didn’t bother to visit any other vendors that day.
---
Pretty sure he was independent though.
---
Or how about someone with a bloodied TSE weapon standing on the roof of Drop Site 9 and killing the SBQ in 30 seconds while a bunch of other players miss out cuz the fast-travel site is too far away to get any tags.
---
And a horse that can stand on vertical surfaces. 
---
Oh, wait, we have power armor. 
---
I guess without BGS saying exactly how they did it, no one can say for certain 
---
&gt;And the game recounts anything you pick up everytime you pick it up. Which makes their whole method deeply flawed and laughable in the first place.
---
Ooh, I see. We're just speculating.
---
If you consider each flux to be worth 50 caps, it is very easy to make 250k ammo in a month
---
If you like farming.
---
There is a thread about price per dps of ultracite ammo, flux is listed at 30-50 each.
---
Banning someone that owns 5 unyielding sentinel ap refresh marine right arm is legit, but 250k ultra ammo is not a valid reason at all.
---
wow u could have just admitted u didnt read the terminal or listen to the logs.  you do you

I see a lot of complaints about food and water to begin with so idk how good that would be.

---
Right! Because those canvas bags were amazing, because they never shared any customer private information, and they’ve fixed every bug and known issue in the game in a timely manner.  They’ve never had to do hot fixes because they’re updates broke things so badly.  Bethesda isn’t capable of getting things wrong
---
Been called worse... Will be called worse. No skin off my ass. 
---
Depending on how and when you cooked your food, it could appear that way. Here's what I've noticed:
---
The condition bar is the stack average. From my unscientific observations, it seems to be based on the number of condition levels in the stack as opposed to each item individually. So lets say there are 10 levels of condition possible on food, and you have 5 radstag steaks total and four are a level 1 condition and the other one is level 9 condition, it seems to show a level 5 condition for the whole stack (which is the average of each 'group' of conditions, (1+9)/2) as opposed to showing a condition of 3 which would be close to the average of each item combined ((1+1+1+1+9)/5). It does seem to consume them in the correct order, but as a result of this grouping, it will show 5 condition until you eat that one, then the whole stack will jump up to 9.  I always sort by spoil and eat from the bottom and I've had things spoil that were further up on the list sooner than things at the bottom because it sorts by stack average instead of lowest spoiling item in the stack. So, in effect, your condition bar isn't even close to being accurate unless all the food in the stack was cooked at the exact same time.
---
So, you could have just some bad stacks right now so it appears to be spoiling faster than you think it should.
---
I’ve got a feeling they’re gonna raise weapon and armour level limit eventually, they didn’t think people were gonna level up that fast 
---
That is absolutely not true. If it were, we wouldn’t have survived tens of thousands of years living hunt to hunt, we wouldn’t have developed agrarian societies that require cooperation and sacrifice to grow and prosper, we wouldn’t have become the dominant species of the world today if all we did when things got rough was get selfish and kill each other.
---
Think about it: our species wasn’t the strongest, or the toughest, or the fastest. We can’t fly, we don’t have claws or giant fangs, we don’t have venom sacs. We survived and eventually thrived because we cooperated. We created societies where some would work to feed the village, while others would work to teach the village, while others would work to keep peace and protect the village, while others would be able to work to create and to invent and to entertain. At one point before that even, humanity was reduced to a population of only a few thousand, which was essentially genetic doom as that small of a pool makes you incredibly susceptible to diseases and genetic problems. What did we do? We merged our group with another group, the Neanderthals (and other smaller groups (like the Denisovans) at various points), to become a larger, more successful community, thereby saving ourselves and our species. There’s no reason to believe that if the species were under threat of extinction again, that the same kinds of cooperation wouldn’t be the norm.
---
They lied when they said they removed all the duplicated items from the game. Had they done that these recent banning wouldn’t be necessary. 
---
Your name looks familiar.   was this by any chance last night around 3am EST or so?.   I noticed anytime anyone got near him he was one shotting people and was also just fast traveling around the map taking everyone's workshops.   I didn't engage him cause there was some fuckery going on with him for sure.
---
I wanna say it's shared, but I've long since lost the source of that info, so I'm unsure.
---
Hey add me. We wrote on Xbox. Categoricshoe47 
---
im with u on the skepticism, but i was hoping they had fully addressed the issue with concrete statement.  was hoping a recent inside the vault would fully clarify this issue or something.  cuz as of now, ur correct that we should be able to bring current characters into survival mode until they say otherwise.
---
Tale a chill pill mate check the bloodpressure too. hahaha jesus
---
I definitely agree. Should be half the size of what they are.
---
I don't think anyone expected to hear about Level 100s just from the BETA. Some of the players totally defied expectations.
---
I don't think you understand economics very much at all. did you know in real life you can take everything you own to a pawn shop or sell everything you own on eBay? There is no limit to how much the vendors on eBay have. The vendors on eBay are people across the world. Unlimited vendor resources. Inflation is not a big problem in the world right now. It's relatively stable. Are you filthy rich? No, why not? We have vendors in real life that have unlimited resources, so why aren't you filthy rich? 
---
This may seem like a comical argument, but it's meant to display a truthful point to you. the people that will use the vendors in such a way are not going to be the people that are well-off or near the cap limit. That wouldn't even make sense. the people that will use the vendors are those that actually need the money, like low-level players who can't seem to get enough. It's similar to people who bring stuff to the pawn shop. You never sleep wealthy people going to the pawn shop pawning off all their goods like they aren't going to make it until tomorrow. so to that effect, if all of the vendors in the world had their own cap amount, the effect would be very minimal. In Fallout 4, there were so many vendors. I never went and cleared all of them out. Why would I want even more money when I haven't spent the amount of money that I have now? your argument just doesn't make sense. You're saying there's going to be heavy inflation. Simply not true. People who already have a ton of money aren't going to go and fight to get more....
---
Good pitch but all I read is "agree with me or else you will be hurting the game".
---
I have had several playthroughs in survival FO4 without legendary effects that were a blast, and this is coming from someone that made his own flavour of 2LM and added it to the levelled lists only to end up ditching it.
---
It doesn't enrich or add depth to the game.
---
Did your friend submit a ticket too?
---
She's really hard to kill unless you have multiple people running bloodied TSE builds...
---
My camp is in the south part of the savage divide, I've had him show up a couple times when I logged in there.  Sitting up on the cliff, ignoring my turrets completely.  Just off the road by the American flag east of Huntersville.
---
Maybe they have updated it to be a 20 hr set with no refresh/reset, I did my testing a month and a half to two months ago. And at that time the faction vendors I visited after doing my loop(farming shocks/plans), reset later than the other 6 factions consistently over 8 different days if I bought or sold anything from them after doing my daily vendor loop. Tested with Responder vendors in the Ash heap, Enclave Vendor at Whitesprings bunker, and BOS vendor in Watoga Super Duper mart.
---
100% certainty? No, not at all. Given how much interest has been drawn to this I think we may get some more clarification from Bethesda on how they calculated this... eventually.
---
It's because he's got a plate of pasghetti

White knight. Duper killer. Ant greifer. Daisy cutter. Exploiter Killer. 
---
Sure. Easiest way to do so is to have another person in that same world and keep leaving the game and rejoining on their game. So you need to invite friends to play or invite people from Reddit to join you by posting in the marketplace or bazaar.
---
You can join a team and do it one of two ways:
---
Way one (if on XBOX, not sure about other platforms): force quit by using the XBOX menu button and clicking start on the game shortcut and selecting quit. Then restart the game and the "play" button should be replaced with "play with team" to allow you rejoin the world in the same area. Make sure at least one teammate is staying in the world when another leaves or else you'll both lose him. You can take turns.
---
Way two (platform may not matter, but this is XBOX): join a team or make sure the people you are with (with Grahm) don't leave the world as above. When you want to refresh him, hit start, then look at the social tab with right bumper, then go to either recent or team and "view profile" which brings up their XBOX profile. If their activity is public you can click "join game" from the XBOX profile and it will reload the world. This skips the whole force quitting/re-entering through the menu.
---
Doesn't help when they make choices that add constraints and hardships.  For example ME3MP using simple ini files for rapid weekly balance changes, while this one they are non trivial.
---
This is the best thing I've read on this subreddit in weeks. 
---
Best line on it:  feature, not a bug
---
Brother. My army boy is serving time with his head held high
---
This is how it usually goes in the large corporation where I work for the core system:
---
The bug has to be discovered.
---
The severity of the bug has to be determined.
---
An estimate has to be made of what resources will needed to fix it.
---
The priority of fixing the bug has to be determined.
---
Management assigns resources (coders and others) to deal with it.
---
The cause of the bug has to be found.
---
The change that fixes the bug has to be noted.
---
The change has to be reviewed by at least one other team member.
---
The change has to be approved.
---
A decision is made when to deploy to test.
---
The fix is deployed in the test environment.
---
The fix is tested and hopefully passes.
---
If it does pass the fix gets prioritized for deployment to live.
---
The fix is deployed to live.
---
Yeah the fix may be very simple and some of the steps can be dome quickly, for one bug, but there may be dozens of fixes being addressed at the same time and there is a lot of overhead involved, and staffing or equipment issues can make it worse.
---
It should be simple, but most often it is not.
---
Take your time with the first one, it is well worth spending time on :)
---
It would allow me to max my caps in a few days and I could stop worrying about focusing on hoarding caps and actually spend more time exploring and playing the game. Since caps are so hard to come by, I find myself spending all my time in pursuit of gathering items to sell and traveling to sell it. Now, if they increased or got rid of the cap limit, then yes, what you are saying would be a problem.

Whether innocent or guilty, he played for 900 hours. He needs to go do something else for a while. I'm sure he'll be back for another 9865074210106874 hours of his very full and well-rounded life when he buys two more accounts or his temporary ban is lifted.

Anyone rolling around with a 1000 bounty is up to something shady.  To win, you either have to be willing to stoop to their level, or you have a team.  And even then, they'll probably log-off or have no Caps on them, just to spite you.
---
Well done sir!
---
I mustve got lucky AF last night, 
---
I got sturdy combat legs AND 
---
sturdy combat arms at watoga station on consecutive server hops (played around for an hour before hopping).
---
I wanna say both were 762 with 3* hardbargain. They were some weird number.
---
On xbox, first time playing since day before patch 5. RNGesus mustve given me a welcoming home present.
---
Ive never seen sturdy combat plans before last night (despite having 2/3 heavy), I thought they were bugged.
---
The reason I bought the plans for my preferred weapons was to make a bunch of level 10/15 ones and scrap them to learn the mods. Then mod the legendary you find.
---
thanks. Yeah i just figure it'll be easier to drop my shit off at their front door. 
---

I've been experiencing this bug. It's on and off and not every enemy but still xp I don't always want to miss out on.
---
As long as you don’t go in expecting Fallout 5 or a post apocalyptic version of Grand Theft Auto Online, you should be fine. I absolutely love the game and I was VERY apprehensive when I first got it. I bought it after the beta, on the first day the full version went on sale live, but still didn’t play it until about 5 weeks ago because I didn’t want to be disappointed. I was a HUGE Fallout 4 fanboy and I let the haters get to me. 
---
I would say that getting the game now is VERY smart as the game is worlds better than it was even two weeks ago with regard to server stability. I would get disconnected very frequently (I’m on Xbox) but now, I very rarely if ever get DC’d from my server. Sure there are some rendering glitches and definitely some lag and weird little quirks, but we’ve come to expect that from Bethesda (remember the Brahmin always getting stuck on the roofs of Sanctuary houses in Fallout 4?). 
---
I think you should ignore the haters and try it out and form your own opinion. Enjoy!
---
The chameleon mutation is bugged, and has been for the last couple of patches.  Sometimes you cloak, and never de-cloak.  You have to bounce servers to clear it up.
---
I didn't say that it was bugged.  Work on your comprehension skills.  I re-read what I wrote. It was clear.  If you haven't finished high school yet, I do hope that you manage to get to the part where they teach about comparisons, simile, and metaphor.    Since you are too dim to get the point without explicit hand holding:  Changing perks around is a part of the game, but it is too large of a part.  There are problems with it, especially in regards to what I would consider passive skills that are just earned by simply leveling up.  (You know...all those cards they GIVE you when you open card packs.)  So, it isn't too much to ask that we have something that make managing perks easier. 
---
Changing the "perks on the fly" implies that this can be done quickly.  The base system that Bugthesda gave is anything but quick or "on the fly".    If you knew how the Perk Loadout Manager worked, you'd see that there is still a cost to it.  You normally wouldn't change out perks while taking damage, so in the heat of battle you go with what you got or you find cover.   The perks still act as a limitation whether you can change their configuration around because you cannot have all perks at all times.  You still have to choose where your focus is and go with it.  None of that is negated by simply removing the time-suck that managing the cards 1-by-1 is.
---
What benefit or balance is provided by having to stop, load a card to make a missile turret, and then put your cards back?    "the reason to limit the amount of perks we ca have equipped at one time" is NOT well thought out and not well executed.  There are many perks that HAVE to be used to create higher level gear so you have to load them.  Many of those similar kinds of perks are 100% useless 90% of the time, and only need to be loaded when you are doing those tasks.  What is the point of making people switch back and forth?  Hint:  It is pointless busywork that adds no enjoyment, no fun, and is not part of "The Game" itself...it is just a mandatory slog.
---
"It's a challenge."  Yeah and creating, running, and modifying perk loadouts still has that same challenge to it.  Your point here is meaningless.   
---
"Edit: I'm sure..." I don't really give a flying grafton monster flinging shit what you are sure of, so you might as well not back peddle on the bullshit you started to post off with at the very end.   You might as well just own the fact that you are a used enema bag full of shit and carry on.  So take your halfassed apology mixed with an excuse and shove it right up your vault suit. I specifically don't apologize for taking you down point by point and calling you out for your bullshit.   
---
Yeaaaah that I know, and I’ve often farmed these meats before so I’m familiar with them and how long they last. The point is that after fast traveling in rapid succession, they spoiled faster than normal.

Wonder what it would have been like if they had reskinned another mmo, say Neverwinter, how would people be reacting.
---
Goodbye.
---
Perhaps they do now keep track of items as they’re created, but they didn’t in the beginning. A few weeks ago Bethesda announced the duplicated items were removed. BS. A few of my friends got tired of griefers destroying them and traded for a few weapons they knew were duped to equalize the playing field.  They’re still playing as of last night and still have those weapons.  
---
Instead of going through all this nonsense and pissing off so many customers that would buy future Bethesda products, just mass delete any remaining massive stashes. But they told us a few weeks ago they did that all ready.  
---
You gonna be hugged to death by toxic carebears. Quit your howling and accept your fate
---
Fixed, thank you.
---
In what way have I spread false information?
---
In the tests I ran last night I could not crack even half the damage numbers I was prior to the patch, regardless of what my hp was. 
---
Multiple people have reported fixes, but multiple others have reported that these fixes either do not work or are only temporary. 
---
It clearly is not functioning properly. Also, Bethesda telling us “Sorry, we broke your build. Just limp along and reinvest all that previous time and it SHOULD work” isn’t a real response. 
---
All I was looking for was some official word on the bug existing and that it (along with others) is being addressed. 
---
You can get it by completing the quest "Falsely Accused" in Toxic Valley.  It also has a (very low) chance of being randomly rewarded from events in any region.

I'm a non-PA sneak build, so I just did the usual. Hazmat + 2.5x sneak bonus rifle shots, an opportunity to finally use dozens of dusty grenades, occasional gatling gun use, and mopping up the distracting critters.
---
SBQ got HP reset to 100%, but ended up dead. Finally got the flux for the shielded vaultsuit.
---
Are you on console or PC? In console(PS4 at least) when you take pictures they go to the capture gallery. I also imagine for PC there would be a local location where they are stored. 
---
sorry bruh
---
I noticed that happening to me. I thought it was just visual on my end, but I guess not.
---
I don't even know why places do simple cosmetics like this on PC.
---
The community can extract the file and make useable mods so you see the cosmetic without ever having paid for it.
---
Only difference being that other people won't see your nifty new Power Armor ornament.
---
Not that rare...  but finding complete sets of a certain type/level can be a pain.  WHY ARE THEY ALL MISSING LEFT LEGS!
---
I was clearing Mount Blair, killed one mole miner, then the rest instantly dropped dead. Was freaked out, looked around for something that could have killed them, but I didn't find anything.
---
Good point. Maybe with +1 Endurance so I can just "drill baby drill!"
---
Wait tommorow is the community team livestream? Now this is something I'll gladly watch.
---
If you are teamed up, just disconnect/ close game.
---
Reboot and join team again.
---
If youre on xbox and solo, check recent players tab, and find someone that is in that world, remember gt, or send message saying you have grahm. If they fast travel to you, leave game, and then rejoin game by going to that players GT from xbox menu.
---
If you friend them, you can rejoin server from fo76 main menu social tab, and even fast travel to them (not that they should be that far from you)
---
na, if they r red. u can attack even with it on.
---
Are you guys going to take on SBQ while a half dozen level 20s sit in the shed and twiddle their thumbs?
---
so it's some sort of pluralis maiestatis
---
neat
---
and btw english is not my first language but thank you for nothing
---
well, I just learned something new
---
no need to roll your eyes but thanks for the teaching I guess
---
np. Glad I could help!
---
The one thing they coded in the game correctly...
---
I changed my mind.
---
You ARE a fucking twat.
---
If I fast travel to all 7 vendors, I'm pretty sure all my uncooked ingredients will spoil. It's been this way as long as I can remember.  The farther the travel, the more spoilage that occurs. Server hopping seems to take about 10% off of everything.
---
u/valseek

I noticed a bug with the VTU Track Suit from the Atomic Store. It severely thins out your character. I’ve attached a link to show what I mean. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/b6a8B2h
---
I've encountered Grahm right after taking all the caps from the Watoga Station vendor. Can confirm he shares that cap pool with them. 
---
Shut up
---
I have two characters.  One of them is only for playing with my wife, the other is for playing without her.  Sure, you have to start over to be on equal footing with her, but that doesn't mean it won't still be fun.  I actually find it more fun to play with her than without, even if that does mean I have to start over.
---
 I had 2 out of 5 normal ones bail and fly off today. I hurt both of em' but they went away.
---
 Maybe the new stuff they did to them, is making this happen. It used to be rare.
---
It looks like Vendors in the Toxic Valley area may sell BoS Combat Armor mod plans. Also they can be rewarded randomly for completing events in the Toxic Valley area.
---
If you used a mule to store the materials and Ammo you were crafting 50k could potentially get you popped.  
---
Will confirm.  Just worked for me. 
---
&gt;People are even defending cheaters that are literally destroying the game if that's what it takes to take Bethesda down a peg.
---
No.  It's literally people that think they purchased a game and feel they should be able to use that software as they see fit.  Regardless of it's a moral or not to do it is an entirely different thing.
---
It's important that you understand this.  Because without understanding it you will never truly be able to defend against it.  They aren't defending someone defrauding the player base, they are defending their property rights in software.
---
The problem is, that it isn't theirs.  Not even the physical copy is theirs.  It's literally just permission to use it as is.  Their is no right.  Furthermore, there are many other industries this is done in.  Buy a house?  Make sure it's not in an HOA.  New Ferrari?  Can't paint it or alter it in anyway, including non cosmetic changes.
---
It's not a new concept.  It's just new to a lot of people that haven't gotten up to speed.  I'm sure *some* small group of people are promoting cheating for the sake of targeting games or Bethesda in general; but the larger majority is arguing for a different point ignorantly.
---
Just remember, it's not about "cheating", but about the use of property you bought.
---
Dang :/ thank you!
---
I don't think so. This may be the reason that it disappears from the weapons workbench after it is repaired. 
---
You should at least get a vampires prefix
---
I get the argument fully, (PA and Armor Paints) but these are actually new models/meshes so a bit more work than just a recolor/retexture.
---
I know the feeling, happened to me once too, luckily I had a friend on the server so didn’t get so screwed 
---
Level 240 something, and I actually didn’t know that lmao, haven’t used them for a long time, but never knew the disease thing.
---
Ah, didnt know about the transit hub one.
---
Bank...we need an account bank, and the FO76 tablet app.
---
Didnt it take quite a few years to make New California? I want to say 4-6 but I could be wrong here. And that was modders taking an already made framework and creating their own content.
---
[Link to a great post with a community built list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
How about a "gun of the month" . A random 3 star legendary gun each month you can buy . For those of us that never get good drops , give us the choose to buy a good gun that's a random drop gun. 
---
Feel better now?
---
Never felt bad!
---
&gt; If you login between 5 and 9 every day both systems will have been reset and ready for your use.
---
What about people who play more than one session in a day, like me?
---
&gt; A static reset gives the peope that have that reset time during their play period a slight advantage because they can do their stuff, wait for reset and do it again, essentially stacking 2 days in one.
---
The only advantage they gain is being able to do that second run sooner, that is it. Everyone still has equal opportunity to runs in a given reset period.
---
The guy is next-level with his builds.
---
Don't trust Bethesda you help them and they ban you!
---
Haha! No plans for SBQ. We're playing on my xbox account and I gave away all my rad aways and almost all my stimpaks to a new player the other night so I don't have enough aid to cover myself.
---
All you do is lie
---
This is how the how game looks... Bethesda just drops bombs on there loyal players
---
That’s not possible.
---
It will be trash.... Just like the rest
---
I get that, but mod creators can do amazing work with just front-facing mods that only apply visual filters over things for you.
---
Check out the mod landscape for Final Fantasy XIV, for example.
---
It's an MMO but the mods used to change various appearances that some people have made are stunning.
---
Get that gameplay fixed yet?
---
Okay thank you, just wanted to know.
---
Lol who's going to watch it you banned all the loyal players, even the ones who were just helping
---
It kinda sucks, but after all, its just a cartoon prop
---
No, but box mods can add stars
---
I have paid atoms for them, when you use the emote and try to enter photo mode it ends the emote
---
Please Bethesda fix the Quick Access Dial in your next patch so I could add variants of the same weapon to it. Right now if I add a bloodied Gatling and a two-shot Gatling to the dial, they will stay there for one round and next time when I log in, one of them will disappear. The one that stays there will display a wrong name. It worked fine until Patch 5. I could put three variants of my Grognak Axe on the dial and quickly switch. Not any more. It’s a real pain when one weapon breaks in a fight and I have go to my full weapon list to look for a substitute. 
---
Speaking of Grog Axe, could you also fix it so that we can repair it to 200% condition. Thanks for listening!! 
---
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
---
Yeah I've killed everything listen and gotten nothing :/
---
I have my mic set to area and rather then initiate a trade I’ll ask from a distance if the lowbie wants stuff
---
If they agree I’ll drop and step back 
---
No pressure to have them come right up and leaves them an out if they feel threatened 
---
some people don't want to just "function fine". and even then, if you need specific sentinel pieces for example, like assassin/sentinel, which are requirements for high level pvp, you're sol.
---
more to the point, a 0.000001% rng on a game like this is not ok.
---
Sorry to hear that, sucks when it happens.
---
Given that is not an uncommon occurrence 'rejoin server' should be an option. 
---
PC right? Yeah he was by that Seneca Rocks fast travel point. I wanna say it was 2:45-3:00 AM CST
---
I think im north of huntersville, hes spawned on me three times there.
---
One time a stalking MM broke into my house while I was on a workbench slapped me, then vanished... Now I cant ever get the well rested bonus :P
---
check if the game is running on Integrated graphics or not. Update your graphics drivers too.
---
What do you mean? Like are there mods out there that are considered legendary that I can apply to my gun?
---
Bethesda can (and have ) screwed Fallout 76 up- a lot. Sadly  theres no denying this. That said, there are cheaters-but after all the times Bethesda has lied to the Community is it any surprise people have doubts about the truth of things?
---
Lvl 65 and not 40c to your name?
---
If he played as my old character when we first start could he drop all of my stuff for me so I’d at least have my PA and weapons I’ve collected even if I’d be too low level to use them at first? I love questing so the main annoyance would be losing all my quest progress 
---
No it definitely wasn’t that. My first shot he healed instantly 
---
Sorry- I mean some of the emote wheel emotes have equivalent photo mode poses in the atom shop- not sure off the top of my head how many there are exactly but they're there.
---
Oh what proof then? He got banned? For ACQUIRING stuff over 30 DAYS? Not in possession of 100k stacks? Yeah that's the ONLY shit we have now. Wow the reason is so clear and not ambiguous at all. For all we know the system may calculate everytime dude drop and pick cuz Beth shitty code. That's why I'm not taking any side.
---
 Im crying when we have someone is stupid like this. But yeah proof doesn't matter cuz "hur dur Bethesda is my god, they did no wrong and give me canvas bag!!" Stupid fanboy.
---
What kind of legendary mods are out there and where can I find them?
---
Two things: 
---
1) I don't disagree with (a) potential obtuse interpretation of your statement, but I also know that a redesign from the ground up would be a ridiculous thing to claim enabling pacifist mode on your camp would cause. 
---
2) Your far-reaching questions about this individuals ability to understand your questions which are, purposefully, worded in a way that leads you down a path of discussion you want to go down instead of addressing their actual request is a try-hard move. 
---
Let me make your statement better with actual standing:
---
"You bought the game as it was and you had the agency to research that this is how PVP works and you purchased it. You admitted to knowing this could (would) happen and you still complain. I find the other person is not at fault and all and they are playing the game the way they want to play the game and within the rules of said game." 
---
If you're going to be purposefully rude, just get to it and move on. 
---
Please read my other post in this thread. It is far more likely beth scaned during the maint, than to believe they could track it in real time.
---
Also, why are we parsing their words so fine?
---
Is it likely that Bethesda (the great communicator) chose this 1 occassion to clearly, and accurately detail exactly how they caught them, in an email to known offenders?
---
Nice work bro this is what this game is really about. 
---
This made me laugh so hard, you have my upvote sir
---
&gt;That's why I'm not taking any side.
---
Clearly you're a liar.
---
you don't get sick for sleeping in mattresses or sleeping bags if they're inside your camp. only random ones.
---
If you had it before the patch then you need to remove it and reapply it to get it to work correctly.
---
I bet your mom said that when you were born.
---
&gt; Please read my other post in this thread. It is far more likely beth scaned during the maint, than to believe they could track it in real time. 
---
And please read *my* other post, where I pointed out that they log certain actions and you would just need to run a slightly long query to go through those logs... like during extended maintenance.
---
Ah gotcha, thanks!
---
So brave of you! /s
---
I found the brown asylum worker uniform laying on a bench in the shower room in one of the upper levels!  So far that's all the luck I've had though, tried a second time and it was white.  It must be randomly generated in that spot.
---
If you are both taking turns on the same Xbox account(even if it's two different characters) yes, you'd have to start from scratch. If you were switching Xbox accounts to play, then just load your account up and good to go. 
---
show bobs and vagene
---
that was the issue, why the hell is it doing that? like what? lmao.
---
lol had to server hop once because of this mongrel
---
Even then, it only got made due to the legal issues because it was cheaper to make the bags than deal with a class action.
---
Removing and reapplying fixes it (but the positive effect does not show up in the display)
---
Thanks, very interesting insight! Now I'm happier to work on my programs alone :P
---
EDIT: if you don't feel like finding it:
---
&gt; Well... we already know that there is a limited log of actions that the servers keep. This has been shown with previous ban actions, particularly against griefers deliberately crashing servers. It's not like they'd have to have something running in the background constantly evaluating every single action, more like running an SQL query against their logging database checking for specific actions. Run queries, accumulate totals, spit out a ban list.
---
In fact that would line up with the extended maintenance, since a query like that would take a bit to run. Funnily enough, "SELECT PLAYER WHERE RARE_ITEM_COUNT &gt; 100000" would probably run in under a minute, depending on how their database is structured.
---
Some people play MMOs for fashion, if other people can't validate how cool they look, then they don't look cool.
---
this actually has been reported by others and I have experienced it myself. I will harvest a razorgrain to repair the fertilizer harvester on my next visit to CAMP and store it in my stash, and be gone for less than 10 minutes and return to have no razorgrain and no change in the number spoiled items
---
Appreciate all the help 👌
---
Oh daam, I was about to check if it was fixed. Only mod I've been using, it's really totally a must with crafting.
---
Manually changing my perks takes like 2-3 mins at start of each small or big crafting session.
---
Not tryna flex or whatever, but I dont seem to have issues with them. But at the same time ove not seen more than 3 at a time. 
---
I was wondering that too
---
Scorched yao guais are worse than deathclaws at SBQ events. Those SOB's will insta-stagger you every time.
---
its so cute hahaha
---
Also had a ps4 SB kill last night.  About 8 minutes left.  Almost the whole server came and everything ran totally fine.  I'm only level 32 but made sure I was constantly doing as much damage as possible.
---
Right
---
This is going to be the longest legacy for Fallout 76.  Private servers with all kinds of different quirky universes &amp; mechanics are going to be the spice of life, and they will keep the game around for an extremely long time.
---
Wild! We ask for a fridge they give us a food compost. 
---
Yeah he probably used a stimpack then, I’ll pvp with you if you want 
---
i play the same time every day and i usually do the same exact route..so i would know if its been 20 hours or not
---
route:
---
* whitespring
---
* pleasant valley
---
* harpers
---
* watoga shopping
---
* watoga station
---
* vault 76 (free fast travel) 10 caps to flatwoods
---
it costs me 49 caps to net 1151 caps daily
---
You weren't suppose to nuke at all, according to majority opinion of the story...The enclave is the only faction that pushes using the nukes.
---
I don’t really PVP that much tbh. Thanks though
---
Because you touch yourself at night. 
---
Ignore em. It's Reddit gibberish. 
---
Your drivers are outdated and is not recognizing FO76. This issue happens with most new games and hence, Nvidia makes the game ready drivers for every new release.
---
Thank you! I'll get this documented as well.
---
Damn, I was hoping someplace had the small metal letters. Starting to think I’ll never get them. 
---
I definitely saw the neon letters at Sutton Station once, selling for 12k caps. Way out of my price range at the time...and still out of my price range now...
---
&gt; \[I can't believe even Slim Jim has fallen for this\] 
---
Why? He's barely better than the list of idiot outrage-bait YTers. His saving grace is he's at least knowledgeable about the industry, but he jumps on popular arguments/opinions left and right to get clicks and them sweet Pateron bux.
---
I've had the same base since the BETA. It's right under the palace of the winding path on a cliff and I can't bring myself to move. I've rebuilt that place so many times.
---
Grham the mutant trader, sell starburst clock plan and super sledge plan, the traveling robot vendor who spawn in charleston sell Nuka cola clock and Coo Coo clock plan
---
Well if it's so hard maybe they should stop fucking with things nobody wants changed like adrenal reaction. If they don't touch it they can't break it and yet.. they just haddd to touch it.
---
Yeah, kinda sucks sometimes, but it's my primary source of income
---
They'd better if they want to avoid stream sniping nukes...
---
I got it taken care of just had to reboot the modem
---
his 1st point was that modders "can’t do a better job, not even remotely close" and that he had "not even once seen original content from that comes anywhere close to the people that actually create the game"- New California proves him wrong.
---
as for the 2nd, he said that "dev teams have hundreds of tasks", which is untrue if you consider the patch notes, and reiterates that "some guy (or group) that is fixated on a single task is of course going to be able to resolve or improve whatever singular issue they are working on", which means Bethesda should be able to fix bug reliably considering the small number of issues tackled per patch.
---
Yao Guais are OG Melee Build.
---
There is a concrete node just south of the overseers camp. I would hate to think of a new player trying to get to the abandoned bog town. Especially if the behemoth spawns.
---
Tbh, I don't believe the guy was wrongfully suspended. I play with a rather large group of people and I'm not gonna say they are all clean. some dupe, some exploit, you know, the usual hardcore gamers that would do anything to get to the top. Anyways, ones that got suspended this time WAS exploiting the game at some time. They were happy last ban wave didn't get to them but turns out Bethesda doesn't fuck around. People were rather amazed to find out Bethesda was keeping all the records. Not a single innocent players were banned btw. Only fuckup Bethesda's making is that they are not banning enough people. There still are some exploiters within our group still able to log on and play
---
We’re PS4 but yeh we’re on the same account I don’t even have my own account because I don’t really game. I should have thought that through before we started but I didn’t think I’d like the game as much as I do.  
---
Such passion for defending bullshit.
---
Iirc the overseer actually pushes towards nuking FSP.
---
I haven't seen it in the shop yet.
---
Who the hell is bob and why you want to kiss him ew
---
This is a great idea as long as it's easy to create a new config which it seems like it would with something like nukesdragons support.
---
Technically, you only get a disease of your sleeping bag is on the ground. If you throw it on a foundation or a floor, itll be fine
---
Probably more bugs to come 
---
&gt; Sure, you can throw out a few buzz words and talk about how modders know more about the game than those who actually created it but it’s just total nonsense. 
---
So very true. Upvote for this.
---
For the record though,, Behtesda has had plenty of time to fix it.  Actually, they should not have released a game that needed so much fixing.   Since every gaming system became connected to the internet, game companies have had the mentality of "release now, fix it with patches later." 
---
But I agree with 90 percent of your post. 
---
Wonder what they are gonna break next patch 
---
I'm pretty sure she only wanted to secure the nuke sites, I don't recall her saying FSP should be nuked, could very well be mistaken though.
---
Is that intended to be some kind of peer pressure?
---
Sorry, im 51 and far too secure in myself to worry about how some anonymous random in a forum percieves my online digital bravery.
---
I only do it because my camp is a slut and she gets around 
---
Yao-guais have 'tells' about what they are about to do that allow you to dodge/block power attacks and flank them if the go into 'frenzy'.
---
Is just a bit more involved but makes for a more interesting encounter.
---
I like to have a little dance with them during Irrational Fear on in the cabins NE of Whitesprings.
---
Biggest enemy is latency really... cannot beat latency.
---
idk what to tell you, I just went back in to double check and that's what it says
---
[https://imgur.com/a/lIWzm3z](https://imgur.com/a/lIWzm3z)
---
And why would we expect that? Really, who is gonna tell potential cheaters exactly how anti cheating measures work?
---
They said mod support would be added along with mods like a year after release, and that might change depending on the work involved, so they wouldn't "live up to" it yet because it's still pretty far out from when they planned it. 
---
Mods on PC are not even officially supported by Bethesda yet. The availability of them now is because players made them work. We'll probably *eventually* see something like the mod shop in Fallout 4, and only those in that shop will be officially supported, and even then probably only available for private servers.
---
lol good one
---
classic
---
If I see you go down, I won't take your bag, and may even protect it for you. But if I see a random bag laying around and no sign of a player nearby on the map, I'm grabbing it. People drop their scrap all the time to make room so there's no way to tell if it's someone junk or treasure.
---
I've noticed this happen with both regular and legendary mobs (above the auto heal; usually above 50%). It becomes even more unfortunate when this happens to a tougher mob. As a sniper I range my target appropriately so I will most likely kill them before they reach me. If they heal back up again, it screws the whole strategy up. I've resorted to climbing up on something where they can't hit me so I don't get overrun. It's even more unfortunate when this happens to the SBQ before she heals up normally as she eats up so much ammo.
---
&gt;  A server controlled allow list, could have been a start, instead of disabling network access completely. They could allow network access on a case by case basis and they could control the whitelist. 
---
They would never whitelist a third-party mod author though. They can't guarantee that security.
---
Your Base prices are incorrect.  You were getting a discount for your Charisma points.  Multiply your numbers by 25/22 to get the true base price.
---
Hard Bargain ranks, Grape Mentats, and raw Charisma points all will reduce the selling price, up to a max of 25% off.
---
LOL. I fight Scorchbeasts all the time and take very little damage. I am geared for them and they do not hurt till they land and that's a big mistake.
---
 I take on Yaos as unfairly as I can. Hide in the cabins, if its the place I'm thinking, of and troll them till they dead.
---
I also hit up the little town with the Mothman museum.   The spawns there are either ticks or bloodbugs.
---
Aww no PC? When do PC folks get to feel the love?
---
Yup 
---
Most of them are such cowards they need several ‘friends’ around to help them when they harass those who aren’t interested in pvp. Can’t imagine how miserable their real lives must be. 
---
Yes if people select Pacifist mode they shouldn’t be able to damage others nor should they take any damage from others, simple as that. It’s as if Bethesda doesn’t really have a clue when they turned a solo game into multi player. 
---
Base building in general doesnt get enough recognition for how bugged and wonky it is. 
---
I couldn't do that since I'd need a foundation next to it that has no roof (but being in the middle of the three tall block wall) to glitch the hole back in each time and that would be a nightmare
---
I've been into it too, same deal. Radtoad horde was in the main common room and I had free roam of the Vault, but the presumed quest items werent available. Very interesting terminals though.
---
 Killed 3 Scorchbeasts today and 2 ran away. How is that not fun?
---
Proof? it's right there on the post that 900 hours guy made! It's not our fault you don't play the game and have no idea what the screenshot is implying
---
I did the same thing last night but they were level 6's. He was trying for mele so I built them both something to look forward to at level 10
---
That sounds really awesome actually haha, I was just thinking about a location that I could do that in
---
Wait, wait, I was reading this thinking the OP had just walked out of 76 and fell victim to the change to the supply drops triggering bounties. I don't even...
---
Instead of powering through the levels. I took it slow and explored. Still enjoying the game. 
---
The one thing they got right is the exploring and dungeon crawling aspect. 
---
The rest, well you know ;-)
---
Don't try to do 40 fun in a 15 fun zone. You will get a severe penalty for that.
---
Just stick to the fun limit and you'll be a-OK.
---
704 hours and counting :D
---
Yeah I like the bunker feeling especially because of that, I did stumble across a semi large cave out in the open that would work as a bunk but it would be compact 
---
Bluntly, because this has now turned into yet another bit of negative PR for the game and BGS. If they want to try and counter that (which they may not) then they're going to have to justify these bans with more than just "because we said so".
---
Your argument would be valid if it weren't for the fact that there are hundreds of devs and modders out there that do this shit and more before their morning coffee. Remember that time CD Projekt Red fixed almost every single issue in The Witcher 3 literally a week after launch? Remember that time when modders made Fallout 4 play like a different game in a month? Exactly.
---
I don't have to be a chef or know how to cook to say that one chef served me a shit meal while another chef does it better.
---
Fallout 76 needs travelers like you, brother. Continue spreading the love and helping the community grow. I'd rather see posts like these on the sub rather than posts about whiners crying about the game.
---
The BoS was going to nuke as well, chronologically the BoS quest comes before the Enclave quest!
---
I did. And you kinda made my point. This is bethesda, lets assume they did it the simplest way possible. Which is what you alluded to. A quick scan showing what accounts have right then. Not some convaluted equation of how much they had+(made-used)×picked up+bought
---
If you’re a attacker that never plans on actually holding the workshop then yeah sure it’s good. But as it is not it takes away any advantage the defender has, someone defending a workshop should be in the advantage, not the attacker.
---
Love the tail detail.
---
I use the same location, but my build is not as good.
---
you can adjust your spawn location at your camp by moving the metal camp over head projector thing. keep moving it around your camp and fast traveling to your own camp until you spawn where you want.
---
it's even prettier than the preview, thanks.
---
also, are there risks to moving meshes around like this? wanted to try it for myself.
---
I feel you there, especially when it comes to quest and event glitches and patch repairs (which break other repairs). Still, from a general standpoint, I can honestly say that I’ve experienced far fewer crashes on FO76 than previous Fallout games.  I suspect it has something to do with item placement.  No GB save file, no problem, right?
---
There’s a datamine Google doc currently in the Discord for this sub that lists all the completed content in the game (not just partial), and it sounds like there’s a lot coming.  We’re at just over 3 months since release.  Most triple As release DLC after 3-4 months, so I don’t really share your concern re: content, but I feel where you’re coming from because the game can be a bit repetitive for betaers at this point.
---
yeah.... i dont kick somone who is allready laying on the ground so i prefer to post good things
---
Tbh the best way to not get griefed is to close the game as soon as you hear stuff getting destroyed. Or leave the server. Closing the game is faster tho and repairing sucks.
---
From how you type I know you’re a high school freshmen.
---
Didn’t they get back in after the last patch? I thought the ban was only temporary 
---
If you could just set a major/minor color for your armor it would go SOOO far in making everyone unique 
---
Has anyone had any luck finding any plans for deep pocketed other than marine armor limbs ?
---
Wish luck to pvp player trying to find anyone they can kill
---
RNGesus must  buy supermutants in bulk, because they always spawn in outrageous numbers
---
It should just start once you walk onto the property.
---
Haha that was a good one
---
Yes, they are teh devil for me in this game. I'll put the hurt on a SB or Death Claw but de' bears beat me into the ground.
---
This is something I am really, *really* hoping they  implement in some sort of way.
---
It was "until after the exploit is fixed in *a future patch*." They never said it would be the *next* patch.
---
Mine was radtoads too. I guess it's specifically that enemy.
---
Thanks for the heads up, i'll take a look at my numbers tonight
---
You can also get mutation serum recipes and stalker’s rolling pins from the queen, so it’s not just ultracite explosive vents. I do hope they completely rework the legendary item system. Right now killing a level 80 SB absolutely won’t give you any legendary item while I can one-axe a fat ghoul and land a three star weapon on a good day (got a three star anti armor gama gun yesterday). The reward system is so upside down why would anyone go anywhere else other than WS. 
---
Oh and they definitely silent nerfed Uranium Fever, the terminated managers won’t go higher than level 40 so essentially no top tier rewards any more from that event 👎👎👎
---
first, dont stoop to his level, if a gamer insults you, dont hop online and insult them back.  nobody wins there. second, you willingly engaged in pvp and lost.  This should teach you to pick your battles.  It sounds like you're pretty new to the game at this point, or a casual player.  Anyone with a 1000 bounty is not new to this game, so expect to take some Ls while u get better at pvp if u want to claim a bounty like that.  you will likely need to know the ins-and-outs of the game mechanics to take down a player who is clearly baiting other players to come get them.  that being said, im sorry about the insults, not all PVP players behave like that win they get a kill, but trash talk is incredibly common in competitive gaming now.  im not big on it personally, let ur play speak for ya.
---
I’ve had the same issue. Using my Gatling plasma non stop for ten minutes without draining a single core or affecting weapon durability.
---
Roughly 5 minutes later, with my grog axe equipped, I got the notice my Gatling plasma broke and all of my cores disappeared.
---
With a static reset you get the option to do your run a little sooner, but you still gotta wait for for the daily reset, where as the 20 hr timer forces you to log in at a similiar time each day.
---
So whether you do your run in the morning or the evening, same same.
---
Not sure what your fighting me on here we are basically saying the same thing, like I said before complaining to me about the system not working the best for you wont do any good, put in a ticket to BGS.
---
Epic 👍
---
Ps4? I got a spare someone gave me still lvl 25 so you will have to upgrade it
---
I guess if by speculating you mean something you can actually confirm yourself just by putting a legendary in a container and pulling it back out.  
---
Or by making a new character and getting the "collect wood" achievement without actually getting 76 pieces of wood by just relooting the same wood out of a suitcase.
---
-15% damage per piece from robots
---
Thanks! It had some parts inside I was told to store before entering. Those are in my stash now for later.
---
You own a workshop so you get thrown into PvP aswell as your team. IIRC
---
You mean it’s actually possible to overlook a few minor glitches and enjoy something for what it is?   It seems like I’ve read that recently, maybe a couple of dozen thousand times,  but I don’t remember exactly where....
---
[Stat wise, level 50 T-51b has the best DR and ER, beating Ultracite and X-01 by one in each stat](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713716184285214/537758620667084830/Qj0dz7WTKoJdXFntnhsQAmVr4ePzfA8lUO4FDdWlTUtJsgsnwhooOdEtlC3JiVWXQmdgGi7JLkwQ9WI1UHKiWyhbkhOrLoXOwDRc.png), however it has the lowest radiation resistance and breaks slightly faster.
---
Shaka, when the walls fell
---
It always required 2. I wish it was one, but I had to plastic farm a lot because it requires 2 to bulk.
---
Sadly, XBox One.
---
Mole miners have never spawned over a level 40 That event has always only had level 40 Legendaries I never knew why people raved about it. I use it primarily to farm Black titanium weapons to sell and xp.
---
I couldn't agree more. When exploring gets old, then grinding gear should take over, but yeah..
---
Did the same thing cause was only thing fun before i quit finally, I think its just more and more quitting and those staying are the casuals. 
---
Those poor dupers.
---
The dude had over 640,000 ammo of different types, and had 250,000 ultracite ammo. 900 hours or not, no one is gonna sit around crafting and farming for that long. 
---
You and I have no proof either way. We are taking this guy and Bethesda’s word. I am making the assumption that Bethesda has more information than you and I and have acted accordingly. There is no incentive for Bethesda to intentionally deny innocent players of the game.  I think the numbers this guy has are suspect, but that is for Bethesda to decide as they have more information than I do.  Is it possible that this was a mistake and he really didn’t take advantage of the system, yes.  I just wouldn’t take those odds at a bet. 
---
I *think* someone figured out that it was from when you first get a single cap from them. 
---
I never talk to pigs
---
cRiTiciSm iS oNlY vAlId iF yOu cAn dO beTta
---
You're a fucking joke. Please stop acting like people aren't allowed to voice their opinions because Bethesda fucks everything up.
---
Prices will very if you have unyeilding armor with super high charma along with hard bargain.
---
I recorded a video about it. Jump a cross the map trying to give low lvls 3 star weapons lvl 1-10 lol. 
---

---
”when it sounds to good to be true it probably is”... Well, not this time.
---
Bethesda just targeted and killed the text chat mod for fallout 76 with latest patch. bzzt - entire community of players tossed out the door.
---
Amazing so it’s pretty open ended, they’ll be over the game by the time they get back in. Less grief for everyone else 
---
New Gad is a neat place based off a real town in WV. The Army Corps of Engineers built a Dam there and flooded the town of Gad. Normally they would name Dams after the closest town but choose to name it after Summersville which is a little farther away. Had they named it after Gad it would have been Gad Dam lol. They didn't think it would be funny so they changed it.
---
nah, you got it wrong. Its another one of Bethesdas stealth "fixes". 
---
Did you seriously never notice it was always 2, or are you just trying to whip up more rumors?
---
Or “Hey, it’s me, your old friend abandoned Detroit home.”
---
I do!!!
---
Oh yeah I am a duper yep woe is me the 200k ultracite 5.56 that got me suspended that isn't even on my account was never traded or sold or even used yep I am the problem.....get off my page.
---
What type of armor and damage mitigating perks are you using?
---
what you described is an actual feature but since last patch some mobs are surviving with what I'm assuming is 1 HP.
---
this is particularly noticeable with my shotgun. in a nuke zone yesterday, literally every single glowing one endured my blasts with a sliver of health.
---
This justifies its own thread to clear all this BS.
---
Dude... That was the first thing I searched when I started playing. Was very sad when I couldn't find it 
---
the entire server crashed, usually i look for recent players and re join, but the server crashed so, sucks for me
---
oh nice I have to try this. What about building a false door in front of the door, you know like 1 block sticking out on a foundation, just remove that block if you know what I mean. 
---
Roof looks pretty cool with the marble foundations but a floor might be nicer, you right they might not be destroyable ... also you could build fake walls or wood walls inside to cover the concrete maybe ? Anyway love the concept, was waiting for someone to do this ..
---
Should have though about all this, may be just once, before cheating.
---
I'm typically not that guy, but git gud. That shit happens all the time. I'm lvl 83, and never once had an issue regardless of if there's low level players hiding around. Have a drink and wash down the salt, or play a different game.
---
The bullshit thing is I shouldn't have to do that. Why should I waste my time to avoid people being jerks?
---
They kick like hell!
---
“Cough 300,000 ultracite ammo Cough”
---
PvP in the game is currently horrible due to restrictions, further restricting it so you can't even PvP half the time is not going to help. Split servers mean if you don't want PvP you don't have to, and if you do you don't have to deal with all the crazy restrictions. Win-Win.
---
Which one?
---
I think the game world is actually really well done. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring Appalachia and finding the different ways they tell stories through environment and set pieces. I’ve heard Howard mention that they are best at world building and I would definitely agree with that. I quit playing after finishing the main quests due to all the reasons we are all well aware of but I look forward to coming back when they add more content and context to this nice game world they built. 
---
Did you think about the fact that there might be a reason why Bethesda put on a 30min timer?
---
I mean seriously do you want endless queues because of players being AFK and not playing?
---
Get a mic and talk to people.  I've avoided all PvP and griefing by simply talking to people.  One of the pvpers/griefers I ended up on a team with even said "If this guy had a mic I probably wouldnt have griefed him."
---
That sucks
---
You should have duped.
---
Maybe what they are doing is duping you into believing that you’ll be able to play again,
---
I mean cheat again.
---
Yup cause everyone hit was a duper. Anyone else remember when this community had a brain and supported one another?
---
Doesn't matter since they quietly targeted and blocked the text chat mod in last patch.
---
Terrific!
---
That arm swipe stun/stagger thing they do is annoying.
---
Look cuck SJW, you need to move off this subreddit so those of us real fallout fans can get some stuff done with this game. Its clear you are the reason why the game cant get fixed because Bethesda only pays attention to users under the conditions like this co-opted subreddit thread. Unfortunately for them, they are not getting good critical information that could help the game from here because you guys are all Bethesda cucks. So ironic btw your statement lmfao, you fell right into my lap on that one haha. And not everyone is a reddit nerd bro, no need to pump up numbers wierdo lol, more numbers equals super nerdy
---
are there still ppl around fighting the bugged SBQ?
---
Overseer’s camp and tuba and NOW I HAVE A MENTAL IMAGE I DIDN’T NEED NOR ASK FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
---
Cool, I’m on now just need to grab it from my stash. Caps?
---
The lowest tier I believe. It's been a while since I've played. 
---
I've got a camp in the hills just north of Huntersville and I've had two of those bastards waiting for me when I got home twice this week alone. I've also run into one over by the radio silence antenna and the Alpha silo, the hills facing the vault and the fissure in the southernmost part of the map and the fields by the highway in the cranberry bog.
---
There are a lot of them around the V94 area. I was surprised when I found one too. There isn't any legitimate way to access any of the Vaults yet as far as I know but great find! Makes you wonder what happened to V94
---
My friend just completed Mayor for a Day yesterday and got her Stimpaks, while I completed it 190 levels ago and haven't gotten fresh Stimpaks from the mayor's office since the last patch. So I imagine it was a bug and you're only supposed to get them once after completing the quest.
---
someone commented on my channel a link of them wearing the armor, they glitched the event to start and got seals to purchase it:  
---

just wanted to share with you incase you haven't gotten around to doing the custom texture into 76!
---
Your point is taken.
---
English haiku aint proper.
---
Niether is English.
---
:)
---
Just type “ fallout ban” or type in “ 900 hour fallout”
---
People don’t need to link things for ya.
---
You’re a lazy cuck.
---
Anyone else wanna call me a cheater and not have any proof?
---
It would be a neat challenge to acquire all the plans in a specific category. It would have two benefits. It would give us something to shoot for (atoms) and give us a comprehensive list of plans.
---
&gt;Thanks for that, any suggestions on where would be better in the Mire?
---
I've decided the next one I'm going to drop will be somewhere around Dyer chemical. If I keep Dyer on the southern edge I think the zone would encompass Braxton Medical supplies, Crevasse Dam, Dolly Sod's Campground, and a couple other minor locations.
---
Besides the named locations that spawn set enemies, there's usually plenty of random anglers and mirelurks roaming that area, so I think it has potential. 
---
Yes, how much for the plans would you like?
---
When the frustration wears off I plan to dive back in.  I am fully aware my hang-up is expecting a traditional Fallout game.  If only they would have named it something else and made all new enemies-  I would then have no traction on my complaints.  'Country Roads' would have been a lovely game where I would have had no expectations and probably would have given it a pass on glitches.  
---
The number of ways and the available ways to exploit the PvP system are such a joke.
---
path of exile has an expansion in 2 weeks or so, if you like ARPG style gameplay, quite a lot of content to get into over there
---
Funny how cheaters dislike your post cause it hurts their chances of getting their “hard work” back.
---
Lol. Such syringe words on a reddit like you are putting your fists up or something.
---
Bethesda isn't perfect, but they aren't that incompetent. More than that, everything they've sent out or stated is consistent with what I've suggested. The only thing backing up your theory is a biased interpretation of the word "acquired" and the assumption that Bethesda decided on a solution that would not actually solve anything. I'll give them a little more credit than that.
---
There was a text chat mod, and instead of figuring out how to add this simple function into the base game, they changed the base game to block anyone else from doing it. So, I don't know about theory or mind reading of their reasons, but clearly it isn't because they can't do it but rather because they don't want it in the game (yet).
---
When you make new characters you start over in every aspect. They can hold your stuff and give it to you though.
---
r/HailCorporate! Nobody messes with my pet greedy corporation!
---
&gt; Hit the Top of the World. Wasn't very exciting.
---
I did that once too. Waste of a nuke.
---
 Ot at 25
---
Can not seem to find the pump action shotgun in your list. Anyone know where it may spawn?
---
"Lol. Such syringe words on a reddit like you are putting your fists up or something."
---
Your drunk go home.
---
I know people who purchased them. Not a single one did because of some shitty, almost imperceptible boost to health when grouped with someone else wearing the same costume for a few days.  This is literally a non-issue.
---
Best post this week! 😂
---
Excavator armor: You're doing it wrong!
---
Nuke world dlc was such a nice addition for this.
---
It’s called auto correct you cheating super.
---
Lol lame come back too. 
---
Just wait till I'm higher?
---
Yes, there's no private about perk card sets.
---
Haha I really am trying not to bug you man but does Twisted Muscles or any other mutation apply to the chainsaw? 
---
Somehow I've played some 300-400 hours without it though...
---
That's a good point, but what do you say after they have demolished half your base? 
---
Thanks for the good fight.
---
According to the email they sent me, the wording implies how they calculate the bans is how many items you've picked up accumulative in a 30 day period. So if you picked up say 3,300 50 cal rounds, every day in a row for a month, well that's 100,000 50 cal rounds and that's a paddlin'. 
---
Because fuck us who play the game a lot. I had 600+ hours from Beta until January 13th, was the last day I logged in. I got my ban email on January 26th I think it was.
---
Yes, yes, yes! We need some way to remove modifiers and apply them to our own weapons. It would fix the endgame grind.
---

---
I hope so, I'm tired of having people trash my camp for no reason... If it was set up in a town like this I hope it would be less of a temptation and more of a welcoming feel.
---
I don’t know how to code but I’d fucking hope the people developing a game does - so why do they keep screwing shit up?
---
I’ve seen them go for 1500 on the market sub. 
---
I read so much about how little griefing there is in this game, but since I started playing last month I have had at least 20 bad encounters with other players. It's gotten better the more I level but still happens.
---
Just last night while I was helping a low level in my camp, a 145 lvl starts bashing apart my stuff with his bare hands. I had to move my base a few weeks ago because every server people were lockpicking and stealing my resources. My first base someone called a damn air strike on lol. Lots of people that try to bait you into a fight as well, while their lvl 200 buddy with a bloodied build hides around the corner to one shot you.
---
Sort of my issue as well.  Play a VATS-Crit build without god-roll gear.  Never really felt like a super critical player in the queen fight compared to melee but after the nerfs it sort of turned into "why bother?"
---
Heard there's a large balance patch in the works.  Hoping that's the case, though with the tendency to nerf nerf nerf I'm not sure what to expect.
---
Sold
---
That is really unfortunate.
---
I hope you get a sort of karma boost as a consequence of your current misfortune.
---
I mean there are Old Gods in the game so who knows, it may be possible that they take your sacrifice kindly and bestow a boon upon you right? 
---
If they did glitch it they could be facing a ban. Or Its possible they just replaced the texture using a custom .ba2 archive. I just started [playing with that myself](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/at6kga/datamine_closer_look_at_the_plague_rider/). Thanks for the reminder i will try the Presidential Paint Next.
---
Same, I climb a tree and shoot their faces. Their melee is powerful and has a high stagger chance.
---
I drop stuff like that all the time too (lvl 108). I made some lvl 5 happy the other day by giving him a lvl 5 vampire hunting rifle. Gave me the heart emote then drop ammo for me as a gift. I laughed and told him to keep it lol.
---
thank you buddy!
---
You really have nothing better to do then try and start shit and call people cheaters do you 😆 and your auto correct is fucked aparently.
---
Probably:  "That guy is batshit crazy and I'm going to do exactly what he says so I don't end up being executed in his bizarre sexual-sadist circuses"
---
At below 20% hp my sledge would get to 980 damage and now it gets to 480. Before you say that's still really strong, realize that I will die if something hits me at that low of health, and they broke sneak so everything sees me almost instantly even with my 19 ability max sneak with chameleon effect. 
---
 I don't think adrenal reaction needed a nerf. I used to be a glass cannon now I'm just glass
---
How did you get the Gatlin to do 760? Base damage of 72 + Bloodied + AR + NR + 9 Heavy + BM doesn't add up 
---
Would you like to call him "Absolutely correct" instead of an idiot now?
---
This has been happening way to often with my sneak character.   I'll shoot at something and see a chunk of its health drop only to see the health bar rebound and give it back a third to half of the damage I had just done to it.     This doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough.       This had happened in the past but appeared to be fixed until last week when it decided to make a reappearance.
---
Sorry but I can make way more than 40 per batch easy. Max Ammosmith &amp; Super duper nets you so much more.
---
Plus, I feel like the reason you guys say it’s so “hard” to collect materials is because you rarely play the game enough to know the grind spots.
---
I could EASILY get enough mats in one days to make 65k rounds of ammunition, and even more if I go super sweaty with the grind.
---
(This is not to say that the 900 guy is innocent, I just feel like it’s mostly the weak casuals fault for thinking getting such stuff is hard.)
---
Check your resolution again. I had terrible problems until I figured out my game was trying to run at like 4K...
---
No clue how it set itself to that. I put it back to 1920x1080 and it was like butter. Maybe a bit crustier around the edges though.
---
I don't think you should be able to learn the mod, but maybe get one of the mods from the stars that you can then apply to a new weapon.  Probably not a 1:1 ratio either, maybe have to get 1 of low tier stuff, 2 of higher, 3 of highest to be able to apply it.  So scrap three exploding guns of a particular type gun to get three mods to add the mod to one.  Learning the legendary effect itself would be too powerful.
---
The funny bit is that I know all the mods for the arms (through scrapping what pieces I've found), but I don't know all the mods for legs or chest despite building and scrapping the hell out of those bits.
---
Wow, if the turret wasn't there I might not be able to tell it was a camp!  Very nice job, any pics of the inside?
---
Just started a Negan character last night. All I've done is spend 2 hrs on the face, lol.
---
They should ban the game, it's the biggest cheater! LOL
---
Depends on ur perks and gear really, if u can get over to white-spring without dying during a nuke just tag glowing ones, you don’t need the kill to get the exp, you jut have had to hit it 
---
I dont play as either but fwiw I've heard heavy guns are not much fun as the weight to damage ratio is kinda bobo. 
---
Shit...I didn't know i was wise lol...
---
That's why I never built a "nice" camp. Went for efficiency and that's it. Honestly I could care less about a fancy camp in 76. I'm too busy exploring this huge map to worry about my camp. I've got water, my crafting stations, a bed, and an instrument. I don't put locks on it because I don't care if you use it. 
---
This.  Two server types.  PvP and Co-op.   No slap damage.  PvP'ers want to be immersed in conflict and nothing kills that immersion like someone else immune to PvP.
---
I don't know why they added a fucking slap precursor.  So dumb.
---
Great to hear that you are that entitled. Nevertheless: shut up, [Scrap All Junk] is extremely easy to fix, it's just that someone has to prioritize it enough. The effort to actually fix a bug like that is so negligible that it should have been mandatorily included in the current patch.
---
Could be a glitchy item it happens sometimes
---
Prove your bullshit number or get the fuck out.
---
Oh, you can't...
---
Ps4 it's easy enough to video scrolling through the error log.
---
Maybe your rig just sucks balls. Throwing out 1500 is hyperbolic. You doubled down on an exact number like a smarmy little cunt with absolutely no proof to back it up.
---
Someday you'll walk in on your girlfriend with a mutual friend going balls deep on her in your bed and you'll just offer to go get them some takeout. 
---
I agree - I’n not asking for a mansion, but give me enough freedom to play around a bit.
---
Oh and give me some of that silver stuff or whatever it is for schooling you cuck. You got wrecked bro, so you got to pay some respect.
---
Even if they aren't contesting it, and without flagging the attacker? That doesn't make sense.

---
Duping would be binary: 1 makes 2, 2-4, then 8 ,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,etc.
---
Its very innefficient at 1st, but very efficient in large numbers. 
---
I have no idea what the actual process is (and dont want too), but i gather that they would want to maintain high numbers (not just to sell) but to continue production. Thus making high numbers an easy to recognize sign. I seriously doubt that just numbers is all beth looks at. But i also doubt they would give away exactly how they did it. Why did they say "over 30 days"? I have no clue. And i dont care. I seriously doubt that that was the be all end all deciding factor in their decision. But i am almost positive it wasnt so they could add up all the dropping and picking up and swapping, etc that some are getting hung up on.
---
Maybe it was just to muddy the water and confuse people. Or maybe thats what the banned dupers want. Either way, its working. (On some)
---
There hasn't been any actual proof of regular players being banned though. Everyone who says they have been always fall back on the "I didn't dupe, I swear! I just didn't!" Cheaters falsely claiming they didn't cheat doesn't have to merit a response from BGS.
---
You still selling those screw?
---
I really hope to get a TSE handmade. I haven't been farming hard though.

Just looked through it don’t recall seeing plans for a modern couch where would I find this

I've tried fighting her twice, first time she dropped nothing and second time she disappeared at 10% health. Not worth the time.
---
The game works out the maths all squiff.
---
Thank you! Currently the insider's a bit bare. Still need to learn a few more recipes before that'll be fixed
---
Looks good, buddy
---
That's crazy.  What if you want to show up at an owned workshop and help with a defense mission?
---
Because to be honest you went from reasonable and IMO correct to bratty and ignorant in one comment, which completely detracts from the original points you made and instead makes you look salty, if we're being honest. I'm defending if anyone YOU here, buy at the same time criticizing you for your poor attitude when it came to being right. 
---
Auto stim armour uses diluted first, any auto stim perk does tried and tested right arrow uses diluted first too
---
Update.
---
Thank you for the well written post yes the hate alone has made me not want to come back to this game between being called a cheater by Bethesda with no proof and people on the sub when I just try to tell people the response I have gotten that there is no time frame in action for any fix to get any suspened account back to playable.
---
I’d like to formally thank everyone for the quick responses, all the positive feedback definitely sealed the deal for this game!
---
As far as something else that sealed the deal for this game, was the genuine love for the game from the community is clear! Your guys passion really makes me want to just go and sink hours into this game and join you in flexing my hours proudly! End game for me is the close friendships I end up making, and then doing content with those people, and judging from this community it seems safe to judge that I too will be in love with the game!
---
As far as my previous fallout experience, it’s hardly anything, my brother kind of ruined the games for me by spoiling the endings so I never really got the chance to indulge in the plots/storyline and enjoy the game. So basically this is the first fallout I will be playing, so I don’t expect the world, and as far as adventuring goes, in Skyrim and Oblivion, I explored every nook and cranny I possibly could so, I do enjoy a good adventure and little dungeons all over.
---
I’m not supporting EA; and activision is quickly becoming another company I will refuse to support, for many reasons that aren’t on topic.

Apex Legends is just another “EA” title that’s currently in the limelight, and If my curiousity about this game so late after release doesn’t tell you anything about me, then I’ll be blunt, I’m not a sheep that follows the flock, I’m not a fish that goes after the new shiny things, I’m the hawk flying overhead surveying things carefully and then going after what I really want,

TLDR; I’ll be playing fallout 76 on ps4 hopefully tomorrow if it takes forever to download! Thank you everyone for your quick responses as well as the time to respond to me! Your passion and love for this game makes me feel very welcome to this community! 
---
&gt; some people don't want to just "function fine".
---
Well that's just "too bad". There's no reason to eek out 10% more damage when you're destroying end game content except for your own satisfaction. There's no point in getting that 10% early, you're just robbing yourself of a goal. Nothing is .00000001% rng. I've only got 250 hours played and a fair bit of that, probably about half of that is leveling up toons. So between my toons I have maybe 125 hours of farming and I've gotten tons of badass armor and a few nice weapons. If you get a nice piece that you don't want or need you can trade that pretty easily.
---
&gt; high level pvp 
---
lol I hope you're kidding. There is no high level pvp. No one pvp's end of story. The only real pvpers moved on to a different game or are waiting for pvp servers. All that's left are people who grief and people trying to prevent themselves from being griefed.
---
No one needs specific armor pieces. Armor, for the most part, isn't really that important or useful. Every build can function properly inside PA until they get the legendary armor to make not wearing PA viable and then they can make the switch. It's not even hard to get good armor, the game throws that shit at you like candy. It's good weapons that are the issue. I've got a full set of unyielding/sent, unyielding/cav and unyielding/f/d/c weight reduction for my melee toon and it was all self found.
---
Yeah. 
---
Just not enough people on their team with multiplayer experience. 
---
You should be in their team.
---
Oh plan 😑 i Dont think u can get that plan for most armour 
---
1. Your late to the game on this.
---
2. Microtransaction abuse is a major issue with the industry right now.
---
3. You're new to this forum aren't you? Players have been pissed off over the microtransaction content happening and patching either not happening or being flubbed hard by Bethesda. Specially when most of that crap was free in Fallout 4 but now they're charging.
---
4. One can like this game and want it to be successful, AND criticize the crap out of Bethesda for trying to scam us all over. Repeatly. If the game fails, its not cause of some YouTubers. It's cause Bethesda f'd up and didn't make it right.
---
This is the wise guy who once told me about this in person.
---
Leave ants out of this
---
this will not stand, this will not stand.  this agression against tubas
---
It was always 2.
---
I don’t think the tuba would fit
---
I decided on both. better than switching cards around.
---
heavies are great for single, distant targets. it makes minced meat out of SBs. they kinda require PA, though. and shotguns make crowd control trivial, nothing like blowing a swarm of ghouls to giblets. that's why I "main" both. being on the str tree and not requiring specific mutations like twisted muscles help.
---
by themselves, a .50 cal *can* mow down groups but it can get messy. and with a shotgun you have to wait for SBs to land, although you can try crippling them. it's quite effective, actually.
---
where slot
---
Shotgunner it will cost u far less in repairs and ammo.
---
Isnt there a Responders bot in Grafton?
---
Can i idle for let just say 4-5 hours and put my character to sleep? is it possible?
---
GT? 
---
Thanks, friend! 
---
Hey nobody, go watch some Overwatch porn. 
---
I've had a 3 star "vampires hardened hunting rifle" for a while now.  Bullets explode, 50 damage resist while loading and gain health regen when you hit an enemy. 
---
Both times no one was present and the workshops were clearly abandoned
---
What plans spawn at fort defiance?
---
Okay how is it people can build big bases yet i can barely build a small base with a small amount of crops?
---
Your missing a vendor faction. There are 7 total so u should get 1400 total less your travel costs
---
bye felicia
---
End game isn’t the big raids or what comes after the storyline for me, it’s hanging out doing stuff with friends, that’s what’s fun for me.
---
Funny how everyone wants a fair trial in RL but the internet is fair game to peoples speculation and BS meters....
---
Yaguai meet jetpack and hammer
---
That's my base. Although I set mine up down from Vault 76 where there is a hiddenish pond. 1/4 of my space is water, rock, and a dock, so up in the air it is.
---
The things I would do for that Rifle. Sounds like a sweet head exploder!
---
Oh that's not a bad idea, I could permanently leave a campfire on a foundation next to it to easily remove them
---
With 3 level 1 rifle perks, I can occasionally 4 shot level 80 scorched beasts with my Calibrated Two-Shot Explosive Lever Action with VATS.
---
If I optimized for Damage instead of VATS/Critical with a Hardened Receiver, put on 9 points of Rifle Perks, bloody mess, and demolition expert, I would be surprised if I could kill it in less then 20 shots aiming down sights.
---
hmmm I sat in the flatwoods monster chair just a few months ago , im jealous as I missed two of those brochures :P
---
"You'll never see a server!" they exclaimed proudly, like it was a good thing. 
---
Fuck I need those
---
pretty sure i've never got that many hardened mass, thats the only one I really pay attention to. 
---
We don't know that that had anything to do with whatever script or detection method they are using to identify and flag people for suspension. But feel free to test it. Get 10000 or so rounds of ultracite ammo (I'm told it's super easy, shouldn't take you more than a few minutes). Then drop it and pick it back up a few dozen times. Let us know if you get a suspension letter.
---
You are so lost I cant breathe right now. Truth is the truth, I have blue screened a million times, and im on ps4. No one cares about PC players lol. Too wierd....wait you play pc dont you? Damnit I should have known, thats why your putdown sucked in both context and content. If you DM me I can help you with your bad communication problems which in turn will help your odd behavior. Seriously man, if you need some tips im willing to drop a little knowledge. Who knows, maybe ill run off on you and you will ditch this NPC mentality and you will be able to finally develop a social life outside of reddit. 
---
BoS leadership told them no, it was a couple that were discussing it anyway
---
Or, you can test it since you're so sure you won't get banned for it.
---
I'm just saying there are legit reasons to nuke a workshop
---
The 5 star legendaries are CRAFTED by adding special mods on 3*s
---
I agree the stagger frequency is high with these bears.
---
Madpipelayer
---
Over repair and mods would be awesome for this.
---
It's the damage bonus for melee only?
---
any thoughts on the panic room technique?  im working on testing it right now.  take a workshop, build a room within a room within a room to stay in, force the raider to become wanted by blowing through walls to get to you to fully claim the workshop.  giving u time to react or even server hop once they accumulate the bounty and spend their caps trying to claim it.  u get into the panic room whenever u see another close on the map or show up by temporarily 'replacing' walls with doorways only the workshop owner can run through as u never fully place it as a doorway, just back out once u run through.  i like u am interested in testing these possible mechanics so we can get something fun and engaging once its all sorted out correctly.
---
Thinking back, that's probably why i had no use for it: no plans. I think i'll spend some time crafting and scrapping tonight, see what i get out of it. Thanks for the inspiration.
---
Mine respawn alot, some just heal halfway through a battle.  You know....  Fallout stuff
---
Tapewyrm0, join you shortly. 
---
Grab yourself a quad double barrel. Highest fire rate and shortest reload time for the shotguns for the same ammo capacity. Plus has excellent accuracy. 
---
I already said I have sold it 
---
Its not just belief. There is a video that shows stacking of explosive bobbleheads up to six digit damage numbers, and shooting a player to test slap damage interaction. Done with multiple types of weapons, before the patch that changed fireproof, or nerfed TSE.
---
Not coming up?
---
"Yo bruh chill" Idk I always make it to the griefers before they make it to me.  The personality types vary.  Most people are easy to be buddy buddy with and join there team.  On the other hand i met this guy with open Mic on and from what i heard on Mic , he seemed like a very troubled, damaged dude, lashing out at people.  i wouldnt know how to deal with him if I wasnt already on a team with him via a mutual guy on our friends list.
---
The knockback might be too much in succession.  It probably doesn’t have diminishing duration but should.  
---
Look dude, I get it, you are young and used to dealing with children, but when someone who's not a child insults you you don't lecture them on how to behave, because we already know how to behave and it's because you are a dumb cunt that we started being rude about things in the first place.
---
Basically, I stand by what I said,  moron.
---
I’ll add you. What’s yours? I’m on. 
---
You have contracted ear worms... Angry birds theme is stuck in my head now.
---
Tapewyrm0 
---
Oooh the edge on that
---
Dupers have soured the game for me. Just never know about another players gear. So PvP is not worth it. It’s a race to see who can one shot first.
---
Damn that sucks.
---
What would stop people from turning off pacifist, go grief the shit out of people and then turn it back on making them immune to player inflicted damage?
---
I've got this, but something has changed.
---
Currently cannot see Mothman assets in shop or mothman shop items purchased in the workshop mode either.
---
I’m looking for the letters, maybe I’m just too ADD but I couldn’t see it haha
---
Bear arms. -90% carry weight for big guns
---
That won’t work simply because those achievements are shared with all characters. 
---
I wanna join the not a cheater party too! 
---
Anytime I see someone on the map with a bounty over 300 I immediately block them. No time for that nonsense.
---
I tried to avoid that, but even the 2x2 foundation got hard to place sometimes, so capital "T" base it is.
---
(Though I do use walls and a roof, too.)
---
Noice!
---
I'm a sniper so it was a dream come true to find it. Decked it out and silenced it and never looked back
---
From a pvper perspective. It's very interesting, keep in mind that many pvpers avoid being wanted, those like myself that like pvp, but hate to grief would most likely just walk away, as the engagement would be too costy lol. Mainly because the purpose for raiding is junk and caps.
---
A wanted bounty eliminates the caps purpose, and the garrison most likely indicates that the workshop owner stashed the goodies away. A griefer however would dig in.
---
Then again, a concrete base, the indestructible one would be something to consider here lol.
---
Yeah, I had one kill me with one swipe before when I was around level 60 in excavator  armor, level 45, he was level 65.
---
Yeah it got really bad after a patch a month or so back. It's one of the reasons I stopped playing because it's so frustrating. I've been waiting to see them fix it so I can try again
---
lol
---
I went with 40 because most ammo types craft in bundles of 12 or 20. Max ammosmith bumps that to 24 or 40. Ammosmith and Super Duper do NOT stack. And are you easily gathering the mats to make ultracite ammo? Because that shit takes more than lead and steel to craft. 
---
I'm heading over there now bro, those green bastards are gonna get some.
---
&gt; Duping would be binary: 1 makes 2, 2-4, then 8 ,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,etc. Its very innefficient at 1st, but very efficient in large numbers. I have no idea what the actual process is 
---
Yes, clearly you don't. That's not how duping works. It's not literal binary duplication.  
---
Secondly, even if you were right, you don't need to keep 100k of something on hand for duplication purposes. Who's going to buy 100k Ultracite ammo at once? Maybe you get someone buying 10k Ultracite ammo, but not often. It makes no sense to keep ammo on hand in those numbers.
---
Ah gotcha, plans can drain a cap stash dry in a heartbeat.  I would love to see it when you have it all finished!  
---
Thank you!! Saving this post. :) :) 
---
I have found Grahm around Sunshine Meadows a lot. I know his path goes by the Mothman museum area, Camden Park, up by Morgantown, and way northeast by that Red Rocket workshop. He generally follows roads and railroads. Sometimes he will shortcut offroad, but not for long. Hope that helps. :)
---
Hi...Asshole here. Although I dont do the murder lowbie game I am an asshole. I can assure you we are still here. So gimme the drugs I scream at you for and you will not be bothered again....or until I need a fix again
---
What stopped griefing cheaters from stacking bobbleheads and one shotting people who wouldn't engage?  
---
A patch of an exploit not considered.  Here is the evidence of an exploit to consider prior to deciding how to implement a change 
---
Yea. Cleaning them out makes no sense, otherwise there would be vendors the next day or two with caps remaining.
---
Their eyes too. I'm a Sniper with VATS limb targeting. I typically drop them in 2-3 shots if I stay hidden. 
---
Just get better at PvP. Bethesda is actually doing the right thing here.
---
Apparently. 
---
I have what your looking for. A furious mahogany baseball bat wrapped in barbwire. Level 45. Does 98 base damage
---
Or both get the under attack notion upon entry, allowing for either workshop owner or attacker to engage at will, rather than giving the option to the attacker alone.
---
Wow you must be awesome at parties
---
Rad x, just pick a weapon that isn't boosted by any other mutations and compare the damage before and after suppressing your mutation 
---
I’m a blue eyes white dragon, while your just dark magician OOH!.
---
If you're going to get it try to get it on sale.... I would even try to haggle the price down too. This game isn't worth $60. Its basically half of Fallout 4. Though  I admit its still kinda fun, but I think most of that is the exploring and playing with friends.
---
Get rid of the turret they honestly serve no purpose and eat up a lot of budget you can add more details to your camp
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/ujUdrdpX7Ok5W/giphy.gif
---
Absolutely! I'll make sure to make another update, once the inside's complete
---
I found one from 94 in a raider cage in one of the ski resorts (if memory serves).
---
I found another one (don't know from what vault) in Harper's ferry on a couch near a bunch of chems.
---
light metal arms aren't a rare plan, just look around Top of the world and other plans spawns, don't pick up anything if you dont want it, then server hop ...
---
What I've been looking for FOREVER is the sturdy and heavy metal armour plans. Seriously, haven't ever got the plans drop on 3 toons and 200 ish hours =(
---
&gt;There's no reason to eek out 10% more damage when you're destroying end game content
---
it's more like 200%. there's a huge difference between a regular and a legendary builds, especially when fighting end-game mobs.
---
&gt;except for your own satisfaction.
---
I thought that was the whole point of a game. enjoyment.
---
&gt;There's no point in getting that 10% early, you're just robbing yourself of a goal.
---
subjective. and it's not early on, it's forever, because...
---
&gt;Nothing is .00000001% rng.
---
you're wrong. I can prove it, mathematically. the odds of rolling a specific 3\* (otherwise known as a "god roll") are less than 0.000001%. let me know if you want the specific numbers as I'd have to bust out a few tables.
---
&gt;I have maybe 125 hours of farming and I've gotten tons of badass armor and a few nice weapons.
---
personal experiences aren't arguments. took me 700 hours to drop an explosive shotgun, for example.
---
&gt;If you get a nice piece that you don't want or need you can trade that pretty easily.
---
people won't sell high tier gear and want something equally as specific for trade. so if I don't have their god roll, I won't get mine.
---
&gt;No one needs specific armor pieces.
---
that is simply not true. someone in full assassin/sentinel will *always* have the upper hand.
---
&gt;Armor, for the most part, isn't really that important except for niche scenarios. 
---
like pvp?
---
&gt;I've got a full set of unyielding/sent, unyielding/cav
---
congrats, you beat the rng. just keep in mind you're a tiny minority.
---
You're arguing an advantage for someone with a reset in the middle of the day. But there is no advantage. Now that person has to waiting the afternoon for the reset.
---
Where as the guy with the reset in the middle of the night can log on any time day or night.
---
The only advantage I could see is if the middle of the night guy has vacation plans or something.
---
Im on xbox1 lol
---
Don't you remember when it used to be three and a half?  Things have improved since then.
---
My chasis is ready. 
---
What building set is that wall? I haven't seen that.
---
I would prefer one pool of 1400 or more caps. Maybe a certain cap limit for level progression but not needing to fast travel everywhere.
---
Level 1-5 200 caps
---
5-15 400
---
16-29 600
---
30-35 800
---
56-40 1000
---
41-45 1200
---
46+ 1400
---
That's a good point! I have noticed how particularly useless it's been against attacks recently
---
I almost \*always\* use only sleeping bags in my CAMP, mainly because I usually go for the "tiny house" builds, and they're a *lot* easier to place in tight quarters.  As long as it's been on a foundation/floor, I've never been diseased from sleeping on it.
---
If you're in a team and one member of a team has a workshop, once that workshop is contested all party members of both original and contesting teams are flagged for PvP against one another.
---
Two shot gaitling gun is the best
---
I would like if they just fixed the loot lag at SBQ fights so I didn't have to wait ten minutes for quest credit. and getting credit for actually killing her in the challenge menu would be cool too.
---
Definitely looks like that. With the right settings they don’t even need dedicated pvp servers and didn’t have to nerf the heck out of legendaries. They could have easily given Pacifists a green icon or green crosshair color so that those who do PVP will only challenge those with a red icon or red crosshair. Right now it’s just a giant waste of time and energy even for die hard PVP fans. 
---
What if they’re in sentinel armor?  Finally the counter has been discovered!
---
I'm not going to say I'm the most prolific programmer but I do think there are some valid complaints about the way things have been rolled out. I do not think the BETA was long enough to uncover significant issues. I am also curious about how much testing happens in their closed Dev environment not the production environment. It feels like they're relying heavily on production to polish the final product. I do agree that time/patience needs to be given to the developers. People throw too much shade in this community.
---
Might I suggest changing your center roof piece to an additional slant piece and then put a wall of 1/2 barn wall windows in the gap? Might give it a little architectural flair. I really like your build
---
You do know, some people are mistakenly banned for real. Right?
---
Nobody should be in advantage.
---
And the defender already is ,since he can place everything he wants.
---
Good, be condescending to someone giving you advice while also trying to maintain the moral high ground by belittling them. Good luck in life when you grow out of that middleschooler mentality man, you're probably gonna need it. 
---
Ok, so like IRL photo/video dude here. I like this a whole lot, and I love photo mode in general.
---
Its probably the last thing they're going to patch, but I wish photo mode was less clunky, and remembered the settings from your last photo (like an IRL camera does).
---
You’re entitled to your own opinions. 
---
I’m just saying that the reason this and precious creation engine games are big and well funded is because they command a large audience made up of multiple tribes that enjoy the game in different ways. 
---
If you make a game that appeals to a more narrow audience, that’ll come back to you as less grand projects with less investment capital, and smaller games. You’re welcome to agree or disagree, as well as form an opinion on whether that’s a good or a bad thing. 
---
funny because it happened to me. and I wasn't in a team or owned a workshop.
---
even post nerf/patch some people dealt considerable damage, enough to force me to use a few stimpacks.
---
oneshot or not it requires reworking imo
---
OOF
---
Hey do you use the targeting hud for your PA? I was getting disconnected from nuke zones, mainly the queen, I took that mod off and it stopped.
---
Yeah, it really shanks the low level players who can't make it to Whitesprings or Watoga. It was my main beef until I hot level 60.  Up until then, I just checked all my extra junk, ammo, chems, etc in the woods at my camp because I couldn't sell my crap for another day.
---
I use heavy guns. It’s a blast. The weight is a problem but I have a mirv and auto launcher that are 3* with one being 90%weight reduction. Plus a bloodied 50. I don’t even use bear arms. 
---
/u/Ladydevan
---
yes..i do not have access yet to the enclave bunker sorry forgot to add
---
I'm being condescending? Me?
---
Seriously, go the fuck away child.  
---
I dont have any issue with PVP, WHEN I want to engage.  Not everyone is prepared for it and neither is everyone wanting to do it all the time.
---
Another real problem right now is that PVP/Survival servers have not been clearly defined.  Will it be a BR format on smaller map sections?  Will it be exactly the same but no-one is allowed Slap Damage before deciding to retaliate?  If the latter will the level balancing be addressed(AGAIN) so lower levels can neither be griefed by higher levels nor grief higher levels as a result of shitty imbalance?  
---
*Survival mode* in any other game makes enemies more difficult, rations harder to come by, and less carry weight so those rations cant be hoarded.  To call it survival mode and allow it to simply be *survival of the fittest* WILL cause the entire game to fail.  More time will be spent patching the new problems on the separate servers and the original game than on fixing and creating new content for ONE game.
---
Oh yes, that's a good idea. It's always been a part I've wanted to improve on. Thank you! 
---
No. Make new god damned content.
---
Well that just isn’t how it works, they simply imported the entire code from fallout 4 where it didn’t matter how crap the data was and bodged it into fallout 76!
---
I sure would like to see them hold up their hand and say all this data problems are ultimately there fault and they can’t fix it so we should move on and work around this issue. But they won’t because no one has ever fucking held up their hands and explained that the development cycle just doesn’t allow for solution to these sort of problems and believe me even titans of the gaming industry have the same sort of problems. 
---
both my pump and my .50 cal weight about the same.
---
Just your perception OP, they are still around 
---
Someone defending their base should be in advantage always, in any real world war scenario, the defender almost always has the advantage, for obvious reasons.
---
So what if you can place anything you want? How does that help you? Turrets are garbage and a waste of materials, if you can be taken out by a turret then no one is worried about you attacking.
---
Healing factor can be lived with out honestly unless yoy wanna max out mutation perks
---
Ultracite ammo is definitely harder. I was never into making it due to the constraint of having to farm nuke zones. Although, I don't think it would be too hard to just put on the double plant perk &amp; just pick flowers for hours on end.
---
Although, even if you spent every day doing it for at least 12 hrs a day for 30 days straight.....you would barely be able to make at least half of what that 900 hour guy got.
---
It really is..if you want defense use the punji boards they are much better and make sure you lock everything 
---
It would also extend more plan-learning goals once the stuff currently possible has been learned. 
---
... Yeah, you are. You're assuming anyone who disagrees with you is either an idiot or a child. While calling another adult a child. If you don't understand how that's condescending you may want to step away from the computer for a while. 
---
I know nothing about coding, except for some visual basic way back in the day, so I'll never act like I could do better but I just wish the game would have been tested more before release.  I don't blame the developers, but it was obviously shipped incomplete to be on time for Christmas.  
---
Let’s face it, we do actually need enemies in the game that are still scary. Being OP all the time gets boring. One of my most intense moments was an Enclave event at this hotel that was all Yao Guai, all different kinds, from glowing, to scorched, to crowned. I had to constantly be in the move and it was great to be afraid of them.
---
Apparently people were able to do it by not shooting the person (which would give slap damage) but stack bobbleheads and shoot the floor near them which wouldn't give slap damage because you technically didn't hit them but would still have enough damage in the explosion radius to kill them. I'll also just add I never killed or got killed by anyone this way nor witnessed it be done, just what I have heard from people making claims.
---
Breaking news from r/floridaman
---
"Florida man injures hundreds after someone shot his tuba; Thousands killed in rampage"
---
It’s spelled P.E.G.G.I.E. 
---
Yes it does
---
There's literally a several months-long content expansion coming next month. 
---
Defeating a Yao Guai solo nekked is the end game 
---
I recommend sg for now maybe try heavy after they get some much needed love. Plus an added point of entertainment. Slap on enforcer from agility and run around knee capping ghouls. They just roll around on bellies growling at ya. Same for deathclaws. Everything else shoots at ya still lol. 
---
I run a heavy weapon dude. It's fun but it's a constant struggle keeping him in ammo. With bear arms most weapons are less than 1 lb some of the mods can put em over that but mostly are still lighter than rifles.
---
Adrenal Reaction. Even for non-sniper builds, the negative effect is so insignificant there's no reason not to have this mutation.
---
That’s a good approach. 
---
Alternatively, keep scrapping them with a chance to learn the legendary mod, until you learn the mod, like scrapping armor for mod plans. 
---
Yea exactly like if you walk on someones workshop PvP is enabled instantly. That way if both want to be friends they still can, but the option to cap them is there all the time.
---
Banned for having to much ammo lol Bethesda is a bunch of scumbags, i have bought every elder scroll game, and fallout no more i'm sorry this is simply unacceptable , good riddance gives me a good reason to not buy the games anymore on principle, sorry but Bethesda you have gone to far what a joke this i've got 20k ammo stopped playing the game first week i got that just from the ammo generating plant this dude has 900+ hours, i only had like under 40 this company is becoming a joke.
---
&gt;Currently the game is loosing players like crazy.
---
Citation Needed. Don't bother though, given that none of those numbers are public.
---
Yeah pretty lame.
---
TSE 50 cal could get up to like 4k damage per shot.  
---
I do think it **needed** a nerf, but it got gutted instead.
---
I never said he didn't you came to that conclusion on your own. When Destiny 2 released there was a big stink about how people were getting banned over using Discord overlay because the game thought that it was a 3rd party software. Well Bungie came in a few days later and said "No, every ban was not automated, it was hand done because these people hacked and cheated during the open beta" and the numbers came out that the "thousands of people getting banned for Discord overlay" was actually only about 300 very vocal individuals lying to get unbanned. Is that to say that everybody who got banned in 76 is guilty? No. But we have to not take the side of the first story we hear then clog our ears to anyone who counters that story.
---
I do not have enough fingers and toes to count the number of times mods have implemented features that the official game devs said were "impossible". And let's not even get started on unofficial bugfix mods.
---
Are you using T-51 armor?  It only works on T-51. 
---
Because what it is has not yet been defined, every player(or groups of players)in favor of PVP Servers/Survival Mode has a different idea of what it's going to be.  Of the above there's 4 different ways it can turn out.  Based solely on that, 75% of players in favor will be sorely disappointed and/or dissatisfied and it will fail.  BSG should DEFINE what they intend to release.
---
Nah, I'm assuming you are an idiot because you are persisting, also because of the original, also, fuck you, you really don't know when to quit.
---
As Valseek said its coming out tomorrow, there's also the first Fallout 76 stream on the official channel at 2PM EST for those interested. Its like they're planning something, hmmm ;) 
---
System.out.println(“Does this belong on r/iamverysmart?”);

Our chief weapon is melee, bobble heads  and melee; two chief weapons, bobble heads, melee, and ruthless metagaming! Er, among our chief weapons are: bobble heads, melee, ruthless metagaming, and near fanatical devotion to the Overseer! Um, I'll come in again...
---
It should auto flag non-team members for PVP when they enter the zone. That would balance the offenses current advantage. I’m while I’m sad that my days as the undisputed King of Hemlock Holes is over. I fully support balanced workshop PvP. Some of my favorite fight are ones where I had to sneaking to the workshop to take the place. 
---
Can-Do + Every Whitespring Garbage can = fed for life
---
I don't see why people who want a workshop wouldn't just server hope to an empty one.  The whole taking a workshop thing seems redundant to me.    I only claim them to complete the quest then leave it.
---
Ok, well just so you know it wasn't 4 star.
---
A martyr in the good fight
---
"*In the embrace of great Nurgle, I am no longer afraid, for with His pestilential favour I have become that which I once feared: Death.*"
---
It’s a post apocalyptic setting. I wouldn’t casually approach someone’s fortified location in that situation unless I was desperate for supplies. 
---
Bruh on the money with this
---
It's really fun and you get tons of play time out of it, just always bugs to deal with.
---
They said in another thread it will be released tomorrow instead
---
adrenal reaction + nerds rage perk + adrenaline perk + bloodied explosive rifle and low hp = around of 1k damage
---
and to that you add a stealth attack + critical = game broken
---
if you're trading with your mule, you aren't dropping it on the ground so someone can possibly steal it. 
---
you're in the trade window.
---
Reverse engineer.
---
Actually maybe you’re right, I got a two shot Gatling from that event and it was a level 40 not 50. Well looks like level 62 ghouls are still the fattest chance for legendaries. 
---
If teams weren't limited to 4 people, sure. Sometimes I just wanna show up and get some free plans for helping out.
---
This won’t work against the fat man raider I encountered day one of Patch 6. 
---
Bingo. 
---
I noticed this just after the patch that added it. I bought a plan I thought I already knew, as soon as I tried to read it the known tag just appeared.
---
I think it's anytime you learn something without having actually read a plan. Like if it was a quest reward and and said something like "you can now craft xxx". Guessing the known tag checks for some flag that gets set when reading a plan but that flag isn't set when your given the knowledge rather than a plan.
---
Fair enough
---
Open the vaults! 
---
Ultracite ammo isn't just picking flowers. It takes pure Flux to craft not raw so every craft takes all the nuke zone drops and ultracite. So that's hours farming bloateds for masses and fluids plus ultracite ore and acid in huge quantities.
---
Sound fun buddy, too bad I'm on Xbox.
---
&gt; Not sure what your fighting me on here we are basically saying the same thing,
---
Because you were essentially justifying the 20 hour cooldown as a good thing, which I disagree with.
---
&gt; With a static reset you get the option to do your run a little sooner, but you still gotta wait for for the daily reset, where as the 20 hr timer forces you to log in at a similar time each day.
---
How is that better for the cooldown option? It basically forces you to not play for periods of time.
---
The static reset time is no real advantage to anyone. You either do one run every 12 hours at best, or 2 runs effectively every 24 hours (Once just before and once just after the reset) So no one gets any advantage at the end of the day. But with a cooldown that resets if you come back too soon, it is possible to have that cooldown never end by coming back 2 times in a given day since there would be no stretch of 20 hours for the cooldown to complete.
---
I had forgotten about the hardened masses from scorched. (I haven't played FO76 since Dec.)
---
At approximately 9.6 hours per day spent on this game, 900 hour dude needs to put his game down, step away and go da fark outside.
---
Only way we're aware of to get 4\* is to add the sacrificial blade.  Any others you are thinking of?  No way to get to 5 yet.
---
The only one embarassing themselves is the person purporting that they can read and then failing basic reading comprehension. Aka you
---
I create new character to build new bases. Each time I settle on a location one, I start another. Currently only have three as I’m using #3 as a team specific C15 with a mobile base. 
---
I lol so hard whenever I think back to that reveal
---
that, and he was banned before the general ban wave went out. 
---
Yeah I have the same experience. Even when doing it with my friends my friend will stop shooting and go "I'm not gonna waste all my ammo on killing her". But dude... if you're not shooting her it means the rest of us wioll have to shoot her more to compensate, now we all have to waste more ammo so you don't have to...
---
I have a 40% swing speed, suppressors baseball bat, forgot what the last effect is though
---
Also stalker weapons are no longer working as they should. No 100% vats  and I'm at 100% full bar getting 3 and 4% accuracy shots on enemy's I'm hidden from with chameleon armor and clear line of sight on.
---
That's the best you could come up with in 5 hours? It's sad that you clearly had to google the definition of "purporting" and still used it incorrectly. 
---
I recall three games that were interesting enough that I spent many an hour attempting to get them to work, rage-uninstalling them in frustration, and then installing them a second time because I forgot how bad they were and then rage-uninstalling them a second time when they again reminded me how horrendous they were.  They were the original Outpost, iMagic Destiny (no relation to the Bungie franchise), and X-COM: Interceptor, all from the 1990s.
---
I have since become *EXTREMELY* selective with my game purchases, and the last time I was memorably burned was in 2012 with *Doom 3: The BFG Edition* having written 140 chapters of fan fiction for the original 2004 version (*FHD Remix* trilogy crossed with anime series *Haibane Renmei*) and very likely topping 900 hours of play time in the process.  I recognized instantly that the entire fault of the problems I was having with *Doom 3: The BFG Edition* lie not with the developer Id Software, but the new publisher they had just signed on with.  I have been very carefully checking labels and web sites since then to make damned sure that I never purchase anything else by that publisher.  And yes, that translates into having never once booted up a Fallout game, a situation that will never change.  I'm here because this thread lit my Youtube circles on fire and I happen to have a Reddit account.
---
I just wish you didn't have to make bulk plastic to bulk the other mats first
---
You will definitely see varying results. For example, stash plans are semi-rare randomly appearing on vendors it seems, even more is the signs and letters.
---
Keep stealth boys and berry mentats on you at all times. If someone wants to play dirty then take the mentats ( it will put a purple aura around all living life, except the chameleon glitch but most people are using stealth boys ) then you take a stealth boy yourself so they cant vats you, get a good distance away and hit them with a fully auto weapon while having tank killer equiped ( for stagger incase theyre running sentinels ) good luck out there 
---
What system you on if you’re on PS4 I have a couple of the electric plans for the mr handy
---
Why not pass your time doing something useful.
---
he posted an ammo making guide, he said he had time to write it after he was banned.
---
he posted the guide before the ban wave even happened. he was already banned before that. 
---
No no no
---
Try the two vendors in pleasant valley (station and resort?. I think I saw one there.
---
Shotgun with enforcer perk is the best way to deal with them. Stagger them before they can get too close and if you have two or more don’t aim just hip fire to get the maximum spread and try and stagger all of them. 
---
Its a slight advantage at best and i'll explain.
---
In a 48 hour period, the person with a static reset, could login before reset do their dailes, have the game reset and do their dailes again. They would be able to do two days worth of dailies in one play session.
---
With a timed reset you have to do your dailes in two seperate sessions 20 hrs apart from one to the next.
---
The slight advantage being, with a static you can do 2 days worth of work in 1 session.
---
I always keep extra and get excited when new vault users come out. Fast travel and give what I can even if it's just food and water. The occasional beer hat or plans, recipes.  
---
I was super worried that I was going to get banned for something like the amount of 10mm ammo I have.  I almost always use a baseball bat so just have loads of ammo.
---
If you're on xbox I can build you stuff if you're missing plans. I have a lot. Not everything yet tho. 
---
No positive effects on adrenal rn on my Alt I'm holding off till next update. Glitch kinda sucks.
---
Better solution would be to just up their caps supply
---
Seriously I'm overflowing with expensive aid items and valuable junk. If I'm "earning" that much more shouldn't I be able to sell it?
---
&gt; you must be crazy

---
Not putting out decent DPS in a fight that only requires DPS means the character is flawed
---
I managed to build a nice 3 story camp. With SOME cool stuff in. I'd like to add more but I don't think I need it halved over again. 
---
You are not the only one, it seem because you don’t learn these through a recipe it does trigger the flag but if it annoys you no end you can always buy and use said recipe, which will then flag it from then onwards.
