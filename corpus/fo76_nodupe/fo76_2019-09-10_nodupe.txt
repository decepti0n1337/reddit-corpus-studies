There's a small dog on a cliff were a couple skeletons are holding hands. I believe there is even a video on youtube about it and it's location.

---
You do not need that much stuff on you at all times, it's that simple. You're playing the game wrong, this is a consequence of that.
---
Ditch what you don't need, which is likely over half what you have, at least.
---
..... mate they always put free stuff on the atom shop on a Thursday. It's been like that for Months.
---
I didn't miss anything, just empathizing with people who did and also recognizing derp for derps sake. Bethesda realized it was dumb and responded, good for them.
---
Would want a fire sword (Shishkabob skin) to slay dragons or at least heal my friends.
---
They refund that stuff sometimes
---
You're a weird dude, I don't know what else to tell you.
---

---
"Die Hards."
---
Yeah that is essentially what I've heard too. I almost went into saying how I've heard it will apply... but I am going to avoid spreading potentially bad information haha I completely agree that it could be a good thing for the game though. I'm hopeful we will see a wider variety of builds that are perceived as viable. I think it could be excellent for the economy as people wont only be seeking bloodied or junkies weapons.
---
Lighten up

This is a sub for an M rated/PEGI 18 game...

Someone just launched a nuke with success (PS4), maybe it‚Äôs fixed?
---
Me too ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ that I almost went into how it‚Äôs applied but was like naaaaaah
---
Maybe a Zetan Ray Gun for a radium rifle skin.
---
Would love some more normal stairs and banisters to match the contemporary building set
---
My house looks rather odd with an industrial metal staircase protruding through a large unrailed hole 
---
Also double sided walls please and thank you Bethesda
---
see now if only if i were lucky enough to meet these high levels im level 103 and anytime i see someone whose high lvl or has a bunch of legacy weapons they always one shot everything not sharing the loot or xp around quite a sad life DX
---
Killer-Soldier1
---
Thanks everyone! Will be checking all of these . Let me know if you have any for sale ;)
---
Im enjoying this few day long break. Getting in for the scrip event but other than that im out until the 15th
---
As a pure plasma user
---
Mama Murmgh despises my guts
---
Playing the game wrong? My dude it's an RPG.... Not everyone wants to do a bloodied/unyielding/invis one shot build. 
---
You can't really play an RPG wrong, it's a role playing game? You play the role you want?
---
Thanks. I signed up today and got it working.
---
Thank you!
---
I‚Äôll add you right now
---
Even the arena fights in nuka world were 10x better than the ones in watoga.
---
"**Gunsmith**" and .50 Cal. I fix it literally once a week or 2.  
---
Energy heavy weapons are made out of chinese plastic in Fo76
---
It‚Äôs only 3 items ammo converter, chicken coop and lunch boxes
---
Non legendary guns and armor are essentially worthless, don‚Äôt store them, don‚Äôt ‚Äúsave them,‚Äù if you aren‚Äôt using them scrap it.
---
Remember to bundle excess scrap and sell it to an npc vendor.
---
Exactly. I would be curious in seeing screenshots of what op has in their inventory and how they are using it. Or some explanation.  I haven‚Äôt been over encumbered in idk how long. And I run heavy/PA as well.
---
so been hovering over reddit today and yes its bugged for everyone and that it should be fixed sometime during tomorrow according to bethesda so hold on to ur cockals lads we might get some nukes in after all XD
---
250 incoming damage (about as much big damage as you'd ever take in a hit in 76)
---
300 armor = ~53% dmg reduction from armor = "~2.13x HP vs 250 dmg", i.e. you can take 2.13x as many 250 dmg hits before dying
---
600 armor = ~64% dmg reduction from armor = "~2.78x HP vs 250 dmg", i.e. you can take 2.78x as many 250 dmg hits before dying
---
900 armor = ~71% dmg reduction from armor = "~3.49x HP vs 250 dmg", i.e. you can take 3.49x as many 250 dmg hits before dying
---
They're saying the % reduction might not look like it's going up much but the actual effect is still rising in a linear way.
---
If the incoming damage is even lower, then the reduction effect is even more. So slow big hits like Yao Guai or Wendigo will wreck you harder in a slow swipe than an equivalent swarm of nibbles even if they should have the same dps.
---
Gotta be careful what you say on reddit lol get downvoted into oblivion.
---
Athena and the travelling merchant can arrive at the same time, really makes the place feel lived in!
---
That's awesome!
---
They did, quite a bit of free atoms. And for why they complained so much, man, fuck if I know. Lol
---
To be honest,  76 has been marked for trolls since release.
---
Some people who hated the idea of the atom shop even existing raged at the idea of anything being available because it wasn't technically "cosmetic" only and screamed how this was some sort of great sin and how everything should be available in game without spending money.
---
Which is why they started developing the score system so things can be earned in game... Now those same people are complaining about no longer having free atoms to buy items in the atom shop they said they never wanted to exist in the first place. 
---
Moral of the story, most the people on this sub got dismissed as entitled whining twats and beth now mostly only listens to people on their own forum and have a much smaller presence on reddit anymore.
---
What is vault steel used for?
---
Nice, I will add that to my arsenal!
---
Its just fun. Nothing beyond tat. Same as looting others stuffs. Yes. I m delusional. Otherwise won't b playing this game. :)
---
I quit doing uranium fever because of it. Small enclosed area and it's rare that everyone shares the legendaries and it's frustrating.
---
Then enjoy your slow moving, poor resource management,  hoarder character, sounds great fun...wading through syrup :-)
---
Tbh, I was thinking that it might have had to do with a function to control npc spawn and prevent overcrowding or something. I say this because around release, Whitesprings had a really bad issue where there would be areas where the bots were overcrowded. Sometimes there would be at least 10+ Mr.Handy's or protectrons stuffed behind the counters inside. The worst case I encountered was out by the service entrance, there were at least 20+ Mr.Handy's that suddenly all aggro'ed on me for no apparent reason.
---
Going to be able to make three time the amount of ammo will help a lot.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm just not playing the game after I completed the legendary run I stopped playing less and less and I just haven‚Äôt played in three days I think a lot of people are tired of logging in everyday to complete it without other content to do
---
Solar and thorn armor which is legendary scout armors with a set bonuses, as well as the strangler power armor.
---
Solar armor when you're at 50% health or more, you and your team mates heal.
---
Thorn armor has both a stealth bonus and reflects melee damage.
---
Strangler power armor is Ultracite with an AOE effect around you.
---
It takes 11 Vault steel per armor piece to craft any of it plus a legendary module unless you're crafting strangler.
---
I usually hit Earl and the SBQ for scrip but can't launch nukes at the moment. I've got a few characters near max scrip but hoping to farm some more if the silos get fixed. I would like to get a decent tenderizer from Mumbles.
---
I have 1000 scrip ready on main and four alts.
---
Going for 3 star god rolls with all of them.
---
Vampire, explosive .50 cal, there is no need to carry anything else.
---
Well, except perhaps my vampire, explosive, faster reloading Gauss shotgun...it's a closer quarters beast.
---
Just be sure to slot Demolition 5  and the perception  perk which doubles explosive area and Fireproof 3 to keep from blowing to yourself up.
---
I also was 13 years old at one time...
---
Lol I probably deserve it. Honestly didn‚Äôt know there was an event or that it was anything special until I saw all the reddit posts about it
---
nice.  I have an alt i just started but only level 5.  Mathgbe next sale
---
I've found faster fire rate out dps anything with the explosives effect on bosses like the SBQ or Earle. Explosives is great at tagging multiple weaker enemies though.
---
Also, while speaking of that, Mothman eggs sell for a buttload of caps, especially if you have the Super Duper perk maxed.
---
And nothing but the best is how we roll.
---
I‚Äôm sure they know but probably don‚Äôt care or ‚Äúbusy fixing bugs‚Äù
---
With healing factor. Without healing factor I don‚Äôt have it at all.
---
Ah ha, perhaps!
---
Some mods you had to find the plan for the mod, it‚Äôs probably that
---
Ahh ok. So say you have 15 base luck and take a max rank legendary luck card , you would still be capped at 15 luck as far as perks go, but your pipboy would indicate youre at 20?
---
If a low level or anyone else is suffering, I suggest they find a game they like. No one needs to suffer through a video game.
---
Probably has 1k gunpowder on him min :-)
---
How does radioactive food spoil anyway?
---
Hell I spent a ton because I found somebody selling it at 5 caps a round.
---
I've got two characters I'm hoping to get a bloodied 25% ap reduction fixer with, only lose 10 scrip whether it's 2* or 3* so no biggie there. And a level 9 to roll for 1* unyielding pieces so I can boost other characters to 50 for the next sale, just wish I'd done that sooner.
---
have you checked the BOS vendor at whitesprings?
---
Yeah, we have automated collection equipment for quantities of pure, delicious, rad-free, disease-free H2O, and still I have to go down to the stream and (slightly) irradiate myself to collect some nasty Brahmin sweat (with my hands I guess) then boil it down to half volume every time I make my corn soup.
---
YOU JUST MADE MY DAY! OPENING FIRE!
---
The way damage per shot performs against armor in this game is really interesting and makes for some great gameplay decisions, and some dps red herrings. I just wish there were Tank Killer for shotguns.
---
I haven't crunched the numbers on how DR and ER interact with damage reduction sets and perks like sentinels, assassins, etc., but my intuition is telling me that you're multiplying things with increasing returns, so you'd get even more increasing returns, which is probably why those modifiers jack up the price so much. If someone can point me at a good rundown of how they work I'll look into adding them into the spreadsheet.
---
When you're talking actual health versus effective health, actual health only gives you better survivability against burst damage, like getting stunlocked by yao guais for a few swipes, but doesn't help in the long run against enemies like Earl since you end up popping the same number of stimpacks to maintain your health. Unless you're running Vanguards - if you have high enough actual health, taking a big hit from something will still leave you in the range where vanguards is somewhat effective, so subsequent hits feel its damage reduction as well until stim's heal-over-time can do its thing. 
---
Last time I played ESO there was an equivalent to Bolstering but not Vanguards, but it was unpopular for tanks because healers tend to keep your health topped off. Tanks would also typically invest just enough points into heath to survive the biggest boss attacks, putting the rest into stamina or magicka so that they could maintain their buffs better. (I kind of hate combat in that game, I'm not crazy about practicing a rotation... FO76 is way more fun for me).
---
Well I do enjoy the game. This is one of the most interesting reads I have seen. It also reminds me of slot machines at casinos. When you play, a little game within the machine rewards you with flashing lights and ringing bells and whistles. But, if you look at like winning is how much you win in money. You're losing a little at a time. But, you don't notice because of the visual prize in front of you. Neat stuff.
---
If you decide to build there (and on ps4), we could be neighbors. üòã I'm at the little pond close by. Far enough away to not cross camp areas too.

id say maybe but at this time only your psn or xbix equivalent are being display so for now i wouldn't worry

Yeah same thing happened to me with the red rocket jumpsuit
---
Bethesda level dialog options. Cool.
---
not 100% but also check the enclave bunker
---
Posts like these... You were right guys
---
Make sure you are scrapping the correct lasers. Ultracite weapons have their own mods that have to be learned separately. Scrapping regular Gatling laser will not unlock the same mods for the ultracite version.
---
But I do not get any info that they are aware of such issue at least...
---
fi gu ra tive ly
---
i see that you take the game very seriously. I see no harm making other players enjoy the game a tid bit more.
---
Whats your level? I doubt is far above 50-75 range.
---
This is the one FO76 PC mod which is truly, life-changing and irreplaceable.  It so nice, so easy, works every time, makes life so much less annoying.  It‚Äôs so good and so seamless, I forget others don‚Äôt have access to it.  
---
I guess maybe the only other mod that is close to being that good is the one that lets you actually type in the number of items you want to buy/sell/drop, and how many caps you want to sell for in your vendor.
---
Draw me like One of your  French girl.
---
It doesn‚Äôt even have to be as deep as that
---
Just the ability to do little things like finding a spot and casting out for a bit adds so much more depth to a game like this and gives it a better feel
---
Also brilliant for people who RP
---
The free item is a "no mic" emote. And it worked just fine for me when I claimed it.

Is smallAsainChild the name of your discord account? If so there are four numbers that come after that I need as well in order to send you the request.

An elevator would be awesome.
---
They know but don't care enough to fix it. The guns have been around for quite a while now and nothing has been done. Even people reported with video don't get banned for using them.
---
Bro you just responded to someone that you are carrying 18 fusion cores with you. That's it, your inventory has poor management, it's on you, not Bethesda. I uss a Heavy/PA build too and I have never struggled with weight because I am constantly selling my garbage and whatnot
---
I do it alone and get 500 screws. I fail the event thou because of time
---
Guns don't level.  
---
It's just rng.  
---
Not level.  
---
And with vendor machine, it's even easier.
---
Hating things don't make them false, dude.
---
It‚Äôs not hard to miss the problems on this game at the same time if they do bait them I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre just banning a burner account I doubt those sellers are dumb enough to be doing it on their main
---
Why limit it to two?  Using the PC mod, I have a ‚Äòstandard‚Äô loadout for quests/low-level events, a ‚Äòscrapping and repairing‚Äô loadout, an ‚Äòoh shit‚Äô survival loadout, a max damage loadout, a CAMP-building loadout, a power armor loadout, and I still have half my available loadout slots open because I‚Äôm lazy.
---
It is spelled ‚Äúfeature‚Äù, not ‚Äúbug‚Äù.
---
I had JUST logged in last night when someone was already at my machines and seriously..... inviting me to trade while I was in my stash trying to figure out what to scrip for the day.  They had crouched right in front of me real slowly trying to get my attention.  I just fast traveled right out.
---
"Food in backpack last longer" Intelligent Bethesda game design right there.
---
I won‚Äôt lie you aren‚Äôt missing much, it‚Äôs pretty shit and all it does is insult you
---
No more score to grind = not that much reason to play.  Sure, I could grind for bullion and scrip, but I‚Äôve got 90% of the legendary armor and weapons I want , and those grinds will always be there.  I used to play daily and it kind of sucks that I don‚Äôt have a reason to log-in right now.
---
I think the difference is 414 ER  vs. 266 ER, which is pretty big, and gets multiplied by the assassins damage reduction. If you're running sentinels, cavalier, or assassins it's going to multiply the damage reduction numbers and make what you're getting from armor rating increasingly more effective.
---
I try to just gunbash them, but someone usually one shots it as I try to, meaning everyone thinks I did it!

Can‚Äôt compete with FO4 mods for settlement building.

That's when I'll start playing again lol
---
Oh, the usual pipe wrench, golf club, pool cue, guitar sword. You know, the strong stuff.
---
I agree. I understand their drive to sort of incentivize coming back daily. I know what engagement means to a company with an asset like this. I've worked in areas where engagement meant money and know the push.
---
During normal country good times missing something can be annoying but we sum it up to welp that's the game. With this people are sitting here choking on ash from a fire or worried shopping for food could kill them or someone else. There's a TON of stuff on our mind. Having a nice little surprise in a game waiting is so refreshing. It's almost like you had a shitty day, see a $10 bill on the floor and you try to run to it and the wind picks it up and pushes into the sky.... One of those "just my luck" scenarios.
---
But I also don't care about upvotes. If you're not bitching with hard core rhetoric you typically don't make any headway. I just wanted to paint an embellished picture of how the mind of a player may be rn.
---
Why does Bethesda even make announcements
---
You know that's a close best in slot sniper weapon right? Could probably fetch max caps for that pretty easy. Mine hits for around 2-3k headshots.
---
Thats cool n all, but im on ps4...
---
Count me in as one of those.  Played during the B.E.T.A. And maybe a few weeks afterwards before I rage-quit due to PVP griefers, constant server crashes, and the unconscionably low stash limit.  Been playing the last 6 weeks or so and its like night and day.  Still waaay too buggy, still a lot of little things that could be (rather easily, IMHO) improved or fixed, but the game is actually a lot of fun now.
---
Yeah but are you seriously saying someone with 2000 hours of play time doesn't have more chances/rolls/time/caps to get god tier weapons than someone with 100 hours?
---
Ah ok. I just have SS armor
---
Steel etc was possible IMO but cork? LOL I really dont think there was enough players and enough cork in all the players inventory lol let alone the donations.
---
Ill sell you 15 caps if you gove me a bloodied lighthweight explosive gatling gun.
---
Mule piece! Oh. Wait. SS is non transferable. Carry on!
---
Lol, that is my overall goal in the end...  try to launch enough in one area to recreate the glowing sea
---
I can't help but draw the conclusion that shotguns are emphatically doing so bad in their normal state then because of how the shot is spread up into so many little hits. I also wonder if Armor Penetration % is applying before or after the damage, likewise Damage Reduction % and armor.
---
And haha, well, I effectively have free and infinite stimpaks, but not infinite health, and outside of the raw math, damage reduction is just a ball in the juggle between shooting and getting hit and being able to slap on the stimpak before I die, so I would consider not dying a critical part of considerations for dealing with incoming damage, that's what I mean. Being given half a second more for the stimpak to apply seems like an essential equivalent to being able to take that one more hit (in order to use the stimpak in time), as we don't have dedicated healers in this game but ourselves, half the time in a stagger when healing suddenly matters most.
---
A logical person!
---
Always get a secret service jetpack chest for any build, but I recommend grabbing some thorn armor for a sneak commando.
---
Solar would work well for a vanguard vampire build.
---
Hey I have a beautiful camp with Murgle.
---
No, it‚Äôs flawless

---
See not having a specific build will bite you but it‚Äôs doable if there are decent players alongside you, just make sure you get enough hits in on Earle to get his loot and have many many stims 
---
Once you‚Äôve done the event a few times you might get the cursed harpoon gun which can practically one shot the wendingo spawns in my experience 
---
I highly recommend finding yourself a specific build whilst you‚Äôre still around level 50 because it‚Äôs not too hard to level up and with the next patch the game will get a fair bit harder for those who aren‚Äôt specialised, will also make boss fights and events far easier
---
Give me some credit. I‚Äôm exactly 2x the high end of that range.
---
Amazing idea! Absolutely love puzzle and game camps! Flamingo Hunter has been my favorite so far, but this may well have just overtaken it. üòç
---
I do!! You're only ever that over encumbered for a fight like Earle or SBQ, and you have enough AP to move during the fight and recharge while you stand still/move slow and release salvos. The rest of the time that you're not in PA you're quick af because you have so much AP and AP regen.
---
Then dont do it mate. dont sell crap, or  "rare" for absurd prices mate. I see someone selling a somewhat ok weapon for literally 30 K and he was actually asking for 55 K, he said i should come back with an alt account and and buy something 25K worth from his alt. LOL.
---
He had 28K+ so i went there aand bought the thing, I lost 30 K, I dont care, its a game, i will make in a week at worse. But he gained less than 2K for that silly bloodied weapon. And I gifted it to a friend... I remember someone asking for LEGIT 100K for an apparel, that couldnt be repaired LOL why? "its super rare mate" lmfao
---
Sorry that's my gamertag. I'm not sure about the discord
---
I bet there is a new ban wave in the works seeing how there was a new code of conduct.
---
Traded for 2 great rolls for me. We both walk away happy
---
Yeah, I have an alt I've been building, and leveling with him takes like 5 minutes instead of a solid hour of doing any event I can find with as many INT and XP buffs as I can muster.
---
So we can ignore them, duh!
---
Nah
---
I was actually able to catch this one. I‚Äôve been working a lot of overtime and on my day off decided to play for awhile... I was surprised there was anything for free on the store.
---
Some recommendations based on experience.   Valley Galleria and Grafton Steel are great for this.  No stealth armor/perks/chems/mutations.  No Berry mentats.  No lights on helmets/pipboy (negotiable).
---
again, we're no longer in 2018 at launch. forget that nostalgia, it's over. rewards, events and accessibility is way different now then it was back then, you get event notifications onscreen and got told what to do. also they updated the event rewards a while ago. and everyone who is playing for a month or longer is having enough stims who drops them regularly. Again: \*WE\`RE NO LONGER IN BETA\*  
---
people who complain they don't get ammo or junk are lazy idiots, simple as it is.
---
Wouldn't it affect players who use more damage multipliers (junkies, bloodied) more than players who use fewer? Like (2x2)=4 (2+2)=4. (2x2x2)=8 (2+2+2)=6. The more numbers (multipliers) you add into the equation, the larger the gap between the two. This is an incredibly simplified example and I'm not saying you're wrong, this is just how I have understood the change.
---
I checked there and that‚Äôs just where it was!
---
[Here ya go](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipe2es/thank_you_for_putting_the_bos_collectron_up_for/g4kydre/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
With Fo76 being as cheap as $6 or as an addon to other games/hardware, accounts are cheap af.
---
Those that sell this shit use burner accounts, so banning those will not really help.
---
As for upvoting... that doesn't help either because beth doesn't know how reddit functions. They MIGHT react if something ist posted over and over ad nausea, but most of the time they choose to ignore the playerbase.
---
Would you like to switch servers?
---
Smash that accept button
---
Thank you, me and my buddy have already came up with some ideas but those could work as well and ive already given the berry mentat issue a thought.
---
My heavy gunner is always going to be over encumbered while in power armor, Emergency Protocols thankfully means that she is a tank and doesn't need to move much!
---
I just give up on the carry weight perks when the suit goes on and max out the damage.
---
No one gets information from beth, they do not communicate, at all.
---
I was lucky enough to get on right before it was removed, I was very surprised to see that it was only up for a very short period of time. Hopefully they put it back up so everyone can get it
---
Do you have a discord account? Asking as im used to discord more than reddit.
---
No because it was working fine before, now it's not. Why would it be fine when I logged out, then an issue when I signed in 5 hours later with literally no changes?
---
It's at least somewhat heartening that they at least let you keep ownership of your mod and you're licensing it to Zenimax. I was worried they'd try to be sneaky and take ownership. But there's still plenty of time, so we'll see what happens when mods really hit the game.
---
Time to farm some flux.  But seriously, stay safe.
---
I'll be pretty straightforward with this. There are specific points across the entire map in which the "foundation property" quest item can spawn whether you have the quest active or not. There are actually numerous spots(I believe it can be any of the areas that the thief spawns at) the items can be found. Even if, for example, you are searching for the turret control board, the multiscope can spawn. 
---
When you have the quest active, if you loot the "correct" item off the raider(even if it is a junk item), it cannot be removed from your inventory even if you die because it is marked as a quest item. The reason why the other property can be dropped is that it has spawned in but not as a quest item. Picking up the "other" items(I believe any work) while the quest is active will progress the quest and allow you to finish the quest, even if you don't have the "correct" item that Ward had asked you for.
---
That would be pretty awesome.
---
Why wouldn't you drive your corvega? Oh, if only...
---
It wasn't a community effort, this BOS thing happens regardless of what we donate. The cake is a lie.
---
This is exactly what I'm saying! Right now my suit is moving like molasses regardless of carry weight until I put on Bandolier.
---
Thank you :)
---
A turret seem to always turn on a players when repaired. Seen this many times.
---
She does look like she's posing on a couch.
---
What's Flamingo Hunter?
---
We did get the pleasant valley claim tickets so it‚Äôs possible. I would love to see this for the Golden Holotape as well. For Appalachia to be a powerhouse of automation it doesn‚Äôt really feel like Bethesda allowed it to live up to the hype.
---
To be fair, the 50 cal hunting (aka ‚Äòsniper‚Äô) rifle has such stupidly low damage, slow firing rate, and small mag size, its a waste of time.  It would be fine if just the damage were made more realistic.  In reality, you could probably shoot through tank armor with one of those, but in FO76 you‚Äôre maxed out at what, 97 dmg, not counting perks?
---
Grrr! Were I on console, I would use my Wookie Skills of Wonder to defeat thee! Hope you guys have buttloads of fun!
---
It would be too expensive to get r.kelly in to the game

Id say one gun army was great when you could cripple the sbq, against anything else I'd end up killing it way faster than it would take for the crippling/stun effect to be of any use
---
I know man
---
Switched from Xbox to PC halfway through so lost half my legendary run items (which I‚Äôm not too fussed about) but couldn‚Äôt pick up the brotherhood items which as a big brotherhood fan makes me a bit sad
---
so were almost every other event with multible enemy spawn. leader of the pack, path of enlightenment, scorched earth, arktos pharma, etc. etc.... 
---
the thing is: uranium fever is low lvl, so why are people still complaining? it's like the Fasnacht sloth. i just don't get it how someone could be +100 and still butthurt for his one chance of a 100% useless item.
---
Awesome! Thanks for checking. Guess I‚Äôll take that serum now!
---
It's gotten to the stage that my stash is half full of random trash 3 star legendary pipe pistols just waiting to be scripped. It's shit because it means I have less room for actual important stuff like scrap. Just remove the cap please we beg
---
I got rid of healing factor and have not had the fast travel bug since, so I am convinced the bug is related to that serum/ weight reducing perks and am not going back to it anytime soon.
---
Excavator and calibrated shocks will help you.  A lot.
---
sometimes after respawn,,,, it takes a minute for all the WR to register, until such time, you may crawl.
---
I‚Äôm an Elder currently In the PKOA,&amp; I like the free states better then anyone In the game realistically,apart from maybe the next newest player I‚Äôm able too help.
---
It‚Äôs not really about the mission of a specific faction,as much as It‚Äôs a ton of dope people from a variety of ages,playstyles,backgrounds,console/pc,with the desire &amp; compassion to help one another &amp; have a good time doing it.
---
Some of us know you can't lose the item, but you didn't need to burst his bubble, he was so excited!
---
Keep having fun man!
---
I have wanted this for thee longest time. I make a lot of food, especially things like Mystery Meat Pie &amp; Fasnacht Sausage, Cranberry Cobbler - foods with added benefits. I end up just dropping off a lot of it at random camps, but I'd love to be able to sell it. 
---
If they would put a 'frozen food' type vendor in the atom shop, I'd be all over that puppy.
---
Feel free to take my idea out for a spin!
---
It is a mod for a specific under armor. You have to first craft the suit itself then mod it. Iirc, I believe Graham sells casual under armor plans.
---
Why can‚Äôt you just crawl to a vendor and get rid of the shit? Not like you really need it all? I have a friend who runs the same build and is always at less then 200 unless he just finished a Earl/SBQ fight. 
---
If you can‚Äôt store it you need to manage your inventory better. You do not need all those weapons and armor that you ‚Äúhope‚Äù to sell/trade/script one day or the 1000 steel in your stash box. There is no reason with a little management that you cannot have space in your stash and on yourself to play the game. 
---
It also might be beneficial to look into adding some type of weight reduction perk card or armor piece to your system to help reduce weigh. As 20% may not seem like much, but when your weapons weigh 20# a piece. 4#s could easily equal almost 40#s in savings its only ten weapons on hand.
---
My camp is there right now; love that spot. Had to murder a level 110 this morning for attacking Murgle.
---
Since getting a gauss minigun and plasma Caster I've given up on ballistic weapons, I have more than enough plasma cores for every day use, and am trying to build up plasma cells and ultracite 2mm ec cartridges. Am holding off crafting any more for now though as we're so close to legendary perks.
---
Mark my words, they're going to bring it back listed as ATX
---
i had something similar happen with the water purifier on a new character i made a while back. i could never figure out what happened &amp; i couldn‚Äôt build it for a long time then i logged in one day &amp; all of the sudden i could. still not sure why it happened though or what i did if anything to fix it.
---
cry around for some scrips? really?
---
just serverhop a bit around whitespring station or wait after scorched earth and check the loot bags. people trash junk legendarys anyway, also there are WAY better ways to get some scrips then uranium fever.  
---
again, i don't get why people are crying for a single low level enemy.
---
It use to be called survival mode. But they ruined it by marking the "top three high scores" It's only pvp if they could find you ;)
---
People will miss it again, just watch.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Waiting fixes the issue for me most of the time.
---
When it's the bug where you see the countdown timer pop up then quickly close, that one I have to move around to clear the bug.
---
Hopefully not :(
---
This one's brilliant like, big fan hahaha
---
I know, I‚Äôm just saying that if modders can do it within the FO76 code, and make it work, for free, Beth can easily do the same thing.  The fact that they don‚Äôt, but keep coming out with more broken Atom items every week, says all you need to know.
---
Nwith the current theft glitches around at the moment it isn't safe to accept trade requests anyway.
---
Well, they're only alive at all because they resented how the other Raiders who stayed behind in '76 were psychotic assholes who maimed and killed (and some ate others) with no regards for anything to the point of getting their own selves wiped out. Literally when the Scorched came and all the factions were trying to fight them, the Raiders stabbed them all in the back, and then the Scorched fucked them.
---
Meg and them are alive because they just wanted to be left alone and were exiled. The other Raiders mocked the hell out of them and now they're dead. Harland McClintock, the original leader of the Raiders, was ousted by David Thorpe for not being ruthless and savage enough. David's fate and all his people who followed him? You end up popping them as a no-name pack of Scorched on some inconsequential quest. Remember that? Whatever Margie McClintock and her "Diehards" did so wrong, surviving long enough to return isn't one of them.
---
Although the irony is, Meg was about to kill you and "kill her way" through the Scorched plague just like her predecessor even as you tried to give her the inoculation, so I can't speak for that dumbfuckery. Regardless, it's either the Raiders the way they are now at Crater, or no Raiders at all. I do wonder why the Blood Eagles haven't succumbed to the plague as nobody is sure as hell handing out My Blood Nukas to *them.*
---
Agreed. But deep down I know I'm just going to get rolling pins and wood armor...
---
cool, so being a crybaby with a lot of support melts you'r consequent behavior of ignoring the community. 
---
now what about hackers in nuclear winter, what about erectus dupers that are a thing again, what about all these bugs and glitches we are STILL facing since the very first beta?
---
Totally! I would love it if they modified the Eat-o-tronic wall machine for this purpose.
---
Hahaha. No problem dude. Have fun in the game
---
That one I totally agree with,  especially if a pack of lowbies are there.
---
Burn down the wolves, complete the event, and let the new guys get a shot at a good weapon.
---
So does high level "content" its colder then the fridge.
---
Since they came into the game this happens. Stops you from reloading or using a stimpac. Some people saying zooming into sights works, others shoulder bash but all that works for me is to holster then bring it out again. As it doesn't benefit you in any way I doubt there will ever be a patch
---
But were you getting chases by a man in a red dress and chally the moo moo mask... no and im pretty sure that is far scarier than being killed.
---
worked for me last night using last weeks on pc
---
That makes a lot of sense, thank you!
---
Hilarious. This subreddit is inhabited by people that would rather hide the truth than listen to real advice. Stop downvoting people that are posting legitimate advice and correct information simply because you don‚Äôt like it.
---
You can likely get keys for this game as low as $5 on G2A (during Fallout sales). Bethesda would be wasting far more money going after people and wasting their employees time to ban a $5 account they‚Äôll just buy another of.
---
If they cared they could literally run a database script to look for the items and remove them from the players completely. They don‚Äôt need to waste their time playing police officers on eBay. It‚Äôs absolutely idiotic I have to point this out.
---
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

Snorting carbon precipitate on the other hand, might actually cause cancer if some of those carbon nanotube studies are true.

Dont wait till it hits 3 to bug out. Better safe than sorry.

I always rock stinging, heard somewhere the AA is somewhere around 30-40% so I figured it's worth the lost of those two shots.
---
It‚Äôs just under 317 days of gameplay, so unless you‚Äôre a diehard fan with a Nuka Cola branded shitbucked from the super duper mart I doubt anyone has it
---
Aww, I‚Äôm hoping to get married in WV too! (I‚Äôm in a neighboring state). Where are you getting married?
---
If I want to PVP, it‚Äôll be in Red Orchestra 2 or something, not FO76.
---
My merry band of idiots and I do this on a small scale. We quite like Morgantown Airport as higher levels because one of us sure as hell hasn't been in there in a while lol. Tyler County and Camden have good hidey holes too!
---
Gold paint, so you can have double arches.
---
Lol
---
Sorry so are you asking how that gap changes between the current damage calcs and what the PTS shows or how the damage changes between different legendary prefixes on the PTS?
---
4 Flamingos hidden around the camp, within decorations or environments. Usually have to pick a lock to start, then shoot/destroy something to find them, to keep it entertaining and draw attention to the base via Bounties.. Each is tagged with a single digit, and numbered as to which order they should be entered in. Use the code on the prize door, and boom, you win!

To be fair a Mr. fuzzy with a Wiffle ball bat(Me) trying to kill you is not much better.
---
I did it 1 on 1 at whitesprings and accidentally hit a robot not a good time I do not recommend.
---
Wait is the sale live? I thought it was tomorrow?!
---
I'll agree as someone who only has the proper time to play a couple times a week.
---
If you use VATS, faster reload to reduce AP usage.
---
Tf? The people at the Crater respect you and are unique. The people at foundation are stupid and always complaining. I only go there because the gold machine is outside.

Portland‚Äôs looking the same, welcome to the wasteland! ü§ô

If you can get your hands on a good flamer its worth it. I have a 3* furious flamer mod out. It can melt a regular wendigo in under 4 seconds. It does the more damage to Earle than any of my heavy gums. It does suck to be standing that close to him when fight him though.
---
Sometimes it glitches out and looses it's quest protection! Often for me it doesn't have quest protection until I server hop with it!
---
This is great, thank you! Totally missed this.
---
Trust me when I say the pink captain cosmos suit with the chally the moo moo mask is enough to make a grown man cry.
---
Done. What country / time zone are you? I'll jump on at your usual time and hook you up with some.
---
I'm all about freebasing humanity. A high like no other.
---
FO76 is more based on perks and damage modifiers. The best advice is to pick a build and stick with it until you are able to farm, buy, or trade for the weapons you want.
---
I suggest rifleman since the fixer is insanely powerful in the current meta. Pick up rifleman perks where you can and sneak around until you are able to find a good melee, heavy, pistol, or shotgun.
---
We are getting married in PA but check out Golden Anchor Cabins as a honeymoon destination in WV :)

im on ps4. im offline for the night though hoping to get tips after my gameplay today didnt weild much usefulness
---
Hell yes, I yearn for the day I get that pink corvega
---
I do use vats, and the FFR is part of the gun. The question is whether the AA bonus to the magazine outweighss the damage from getting to fire two more shots.
---
Just above the Harper‚Äôs Ferry tunnel, at the top of the cliff

La county and it's the same down here =/
---
Thanks for sharing this, bc I had that same feeling. It's really good to hear that there are still peeps out there who can be kind in-game. üòÅ
---
I felt the same way at launch, I think a lot of us did. But here I still am, 2500hrs later. Enjoy your time in Appalachia!
---
Unless your into that sort of thing...
---
Perhaps you mean; Leader of the pack?
---
Ad victoriam! Excellent field shots brother
---
LOL Yeah, that gets a bit more exciting for sure!
---
Double check tomorrow with the inside the vault article in case it gets delayed, as many things do...
---
you mean the cards when i level up, new to the lingo but im guessing those are the perks? ive been trying to get alot of str and per, but i still cant see enemies on my radar until im in "danger" ive been spending what i can on the gun ones, the weight ones, and the ones that make water/food better or last longer.
---
Enclave niggas: *yall are getting collectrons*

It‚Äôs such a different game from launch. I‚Äôm glad k came back to it.

Right so somethings you dont need to kill things.

Hrm they still haven't removed it wonder if they will ever get around to the poly fiber power suit.

But yeah welcome to the party people been busting in since Jan 2019.
---
Ok

Praise Atom! It's the only BOS item I actually wanted and I donated most of my cloth to get it! :(
---
Someone accidentally blew up a car by an Assaultron clear on the other side of the Whitesprings property, and aggro‚Äôd all the bots, I bet.  The first time I made it to Whitespring as a level 15 or whatever waaay back in B.E.T.A., that same thing happened to me...I was watching the bots murder some random ghouls and ignore me walking past, and after a couple of minutes they turned to me and melted me in less than a split second.
---
No you remember right. I have all five slots filled with the promise of being able to share legendary perks between them. Seems I would have been better off putting all 900 levels into one character now.
---
Not sure how I could've phrased it better but it is good to see people enjoying themselves. I think my problem was always getting frustrated about losing a ton of junk, whereas with the FP items, there's a chance of getting another without spending hours looting.
---
Wth didn't know that
---
Maybe at max rep, otherwise they're total dicks.
---
Is it really that different? I know they added NPC but idk. I burned out after getting to level 80ish after release.
---
Seeing how the bombs fell in October I think this should definitely be a thing. Youd think youd see more prewar Halloween decor everywhere
---
I'm asking about how dps has changed between the PTS and live server based on particular builds. I guess I inadvertently conflated builds with legendary affects, my apologies.
---
YYYESSS!! Take all my caps!
---
The legendary run burnt us all out!
---
Also a lot of demoralised players who couldn't finish it thanks to the auto complete bug!
---
On of the lumber mills in the forest has a bunch of robots roaming the road, if you wanna deal with the cultist spawn
---
It‚Äôs tomorrow, but I‚Äôm dreading my lack of stash space.
---
I suspect developers have little say on such matters.
---
Not cool. It means apocalypse time! Yay....!
---
You will it's only a matter of time before you figure it out.  Your feelings about different aspects will almost always lead you back here.  When you launched 50th nuke and gotten 20th assassin's shovel of uselessness or worse you'll wonder why you thought there was more.  Heed the warning there is nothing of value beyond this point
---
How did you get in???????
---
And how do I get inside the rooms with the hand print scanner in the Resort????
---
Please help me.
---
Wrong sub for this, unless you want the plans to have the plans just get someone to paint it for you. Most people will do it for free or at cost of materials.
---
Dam right.-. I don‚Äôt like the bos or any faction for that matter he‚Äôll I don‚Äôt even call myself a bethsheda fan but I agree that the feeling of being treated like a sucker is lowbrow on a team like this onto the community and is barely worth the excuses that flow or the bot / automatic recording of a help desk person from the co. I live IN THE BIG RED WHITE AND BLUE, gun Lugging beeer drinking ballzy god fearing USA I want to here a HUMAN‚Äôs voice when I contact people not a bot and for hella sure not a copy paste email. This is not how things get run. I served my country leaving the game behind with my wife and 5 daughters and I was happy to be home but hurt to come back to this. Tf guys we are all on one planet and yet stuff like this happens to everyone.-.

Yeah two ways the door glitch where it takes forever for everything to load and you can walk right on in and the clip the ceiling trick. Haven't really kept up if the PA wall clip works with it but probably does.   
---
We waited and waited and waited and nothing honestly thought with the election this year they would have activated it but I am sure it is just long forgotten by them instead.
---
Appreciate it!
---
Dont mean to throw dirt on you, But Ive been drowning in caps, ammo, chems, junk for months, reminding low levels that my waters, scraptron  are unlocked, drop them 100+ wood/steel, 100+ ammo of their choice, 10+ stims and radaways, drop them bulk fertilizer or anything i have too much of, in bulked so they can sell. heck if they are cool I drop them free mutation serums if they have starched genes. its just like 400-500 caps worth. Some insist paying, i dont say no to that, i give an average price, build them PA for few hundred caps, sometimes free. I mean Even if I didnt want to give, I have give so i can have space in my stash and I can run lol
---
I go to a vendor and within 5 seconds I sell 1400 caps stuff, and Im in Excavator PA with Calibrated shocks. within the past 600 hours i played, only the other day I ran out of 1 material. (I usually collect everything, overencumbered, slowly trekking few locations lol) now im back around 200+s of that material again.
---
No, dude, when I DON'T have full damage perks equipped (in the strength tree), and I'm not in PA, then I have fine carry weight and sit at around 280/355 on average.
---
The issue is that while over encumbered in PA (which is inevitable since it unequips all your % weight reduction armor) and with full damage perks enabled, you could still run until your AP ran out. This is standard for how the over encumbered system works on every player. Now, for some reason, my suit moves as if I am over encumbered and have no AP, despite my AP bar being full and actually going down as I walk around at a snails pace.
---
This game is not very good is the reason. There are so many better things in life.
---
Yeah, definitely cursed objects. Completely cursed, might crash you out entirely, yeah. You‚Äôd best let me take all those for you, I can get rid of them safely.
---
Yes, experiencing the same thing. I was farming stuff, and noticed someone had beat me to each area I went to, so at least 1 person is out there farming scrap as well. Other than that, map is pretty sparse. Hard to get people together for events, but that's not too new.
---
Assuming what people are saying is legit - taking a break due to burnout or some such.
---
Yeah, thats what Ive got right now, a furious handmade, and I‚Äôm desperately looking for an AA or Junkies one (I don‚Äôt think I can handle a Bloody playstyle).  It‚Äôs great if you keep having to hit the target, but those first few shots are...kinda sad.
---
Oh goodness no....stash then play, STASH THEN PLAY!
---
Cannibal?
---
What's the right sub?
---
Double the regular time which is 5 times worse than the good with salt perk level 3

800/800
---
no
---
Great post. It‚Äôs very refreshing to see you attitude about the game. ‚ÄúHave fun. You can‚Äôt screw it up.‚Äù Love seeing that, as a full health heavy gunner I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm playing the game wrong by a bloodied and/or stealth commando build.
---
SmallAsianChild6221
---
I have a discord and I'm new to both lol
---
Just use whatevers good, dont worry about gear till you're level 50. You'll be replacing and upgrading to new weapons so often as you level up its not really super worth it to invest in legendary unless you just get lucky and get one.
---
Focus on a cohesive perk card build, pick a weapon type or two and invest in those and use that. Like if you wanna be a rifleman grab those perks. ect. You can also respec post-50 but thats pretty grindy to do since you do one point per level post 50.
---
Halves spoil rate of the 15 food items in it.
---
It's useless
---
Thank you papa
---
Please consider in the future not requiring promotional items like this to be manually claimed by the player, and instead just automatically flagging it active for all players at the time.
---
What r the old codes
---
I usually lock only my collectron, and if anyone wants the pretty basic loot, feel free to get a wanted level :)
---
That‚Äôs what it looks like over here too üòï
---
I believe they've announced they are trying to fix the ammo converter in the near future
---
I just burned out and spent my monthly allotment of fallout 1st atoms to finish. Nice that you actually collect another 1000 or so in the last several steps
---
I have one gauss shotgun and one normal (although partial magic I think) - I like my normal one better.
---
Why did this get a downvote? It's true.
---
Ill add you right away!
---
Yup - there‚Äôs a raider camp set up near Harpers Ferry on a number of buildings - in one of the camp houses is a kitchen with what looks like a stash with ‚ÄúFreezer‚Äù stenciled on the front.  Not an active box, just furniture.  But someone at Beth was thinking about it.
---
Everyone who is complaining absolutely thinks the world revolves around them, or they are a child. I‚Äôve missed shit before and it sucks, but it really is not a big deal. There‚Äôs a weird sense of entitlement around this game, and I don‚Äôt understand.
---
Wendigo Spawns or Whitesprings
---
Wow, thanks!  Didn‚Äôt know this!
---
Thanks OP you the real MVP here
---
Thank you, but I‚Äôm actually referring to the four upcoming Legendary Perk Cards that add a percent chance to explode enemies based on which weapon type/card is used (melee, ranged, unarmed, thrown explosives.)
---
I'd say look out for the ACP is a good Idea just keep killing the Wendigo Spawns which inturn keeps the allies from being attacked.
---
added bonus a crap tonne of screws &amp; an ammunition for the weapon you're using.
---
In general the whitesprings or anywhere with charrlibois (charred feral ghouls) or anywhere with greenskins (super mutants) works well.
---
Ah I meant fo76. Good point tho
---
~~700~~350 atoms (50% off!)
---
should i stock up on plans i can buy from vendors for when im a higher level, or just take it as i go? im used to new vegas where 20 is tougher, level 50+ is unheard of mostly. plans are in players vendor stores ive bought some but not sure if i should keep investing in those
---
And concrete lmao
---
there will be mobs that do damage fire, and fireproof is not enough for fire in ACP nor dense
---
Fridges need to be free
---
They're working on it:

---
Oh ok, well bloodied will be doing about 1/2, junkies and will be at 4/5, berserker somewhere around that. The other balancing will be less but negligible and then everything is reduced for melee since str dictates melee damage, a fully powered str build could see their damage drop by half. 
---
But if you‚Äôre trying to figure out how much damage a weapon you have is going to do, google its base dmg or unequip any dmg boosting perks you have and check the base damage. From there all stats will just give a flat bonus based on base damage. 2x perks will just be +100%, +10% is 10%, etc etc. add all those percents together and just find what the % increase of your base damage and you‚Äôll know how much you will be doing.
---
It doesn‚Äôt get a server-wide announcement so you have to notice it‚Äôs happening.
---
I‚Äôd love to help ya lvl,exspecially now...while I know the you tag I bag technique.

Yeah let‚Äôs all just open our wallets for daddy Bethesda to bless us with more overpriced crap for camps that have no space for them. We did it reddit!
---
I saw someone with the pistol today. They were doing some decent damage to ghouls in radiation rumble. Pistol can't be that bad...maybe?
---
Probably buy legendary modules and try to get a good gauss shotgun roll given its a very decent weapon, if I somehow fluke that within a few days then I guess try for any decent roll as a backup weapon. I'm a simple man
---
Yes, the cards when you level up are your new perks. Pumping strength and perception is good, but try not to spread your levels through multiple weapon cards. 76 forces you to specialize more due to the cap of SPECIAL perk points at 15. Pick one weapon and stick with it until you can transfer completely over to the playstyle you eventually want.
---
76 works differently than previous Fallouts with enemy locations on your compass bar. Enemies will not show up until you are engaged in combat. That‚Äôs anywhere from defected to caution, with the exception being friendly NPCs. You can put points into agility to level up your sneak stats and use Escape Artist perk to quickly hide from enemies.
---
It should be the codes that were crossed off by Nukacrypt‚Äôs post.
---
Turn the corner at the motel, shoot the rad roach, grab the weights.  Enter the prison, shoot the Super Mutants and that one fire phlegm monster, grab the weights.  Enter Lucky Hole mine, shoot all the cultists, mine all the lead nodes, realize you‚Äôre low on acid to smelt the lead...go farm acid...wash, rinse, repeat.
---
Good with salt 3 makes food last 10 times longer and it's only 3 perk points
---
Carnivore, good with salt 3, thru hiker 3 allows stupidly large amounts of food and purified water to be carried to the point you end up selling everything that doesn't give carryweight or strength. I use glowing meat steak for hunger management
---
Events will sometimes reward legendary gear, and sometimes legendary enemies spawn in the event.
---
For events, it is good if you can join a party of people who are at the event. Don't worry about levels, only  A.Holes care about levels for public parties. Being in a party means you can get xp and loot from stuff you party damages.
---
So if there is an event with people there, even if you are below the recommended level, join it. You don;t have to land the killing blow to loot the body, just deal enough damage. A few shots should be enough if you are below the recommended level. Molotov's work well if you can toss them in time. Rapid fire weapons like the SMG are nice as you can put multiple shots in quickly.
---
Uranium Fever will spawn legendary enemies and normally has enough people so you don't have to worry about killing everything.
---
Line in the Sand, a XP farm event. If there are others at this event, JOIN. Focus on tagging enemies so you get xp. Legendary ScorchBeasts can spawn, but the focus here is xp. If it is a glitched version, where everything spawns in the middle, molotovs, grenads, grenade-launchers are good ways to tag alot of enemies all at once.

Scorched Earth, generally alot of people show up to this event. If you can deal enough damage to the 3\* legendary SBQ, you can lot her. Otherwise, being present should net you a guaranteed legendary for the event reward. If you want to help when underleveled, focus on raising people who go down and dealing what little damage you can. This is one of those times where heavy weapons work well for lower levels. This is because you do a min of 1dmg per shot. Need to break like 1000-1200 damage to be able to loot her.
---
He might if he doesn't like one-shotting everything. Yeah.
---
and a pumpkin speaker that plays music like monster mash?
---
So I‚Äôve heard,PC has a double edged sword,ya get all the turds/hackers...but ya also get some sweet cosmetic mods &amp; things of that nature.
---
I both feel sorry for you,&amp; envy you
---
I do know a few dope PC players who neither glitch/hack or grief,&amp; are generally great people.
---
I‚Äôm XBOX,but there are good PC players ARE OUT THERE!!
---
I promise
---
I've got two characters, one bloodied sneak commando and one bloodied PA heavy, love em both. It's nice to be able to sneak around and kill everything in a few shots, but there's always something special about just raining .50 cal hellfire down on a group of ghouls or standing toe to toe with the SBQ emptying a minigun in her face.
---
Sadly 6 slots are not enough for me and with 3 legendary specials and follow through and one for the team, no space for fire lining legendary.
---
I've got an executioners gamma I hold onto for just such a purpose
---
YES PLS
---
The fact that it makes no sense makes it *more* likely to be true, in this case.
---
punji traps and a tiger statue
---
Ya I'm literally stockpiling resources for ammo waiting on that perk lol
---
Correlation does not necessarily mean causation, right?  I mean, it still sucks balls, but it probably wasn‚Äôt the Atom store update.
---
In game vendors do black friday sales??
---
I was referring to the magazine mod that improves reload speed.
---
Either Piercing Magazine or Swift Magazine mods will reduce AP usage.
---
Aligned barrel and stock will also reduce AP usage.
---
Reflex site will reduce AP usage too.
---
And if it has an automatic receiver, that will reduce AP usage alot, but also reduce damage, so this is a trade-off you would have to think about.
---
lol sometimes
---
But how
---
Ez witch-hunting report
---
Oh my mistake
---
The cause is from firing off shots too quickly. It‚Äôs not not functioning. It‚Äôs just got a shot charging in the chamber. You‚Äôll see the gun vibrating a bit like it‚Äôs charging a shot (it‚Äôs not actually charged tho). A couple of fixes, throw a rifle butt, fire a single shot (quickest fix), holster and redraw. The gauss pistol also does this. I think the gauss rifle does it also, but I haven‚Äôt used one in a while so I can‚Äôt confirm that gun.
---
okay very very good to know agil does the sneak stats. ive been relatively even in my stats with per and str being highest. good to hear im doing that right lol. thank you for the tips
---
Yeah, I agree with that last part.
---
What I did was I just saved all the atoms I claimed from the run, adding to the atoms I collected during the run. I was just glad I got atoms for completing so I could have some for the next run.
---
Let me jump in for a sec - you don't need to bulk most things, its a waste of plastic. Just bulk lead and aluminum in order to save space, they're the only ones that actually get smaller when bulked.
---
One strategy is to get Fallout 1st for one month, then pack your scrap box as full as possible during that month. Don't renew, but you'll still have access to your scrap box, you just can't add to it. So you can slowly bleed it dry over time. Something to think about if you're good with spending 13USD.
---
Scroll a little bit in this subreddit and you‚Äôll find a thread about the upcoming wide-scale player legendary damage nerf.  They‚Äôre changing how damage multipliers are added to the base damage, effectively reducing the damage output of almost all legendaries.  The only thing that isn‚Äôt affected is two-shot, I think.
---
I'm going for 4 legendary specials, follow through and I'm thinking either fire or poison resist
---
That's a lot of weight...
---
No worries. Game is complex and doesn‚Äôt explain enough properly. I genuinely feel bad for anyone who immediately jumps into it without playing any of the other non-isometric games of the series since there‚Äôs no hand holding tutorial.
---
I just got off 5 straight 12 hour night shifts and didn't even realize the Brotherhood collectron was even a thing.
---
Based on the results of this [weapon damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html), I'm pretty sure armor penetration reduces the armor rating (DR or ER) before the damage coefficient is calculated. It's interesting because it means that, unlike the armor penetration sets in ESO, you don't really get diminishing returns for stacking more armor penetration, unless you're exceeding 100%, which I'm pretty sure is impossible. Except that according to the wiki the effects of tank killer and stabilized are coded to get cut in half if you're running the anti-armor legendary effect, so you get less of a return if you're stacking those two. Now that I'm looking at it I think things might be off in that damage calculator when you start stacking armor penetration effects... it seems to just be multiplying the armor penetration amounts.
---
For shotguns, you are exactly right, they suck because they perform poorly against armor, which is something that damage calculator calculates incorrectly. That calculator doesn't take multiple projectiles into account so shotgun, two shot, explosive legendary, and beam splitter calculations are off. I have a pistols and shotguns tank character that does ok for a full health build with a quad double barrel (really high damage per shot with an insane rate of fire) just by brute forcing raw dps. Standing toe to toe with Earl I can consistently land headshots for the duration of the fight, I just need to pop a lot of stims. The build will probably be really good for that fight once I can max out the Taking One for the Team legendary perk that's coming out.
---
That‚Äôs the only cat for me...
---
I'm actually building a 3rd character that's just pipe pistol and regular pistol now. Still trying to decide what I'm actually going to do for damage buffs.
---
Yeah they fixed that after they broke it.
---
Honestly I'd be fine if we could just place the stairs we already have against the wall, i don't want my second floor to be made of metal mesh and I don't want my stairs in the middle of my house
---
I just hit 250 with my main on xbox. My gamertag is TenebrousSavant. I am frequently bored and happy to help new players, so hit me up and I will be glad to have something to do if I am not busy.
---
Creek fire. Central Ca
---
I'm one of the only ones willing to PvP these asshats at home, mostly because I don't have a rad shower. No matter what they break, it'll take me 2 clicks to replace it all with repair all. Mostly it's for the role play of running a Raider bar. Don't start none, there won't be none, but I have no compunction about throwing out shit disturbers. Thankfully a junkies build throws most of them out on their asses, and I've got an executioners gamma for the bloodied try hards.
---
Yea worked for me last night too. Today someone reported that it no longer work. Now I‚Äôm on a second server where someone nuked FP, I guess it‚Äôs working again.
---
You'll get over the fear since you'll be killing many of them in order to stay alive.
---
And don't forget, when you're "frightened" by that scream attack, you can still turn yourself left or right to avoid running into drills and stuff (if you have a controller).
---
the last one i did, i forget what it was called...but it was in monongah mines and had 3 heads, wild af event i havent done anything like that. everyone was dying, got the revive trophy at least, but i feel like a moocher for being level 19 or 20 when theyre 200+, but im not gonna lie....i kinda am mooching considering my dmg doesnt do shit, but i probably spent 10 stimpacks during that fight reviving teammates even if they didnt revive me.
---
good to know there is a dmg meter for rewards, is that every event? even say a messenger one?
---
Knowing bethesda they've probably tested it, realised it's bugged as shit and just sweeped it under the rug until someone notices it and they'll say "oh wow this is unexpected" and then wait 3 months to finally fix it, and in doing so will probably break something else and the situation doesn't improve. Been burned one too many times
---
However with nuking not working rn, the bigger events like project paradise and line in the sand are hopping. Bored wastelanders looking for something to do lol.
---
What system and which paint are you after.
---
I can just see the posts now "I went on vacation for two weeks and just got back, wtf Bethesda why do I even play your shitty game #bubye"
---
I have the whole set learned to craft, and one of the plans for Elder available for interesting trades.  EDIT: on PC.
---
Real value is stored in the game, but like you said they would limit the UI to save memory. Could be capped at 3 digits, could be a different convenient value for the engine. I know older call of duty games have it capped at 1023 (2^10, 1024 values, 0-1023). It still counts the real value in the game memory but just doesn't display anything higher beyond that
---
Sounds like you want the plans to me
---
I‚Äôd peel a settler‚Äôs skin for more music added to the radio.
---
Man I've lived in WV for 20 years and have YET to hit half of these üòÇ
---
Here are my thoughts but:
---
It's pointless to lock most things as half the time you're not there so it goes to waste, water is generated fast so just keep them unlocked as if you ain't there why bother someone can just have a bit of water an such.
---
similar crops are freely grown resources and if you lock them up you have a few issues.
---
But a certain resource can be locked in you're constantly going back to it say a Lead Deposit or an ammunition factory if you're farming from it.
---
and if it's a glitched ammunition factory screw the bounty an break into it an take some sweet glitched ammunition.
---
Yep, PA wall glitch works too
---
This needs more likes
---
Hello from 170 miles north! It's like that here too. This is kind of how I'd imagine it would look like if we had modern nukes being dropped.
---
I mean the build isnt the most optimized, but having like, 8 black powder pistols and hotkeying them all and alternating between them in a fight to avoid reloading pirate style can be both fun and effective. I wouldn't build the entire character like this but hey it'll be effective early on, can be very powerful as it can burst down high health enemies very quickly
---
10 with armorer 3
---
Is there for sure no discount on modules?
---
Considering this game is meant to last a long time, they should really consider forming an in studio band to create some new songs. 
---
Imagine a monthly quest to help a wasteland band find inspiration for new songs that get added to the radio as a reward.
---
Nocturnal is nice, but bloodied outperforms by a wide margin, junkies is close behind with good Chem management, but nocturnal spends half it's time nerfed, and the other half just catching up to junkies.
---
I'd be totally down for a Halloween radiation arc that has a spider web in the center and a huge spider on top
---
Nocturnal Auto Grenade Launcher.
---
I think that answers the question.
---
I like people that snipe others with the gauss shotgun. Like across the map, barely visible, shot in their general direction and they die, sniping. With a shotgun. That seems fair and, most of all, realistic!
---
I thought this was going to be a new post in r/deathclawmating nsfw
---
Well I am a collector so I have my one copy of the game on me at all times so I cannot pick up any more of them. Within the groups I am in we call out when we find a game and I like to help people find them since they might go back to that spot another time and find another magazine. Help people experience more of the game, 99% of the time the people I show the game give me a heart emote. To each their own play style though. I also sell the magazines and bobbleheads 15 and 25 caps, I am more interested in making deals than caps.
---
Thank you ill add you
---
Thank you! I'll  check it out.
---
Bless your poor, poor soul
---
Everyone will tell you to just play the game but honestly hang around high levels on public teams, they will usually just drop you shit or you can ask them. But yeah these posts just come across as you being lazy, I personally dgaf but yeah good luck man, try asking people for their unwanted plans and you can sell them cheap in your vending machine
---
Feeling the love for the Enclave here. About time. Lol.
---
Boo Debbie Downer Boo
---
I was a public server Monday afternoon. Swear there were only two other people on that server. I lol‚Äôd.
---
I do want the plans myself and farming the quest is a real nuisance.
---
If it's unlocked it's fair game as far as I'm concerned
---
They‚Äôll probably lower it to half for the ally vendors...
---
I've been wanting stairs that are L shaped. Go up a bit turn at a landing and then go up the rest of the way. Even a spiral staircase would be great.
---
Yeah, I never get why bloodied builds (ESPECIALLY melee) try to PvP. They‚Äôre just trash with how PvP is. 
---
I say this as a melee build... And the only way to win a PvP fight a close range w/melee is VATS. VATS is broken in PvP for ranged weapons, so they‚Äôre either going to kill themselves with their explosive shit, or die to you.
---
You will be able to move special points later so you can‚Äôt mess anything up too badly. The higher your level the more perks unlock as well to you can see what is available at each level. [Nukes &amp; Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com) is a good resource to start familiarizing yourself with and planning out full builds.
---
If you need help don‚Äôt be afraid to ask on this sub or find a community to play with. The game is played almost exactly the same across all systems so anyone can help.
---
Chief, your average person has to try harder than usual to make sense of this post
---
I have probably 15 alts that I put through that quest. Feel my pain.
---
Happened to me the other day :/ I put a lot of effort into my builds and it was certainly unexpected
---
Not sure if I have anything interesting to offer just caps mostly.
---
Post it again tomorrow, it‚Äôs only been posted three days in a row.
---
I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt since they reset weekly I doubt they keep the same code from a week ago
---
Hidden weight is also plans, because they are 0.25 but we tend to carry tons of them. 
---
And purified water.
---
I just want the fucking button to work.
---
Highly unlikely.
---
With the Sofia quest line, you get a former Assaultron called Athena that visits as a random vendor and also has ammo scrap.  Her cap limit is definitely shared with all the other vendors (railroad, traveling merchant, 
---
Whitespring, etc.).
---
Enforcer works.
---
I keep my no-fast-travel gunslinger alt for times like this, when I'm waiting for events/patches/updates/20 hour timers to turn over.
---
Just strolling and rolling around Appalachia, going as slow as I can.
---
It‚Äôs the camps with 30 ammo factories.
---
Junkies builds are actually top 3 in the game. A melee junkie would 1 shot the spawns, and do appreciable damage to Earle, power armor is great to tank hits and just keep smacking. Strength builds also synergize well into shotgun or heavy guns builds. I'm a heavy junkie, and I'd bet I could solo most content, though I don't have 1st to test that wager
---
Sorry about that i was in a hurry but what i am asking is when the camo Secret service might come back
---
True. And true. Sorry, I was mostly just ribbing you : )
---
Take it easy mate \^\_\^
---
The pumpkin house area is free, except for that Scorchbeast that likes to roam the skies.
---
I am going to guess that the image was different 17 minutes ago. There is currently no player name shown.
---
Yeah I travel for work.. it was up and gone while I was away..
---
Tru we got what we wanted let‚Äôs be happy for once lul
---
Like everyone said yeah it‚Äôs super important to pick a weapon type and stick with that as far as perks go. Commando (full auto rifles) is waaaaaay more effective in this than previous games but the ammo consumption can be rough at lower levels so early on rifleman (semi auto/single shot) is a good choice. Sneak peeks are awesome. The damage output of sneak attacks is about to be reduced but just how hard it is for enemies to spot you makes it useful. Legendary effects of weapons are important but don‚Äôt worry about it till you hit level 50 as you‚Äôll outgrow your early weapons quickly. A big help is in the settings of you haven‚Äôt you an turn on damage numbers so you see exactly what changes in gear is doing to your real damage against enemies. Look up mutations and get some of those as soon as you‚Äôre able to equip starched genes(perk that prevents mutations from going away). Don‚Äôt worry too much too 50 is the soft level cap where you can‚Äôt add anymore special points but still every level you can move a perk point or pick a perk so you can continue tweaking things until it‚Äôs just how you want.
---
Stinging.
---
Waaaa
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs so cute. Reminds me of the loading screen that says ‚ÄúWest Virginia was home to Bed and Breakfasts before the war‚Äù or something like that. Congratulations!!
---
I have a massive amount of respect for CMs. Thanks for being our voice, and thanks for the response!
---
Just keep it in the store forever, I know a few people who play this game just lost their homes from the wildfires and I doubt they can log in next week
---
I'd just like to be able to stack the platform stair piece
---
There‚Äôs a very. $imple $olution
---
Thats why i always gladly go back to fallout 76 never a dull moment
---
Booooo
---
That's what I was planning on selling all my scrip for.
---
I doubt they'd bother to get the licensing, sadly--
---
They Could use the Halloween atom shop music from last year though and it'd work:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHbAMLRbC\_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHbAMLRbC_Y)
---
Go launch one yourself
---
What is going on with the silos?
---
Just gotta keep scrapping them. It's obtained that way and has a medium chance to trigger so it may take a few.
---
[Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V_qPFefn79OM/edit?usp=drivesdk) a spreadsheet for each weapon mod with what you can get by scrapping and the chance to get it.
---
This is a perfect idea!
---
Honestly,  i wish bethesda would hire on alot of the modders out there, atleast as supplemental devs.  
---
 Need to make q big push to release new content, contract some modders that already love the game, have a laundry list of bugs that are in dire need of a solid fix, not a bandaid, contract some modders.... b
---
Make it require power so a freezer makes sense.
---
I thought this was already confirmed in the PTS?
---
Camera glitch or power armor glitch probably.
---
There's a terminal outside the main entrance that you learn it from.
---
The refined 38 gives great damage too. I have a Bloodied Explosive Fixer modded to use 38 ammo, and I am hitting for 800 with three rifleman perks, no covert ops and no bloody mess.
---
You are correct. I redacted the GT on the Duplicate image, but accidently selected the original photo when I made the post. @DingoBro97 brought it to my attention, and I swiftly corrected it. I have to remember that my camera saves 3 versions of photos taken, and to select the right one when posting one.
---
I‚Äôm level 45, I would fail 100%. And I‚Äôm not far enough in the story anyways
---
 they don't work , i try it a couple times in the last 5 hours.   
---
\- the codes from Last Week also not working anymore. just as ever after the weekly reset
---
I just put it in a bathtub and cover it with curtains.
---
The other day, I made a post suggesting some changes to the overall grind for the game and it got downvoted. I guess some players want the endless grind to exist. That‚Äôs fine with me since there are other grind heavy games that I play that are much more enjoyable. I just don‚Äôt get why people wouldn‚Äôt want the grind to be simplified.
---
"eh grrrrrrrl, you wanna become an "Albino" Deathclaw?"
---
hurt typing that out lmao
---
Hopefully not until they fix it. It can be crafted, but cannot be modded. Even if you know the plans for modding SS underarmor, it‚Äôll allow you apply the mod, but won‚Äôt actually apply the mod. It‚Äôll just use up the materials but not do anything.
---
From what I hear legendary modules will not be a part of the sale.
---
But is it gonna be like Christmas and other holidays where they put the holiday themed items in the atom store 2 days before the holiday.
---
Halloween stuff needs to be out by Oct 1 at the latest
---
I like your list bro.
---
I've heard people claim that the BOS collectron also drops weapons, personally I've only seen scrap.
---
Dang i didnt know this thanks for the heads up
---
You are AWESOME and I am SUPER duper on-board with this. üíô
---
Nukes have quadrupled in my game sessions since Earl came along!
---
I guess I'm just unlucky
---
Can someone very gently explain how to do this? I never did it before they patched it and now I want to try but it's not working as easily as snapping walls to doorways.
---
pain. just pain. day is ruined. only way it'll be better now is if I pull an instigating gauss shotgun.
---
Happy to craft whatever you want for free.  Just holding onto those plans for a good trade.  Just bring a set of T-60 by my camp and holler.  (IGN: TheScotchBeast)
---
Rumor has it that it will be fixed in patch 22 but no word on if it‚Äôll make it back into the atom shop.
---
I just saw your YouTube vid was really cool to watch
---
At the absolute very least they could bump it from 24 hour reset to 12 hours.
---
Hopefully i have t65 camo and i finally have ss armor and i want them to match
---
I'm sure they will, not a lot of effort was put into last year's halloween--I think they spent more putting forks around whitespring to be honest
---
You never had to destroy walls to get them double sided. Just use doorways on both sides and change them to whatever you want after they‚Äôre in place. Destroying objects (and repairing after you‚Äôve placed other things in the same area) is needed when you want objects to overlap when the game won‚Äôt allow it.
---
Corner stairs would be nice
---
Think of the antiarmor weapons you will get by playing the game. Honestly, I have been selling everything for under 1000 caps, bloodied, antiarmor, you name it. 
---
The new weapons (Gauss shotguns and other Wastelanders items) have pushed people into selling great weapons, and the same with SS armor replacing beautiful sets of urban, combat, etc.
---
This wouldn't be as big of a problem if they would implement  some form of explosive resistance perk card like fireproof. Explosives in general over powered simply because there's no resistance stats to negate their damage.
---
OOF.  Guess I can't be mad at them.  After all, it's Beth's fault for telegraphing the incoming (absurdly unnecessary) damage nerf.  If the Legendary Run hadn't turned me into an ammo efficient murder factor, I'd probably be doing the same.
---
There are also ways to go about this without showing a player at all. I would consider the fact that you posted any image of another player with no proof that they were waiting to trap other players as witch-hunting. If you have a video of this player sitting there until a player opens the drop, then killing them it would be a different case entirely, as you would have proof and not just be making accusations. Also, how are we suppose to know that the crate is still locked? He could have opened the drop and left it for lower levels to find.
---
Hey, thank you so much for taking the time to write this, OP. This post gave me a lot of hope and felt so good to read, especially after the elitism and gatekeeping the Colossal Problem event has brought out in the community. One particular post was incredibly disheartening to me (in particular, the comments), but this (and the comments, too!) is like a perfect antithesis to all of that negativity.
---
I hope you have an awesome day. You are a fantastic person and you deserve it. üíô
---
Well said
---
Ooohh you‚Äôre talking about the armor armor... my bad, that paint works fine. No idea if it‚Äôll be in the shop again soon tho. I was goin on about the under armor. üòÜ
---
You are a legend, thanks for all you do!
---
*\*explosions in fallout physics engine\**
---
Yes, I've been there. Does it automatically unlock? Or do I have to do something?
---
Please increase scrip limit!
---
I really want more coins for the RobCo vault too.
---
After watching a few Angry Turtle vids about the legendary perks and how they work, I really don‚Äôt think much is gonna change with the damage nerf. Some of those perks (with the damage nerf active) can be really op. I‚Äôm not sweatin bullets yet (pun intended).
---
Also it's super annoying that items don't stack.
---
Yes.  They should be reported via Bethesda‚Äôs website.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/
---
Then progress the story enough to get em. Unless you find someone willing to launch one where you want it you're gonna have to do it yourself. Also there's been people that have used pipe guns to kill endgame enemies so don't think that just cause you're level 45 that you'll fail.
---
Thanks for the information
---
Completely forgot about that. Would be a good incentive for doing Enclave events after becoming a general if they added them to the enclave specific events.
---
Dude gunslinger is so much fun. I run max agility and perception so I can freely switch between stealth commando and gunslinger, but honestly unless I'm grinding exp and legendaries or am anywhere in the mire my explosive instigating .44 is so much fun. Helps that I'm decided out as a wasteland cowboy lol
---
The amount of damage it provides is outside of the player's control. If it wasn't worse during the day it might actually be decent.
---
The terminal unlocks the plan for Brotherhood Recon Rifle and yes it is under machined rifles in crafting.
---
No weapons. But you can set any of the collections to gather the lists of any other collectron you own. So they may have switched it to one of the others and are making that claim.
---
Place a doorway, then place another doorway in the same space. You may have to rotate the piece or position yourself just right to get it to snap but it‚Äôs not difficult. One you have the two pieces back to back you can change both pieces to whatever other wall piece you really want there - even if it‚Äôs a different material.
---
Yes! I'm in ps4! I will write you if i move lol
---
Well you see, I need the nuke so I can kill 10 scorchbeast, But I‚Äôll just look for some in the normal wasteland
---
codes/silos have been messed up since yesterday at 8pm eastern
---
But with a full week there's less of an excuse.
---
Honestly with it being a community reward it should be a full month to ensure absolutely nobody misses it.
---
I just got a pretty cool 3 star gauss shotgun at first I didn‚Äôt like it but it‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs a mutants 10% more damage if your mutated  faster fire rate  and 25% less vatts my damage is 712 give or take a point can‚Äôt remember the exact number and that‚Äôs without taking anything
---
I saw 173 on my public team killing a level 13 I fast travel to him left the team and tried to PVP almost killed him but he merked me. Left the server ):
---
And lots of free repackaged presents renamed provisions!
---
Does it unlock it automatically, or does it put the plan in your inventory and you still have to read it? I don't remember.
---
Last Weeks:

the were working on one server i was on last night after the switch, but since silos themselves have been broken
---
Awesome üòä
---
Fissure sites will almost always spawn a scorchbeast when approached so just find a couple somewhat close together kill the beasts server hop and do it all over again.
---
Oh well now I‚Äôm definitely not trying to launch one myself
---
They bring them back from time to time
---
The reason I know, is I went up to the crate and selected to open it. When I did that, the lock with the Bobby pin &amp; Screw Driver appeared. It stated "Steal" on the screen as well. I then backed out of the screen because I figured out what was about to happen, then the player was standing up with his rifle pointed at me... Pretty easy then to see that my suspicion was confirmed. I then sat on the top floor of the hotel for over 5 mins, and he sat back down in order to wait for his next victim....
---
I stand correct. My bad guys.
---
Sounds good, thanks
---
I would imagine it would be out during Valentine‚Äôs Day. They bring back stuff pretty often that is holiday related
---
So definitely not worth the effort for 600 armor.
---
Thanks for the math!
---
Wow, amazing job! What platform is it on? And would you mind letting me join you to try it out/give you some materials to repair it?
---
yea i would hold off until we hear back from bethesda that it's sorted
---
Wtf. You can change your build whenever you want?
---
It would be cool if we could boost our drinks by refrigerating them like in Fo4.
---
That's what I kept trying to explain to them. Only the raider and communist collectron gathers weapons.
---
Do follow me emote when there is a legendary, tag it and wait.
---
But there is no list of existing bug / hack they are trying to fix though, that can be really helpful instead of kept reporting same bugs if not, just vote up, you know like some other games / software development companies do for their support system and be able to autocomplete the issues.
---
Are there any updates on this, Thank you, everybody.
---
What's tatos, precious?
---
I think its fine now. We are getting 50 coins for free now to make up for special redistribution costs. They don't cost that much at all anymore.
---
Just another 5100 hours before you get those 760 atoms!
---
Yes, patch 22 will bring damage calculation changes on September 15.
---
It unlocks in the terminal. It's a combat rifle mod, I believe?
---
It used to really glitch out the game till you closed it down when you got in there, all intractable objects just vanished entirely!
---
It took a long time for YT to understand that I was looking for content videos and not bitchy angry videos, as it kept recommending Yongyea to me. 
---
I can't remember how many times I clicked "not interested" before YT registered I dont want Yong's videos. Now it recommends Angry Turtle instead!
---
To try and cheat ya mean? I'd probably just leave the server. I haven't had anyone try to cheat though. I think most people want to complete the encounter without spoiling it, otherwise it's pointless. But obviously its possible to cheat at almost any game.
---
Ward is worse than the Insult Bot
---
I'd love for the Liberty Prime PA to come back. I was taking a much needed break from the game when it was around :(
---
I did the event and got the plans today, plus the Aktos lab coat. 
---
Three animals were alive in the end, nice group of random players, we got all feeders to the fullest, three level 3 creatures.
---
I don't think it's a bug, you just hit a point you can't run anymore.  When my carry weight was 200 I couldn't  go over I think 800 and not be able to run. I don't use PA. Now that my cw is almost 300 I can go over 1000 before I can't run
---
Good idea. But imagine getting those all to L50?
---
Unknown.
---
But most likely no.
---
Really I just want legendary modules and Vault steel, but alas neither will be discounted.
---
It's not working for me either on PS4.
---
I'm not sure where that is, is where was one of the prime meat points?
---
When I see Mr Prize Bot I smash him to bits. 1 lead scrap is a much better prize. Plus, cutting him off mid-sentence in his congratulations speech by smashing him to bits just feels right.
---
I'm an xboxer so if you're on there fire me a message: korindabar
---
Salem Oregon looks the same
---
Yup. Found it in my inventory. Damn, I feel like an idiot. 
---
Stay safe friend, it was like this in Australia not too long ago :(
---
Thats rad
---
It put it in my inventory.  I'm an idiot. 
---
It's just to cover their butts.
---
There you go! No use in double scripts if we're limited to 999.
---
Not even close, 7159.
---
I saw a camp with external stairs that went up the side of the wall. I have no clue how to build that.
---
See an issue?  Report it and let them sort it.  I prefer that to searching through a list for what I saw but perhaps is a little different, so I would end up submitting a report of my own anyhow.
---
I do that all the time, I finally remember to look at q plan in my inventory and I have like 5 or 6 sometimes.
---
You sure it wasn't one of the drops that have the nuclear keycards? I don't think I've ever seen a regular government supply drop say "steal from" on it, only the ones you shoot down the vertibots for. Could be wrong though.
---
Question, would a Stalker‚Äôs Gauss Shotgun (100% when not in combat, +33% VATS, &amp; 25% less VATS cost) trigger this effect bc of the 33%??
---
edit: I also rolled Vampires, +50 Limb, +250 DR reload would that be better or is the VATS better?
---
Oh I'm sure, I've seen a couple myself, but is because i really suck making camps so the scenery has to help me a lot to make it look nice lol
---
Legendaries under lv 50 with a few exceptions and collector/pvper interest, are not worth the time to seek out.
---
Best to use stock weapons, and focus on learning the top damage mods for those weapons, as that will help your game more. Keep those weapons current. Don't use your lv 10 legendary at lv 20, use a stock lv 20 that you can mod.
---
Fo76 also does not reward generalized builds, this particularly hurts damage. Pick a weapon type and spec for it if doing more damage is your main concern.
---
I. hit. the. jackpot! Two. square. inches. of intact. aluminum. foil!
---
...provided you're running bloodied.  The game should be playable without being bloody!
---
Without the damage nerf, the Legendary perks might start to make the game more interesting without bloodied builds...but the damage nerf undoes most of the good the perks do.
---
I've played on PTS, and I'm high enough level that I could spec out something interesting with the new legendary perks, and between those and the nerf, it's a wash.  Most people really will need more ammo.
---
Do you think Bethesda tried to patch the silo stuff?
---
Hahah good work.
---
Blood stained floors and wallpaper
---
A Colossal Problem is THE exp farm today. Take your strongest weapon and kill all wendigos. 
---
If you want something less stressful, you can kill ghouls at the Whitespring, or take/retake workshops.
---
Again, until you post proof of that this is just a witch-hunt. I see no gun or lock pick prompt. If you have the evidence, please post it so this is no longer a ‚Äúhe said she said‚Äù without allowing the player you are accusing to present their side. Downvote me all you want, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this post is a witch-hunt as long as you offer no proof of your claims.
---
Oh no the cultists! They are Everywhere! And with that annoying voice some of them have lol
---
I hope so.  I'm getting tired of players with .50s and miniguns spitting explosive shot shells and mini nukes.
---
The main thing I got from this is that they A) want to be able to allow/disallow whatever mods they please, and B) don‚Äôt want you blaming Zenimax if you download a third-party mod and it breaks something on your account.
---
A free skin for like the handmade called blood stained that is just the regular skin but covered in blood
---
It may have been, I've never seen one in Flatwoods before tho. The thing that tipped me off tho was it stating "Steal" on the screen, and I figured out real quick what was about to happen. Sure enough I back out of the lockpick screen, and the player is standing up and in full blown ADS pointed towards me lol.
---
Exactly I only eat the finest raw wolf meat and drink the sweetest sweetwater special blend.
---
Nah, you're good! I probably should've phrased it differently though
---
and thanks! You too!
---
...unless it's to communicate poorly.  They do that from time to time.
---
You know except food that's been around for decades and then only starts to rot AFTER you pick it up.
---
Every weapon in the game is being nerfed, weapons, weapon mods, perks and legendary effects.
---
Rifles, pistols and melee are being hit the hardest!
---
The only remaining viable weapons are full auto commando builds, or heavy gun builds!
---
Perks no longer buff fully modded weapons, the buff is applied based on the guns base stats.
---
It's for all consoles i'm pretty sure, i'm on PS4 and it also happens
---
Everything I've heard about PTS and damage changes to come on Sept 15 says rifleman won't be good. I think you may mean commando? 
---
Also I would suggest, OP, that you be a little careful about respeccing your build. After Sept 15, every time you respec, you lose points you can *grow* your character with through the new legendary perks. 
---
Read your research, then apply it to your character, will give you better results in the long run. But at the end of the day, people find ways to find FO76 fun without following the cookie cutter advice, so your mileage may vary.
---
.............,,,,,,,,,,,,
---
Please, take a few.
---
Ahhhh!  I recently gave myself healing factor by accident and I'm experiencing the FT bug like never before.  I'll have to scrub it and see if that helps--thanks!  I'd never heard of this possible link before.
---
The 1k limit isn‚Äôt a big deal as much as the daily 150.  I far exceed 150 worth of new scrip each day without trying.  I just run SBQ, Colassus, events and daily‚Äôs.  it adds up.  I roll a single 3* ranged and one module for a Ss roll per day.  Just doubling it to 300 would make my game more enjoyable and help me with weight management.
---
Ok, regardless of what your opinion is, it is just that.... An opinion. I don't have to prove anything to you, especially because I'm not accusing the player of doing anything other than "scrub play" that a low level player could easily fall for.
---
That sounds like my sorta build!!
---
Do you play on console?
---
Maybe the loot is worth the annoying, condescending lines that BoS Collectron spouts at you all the time, but I doubt it.  I‚Äôll keep my Commie for now, thanks, and if I get tired of it, the Raider is waiting in the wings.
---
It was actually for the OP above you, no sweat buddy. Good luck!
---
Codes won't work. You can punch in the correct one but it says invalid anyways.
---
Happens on PC too.
---
We've been saying this for weeks now. No response. Why are we not banding together and doing a peaceful protest in front of Todd Howards mansion? Nothing is going to happen unless all the FO1st and microstransactions dry up... or we do a peaceful riot.
---
Ah, my bad. Appreciate it. 
---
Doubt I‚Äôll ever get to it. I play this way too casually.
---
Try restarting the game. A part of the atom shop menu froze for me last night until I restarted game (PS4), so it may look like some pages are missing but they're not.
---
(hunting rifle)
---
The whitespring.  I set up a fence perimeter. Totally flat in a few spots for entire camp
---
In a week there will be new content.  If you don't feel l I'll le playing you could honestly just not log in for a week.
---
If I pull an instigating one I'm gonna be ecstatic hahaha, even happier if it's a decent instigating 3 star
---
Oh yah i forgot about that one. üòÖ
---
They‚Äôve done this for a while, gauss minigun and pistol also have a built in explosive effect. It goes away on the rifle if you attach a suppressor
---
Exact same here. I traded plasma grenade plans for fixer plans,. learned it, got three fixer plans from five events after that, in two days.
---
There‚Äôs dailies you can do. Challenges to complete if not glitched. Events to do when they pop up.  Go farm materials
---
The subreddit rules say otherwise.
---
i just want some funky halloween music to spice up my halloween parties nearby the whitesprings when the event goes live
---
Now you play the game....i mean the grind you play to grind.
---
i have been trying to get an instigsting plasma caster.  but after 15 rolls, nothing yet.
---
No hacks on console, that I know of. I've followed the sub reddits and every article.
---
Perks apply to gun+mods, they don't apply to each other.  Technically no weapon is being nerfed per se.
---
An old vintage elevator would be fantastic. I always wanted to make an old haunted mansion.
---
It stops them from engaging with you and if one of you server hops, it blocks the system from putting you both on the same server again for 24 hours (or until you exit the game at least). It doesn't stop them from attempting to claim your workshop, but it does keep your camp off their map, even if you are selling.
---
Some really nice shots there, my fav is the road sign behind you
---
Wrong, perks, weapon mods and base guns themselves are being nerfed!
---
Even non legendary weapons will be doing significantly less damage!
---
Ah, damn. Why are all the creative ones on Xbox lol
---
Literally nothing you said is true
---
That's what I'm doing.  Hopefully by the time I log in I'll be refreshed :)
---
It sounds like they want to be able to ban anyone at any time and or any reason. They just need the TOS to back it up so that they will know what to put on the automated message that they send you after the ban. 
---
Now lets see how they will enforce it. I do not think that they have  the manpower to ban everyone for these offenses. If anything, they might have to automate the whole banning process. Doing that comes with its own set of troubles. For example, in games like world of warcraft, if you get a bunch of people to report a person, they get banned without human intervention. That person will then have to appeal and it might take days to overturn the decision. Some players weaponize this and use it to blackmail players into giving them gold, otherwise they will all report that player.
---
mine is aid.  it all adds up!! great advice
---
Look up the charts and player feedback coming out of the public test server!
---
the only things not effected by the nerfs are anti armor and explosive legendary effects!
---
My speculation is their legal dept wanted some stronger language since they got news that another department banned accounts recently. Think of all the accounts that got banned for the weapon dupe, and then many of the posts saying they got unbanned and retained all their duped stuff. All very recent news that are to do with a punishment for what Beth considered unacceptable conduct.
---
I've worked in corporate environments with lawyers and often the case lawyers are reacting to something the company did, or may do, that is a red flag legally, and then applying a solution to that red flag.
---
Wouldn't surprise me too if someone filed a frivolous lawsuit in some court against Bethesda for a ban or something related to player conduct punishment. Where I live, we can file small ($10k or under) suits online, the hardest part is serving the other party with the notice.
---
Hmmmm, the link to the picture doesn't show any player name ü§î. So I'm breaking a rule by "witch hunting" a player that can not be identified what so ever.... Go ahead and report me then internet bad boy
---
What is Bethesda going to do when someone says "fix the fast travel bug."  If 8t was that simple, they would have fixed it.  Most people don't realize how complicated bug fixing is.  I doubt they don't hear us, I think it's much more likely that they're trying to fix bugs, but are having a hard time.
---
Worst. NPC. Ever.  ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs YOU again.‚Äù Yes, it is me, you twat, come to steal your can-chimes and spend all night keeping you awake scrapping all the Mole Miner Gauntlets I plucked off the corpses of your old miner pals down in town.
---
Have you played on the pts?
---
WITH 50S STYLE HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS
---
They are already scattered in 4 and a bit in 76. The bombs dropped while everyone was getting ready for Halloween it would be sooooo perfect
---
Can't blame them from the sound of it! It never ceases to amaze me the amount of entitlement some gamers have. They buy a $60 game and it should provide free updates for the next 10 years because the people working on those updates don't need to be paid or some dumb shit.
---
It's especially mind numbing when the game also provides a way to obtain that premium currency in game!
---
Like in Fallout 2 where you fix the car for fast travel.. üöô
---
It's a standard scrap bot with the occasional energy type grenades
---
You show up at my camp and unless I‚Äôm afk I‚Äôll hook up new people. Gt ‚Äúcrunchtastic ‚Äú.  I‚Äôll take you on a run in whitespring. But really just play the game. At level 50 it opens up and you start really hunting weapons.  Play in teams. You will level quick.
---
Fuck them, just ignore it
---
I'll sell you a bridge for 30k.
---
1. No, not every weapon in the game is being nerfed. No weapons are being nerfed. Not even perks or damage that applies is being nerfed. The damage system changing how it calculates damage is not a nerf.
---
2. Rifles, pistols and melee are not being hit the hardest, no weapon is being hit any differently then other weapons.
---
3. Any build is still viable. Enemies taking 2 shots to kill isn‚Äôt ‚Äúunviable‚Äù
---
4. Perks do still buff fully modded weapons. They buff it no matter if it‚Äôs modded or not.
---
People like you are just spreading false information, and the people who believe you are gonna spread it elsewhere. This is how shitty information gets out and believed by so many people when it simply isn‚Äôt true
---
there be a few small sheds in the mire an can help if you're going for a hill billy &amp;/ swamp folk style moonshiner.
---
just above the treetop houses there's a ruined shed also next to a lead deposit that's also helpful.
---
I'm going by the data being revealed by the public test server, player responses, data mining, and actual damage numbers.
---
I don't play the pc version to access it myself, there's more than enough information published by other players to show the problems this nerf is going to cause.
---
Fridges should at least preserve food as good as rank 3 Good With Salt. The refrigerators are already limited by being able to hold hardly anything.
---
Which has pretty much always been their stance, has it not?
---
Honestly, I'm more open to tips than anything, as cool as free stuff is, it doesn't teach me any more about the game, not being lazy, just confused on how this game works
---
I guarantee you were a Bethesda fan before Fallout 76 came out.
---
Common man, stop holding out on me, man! I need my fix man! I need the stuff, man! Have a heart, I'll pay you tomorrow - I swear! You know I'm good for it, man! Please?!
---
Than you don't understand what's going on.  Because what you claimed isn't true
---
So you‚Äôre telling me that going for the heavy armor tree in Skyrim is just a load of total bullshit unless I like the look of it? Sons of bitches... I‚Äôve used nothing but heavy armor (shield included) and a Skyforge Steel Sword. You‚Äôre telling me I could have got the same damage reduction from lighter armor making it easier to sneak?
---
I missed out on the banner as well,but I do def appreciate that they‚Äôre bringing back the collectron for those that missed out!!
---
(Didn‚Äôt miss out on it myself)
---
But it‚Äôs nice to see they‚Äôre listening too the community,&amp; hookin it up regardless.
---
They obviously DO NOT have to,but HAVE.
---
It‚Äôs just nice to see
---
Edit:cause autocorrect butchered my post &amp; I didn‚Äôt proofread
---
It‚Äôs diff then the flag for me,simply because of the benefit/utility of it.
---
A flag is cool,but just cosmetic
---
That'd be great, gt is UltraKyuubi4431
---
This is all I really want.  Takes enough CAMP budget as it is, and then you have to either rig up a switch/pressure plate or just leave it on all the time.
---
I speak on behalf of EVERYONE, we
---
Agree
---
I'll add you my gt is UltraKyuubi4431
---
Any recommendations for new players? I just started on PC. Kind of overwhelmed, have watched some tutorials and read up on stuff. Currently level 8. Just curious to know if i should be doing campaign missions and etc as that would help me get a grip of the game?
---
How about classic monsters masks, at least Fallout Universe versions of The Wolfman, Dracula, The Mummy, etc...like Fasnacht masks, but for reward drops during Mischief Night.
---
So, I guess their plan of tormenting you bombed....
---
Sigh... I know, that was terrible. I'll show myself out...
---
Every report and footage I've seen has show that both rifleman and melee builds take far too long to kill enemies, regardless of legendary or not to make them a viable build anymore. They've both lost the most when it comes to damage numbers.
---
Yes bloodied commandos and heavy gunners will take two or three more bullets to kill things, not a big problem, rifle pistol and melee is so much worse as they relied on the possibility of high damage from their slower rate of fire and risking the user by needing to get closer.
---
Hahahahahahahah....god I would have loved to see that!   Griefer upset you took his junk!  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah, xbox1
---
As they stand they are useless
---
Make them have 50 storage weight capacity total independent of how many fridges you place.
---
Have at least 75% slower spoilage but need to be powered as currently you can place 3 fridges for 45 items and most meat weighs over 1Lb
---
That's a really clear way of putting it. To be fair, it means that my TL/DR is not really accurate. You do get diminishing returns, but there's no point at which they start rapidly diminishing, except maybe at around 60 armor rating, which is too low to really be relevant.
---
I‚Äôm Longy6245. You guys should add me. I‚Äôm always looking for someone to run around with.
---
I‚Äôd check all the railroad stations if you can‚Äôt find it
---
But I do need them so I can carry the shit I use to make myself even more powerful to kill people faster, and stop them killing me. I will carry about 600 Quantums into a serious fight and come out with less than 100.
---
Yeah, this.  Roads will be packed
---
Want to make a group?
---
Nice, will do.
---
If you want to truly experience the game I would recommend doing the missions as they come about. They not only provide background for the game but lots of items that will help you at lower levels, like ammo and stimpacks. It will also walk you through the map without having to fast travel everywhere. 
---
You can do some of the side quests but don‚Äôt get upset if you need to level up first. The game is meant to be followed in a way that allows for the full experience not whipped through in a few days.
---
I‚Äôve started listening to ‚Äòold world radio Boston‚Äô on YouTube it‚Äôs fallout themed and it‚Äôs not to shabby. It‚Äôs made playing a lot more enjoyable.
---
yeah I am sure a digital robot is what they are looking forward to after all that
---
You improove your quality of life and fix your build !
---
‚ñ™ First...you lvl up to buy these 7 cards here: ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;w=lm2au2at1ik0if2ii0iq2 ) and you work to get the "Excavator" power armor so you can go farm lead ore at the  "Lucky hole mine" to allow you to craft all the ammo you need.
---
‚ñ™ You find a good Acid deposit spot to place your camp on ( to place your extractor )...because you gonna need A LOT of Acid !
---
Then you should be able to fix your build...
---
If you don't improove your quality of life first...the curve to improove your build ( to fix it ) is gonna be really painful. So think about it twice.
---
Then you should be able to do all the difficult stuff you can't do right now because you are too weak or don't have the dps.
---
You need to make sure you can craft your own ammo first...really really important !
---
You missed the point, nice.
---
Well I'm not on right now but definitely tommorow, I'll add you back
---
Wow, this whole time I've been seeing your awesome camps I didn't even know you're on xbox as well. Will have to stop by!
---
Why would they merge a weapon????
---
Just kill the cunt he chats shit
---
I just got an AA fss 90%, God roll for my full health melee. Must have used up all my rng. Good lucküëç
---
I just want a better event...the Halloween event was kinda garbage TBH.
---
I had my best luck killing them when kneecapping them.  They aren‚Äôt so tough when trying to drag their sorry ass around with their arms.
---
Sounds about as bad as blue screening at the last second.. yeah now that, that's what broke a glass.
---
In my few personal experiences with workshops, it was always some lvl 100+ that instakills me with explosive weaps or the extremely common and lame bloodied/junkies builds
---
Platinum would be my guess, or maybe tungsten?
---
I ditto that! It's nice to have players that don't purposely kill you just cuz you're a low level. FO76 has its problems, but the players are great!!
---
Compare the grind to rockstars two titles and it's not so bad
---
Yeah! 
---
More bullets to kill everything. That's why they're adding a legendary perk to craft more ammo!
---
Sounds fun, doesn't it?
---
Yes it's scheduled to come out on the 15th with the rest of 'one wasteland' and 'faily ops' But don't worry too much, it's not as bad as people are making it out to be
---
I'm pretty sure you can't hit 600 in regular armor, and in power armor T-65 versus Excavator is a very noticeable difference. PA versus non-PA is also very noticeable, but it's partially due to the flat damage reduction per piece. In regular armor, if you're benefiting from additional damage reduction effects like assassins, sentinels, cavaliers, blocker, etc. it multiplies with the damage reduction you get from armor rating (DR and ER) and becomes increasingly more effective.
---
Ouch.
---
Wish they would have moved somewhere else as I am tired of finding vacuum tubes. Like maybe if you didn‚Äôt love a toxic waste dump they would last a wee bit longer?
---
Because after 100ish fuckups in a row its only fair to ask what the fuck is going on with this professional development team? 
---
Learn to let the large company with a legal team on retainer defend themselves and stop trying to silence any dissent on their behalf.
---
Yeah, I've noticed. Not so much on the Gauss rifle, but on my Gauss Shotgun I've killed myself with that thing more times than I can count because I fired it at too close of range. Those fricking Ghouls sprinting at you just as you release  the trigger,
---
Yep it's illegal and if you don't get the right lawyer you are looking at some serious prison time.
---
Call 1-800- notitsnotfrigginillegaldontbesostupid NOW !
---
Those plans are frigging everywhere.  They‚Äôre not at every low-level rail station like the Water Filter plans are, but they‚Äôre close.  I usually don‚Äôt even waste a vendor spot on them, just drop them on the ground right in front of my vendor shack.
---
Just trying to make this community a better place, without make indefensible claims regarding fellow community members. If that makes me a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù I‚Äôll gladly accept that title.
---
This post could have been a simple PSA like the last time this was posted, but instead you decided to drag another player into it without providing evidence of their wrongdoing.
---
Also, you may want to look up the definition of witch hunt again, since this clearly fits the definition from Merriam-Webster:
---
&gt; the searching out and deliberate harassment of those (such as political opponents) with unpopular views
---
Must be nice, I did 6 ACPs and SBQ mixed in and got 9 one stars and 5 two stars. Thats only 90 scrip worth for about 8hrs of grind.
---
Nerfed autocorrects to merged
---
Server stability has been bad for a couple of years.....
---
Damn right
---
I‚Äôm usually like - how much lead scrap do I think I had on me when that Assaultron melted my face? Is it worth going back for it?
---
I agree that us spending money on a game with so many bugs and issues is us condoning it in a way but these are things that would actually make players like me happier to play. I've already invested so much time and money to Fallout. Its less about filling their pockets with money and more of me getting something that makes the game more worth while. Now if we could just somehow get more budget space without making their 1920s SERVER blow up, we would have it made. 100% of my budget space is taken up by atom shop stuff and I can't even use half of what I bought. But that's a battle for another post.
---
Happens 4 everyone
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt happen on the nuclear ones. Only on government ones called in by a player
---
Ok, nice number. And again I said I wasnt sure if it was true or not, that's why I an asking the community if it was
---
You're not the normal player.  PVP in this game is not about anything related to normal gameplay.  You said it yourself you have to dunk 600 quantums just to stay alive.  Why is that fun game play to you?  And I'm sure you farmed and bought all those quantums totally legit.
---
Yaaaas.. I want some spooky!
---
How do you kneecap them wtf
---
Wait until you get the (dis)pleasure of having to encounter one of them in a nuke zone. Laser and nuke cloud are about the same color. You just drop.
---
Given my main camp is at / under a graveyard ... +1
---
Damn
---
I love them, they add a  hint of danger this game needs more of.
---
Yeah, that grind sucked.  Happens though.
---
Concentrated Fire perk- at the legs (I VATS a lot because I‚Äôm old and lack decent twitch aiming reflexes).  Or just manually aim at the legs and blow them away.
---
That grocery store was, indeed, more fun.
---
I have 1000 scrip ready to go, I plan on logging in each day to turn in the bad weapons I get to reach the daily cap.
---
Sorry but is this a troll post? You know Bethesda can just disable workshop PvP if they wanted to, right?
---
Yes, this would be amazing
---
Me: Can't get power through a wall for 30 minutes. 
---
This guy: I'm going to make a game show. 
---
Well played.
---
It's not a plan it's a scrap unlocked mod,  just not that lucky.
---
I suggest they make up some semi-plausible tech that does it. Can I get a dehydrator ray 2000, please? And make it so you need purified water to rehydrate it to full spec or you get reduced stats with dirty or boiled water.
---
Maybe poison with toxic water (toxic bait).

I can help you out if I see you online.. üëç
---
It's not a troll post that's why I'm asking the community if it's true or not. I knew it wasnt real but I got sceptical and wanted to ask
---
Can you name said player? How can a nameless player, no one can identify or attach a actual player to, be witch hunted. In order to witch hunt someone, there has to be an identifiable person to attach the "witch" to. All you have is a photo of a unidentifiable player in a game that has millions of players..... When you can tell me who I have actually "witch hunted", and by tell me I want to know the actual said player, then I will continue this conversation. Until then, all you are doing is gaslighting/virtue signaling.
---
Oh you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm a total think-for-yourself-er. Got four toons all bloodied. Been a one shot wonder for so long now I forget other people use high health builds. You‚Äôre also right that we may start to see new good builds with the legendary perks. Possibly even a new meta. 
---
Regardless, I think most of the server instability is caused by the ammo factory glitch (to get back on the original topicüòÇ).
---
Bloodied outperforms everything, it's a pretty well known fact that it's playing the game on easy mode. But nocturnal is a pretty easy alternative to junkie's if you play it right. Makes for a great sidearm when the time is right, and people sell them dirt cheap
---
Oh to be new to Earle xD
---
I remember my first as well, getting perma staggered and panic reloading and stimpacking
---
Now I have a fully optimized super tank build and I can stand in the middle and spam emotes while tanking all the Wendigos and not drop below 75% health.
---
I'd buy it if I had some good stuff.
---
Seriously. Give me all the Halloween and all the Christmas and I will give them all the money. I'm a basic witch; I know what I am.
---
YEEEEEEESSSS!!
---
This sounds horrible
---
A lot of people like building. A lot more are on an endless quest to get the best weapons. 
---
You aren‚Äôt missing very much lore-wise. There are stories here and there, but nothing like the other fallout games. 
---
It can be fun to join a player made faction and collaborate, but again, the goals don‚Äôt really change. I think it can be a fun game, but it isn‚Äôt the story driven game that the others were. It really tends to not be fun by yourself.
---
Punched out lead?
---
Exactly so why the ever living freak would you have them at the base 100 caps or whatever it is in a vender. It's the same with most plans. It's not like it's a fat man or prime receiver plan which are understandable to keep base or a event based plan that is understandable to mark up.
---
Thank you! Yes i agree. When you say missions as they come about you're referring to doing the campaign missions as they come about while still exploring and doing other things? 
---
Yeah i know, hahah i went up against some level 50 creatures got my ass handed to me. Lots to learn.
---
Yeah, going back to FO4.  Nothing new here that I can tell, obligatory IINAL.
---
When you took the workshop did it prompt that pvp was enabled in workshops? The only thing I saw in the new disclaimer thing was the griefing is banned. Taking a workshop from another player is not griefing. It‚Äôs a mechanic.
---
Depleted uranium
---
I guess his plan...backfired
---
..I'll follow you out
---
Gold, lead and uranium and a little bit of asbestos. Just whatever super heavy materials they had laying around and some asbestos.
---
Yes I have this problem aswell. I‚Äôve tried everything to fix it. Nothing works. Don‚Äôt know if the camo under armor, ghillie suit skin, or its random causes it. I‚Äôve found no info on it too unfortunately..
---
Yes. You have to work a little harder at smithing than you would with heavy, but you can max damage reduction in Skryim with dragonscale armor. Here's a [link](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Armor#Shields) (apparently the max damage reduction is 80%, not 85%). Blocking with a shield or weapon stacks with your armor rating, so you're still tougher as a sword and shield character than anything else. Apparently it's blocking that's capped at 85%, for a combined reduction of 97%, or an effective health of 33.3, so really tanky.
---
Got it, thanks. What a shit show..
---
My first roll for the Gauss shotgun was a 1* junkies. Full addictions and perks (including demo expert), it's a little over 1k damage. I can usually one-shot those little wendigos, but it does just enough to the boss that I can see it's health move a tiny bit.
---
That‚Äôs the story of my life right now, I keep getting really good heavy weapons, .50 cals and Gatling plasmas constantly. Like everyone else I‚Äôm looking for end game fixers.
---
You might have turned it off or completely transparent in your settings by accident. Check around in your display settings, someone else will probably have a clearer answer.
---
Maybe he got some of that vomit in his mouth and it gave him an acute case of Die-arrhea.
---
Same, I recently watched a TKS Mantis video about the Brotherhood of Steel and got his own lore wrong, and yet people in his comment section praise him. I really hate negativity and non factual statements.
---
That's it. It's been almost 2 years since I made one, lol
---
Still not as tough as a rad rat.
---
HIGHLY underrated perk. Just one perception point and its a total game changer.
---
Ah ok thanks for clearing it up. I didnt go take a workshop or anything yet
---
Just gotta hit the market place and try to trade for something you want.
---
I haven‚Äôt taken a workshop in a while so I was actually curious lol.
---
Me too lol haha
---
As someone who really enjoys crafting/farming food and aid, I was really sad and surprised that there was no "Master Chef" or "Medic" style Legendary Perks. I would have loved being able to craft more complex items with like hour-long bonuses and such.
---
It would be sick to make a "Legendary Pizza" and it's like 150% Health Regen for 2h or something. It would make selling food a nice way to make money.
---
I'd rather use the +END team instead of gaining XP. Just a slightly lower chance of death.
---
You clearly don‚Äôt understand the meaning of ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù. You don‚Äôt have to name a person or group, only imply that there is someone doing a certain activity and paint that practice in a bad light. Sound like any posts you have read recently?
---
Also you quite literally started by naming the player in this picture, you since updated the link to show an edited picture.
---
From that moment you were done, delete the post and start over. My original comment came when you post still said Now as time posted. Would it have been that hard to take it down and look at what might be wrong with it? Or you know, ask me why I said your post was was witch-hunting instead of waiting to respond to someone who responded to me.
---
Life happens.  3 days can easily slip due to family events, work trips, long shifts at work, natural disasters, etc.
---
I expected Rule 34 deathclaws. I got Rule 34 deathclaws. I'm somehow very disappointed that I was right.
---
Yep.  On your perk screen, you hit Shift+number to save the current build, which associates that number as a hotkey.  You can even name the build.  Your saved loadout names are shown in a little box at the bottom of the screen for reference. Then, whenever you want to use that build, you go back to the Perk page and just hit that hotkey and bang, your build is loaded.  Takes longer to load into the Pip-Boy and the perk page than it does to change the loadout. 
---
I think it uses scripts to run, so you have to load a separate little script-extender mod before the perk loadout mod, which is very common for Fallout mods through the years.
---
No it's not bad. Probably what most people are going to do.
---
Just what we all need, another skin for the Handmade. Not to mention the Blood Eagle skin from the legendary run.
---
Punkin Chucker would definitely be more useful than the broadsider, and the confetti cannon would probably be more powerful.
---
It's called perk loadouts that will be coming eventually to console but PC has had for a long time through a mod.
---
I'm all about supply stuff, take my money now
---
Another option is Enforcer.  Even the level 1 perk can cripple the legs in 1 or 2 shotgun blasts(you don't have to be a shotgun user or have any other shotgun perks). It's been nerfed a bit but it's still a reasonably powerful tactic.
---
I have 1 piece of TShooters armor and a good Tshooters weapon on each of my toons..
---
only mob I carry a specific weapon for.. at least until 1wasteland shits on us.. then Ill probably get something for supermutants and mirelurks too..
---
Damn, I sold mine for like 500
---
It‚Äôs whatever to me, but I‚Äôm laughing at my friend because he‚Äôs gonna have to change his gamer tag because of it.
---
Why aren't you doing the questline?  At level 8, wandering around aimlessly doesn't seem like the best strategy.
---
Yeah I think it's more common on consoles because of there being more kids on there. On PC it's pretty uncommon. I only remember maybe meeting 10 people like that in 1700 hours so far.
---
It's just not the game for you then my dude, just asking to be downvoted for even posting because you've played to level 8 and experienced 2% of the content.

Hey if modded correctly a pipe revolver can be brutally strong. they can take BOTH rifle AND PISTOL perks at the same time.

2. Nope.
---
Sorry...
---
I hate fighting them but boy are they scarousing.
---
Dude, for some people it wasn‚Äôt that they weren‚Äôt informed. It was that they had stuff in real life going on and missed the three day period.
---
Definitely will do!
---
Agreed, but fyi to add you can check the total amount of ammo you have for any favorited gun by hovering over it in the favorites wheel. No need to open the pip boy
---
I guess they come in a mini safe with explosives stuffed inside
---
Shoot the cores on their back.
---
It was available before the weekend. I got before I left town. I have real stuff going on in life.
---
It‚Äôs coming back. Lighten up.
---
You know what it collects? The stuff we had to collect for the rewards.
---
This
---
Master infiltrator is a waste.
---
Got a anti armor Tesla a few days ago I wasnt to excited but then i tried it out and I enjoy it.
---
Damn good job!
---
Pipe is life? Welder?
---
This isn't even a microtransaction issue.  It is an availablility issue.  Many people can't be logged in everyday.
---
Lol nobody reads sarcasm I guess
---
Unfortunately, back when they started offering modder-created items as monetized Bethesda store purchases for FO4, they didn‚Äôt offer any of the hundreds of fantastic mods that actually made the game work better/more fun, they chose crap like pink military uniforms and Vault-Tec skinned kitchen appliances, like the Atom store but worse.  And the modders had to essentially take down any unapproved mods they‚Äôd developed before signing up.  
---
It was a lot of drama back in the day.
---
Yeah agreed except skip Master Infiltrator.
---
Please no. There's so much hacking on PC and I'd really rather it not infest the console versions. Console only crossplay would be ok though. But no PC.
---
That's a sentry bot...
---
It's not hard to kill them.  Just... shoot at them.  They melt quickly
---
Really? Like not having to waste 3 perk point slots in perception AND 3 perk point slots in Intelligence AND being able to skip all those mini-games seems like a QoL improvement.
---
I say waste the slots, but it's really stopping to change out cards.
---
2% come on. You‚Äôre giving him too much credit. He‚Äôs literally ‚Äúexplored‚Äù gaully mine and the fair grounds and declared fuck it.
---
No... The sentry not also has it. Edit - well, the capacitors or whatever is on their back. Similar thing that downs them in one shot.
---
To which hacks are you referring to?
---
I‚Äôm not talking about the fact it‚Äôs coming back. I‚Äôm talking about the too short of a time span the item had for people to collect it and how you said ‚ÄúIf you had kept yourself informed, you wouldn‚Äôt have missed it‚Äù. What you said was pretty ignorant to the fact that some people couldn‚Äôt play Fallout 76 because of something going on in there life.
---
Edit: [Found a post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ioy9es/had_no_internet_for_a_few_days_due_to_wildfire/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Nice idea. Afraid deliverers gonna become a skin for 10mm pistol, I think.
---
In the upcoming update, if you use PA, and the legendary reboot perk (the one that recharges your cores) it‚Äôll heal you on top of charging your cores. 
---
This applies to their head lasers. You can‚Äôt die to them anymore.
---
Exploit dude- bad news in my opinion.... Wouldn't do it.
---
Hack and slash + collateral damge + demolitions expert... for my full health PA two handed melee build... all my other builds, yeah pretty much just special perks
---
Honestly it‚Äôs just how often are you unlocking something? And even then, how often does that unlocked something lead to anything decent? Anything behind a locked door or safe can be crafted or found easily elsewhere on the map. I stopped unlocking anything personally and just never have those perks on. At most you‚Äôll save time with a shortcut
---
Yeah gotta take other people‚Äôs opinions with a grain of salt. I assumed Metal Gear Survive would be garbage based on videos by Jim Sterling etc. When it came out on Xbox games pass, I tried it assuming it‚Äôd be terrible, but I ended up having a great time.
---
Did you miss the whole incident with hackers taking peoples full inventory literally off their characters? Youtube it. It was nuts. No thanks to that shit on consoles.
---
You already have enough in both and unless you plan on maxing out the legendary perk you'll have to put the cards in anyway, as it only automatically does lvl 0 locks for the first rank
---
Come on man.
---
Yes. Actually I did. The guy I bought them from is probably a Duper. But I did buy them. And that‚Äôs at the professional level where Quantum spamming and stealth boys are king, because if you don‚Äôt the weapons the other guy is armed with will one tap you. Especially in VATS.
---
Thats really disappointing,  as there are a ton of talented coders out there that could vastly improve this game and help clear up some of the existing issues
---
Nukes always rain down. Plus if you're a PvP enemy of theirs at some point you're gonna go head to head on the battlefield. I say embrace it.

Haters hate winners. ü•á

Me too! I got it Free in the Atomic Shop, then one day, it was gone! I‚Äôd be really mad if I paid Atoms for it, but they GAVE it to us FREE, then took it away! Kinda crappy of them either way!
---
So... If you make it a rifle and double dip on the rifleman and gunslinger perks that thing will pack a wallop. And they are cheap to repair. 
---
The ammo is plentiful as well, since no one else will use it.
---
Whatever guy, we're apparently not going to come to an agreement so it is a waste of time to continue talking about it. I openly stated that I made an error by posting the wrong photo, and in that statement I credited you with pointing it out. This post was made in order to help low level players from being entrapped into getting attacked without knowing it can happen to them. Now that "pacifist" mode is a thing, the high level trolls try all kind of tricks in order to initiate an attack on a unsuspecting low level player that knows no better. I've been that low level player that spent every cap he had on bulk scrap at vendors to build things I wanted, just to have a high level player entice into doing something that gave me a bounty, then kill me and took every single bit of scrap from me. I contemplated quitting when that happened to me, so I was just trying to save some heartache for noob players. You were not there, didn't see him standing up with gun pointed towards me in hopes I unlocked that drop. So I going to agree to disagree, and move on. Have a good night, and again thank you for pointing out my error with the original photo.
---
Damn. I knew in my gut it wasn‚Äôt worth the investment in the long run... But I went ahead and did it anyway.
---
Can confirm, although it was a single lvl one rabbit, killing it made fast travel immediately viable.
---
Im voting for "Punkin" to be the next wasteland vegetable.... tato = Potato/tomato.. Punkin = ?
---
Just the first rank of infiltrator is free and replaces all six normal perk cards, and then you still have to do the mini-game thingy.
---
But it's 250 perk points to get master just to avoid the mini-game thingy
---
I‚Äôve had one and it doesn‚Äôt seem to do what it says and execution as well didn‚Äôt notice anything happening there either
---
You're both right. Like I can always swap them out, especially with loadouts coming in like maybe December.  
---
I planned to max it out. I just don't enjoy those mini-games (hacking, lockpicking) anymore. I wanted the PTS where the guys was just running through doors/chest/etc and it seemed cool.
---
His plan really blew up in his face
---
I'd love a Horror bundle and not in the trick or treat sense.  I was really into the caged skeleton tree from the Legendary Run and I'm still looking for an electric chair plan. I'd like to see more torture devices like a guillotine or iron maiden and maybe Jack the Ripper's toolset as another decoration.
---
But to be fair,  theu could easily just have a disable crossplay option for people who are scared of the pc players.
---
Just doesn't seem worth it to me over other perks
---
I think console only cross platform would be great.
---
Not my fav youtuber but here ya go. No thanks to PC hack players on console. I want to KEEP playing the game k? If that means PC has to stay away so be it.

If FO76 had ESO's map scale it would be pretty amazing. One can always hope. That said, it is still a pretty engrossing amount of content, and the build flexibility in terms of perks, armor and weapons, and the grind involved in getting them, keeps it interesting. At level 8 there are a lot of enemies that you can't really face yet. And unlike ESO (last time I checked) they don't all fall into the same few health and resistance slots.

Hacking is actually not a big issue in PC. It's just that when it does happen it gets a TON of attention. This happens with most things that can cause a negative impact. 99.99% of people can be having no trouble and won't say anything, but the 0.01% will go viral. It's the nature of the internet
---
Just until they add enough content where they become comfortable enough to charge a monthy subscription to play... eventually its going to end up there
---
Its enough that I don't want to deal with it.
---
This can happen i think anywhere with a vein that gets nuked. Ive seen it south of v9. Not sure if it's intentional or a bug, since the ones outside of the tree in tanagra will spawn spread out, as an attacking wave. In the other places, you generally won't be in a position to kill them all with a few explosive bullets due to their positions.
---
I have not said anything about the balance ( too early when not tested myself ) but i watched the videos about the perks and even i have to say if the damage had stayed the same + the new perks imo there would have been 0 reason to continue playing cause our damage would have gone stupid high
---
Nice. I'd like an instigating or bloodied fss 90rw. I'm not going to hold my breath though.
---
Just scrap as many 10mm pistols as you can find to learn the mods. Thankfully that's a pretty common weapon early on in the game.
---
Don't you have to attack things multiple times for Follow Through to pop. It's not like bonus damage on the first hit right? It's a debuff that gets added.   
---
You're right in that it's good for bosses, but I trash most things in 1 hit anyway. I should still be able to after the upcoming One Wastelanders.
---
I'm 180 I think, or close.  Xbox name is the same except a space instead of the underline in the middle.  I work shift work so I'm on at different times tho
---
World of tanks mobile has this option. It would solve the issue for sure.
---
Where abouts in the bunker is the room?
---
You learn the mods from scrapping the weapon. Find or craft a bunch.....
---
üò≥üôÄüôÄ BRO YOU FORGOT TO PARDON YOUR LANGUAGE

My post was sarcasm,  I've seen it,  but as I stated,  they could easily just add an option to opt out of crossplay,  the frames on consoles are the only reason I'm hating it,  watoga will drop to 10 frames on a one x,  and they've yet to announce if fallout 76 will just be backwards compatible on the series x or get an upgrade like doom and eso.  The hacking is also something like many other things that bethesda could do better at, but hey, you can miss the earle fight after dropping a nuke because of the fast travel bug thats been around for months but they can fix an exploit to buy unlimited bullions from the wayward in less than 2 hours after an update ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Finally someone with the guts to help

You can do this basically anywhere you find an ultracite node inside of a nuke zone. You can always find one when someone nukes the mine to start ACP, too. Not always in the same place, but I've never not been able to find one when I wanted to farm scorched for flux stabilizing ingredients. It's a great place for it too because short of Whitespring it's the most cobalt flux heavy area I've ever seen get regularly nuked.
---
All that's left is building/scrapping radium r1fles
---
Versus lore discussions and debates on death claw population caps and breeding seasons and rituals?
---
I like how they made that a thing in fallout 4 even if it was a little
---
Just another communist plot to undermine the free market here in Appalachia. But dont worry, a few of us upright citizens might just have a brigade and deliver these commies some good old fashioned American comeuppance.
---
it was/is (dunno and tbh i dont care) possible to blueprint the machines at a workshop and build them in your camp - classic bethesda fuckup.  
---
  
---
but there is another glitch on it also: if you remove the machines, the camp budget stays blocked til you move the entire camp.   
---
(and before someone says this is spreading glitches: it takes like one minute at google to find out how to do it, so calm down....)
---
Again,  like the glitch where you could take from peoples stash box on ALL consoles,  bethesda could fix it,  and i came from pc and never ran into any hackers so it must not be as bad as you say. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You didn't like me new armor bench?

Yes a major buff is needed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting too old for this shit‚Äù

Of the three mods for the tenderizer (all of which are just a seasoning shaker) two are either weightless or weigh 1 pound. The third one wights 11 pounds. The point is Bethesda pulls the weights of stuff out of their ass with absolutely no acceptable logic behind some of them. If you think about it too much it will just drive you crazy.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not playing till next season starts
---
Adding an opt out would fracture the playerbase on consoles too much. Its already very common to load into half full servers at best lately on ps4. Nothing you say will convince me crossplay is a good idea and would be good for this game so I'll be blunt and tell you outright you're wasting your time trying. Its Bethesda. It'd be an absolute disaster. No thanks.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was a problem there I‚Äôm going to check mine tonight
---
Tormentor will kneecap them too if you're more of a rifleman, but I find enforcers/shotguns more reliable.
---
i dont think crossplay from consoles to pc will ever come, at any game (beside mahjong or stuff like this). input methods are just way too different.  
---
id love the idea of having all consoles together but as this point is highly political between multi billion dollar companies, i doubt it for the next years.
---
What‚Äôs the new codes
---
NOOB TUBE *FUMP*
---
Ive had 8 friends who played on PC and have all quit because hackers. Just because you haven't doesnt mean others haven't.
---
They have such a sexy voice when they call me sir at the Whitespring, though...
---
Then that is bullshit. "50% sale on stuff the Purveyor has! Except when it isn't!"
---
Lmao
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox.  I was just surprised.  I wish we could do that.
---
You do realize there's already alot of games that are crossplay between consoles and pc right?
---
You don't. They will forever take your money until the day you die.
---
Yeah i haven't played in almost a month. The seasons give me something to work towards, otherwise I already have the equipment and build I like in the game so no real reason to keep playing.
---
really? please tell me. i usually stick to a game for long time and dont play too much other things so i've never seen it but i have also never read about a "big game" doing so. what did i miss?
---
Its a bit obvious nothing will change your mind,  i simply asked a question no where in my post did I ask Mr. Todd Howard to add crossplay,  they've already stated their desire to but Sony "wouldn't play ball",  sounds like a Playstation problem though because xbox servers are almost full at all times ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Definitely took a little luster off selling my ACP Reclaimed mask for 10k earlier in the day...
---
Interesting. I'll admit I haven't paid much attention to the various defensive perks until now, there are a lot of them. I'd imagine blocker, dodgy and serendipity are awesome, but the ones that provide armor rating only provide about 10 or 15 points per perk point, which is a little steep. But it sounds like it's totally possible to make a non-PA tank.
---
Doesn't help that nuke codes are currently bugging out.

I‚Äôd like to see us being able to interact with the other stuff in our survival tents or maybe be able to customize them all together

During October, you could find Halloween recipes which could be made any time. Put the drink into the cauldron like a Fermentor and when done it would get better effects. Random things like fangs, wings, tail, etc. but temporary and cosmetic only.

Yeah I only recently noticed it when I took off the costume I was wearing for a while. It wasn't always that way though as I've seen videos where the elbow pads are grey like they should be. My only guess is that when they released the skins for the armor something must have bugged out. But yeah I didn't find anyone talking about this so I was curious if it was only me. Thanks for letting me know it's not.

What color is the sky in your world bro and how much weed did you smoke to get it that way?
---
Pro ssd here and I'm running fine
---
I think you don't show on their map either
---
I had to reset the game
---
Hardly anything kills me. I had an assaultron snipe me through an open doorway from like 200 feet. I don‚Äôt mind.
---
Earle is probably the most fun boss fight in the game. He's hard to kill though. With my bloodied explosive .50 it takes me roughly 7k rounds with a little help from another person.
---
Yea I went on another character that didn‚Äôt have the ghillie suit skin crafted/used and crafted a SS under armor And it was normal. So I really don‚Äôt know what caused it
---
Idc how full xbox servers are as I don't play there. I only care about the servers I play on. Happily without PC. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This is already a thing in the shop?
---
I'm sure your friends have bud,  keep arguing just to argue,  lol
---
the heck...? seems like i missed a thing or two :D

thanks man, i need to read up some things....

RIGHT. Omg this is facts

Question, I don‚Äôt think Angry Turtle answered my question on it, and I watched his video on empath today which he uploaded before public teams released: 
---
How does it work if you‚Äôre on a public team (a) if no one else on the team has it, and (b) if you‚Äôre on a public team but you‚Äôre the only one on the team [solo public teaming]? I can craft it and was wondering about taking it now. Is it similar to her mentality where you get the team bonus even if you‚Äôre solo?
---
My problem is, I have the notes, but I keep forgetting to grab gold every day :\ Why tf is there a limit on it? I've been doing events so long I forgot I have the notes! And I'm sure what I have is nothing compared to other players in the game who play way more religiously.
---
What happened to both hands? Curiosity has engaged
---
Or just launch one yourself if you really want to do it?
---
Been a very boring and uneventful day....uneventful...pun intended
---
Didn‚Äôt we just get the nice armor bench?

Obama and his cronies got very very rich with his presidency.  Trump has lost quite a bit of money.

Are you a Chinese bot?  Saying stuff that stupid makes it seem like you must be.
---
Need. More. Budget!
---
I would love to as I never have.    
---
I don't group much and my main who is the only one out of 3 that is remotely able to do it. Stealth Sniper and nowhere near the best gear.
---
It is lol
---
This would be great so I don‚Äôt have to spam when cooking to sell off at vendors
---
It is a repeat cycle games do to keep you playing. Sucks but effective. I always end my day at foundation so I always grab the gold. I check gold the same time I check for scrip refresh for the day.
---
Are you on PS4? I have the electric chair plan
---
Do you mammals really think they‚Äôll add this when almost a year later Fallout 1st subscribers don‚Äôt have basic skins for their scrap boxes?
---
Then if you're used to playing on dead servers on playstation then im sure "fracturing" your player base wouldn't effect you too much.  A simple opt out of crossplay feature would put your fears of the big scary pc players at rest.
---
76 is poorly optimized on console :( I stopped played because I was also getting nauseous from bad frame drops in certain areas of the game, especially when fighting the sbq or if somebody launched a nuke close to me.
---
Whatever it is you had me at horror.
---
yeah i remember it being in dead worlds and running 3 on sbq but hell now its hard to find a clean server
---
Doesn‚Äôt help that nuke codes aren‚Äôt working today so all the end game content is unavailable too beyond no challenges

What system are you on? I've seen at least one a day on PC, even while the nuke codes have been bugged recently.
---
solo?
---
wasn't aware
---
Already a thing bud
---
did not know that
---
Yea this is already a thing bought through atom shop makes food last longer
---
Is it something that happens every time you enter?
---
Yes. As you follow the original oversee mission it will direct you where to go. Like at first to Flatwoods to do the water testing and then to Morgantown and the airport, etc
---
They will take you around the map and introduce you to some ‚Äúside‚Äù but necessary missions like the free states, BOS and enclave.
---
Oh God.  FO76 grind is NOTHING compared to GTAV grind.  Want to play the massive new content, including a cool heist? Surprise! You need to spend millions of dollars on some new property - an office, an arcade, a frigging bunker in the middle of nowhere, etc.  Oh, and now that you own the place, you‚Äôre going to have to keep the lights on, which means a thousand or so dollars is deducted from your toon‚Äôs account every in-game day.  Just for that one property.
---
Want to offset some of that expense by utilizing the grind opportunities offered by other properties you might own? Well, first you need to spend hundreds of thousands on upgrades to even make it worthwhile to do so, then spend tens of thousands on the ‚Äòraw materials‚Äô, wait and hope the facility doesn‚Äôt get raided by the cops, and then attempt to sell your product to several different locations around the huge world map in a short amount of time, using a frigging UPS truck, on a server full of rabid PVPers with magic flying broomsticks who know EXACTLY where you are, and avoiding cops, who all have Olympic shooter-class accuracy.  Every bullet you shoot costs money.  You need to heal?  Costs money, or at minimum a trip to another one of your properties to get them for free from your secretary...who costs you money to employ.  If you die, your undelivered product is lost and you‚Äôre out what it cost you to make it.  Do that several dozen times, do a bunch of other missions on top of it, and you might get to do that heist you read so much about.

PC
---
Same. Played at launch for about a month I think and got up to level 52 but ended up losing interest and completely stopped playing. Then Covid happened and I was looking for a game to play and decided to try it again in the beginning of July. Now I‚Äôm level 423 lol Can only imagine what level I would be if I never stopped. Still has some issues but for the most part I‚Äôm really enjoying it and can‚Äôt wait for One Wasteland!
---
no worries mate once bethesda gets it all worked out we will be launching like crazy
---
Ah yes the "this person's friend's experiences counter mine so better act patronizing like a dick" option. But hey, one rando dick on reddit who hasn't had bad experiences totally invalidates and outweighs all the people who HAVE had them right? üôÑ
---
Easy solution.....jump them. Just spawn with a couple of friends close to there to kill them once they come out of the rad zone. Suit case plus all their aid. And the briefcase doesn't spawn everytime.
---
Two of my characters were both affected by the ghost budget, but on the most recent version of the PTS they have both been fixed.
---
I understand having a cap, it helps to slow dupers. However, the cap should be high enough that no normal player will ever hit the limit on legendaries collected in a day.
---
And the bed and wicker rug last month I think. The last few items haven't appeared under the fallout 1st tab/section so that might be why people aren't realizing it.
---
I usually hop on shortly after 3 in the afternoon central time.
---
Yup. Just like the 100s of other post about this since yesterday that can be found via the search box.
---
Also, if all the sites and subs say it is broken...why would there be a place to find them?
---
Yes, Follow Through takes a server tick to process after the first shot
---
The amount of enemies that can be one-shotted is noticably reduced in the new damage model.
---
I have a dream that one day there will be no mutants.
---
Forever 1 mod left
---
This, a couple of friends and I tried to do ACP last night but couldn't do it because of the codes. Collectively, we lost 5 nuke cards trying it.
---
I have visited the PTS today and my ghost budget affected characters have all been fixed.
---
What happens? I'm confused?! But also intrigued.
---
Just don‚Äôt report him
---
Lol you really think Bethesda‚Äôs banning people for doing the ammo factory glitch? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yea true
---
I see them in camps all the time, doesn't look like anyone's getting banned?
---
That‚Äôs the one.  ‚ÄòI think I‚Äôve got the black lung, Pop!‚Äô
---
Can't wait to get my hands on 365 cans of Cram!
---
I guess. like all my friends advice me from not doing it too. They say people have been getting banned
---
Already a thing.. yes this is true , but the thing, the fridge is not very helpful. Who (in real life) can only store 10 things in a fridge?? It‚Äôs not a mini fridge. 
---
They need to fix this.....
---
Unless they already did, I haven‚Äôt used fridge in months because it was very disappointing.
---
Yea true idk still kinda sus tho
---
DOES SOMEBODY NEED ME TO KICK THEIR ASS? \*pop-pop\* \*pop-pop-pop-pop\* -&gt; dead
---
What's your main weapon of choice?
---
Heck yeah. I only do it solo. Less robot spawns.
---
That too but I meant that only having two maps makes the gameplay get kinda stale after a while. There isn't enough variety in the playing part of NW
---
You're the friend, right?
---
Half full =/= dead. You can tell you're an xbox player with your lack of simple  understanding and your desire to look right even when you're literally feeding the troll who targets your type to get you riled up to laugh at you as a form of entertainment. Your type is easy as fuck. Jesus you're stupid as shit to even think this was ever serious. Lmao. Why are you guys so easy? Like really you "I gOtTa Be RiGhT. mUsT oVeRcOmEnSaTe" are the best thing on reddit. I love you guys. Great for amusement. Thanks for walking right in just like I knew you would babe. üòò
---
The change the shop every Tuesday with new and returning items. And yes that was vday.
---
Hell no I don‚Äôt want my account banned
---
Wait what game are you playing? Foundation is a group of asshole scumbags with no personality. The raiders just dont want you around them but after a bit theyre cool with you and respect you as a hero
---
Its always fun finding posts of people saying why dont you do X it would help bloodied players. Why should I cater to your build?
---
Yes!
---
*cough* Luigi‚Äôs Mansion *cough*
---
As a bloodied build, they can drop me quick if I'm caught off guard, but most of the time I just shred them. Still always annoying to die to one, but its also nice to know I'm not incapable being in danger against an enemy. 
---
I wish other enemies were similar, especially Deathclaws and the other large monsters.
---
I bought the "icebox" fridge, it's the more realistic experience lol
---
This would also be appreciated!
---
They can‚Äôt stop them From selling them, they are very organized
---
You prove my point.  You have to go to extreme levels of admitting that someone else is exploiting in order to supply you with enough consumables in order to PVP in a game that isn't even remotely balanced or rewarding.  Even in NW where the weapons are somewhat more reasonable there are specific weapons that stand out well beyond anything else.  Is the Fallout scenery really that good?
---
Waiting to buy legendary modules. And if they aren't part of the 50% discount, then buy modules anyway and log off for the rest of the week, ignoring the shitty "sale".
---
Let me tell you about the invisible one with swords for arms and the strike breaker with shishkebab for arms
---
This seems like a good stop gap measure in the meantime, mind showing me how you do this?
---
Looks like they broke nukes in latest patch lol. So, the few end game players who were willing to play despite there not being a season right now are deciding to play something else.
---
And how about making hostile targets actually show up as a red blip BEFORE they're attack you if you have a high perception. What kind of blithering idiot isn't aware of a giant green monster walking around talking loudly nearby until they're already firing at you?
---
Nukes are bugged at the moment. Your little brother probably didn't do anything wrong. No code is working right now.
---
It will help every player
---
The reasoning that Ive heard has something to do with Super Duper.
---
It was sad to see.  One of the most popular mods for FO4 was (is?) quite literally, just a whole huge slew of bug-fixes that Beth never saw fit to clean up themselves.  The game is potentially unplayable without it (I.e., major quest lines broken, etc.).  Modders made it happen.  Want to be able to craft ammo? Modders made it happen. Want the seasons to change as the days pass? Modders made it happen.  Want Deathclaws to look (and sound) like Randy ‚ÄòMacho Man‚Äô Savage? The TVs to actually show TV shows? Modders...well, you get the idea.
---
To go from that to ‚Äòwant this slightly more brown-colored desk lamp created for Bethesda by this amazing modder?  It can be yours for only $3.99!‚Äô....the backlash was huge.
---
PvP in 76 is totally unique, and I can‚Äôt think of anything even remotely close to it. I also spent over 1200 hours perfecting my weapons and build, I just need to sort out my armor next. I‚Äôm not dropping it, not now not ever. And it‚Äôs only probable. I don‚Äôt ask where he gets them from. But if I wanted to, I can get you 30 Quantums from world spawns, maybe another half a dozen to a dozen from vendors and server hop the dude in WSR who sells them. That‚Äôs how I got them before I found myself a dealer.
---
Please, he‚Äôs getting paid every time he stays at any of his properties. Not to mention how his properties always raise their prices whenever he‚Äôs in town. He‚Äôs benefiting plenty from this, there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs hiding his tax returns.
---
I like getting killed by it. I truly do. I have not got one to try yet in NW.
---
My disclaimer before anyone bumrushes me on this: THE WORDS IM ABOUT TO SAY ARE MY EXPERIENCE ONLY AND MAY NOT REFLECT YOURS.
---
For me, the best course of action has always been using legitimate and safe out of game markets to trade for weapons gears and plans. What I have found is it's best to either RNG a decent weapon or buy from a vendor (sometimes you get lucky and find a God tier for a few thousand caps). This way you have something someone else may want and can trade for something you'd like.
---
Speaking of caps too that's a huge entryway into trading. Not everyone uses caps but you can get some pretty amazing weapons with caps either in markets or in vendors.
---
But as many have suggested here focus on getting to level 50 (I'd suggest 75 even so you can have a better loadout for perk cards) and start thinking of what build you want to be. Usually an amazing weapon will fall into your lap and your build will reflect that.
---
Either way enjoy the climb! It's a lot of fun finding that right weapon and build.
---
No, there were no thoughts involved in this scenario whatsoever.
---
I played it tonight on PS4, it was great as always
---
Its not hard to not die lmao but ok bud, keep everyone else from getting a drop because you can't defend yourself
---
Y = You; O = Object; P = Your power armor
---
Y O P
---
The object should be of medium height, so that you're still able to look over it. Try to enter your power armor and it will NOT work. You will be able to move a couple of seconds later. Now you have a few seconds to walk in to the wall that you wanna breach through. Never stop moving against said wall and voila you're in your power armor suit and have magically bugged through the wall
---
LOL no. Workshops are still PvP zones. That player was just fucking with ya.
---
How come?
---
Bethesda barely even banned people for duping dozens of weapons, they‚Äôre not gonna ban people for placing a blueprint
---
Enschuldigen Sie. Es tut mir leid .
---
That‚Äôs all right.  We have room for all the legendaries you have to scrip because your stash space is filled up with 75 Mini Nukes.
---
True but my other friends said something along the lines of ‚Äúif you collect too much ammo you‚Äôll get banned‚Äù
---
Pretty sure you literally can't pvp until level 5 or 6. And in my experience it's always high levels, low levels mind their own business or they might ask for some help but that's rare so I offer when I can. I get high levels doing dumb shit like this almost every day I play
---
Enclave gang
---
Well your friend is wrong. Any amount of ammo you collect from those machines could be crafted. They don‚Äôt ban people for getting too much of an item, it has to be under certain circumstances
---
Shitty as always
---
If I‚Äôm down in that mine, the rads can and will kill me if I forget to watch them. Most of the time I‚Äôm running about 9% health already. I push it up to about 25-30% but I still notice my health creep lower than I like. And I have been killed for bashing not killing the legendary.
---
Joining FO76 in August, I did a red rocket camp build previously but didnt bother to wait for the red rocket mega sign since its release back in 2019..I guess sometimes the wait is longer.
---
Hmmm interesting
---
## Never forget the skeleton war
---
Fake. Even if you did, you're not going to make 10 billion rounds with this glitch
---
Exactly, lets be real, no one is earning crap. This thing drops regardless of what anyone donates. Its busy work and fake accomplishment.  Its like the participation trophy when you still lose the pee-wee baseball game. All these folks talking how they donated so much scrap, aww good for you. You just wasted your time and effort. This was never not going to happen.
---
Okay this made me laugh. Well done OP I did not expect that.
---
Same here. I‚Äôm a staunch fallout fan since the 90s and was really disappointed when 76 was released. Now my wife gets mad at me because I spend too much time playing it. I found that I can still role play my character like the past games and but have more options to get really dorky with it.
---
Yeah I did it three times today, twice people would wave everyone over so we'd all get hits and then other time I had to deal with the dude who one shotted them every time
---
Yes you can get them, but no one is doing that to supply every PVPer with hundreds of quantums per fight.  You're just deluding yourself if you think you're not being supplied by duping.  I'm glad someone likes it because you're right it sure is unique in that its not really competitive in any way shape or form.
---
The interloper has cast a mental paralysis on you, you‚Äôll need a psychic nullifier
---
Can't imagine why that'd be..
---
It is "good" they are being it back (never should have left as any other event reward too) but it's gonna be the same case of people missing it for whatever reasons.
---
Dunno why it can't just be a permanent thing so nobody misses out; new players down the line will see and get this and be like "oh cool go community"; they don't feel like they've missed out on anything and everyone is happy but who are we kidding fo76 should be called FOMO76
---
Ah true
---
Listen if they put those spawns in the actual whitesprings then they better take out the robots cause we are gonna have a huge shootout if they dont.
---
whitespring has a lot of attention, nice location, quite useful mall and i still see it get nuked from time to time as its a great place to farm nuke materials.  
---
if there is something like you mention, it should be in an area with low frequency. like a halloween party at the red rocket megastop or a festival at tyler county fairgrounds. with a deathclaw spawn point next to it you can create neat stuff. also, with scaling mobs from one wasteland coming up, it would be worthwhile for everyone.
---
might be good advice.  Ill feel like im gonna be 50 % more dissapointed
---
Show me where the pc and xbox players hurt you?  Youre not fooling anyone with your post,  you were dead serious from the start and trying to back track because "oVercOmEnSaTed" ,  have a good one dude,  youre a moron üòÇ
---
Well, the was an agreement update that basically said 'no griefing, griefing bad'. I don't think Beth considers workshop pvp griefing because they would otherwise have already disabled it, like u/pheakelmatters said.
---
Well it has been 5 months since i played..
---
Nah I'm not going to let a game I enjoy playing become shitty because of someone else's opinion of it. Any time I get bored on my current character I play a different game or I use my second character which has a different build. And I'll continue making new characters for different builds and enjoying the game because I'm not just trying to max my shit out and then claim the game has nothing to offer me lol thanks tho. Again, why do you play if that's how you feel anyway? Play something you enjoy and stop telling other people they won't enjoy it maybe?
---
A voice of reason here
---
Weirdos apparently. I had some guy with a power fist come up and start punching me the other night. Unlike most people he was using his mic, but seemed to only be speaking in sound bites, like clips from Family Guy and stuff. I think he might have been streaming.
---
Yessir starts tomorrow
---
Of course
---
I‚Äôm sure others will join you on a public server. But yea if you do it in your private world, solo is very doable too.
---
Automatic receivers on combat shotguns have the reverse effect.  More AP used for less damage.  Always go with hardened if you‚Äôre using VATS.  Aligned barrel does nothing for AP, unlike rifles.  Go with a true long barrel for more accuracy.  Also, aligned stock and forceful stock have the same AP mod, so go forceful for all of that extra durability.
---
Say less
---
If they ever let us fail one of these things, i'll eat my B2525 fixer.
---
The beginning is lame, so it'll only get better \^\^
---
Just wait until you see the big baddies of the wasteland
---
He swung at me like twice and just dropped lol it was kind of sad and I expected more from him after meleeing me for 5 minutes straight as I was minding my business
---
Yeah you can't until you're level 5. I always message them in the middle of their whacking fit and theyre usually disappointed and act like they can actually kill me. Like bruh don't feel like I can't one shot you in your blues right here.
---
Go to Morgantown high school...
---
Hahahaha when they do this again next season or whenever I‚Äôm coming right back to this comment and holding you to this üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You can but you need presents, for some reason they put that plan in the loot pool for presents so if you have any or know anyone that does just ask them for some I had 100 that I found and it gave me like 5 of thos plans
---
u/ladydevann
---
Classic
---
I mean isn't that what you came to this post to do? Then admitted youre full of shit the entire time while bringing in the console flame war? Go to twitch and watch the streamers with the most viewers(all on pc btw) and just ask them how bad these "hackers" are,  they'll tell you the same thing,  i highly doubt you even have 8 friends though with youre argumentative attitude and you would have brought up that point at the beginning instead of showing an old youtubr video if youre so confident in your friends experiences on pc.
---
Thank you very much for your help! Appreciate it.
---
Feels odd to say this, but the commie is better
---
Must be because lots of people claim to never see them and I see one person or group like this almost every time I play
---
No in game mechanic will count as harassment
---
Who's telling anyone what to do?  I was just giving my opinion on it the same way that you are.  I'm as confused about why you play the game as why I do.  I enjoy the game for a lot of reasons, most of them are against the rules.  The game is extremely open to hacking and manipulation.  There is almost no protections and the code is wide open to reverse engineering.  So when I say the game is garbage its because it actually is, just look at the results of the numerous people data mining it.
---
Why would you even go in the silo with only one keycard?
---
Don't play Nuclear Winter if you don't want to get nuked.
---
Correct
---
Anytime some ass shoots you with an explosive just run up to them as fast as you can. Self kill now that's funny as hell
---
The pay to win idea is bullshit
---
 You can literally earn atoms in game to purchase something like the fridge (not that its worth it). Not even remotely pay to win.
---
Huh, that is weird. I have the ghillie suit skin but have never crafted it. Can't be an issue with claiming it since your second character can craft it with no problems. The only ghillie skins I've crafted have been for the hunting rifle and backpack but I can't see those affecting the SS armor.
---
I‚Äôll have to check it out
---
What system are you on? I‚Äôm on Xbox if want them I‚Äôll drop them for free.
---
Sounds like you should pay more attention to your rads and run a build that doesn't get you killed in the mines so fast, instead of taking away everyone else's chance at a legendary drop. Its selfish to kill it and prevent every other person in the event from getting the drop.
---
Nah I'd rather they add them to the base game. Let enemies shoot us with them.
---
Maybe any of the ghillie suit skins bug it out when you craft them
---
He probably did dupe them, and if he didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs almost certain the guy he got them from did. I‚Äôm just saying there are legit ways to get those kinds of numbers.
---
It‚Äôs selfish of you to expect me to kick the bucket tagging rather than killing it.
---
I can‚Äôt think of any reason why this can get anyone banned. They even let dupers walk free and keep all their duped shit.
---
So like a recon scope? I'd be down for the weapons that dont have them.
---
Edit to be more helpful: 
---
In case you didn't know, the recon scope that is available for several rifles and pistols has the same effect of marking targets.
---
They're made of gameplay-elements
---
Anybody else notice they sound like a transvestite hairdresser named cookie
---
Not really. Sorry the big bad legendaries keep killing you though hope you figure that out so other people who are also doing the event to get the drops can actually get the drops lmao
---
Been around for generations.
---
Wait until you find out about Good With Salt.
---
It is technically available to everyone because you can earn atoms in game. Hardly pay to win. Not that the fridge is worth it.
---
Try Fireproof 1
---
Possibly, seems to be the only thing that's in common between our characters that have the issue. Welp this will probably be a thing for a while though since most people don't seem to notice or care about it. Guess we have to try to ignore it for now.
---
Jet pack would need to be it's own item to attach onto the chassis.
---
They're not gonna
---
Could you please tell me more about this alt player I'm having same prop?
---
Yea I‚Äôve made plenty of posts and no one seems to care so this will probably never get patched and my OCD will drive me nuts lol
---
Who knows I just thought I could go in and out and plus I didn't know that it destroyed keycards
---
I'm on pc unfortunately thanks for the kind offer though &lt;3
---
It is, that's why people were crying "pay to win!"
---
Yep. Hella drops from presents on PC.

---
I pray to almighty Mothman that never happens!
---
Not pay to win when you can earn atoms in game. They can cry all they want but its not really justified.
---
Wiki was wrong for a while too
---
Anyone remember what people said when they first released fridges?
---
That they were P2W.  That they were the beginning of the end of the game, introducing special effects exclusively in the atom shop.
---
What made all of those complaints total bullshit was the fact that the fridge actually sucked since it was a weaker and less convenient option compared to the backpack mod or the perk.
---
And now every so often we get people demanding bethesda remove the one saving grace that didn't make the fucking thing "P2W" in the first place.
---
The fridge was never meant to revolutionize food storage.  It's a cosmetic they tossed a reverse version of the fermenters code on because it fit thematically.  They could have released a totally dumb fridge you couldn't even put stuff in and people still would have bought it just for decorative purposes... but they decided it would be more fitting to at least have it do something.
---
This exactly.
---
Then what do they consider griefing then? The briefcase isn't supposed to spawn in the same known location every game.
---
Halloween is my favorite holiday and I have been trying to decorate my camp to get into the spirit of things. However, there are a lack of decorations that need to be addressed! I have also tried finding recipes for the pumpkin decor but it's so hard to find! Will 10/10 purchase, I don't care how much it is!!!!

Lmao dude I do this all the time. The trick is to seem serious and set the bait out. Nobody plays if they think you're trolling from the start. You were used by a chick for cheap laughs. But its ok. Your clearly fragile ego won't let you understand that. You've literally danced for me like a puppet babe. You weren't the first. And you won't be the last. Nice touch with the moron bit. Really shows how desperate you are to be right instead of seeing you were used. üòò
---
Also if you would, keep dancing a little longer. Ive got a bet going. I'm counting on you to make me $150. üòò
---
There's nothing more sleazy than a sleazy bed that's kid sized. Just sayin'. The armor bench is fantastic though.
---
All of my characters are high health. I have one junkie's slugger that can one-shot most things so I can sort of get where you're coming from. Tankiness is fun in and of itself though, you can run around not really caring what's attacking you. Within reason, those damn glowing yao guai pairs are still tough...
---
It isn't about that. It's about people using an exploit repeatedly on the same target. Even if they could nuke a group of 8 they would choose to nuke me all by myself when my team isn't with me.
---
I just started and i've definitely seen a lot of people on the map for sure. But just curious, is there a difference between playing the game on Game Pass (PC) vs. Steam? I mean i could be playing with people who own the game via steam and vice versa, right?

Fallout 76 Creation Club: *"Bugfix Patch"* - $20
---
It's because of Super Duper. It would probably be locked to 1 dupe no matter the stack if I were to guess, and that's just no good.
---
Lmao you're still actually taking this farce serious. I can't even. Dude you're blind. Men are easy as fuck. I swear. üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs for storage. It‚Äôs mostly a visual display.
---
But no, you don‚Äôt get added storage
---
They have had Halloween stuff both years (limited for the first, but it was launch), don't know why there wouldn't be this year.
---
Damn..
---
I only just noticed that..... Dear God that *is* sleazy....
---
Sorry for the delayed response. I've only played a couple hours but stepping down to 720p was more noticeable (visually) than I thought. Granted this was the first time I've played for a couple weeks, but for whatever reason everything looks overexposed, washed out, and too bright. To the point where it's actually straining my eyes a bit. I dunno, could just be my TV. I'm gonna experiment with the color/ display settings on the TV itself a little more. 
---
But performance wise, I think you're on to something. Running and gunning, everything seems slightly tighter and smoother. Biggest difference I noticed was in menus. They've always been laggy for me, but I was pleased to see I could breeze thru menus with no lag at all!
---
I'll have to compare the 1080p and 720p back to back to see which I stick with, so I guess the jury's still out lol
---
My frame rate on ps4 would disagree
---
Idk if you're trying to convince everyone else or yourself at this point but ill let you think that if it makes you feel good about yourself üòÇ
---
Crying to Bethesda won't achieve much, if anything. Look at all the assholes flying around killing people for months. Work with what you've got.
---
Have the same exact question too!
---
I mean, you're literally giving me what I want. And making me money in the process. Bets are fun so thanks babe. Keep going k? I want that money. üòò
---
If they bring back mischief night you should be able to unlock quite a bit of Halloween themed goodies.
---
I'll try and keep this short as I can.  
---
I'm partially disabled. Nothing severe or major life changes but my hands don't work as well as they used to. One hand will randomly decide to throw whatever is in it in a random direction.  
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper. All Legendary gear but nothing super mega awesome. My higest damage one is a 3 star Explosive Lever gun. A Fixer and Combat Rifle. A shotgun for up close lower enemies.  
---
My armor is good IMO. I really good 3 Star SS Chest and maxed out SS Underarmor. I don't have my SPECIAL to link or a picture but I'm good with how it is. I'm a casual player so I don't have time to grind to change points.  
---
If I could find a spot that's safe, I could do enough damage to Earl to get loot but also hit the wendigos. Not PA user. I still think I'd go down somewhat fast.  
---
I'm no fan of grinding for long periods. Mainly, I just want to complete the quest. I still haven't launched a nuke and finished the main quest yet. üòÜ
---
Script is really impossible with these items. They'd need to know the exact mod combination on each hacked weapon. It's impossible without interrogating the guys who spawned them in.
---
It's just so you can decorate without the stash box. The ice machine also serves as a stash box.
---
Meg is a good leader, but a bad raider.

Sammmeeeeeee
---
Steam because you can refund it easily if you don't like it before playing 2+ hours
---
Wait you mean that 2700 damage with a bloodied fixer isnt normal? How dare you! /s
---
You're probably fine. I would imagine they'd be after all the glitched ass weapons before a power armor skin, but if you want to be safe ditch it.
---
The closest thing to griefing you can do in NW is plopping down a billboard with neon letters saying:
---
*"Freds_Premium is a n****** *pedophile cocksucker. Phone number XXX-XXX-XXXX"*

Would be nice to be able to separate some stuff out. But no, we just get boxes to look at. Lol

You didn't spawn it in, worst case scenario is it gets deleted

Sign me up for literally every suggestion dropped here. üéÉ

You're not the one who brought it in. You're safe.

So you like the game because you break the rules lmfao. Okay buddy, you seem pretty trash and I'm done talking to you üòÇ have a good night
---
big iron
---
A list of items I deeply want and am willing to pay hard cash for...
---
A radio type item that plays that creepy church music. (That doesnt have to be actively played, rather on or off switch)
---
A radio type item that plays creepy white noise.
---
A pipe organ musical chair that let's us go all phantom of the opera. With said creepy organ music. 
---
Laying coffin, open and closed.
---
Standing coffin, open and closed, 
---
Leaning coffin, open and closed. 
---
Hidden coffin door. This might be easier to pull off if it's a pile of coffins against a wall, and they are like a shell that covers the doorway. 
---
Coffin bed, that you sit up from like a zombie or vampire.
---
Skeletons posed or ragdolled.
---
Various Animal skulls as floor decor. 
---
Dangling skeletons, with rag doll effects, (think the bone alarms)
---
More skeleton stuff in general. 
---
A collectron that plays creepy music, gathers various candies and occasionally let's loose ghastly screem (like that one haunted camp)
---
More retro holiday decor. 
---
A projector type item that projects a ghost of various types onto a surface.
---
Also really want stuff that makes sounds to be audible to people who haven't directly clicked on them, think the spooky scarecrow versus the alpine horn or wendigo plushy those really need to be audible to others so we know when peeps are playing with them.
---
More lit jack'o'lantern lights as floor decor.
---
More creepy laboratory stuff, organs in jars, rad rats, brains, perfectly preserved pie,  etc.
---
Trick or treat drop/loot bags. (Jack'o'lantern pales)
---
A means to pre package items of our choosing to drop as a gift to visitors. For example filled with Halloween candy,  or a new player gift basket (stims and ammo).  I would understand if not allowing legendaries to avoid the potential for duping. 
---
A candy bucket item we can fill with tricks or treats that others can loot. Please set it to be 1 per person per fast travel! (Also please do this for current drink dispensers!)
---
Treats examples = various consumable candies, buff foods, chems.
---
Trick example, super mutant parts, toxic goo, radaway, nukashine, tato salad,
---
Basically let us put whatever we want inside. Could expand this as new decore items that are a cooked meal that can be partaken from. 
---
Debatable if they should be consumed immediately or go into their inventory. 
---
Creepy mannequins. I know the display ones are inbound, but what about just the ones currently In game, nude or with their generic clothing. 
---
Then a variant one that changes position within the camp at random, anywhere an NPC an be.
---
A campfire of bones and skulls. Double as cooking fire??
---
A witches cauldron brewing station. Player animation drops creepy items inside when being used, rad road eggs,  super mutant feet, nuclear material, etc.
---
A flapping bat on a string ceiling decore item. Makes squeaks.
---
Lights that cast a beam of light in a certain direction,  floor, ceiling, or wall. Where we can chose the colors.
---
Would allow for unique lighting effects. Especially if they cast shadows from players and furniture. 
---
Also would love a means to make our camp interiors always be in a state of night. The lighting options at night are really great for setting creepy moods, but all that work is wasted during the day when the sunlight pierces through the walls and bleaches everything out.
---
Eggs/tato grenade type item that can be thrown at people or places. Toilet paper streamers grenade.
---
Decorative toilet paper, think the fassnacht wall/ceiling decore but are loops of toilet paper.
---
A creepy doll plush that plays a creepy nursery rhyme. 
---
Padded walls/door wall skin, for making creepy asylum designs. 
---
Blood stains/ bullet holes/ slash marks that are like stickers that can be placed on various surfaces. Also similar such wet stains/blood stains for floors or ceilings.
---
Floor decor headstones, with grave mound to put by them, to include an open grave mound.
---
A decorative mausoleum item. But please let these be placed anywhere.  Indoor grave scenes would be great for certain camp builds. Especially would love to have something that doubles as a portal to the floor below when jumped into. 
---
Seriously I'll gladly pay whatever the asking price is for this sort of stuff. I want to realize my dream of running a haunted house if at least only digitally   .o  ,
---
--------
---
P.s. really need a means to have players spawn reliably in a safe place in the camp like the old welcome mat functionality. Maybe set it up so it cant be within certain range of a damaging trap item.
---
Or adjust the CAMP device so that we can rotate the direction players spawn in. Always going north is highly detrimental to my visitors camp experience.  Let us be able to rotate it towards the south.
---
I wont even complain of it's just the old functionality returned and I get killed by a bunch of trap camps. I'm just wasting so much budget guiding players to the start of my camp experience when they should be starting at the front and not the middle or back. I lose so many sales because of that.
---
We both know this is not true. Only dupers got banned. Just stop making up stories to make others scared. Thank you.
---
Lore breaking
---
Wonder if that's a Motorama reference, if so, bless them.  One of my favorite movies no one has ever heard of.  It's like if David Lynch directed an Adventures of Pete and Pete road movie.

Want!

And the meat piles would grind the engine to a complete standstill

"oh no, the communism is working. Time to remind them that communism doesn't work!" Is peak american üòÇ
---
You're fine, even if you bought the plan and crafted it yourself.
---
The only offense would be travelling back in time to raid the devroom and molest W00by
---
You know they‚Äôre listening, right?
---
Would be even better for all the various melee blades.
---
Enclave!
---
Yes this is good, I was at the fasnacht event and this horrible dweller who was going around attacking everyone after it finished, he got no takers so they jetpacked up for the roof of the candle making store. They must have got lag and went way up, then fell to their death. Haha then it was a mad rush to get the booty between us bystanders 
---
Sucker
---
Take your Cyclops to either the Blood Kelp Zone, the Deep Grand Reef, or the border between the Mountains and Bulb Zone, and look for a huge subterranean cavern with a milky river running along the floor...
---
Er, woops, wrong game. Look for military grade duct tape, found in random containers the same way you'd find duct tape, or military ammo bags, usually found next to soldier corpses inside of those wrecked armored personnel carriers. There's also one in one of the rooms upstairs at the overseer's place. I think killing and looting a mothman also yields it, could be wrong, either way those things are even more rare than ballistic fiber.
---
Can I transfer my character data from win 10 to steam?
---
Scorched Eyebot

Try to change your build around a little to maximize damage or change your primary gun. It really changes the game. Put lots of time into a new base, make it one of the special ones. And when in doubt, launch 3 nukes on Earle and/or SBQ then sign off!
---
From windows 10?
---
I only took it yesterday but I only take 6% more damage solo with perks in a public team according to my pip boy. I havent noticed the difference. Im not bloodied though. I'm a "full health" build
---
Agreed
---
Nothing special really. I have/had Pharma finder perk before I had the recipes and just never used them so sold all I found. These days I rarely use Stims or Radaway so I keep a handful and sell the rest
---
My weapon route is same as most, Morgantown Trainyard, West Tec, Penitentiary, Bog Town
---
Honey, can you change the channel? I'm getting bored watching static!
---
I wanna be a cowboy!
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be a flat screen (well maybe a little)
---
Bring me ALL the spooky stuff!! üéÉüçÇüçÅüíÄ
---
That's actually not true. If they get reports for harassment they will do stuff. I had a name like SergeantCovid or something like that and they changed it to some random name. Why? Because haters reported it.
---
Maybe we can get iPhone pipboy skins too
---
Who needs ammo duping glitches when the excavator armor exists and there's that one mine with the moth cult that has a billion lead ore nodes. I think it's called lucky hole mine.
---
Be like my church. Blare a cover of thriller about jesus christ across seven blocks...
---
I... I was happy to see the cops shut them down. If they had more than one song it woulda been cute!
---
A cauldron brewing station skin alone would be great. And maybe easier to coax them towards making reality.
---
You'd think they'd have taken a cue from retail stores and would have Christmas stuff out already. lol
---
Theres apparently another round of the Treasure Hunter event coming. I think its been on the PTS. if you cant find it from other players you can get another chance at it there. It seems the loot pool might be kinder next time around because they took a lot of the rubbish out
---
I didn't want any of these items, so I didn't make any effort to claim them, so I feel I'm impartial here, but I really don't understand why it wouldn't be at least the standard week time frames they game seems to work on.  I mean, the window to get the reward was shorter than one of the turn in periods to earn them.
---
I fail to see the negative of giving people plenty of time to get these things.  Of course even if it had been a one hour window there would be people on here defending it, because they defend every choice they make no matter how imbalanced, player unfriendly, or nonsensical.
---
Exactly, it‚Äôll help every build not just bloodied.  A large volume of the player base is bloodied but even if you aren‚Äôt bloodied there‚Äôs a large chance that your playing with a bloodied.  Again, Spec Ops are around the corner so why not take every advantage to get to Elder rank.
---
*elevated screaming*
---
It's impossible.
---
No I like the game because its a playground for hacking.  It literally should be the tutorial game that any budding game hacker should start with.  It is literally like an open book with almost no protection what-so-ever.  We both like the game for different reasons, as I said I'm confused about yours as much as you are about mine.
---
In real life please
---
Nah. Retail store it. Have it out at July 5th.
---
How cool would it be to get a working freezer to store meat for longer. That way you can go hunting, and store the meat and thaw some when you need it. Really would make it more immersive.
---
I want to sell fast food. Specifically, cram burgers, crisps, and cola.
---
I've been saving up the non-perishable ingredients in the hope that Bethesda pulls their head out of their ass someday and gives us realistic food preservation.
---
Once you unlock the BoS gathering ability by owning the BoS Collectron, you can use that ability on any of the Collectrons you own.  You can mix and match gathering orders and Collectrons via the terminal.
---
It has came back within a bundle at least once (I purchased it then), but you are right, it was a long time ago.
---
I just want the poodle skirt to come back and I feel the same as you, only the same items/bundles are coming back...
---
What time does the sale start?
---
Makes sense that its loot pool isnt that great as it is one of the only collectrons that isn't purchased with atoms,  I'd be okay with it requiring a large amount of bullion or some sort to purchase in game.
---
Yes, but raising the standards is still good. I'd be good if it was just a skin b/c an orange fire glow at the bottom would be necessary.
---
Safest bet in the wasteland.
---
This^. Absolutely no crossplay with PC.
---
Yeah got a ton of items I'd love I just posted, but am always try to think of the simplest way for them to get it in the game with the least amount of effort, given the issues they have with other basic items.
---
I faced a scorch beast that had unlimited yell attack. Would never land and just screamed at me for 15 minutes while I killed it out of the sky. First one I ever fought, they have only gotten easier.
---
Better to link you to maps I use a lot as others may be interested:
---
[Fallout 76 Interactive Map Project](https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/)
---
[Fallout 76 Map](https://fo76map.com/)
---
There are 3 icons in a diagonal south of Foundation (the former Spruce Knob). My camp was close to the "middle" icon, "Spruce Knob Lake". It's one of the rare fast-travel locations that does not seem to have a no-build zone. There is a spot where two streams join a lake/pond which drains into a single stream going down the hill. You'll know you are in the right spot when you find a skeleton laying on a picnic blanket under a tree next to a swimsuit and a cooler. (There is a Magazine spawn on the blanket as well.) If you follow the stream to the bottom of this hill is the behemoth spawn.
---
Agreed! I can spend a lot of time searching for someone's vendors before I give up, which is frustrating bc i spend the caps to get to their camp &amp; bc I thought they might have something worthwhile. Doesn't happen all the time, a lot of people keep theirs in obvious locations, but every now and then it feels like they're hiding them on purpose üòÇüòÇ
---
Also keep in mind that the person that was there in the silo might have tried to steal your nuke. Sometimes people will wait until you insert the key card and then go in to launch the nuke themselves.
---
Fun fact young yea is actually doing that to a lot of games, literally in any subreddit for an online game I his name falls and how bad a game is. Sadly it‚Äôs because ‚ÄúControversy creates cash‚Äù
---
hmmm maybe ur right
---
 - Legendary scorched with poison, no idea.
---
 - Exploding mole rats (or any other non-robot), i've experienced a couple of times before, i assume is a bug.
---
 - Assaultron lasers are known bugs, will Bethesda fix them? No idea.
---
That took a turn for the horrifying, it‚Äôs possible that you where quick and enough to act, I would keep in mind that player‚Äôs user just in case
---
Yeah. I feel the same. My PC is pretty good considering I built it in Jan 2016. It turns Fallout 4 on most high and max settings. 76 has some bit longer load times and fast travel. I don't have any issues that ruin playing it.  
---
There are fog machines that I've seen they could use to just cover the top and a mix of red/orange around the bottom to simulate fire.
---
This is very helpful keep these coming man!
---
I can justify any price when it comes to Halloween cause....spoopy.

SmallAsainChild (yup misspell asian) I'm wanting to knock out some badges.

Huge shootout you say?
---
beth pls
---
Well, this involves having an empty room, put a wall with the door frame, place the tv where the door is supposed to go, then turn that door frame back into a regular wall. The tv will still be there in place and it will look like it‚Äôs built into the wall
---
PA + new legendary perk Energy Absorbtion = Assaultrons obsolete
---
That‚Äôs weird. He said the opposite of you kicking the bucket (reading comprehension). I think he just expects you to have some semblance of how the game works. It also sounds like he‚Äôs a little embarrassed for you.  You know, embarrassed for you because you die so easily in the game and want other people to make concessions for you due to your weakness and inabilities.    
---
At that point, just get on mic and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too weak to survive this trivial event, can someone please give be a better gun?‚Äù That way more total loot drops and someone is more likely to give you charity when they feel bad for you.
---
I get all of that. I have lost my fair share of junk to griefers as well. Most recently one shot a Vertibot down over my head and the falling debris killed me while i had several hundred bulk junk items. BUT you went about it all wrong. Had you written up a simple PSA showing the differences between the government aid drop and the nuclear keycard drops, then explained how new players could avoid being griefed by other players setting bounty traps I would have gladly upvoted your post and moved on. Hell, I‚Äôve been in the mood to give out gold and other rewards so you may have gotten one.
---
Instead you decided to accuse another member of the community of entrapping players to kill them and steal their junk. All while providing no proof that this player actually did anything you accused him of doing. Do you really not see the difference? Instead of doing your due diligence and gathering evidence you ran to Reddit to make a post plastering his picture next to unfounded accusations. By accusing another community member without evidence of anything other him being AFK, you are no better than the player who would do what you are accusing him of.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that warning new players about this system isn‚Äôt the right thing to do, I‚Äôm saying you went about it in a way that could actively hurt other community members. Myself and several friends will often request government supply drops in the Forrest and toxic valley to open them for new players, now other players may report us without evidence if they see us standing near what may or may not be an unlocked crate.
---
You may have the right idea of warning new players, but using an example that accuses another community member of something is the complete wrong way to go about it.
---
I've not experienced this myself but i've heard it's related to unlocked framerates - try using your graphics card control panel to lock your frames to 60 (just to test, raise it later of you want) and see if that fixes it.
---
I hope this gets fixed before Tuesday.  I was planning on a last hurrah solo of Earle before rifleman gets nerfed.
---
i have to say whats the big deal with ammo factories like this? Esp in a private world.
---
does that hurt you?
---
what about the Fo1 exploit thats used at Line in the Sand? The exploits to glitch thru nuke silos? The exploit to enter the mine before Earl starts so people show up to a dead boss?
---
Why arent you thinking of reporting those? Why is this ammo factory such a big deal?
---
That's pretty cash money. Nice.
---
We will rebuild!
---
Dumb question. But if you have the empath serum, how can you tell if someone else the group has it also?
---
Mind sharing your build? I tried to go gunslinger a little while back with the gauss pistol but it was pretty bad. RIP to that gold bullion. Might try it again if I get a good .44
---
All I want for Christmas is this:
---
&gt;Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as **expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence**.

---
The cosmetics are great, but I'm somewhat patiently waiting for these things.
---
Just calm down and wait.  The solution is that simple.  There‚Äôs a sob story once a week on here about impatience resulting in a deleted weapon, lost item or unintended sale.
---
Lay off the Jet.
---
Well yeah, that's what happens when your method of reward distribution is stupid.  Maybe if they just **provided it automatically to everyone who contributed**, they could avoid the headache of people missing the reward window entirely, but no, Bethesda does things with time limits on digital items that have no shortages.
---
Pretty sure it's this. I've got mine unlocked, 144Hz gsync &amp; ima use it, but lucky hole is a PITA for sure
---
Though it's basically moot with this game. Limit it to about 72 &amp; you'll still not cap out I'm willing to bet, regardless of hardware.
---
I think both factions were implemented in about the most boring and meaningless way possible.  Once the 10ish hour story quest is completed they essentially are just window dressing.    
---
Just 4 boring, repetitive fetch quests for both factions combined, and reputation is just a loot wall.    
---
No branching or more varied quests that unlock as you earn their trust, no faction vs faction competitive events, no community faction building events, no side quests from trying to interact with the various characters in the settlements to flesh them out as individuals...   Just robots that look like humans and a grind system that keeps you away from some loot for a while.  That's all.
---
I killed a Yao Guai Ghoul a couple weeks ago. Even got a screenshot. Felt like I found a unicorn... wish it came with its own mount.
---
i can't play every day, i only play once each season so pls put the BOS collectron back
---
I'm confused, since you are an Aussie, wouldn't you have fallen towards the sky when the CAMP disappeared?
---
Maybe just start granting these rewards automatically and avoid the trouble of a temporary claim window in the first place.  Just saying.
---
Nocturnal lead pipe!!!
---
Once you get over the content the game came with it honestly is empty.  Grind reputation/bullion.  Aimlessly hunt for a decent weapon.  Fuck around in your camp.  Wait for the next event.  That's bout it.
---
I love that little witch machine that just cackles, I hope that‚Äôs for sale again, I missed it last time.
---
It was pulled 24 hours early. Bummed, but hey, at least we know what to expect now.
---
I always put a door wall there because of that but it's annoying.
---
World War Z is another &amp; it's amazing. Crossplay has brought me &amp; my buddies back together for gaming in a major way.
---
I'm not denying there is some fishy stuff on PC but it's highly overplayed. 1000~ in and I've never experienced a single instance of what is claimed. Remember "squeeky wheel gets the grease" you'll rarely of ever see anybody post "hey I played on pc, didn't lose all my stuff &amp; have never seen a minigun rocket launcher" cause it isn't exciting.
---
Turn the tables I don't want the filthy console players on my PC servers. Feels shitty doesn't it?
---
There is so much shit about PCMR but the console players in the 76 sub are wicked into smelling their own farts everytime this gets brought up. If BGS wasn't so jeezlusly bad at coding their own game it'd be an excellent addition but you never see that mentioned either. Just noses held high. It's gross.
---
I'm not ranting at you, in particular BTW. "This community is so nice" versus the Crossplay topic are hilarious yet frustrating to me. One bad apple &amp; the whole batch is bad (Ôºç‚Ä∏·Éö)
---
I believe Halloween is the only holiday with which themed stuff works year round in game. I can‚Äôt stand Christmas, Easter, or St. Patrick‚Äôs day stuff year round, but Halloween just works. I guess with fallout it works, because the bombs dropped just before Halloween and there were decorations everywhere
---
I don't wanna live in that brain of yours.  It scares me.
---
;)
---
I wonder if the instanced camps will allow for something like this.
---
Not crying about it at all it‚Äôs all about efficiency more legendary‚Äôs I can get I can scrap in more scrip I get more of a chance I can get the potential god role from the purveyor for example the other day I got a junkies explosive 50cal I personally thing it‚Äôs a decent role but I‚Äôm gunna wait for the balance update to see where I‚Äôd like to go with my build it‚Äôs all about having options

I'm just glad you now understand what griefing actually looks like

Your friend will be lucky if he just gets his living room rug pissed on. There could be some fuckers that will show up to his house and beat the crap out of his car, steal his Creedence 8-tracks, and possibly even cut off his girlfriend's toe.

Does he not realize what happens when he tries to screw Bethesda in the game mechanics?
---
I'd hate even having the Xbox Gamepass masses actually.  I like my little PS4 world.

Nah sorey

I want a jack-o-lantern head I can craft from materials including a pumpkin.

Is this on PS4? Seems like very much the same CAMP I had traveled to almost 2 hours ago.

There is a flamer &amp; unrepaired pungi boards on the other side of the wall; after ducking into the room with the fireplace door. As soon as somebody activates the vendor the camp owner or friend repairs the pungi boards &amp; activates the flamer.
---
I also escaped through the fireplace door, went upstairs and sat in the throne. There was another player all ready sleeping in the bed.
---
You can also blueprint collectrons and place multiple at your camp ‚úåüèª
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I have a big group that launches nukes (when codes are working) about 20 times a day. We could definitely help you out!
---
Some of them walked away free. Not all.
---
Lolol you hit the nail on the head. He is probably a bloodied build going into a uranium mine which is a place with nice amounts of radiation exposure with an almost full health bar of rads and punishes other players by stopping their legendary gains because he's incompetent and doing something that's just all around stupid. Get rid of your rads and fill your health bar or die, don't ruin other people's time because you can't stay alive üòÇ shit I'd probably throw him one of the drops and other loot out of sympathy but he'd rather just stop everyone else from getting them altogether I guess
---
the ones on the site are the new codes that get sent to the client... but the server is only accepting last weeks codes apparently.
---
How they aren't linked, i don't know... but its possible they are trying to fix the security hole that allows for the key to be extracted at login.
---
It was part of the West Virginia bundle. Included the bear table and a coffee table in the shape of West Virginia
---
Now where know where the increases of these Junkies are coming from...
---
Thank you! Glad I didn't buy it, blinded by bear love.
---
Dataminer here. It actually works just fine. The problem is visual only. I'm planning on writing  a detailed post explaining exactly what's going on with it.
---
I have not played for a couple of weeks, but I did log a bug report on this for XB and PS. I noticed that Class Freak was not working during the latter part of the Legendary Run, starting in early-ish August. While I cannot confirm this, it seemed to have some connection to Strange In Numbers. I noticed this was happening when I'd group in a public team and someone was already sharing Strange In Numbers (I usually share that one, if the levels are above 75 or so in the group). Might have been coincidence though. Removing and reapplying Class Freak would *sometimes* work properly after this, but never on Speed Demon, as you called out. Other times, it would only apply to some of my 6 mutations no matter how many times I recycled the perk card.
---
I hope they fix it soon or I'm going to have to raid Uncle Owen &amp; Aunt Beru's moisture farm when Season 2 starts.
---
It‚Äôll probably come back around. It was a relatively popular bundle way back.
---
Bro is going off.
---
Laser Muskets haven't been invented yet. It's a prequel game.
---
A ladder flush with a wall would be amazing. I guess that would require a whole new climbing mechanic for characters or whatever üòï
---
Is the bos collector better than the others?
---
Its a bit north from WS , near a marked farm , a giant billboard has alot of cats roaming there + ammo box &amp; first aid box iirc. Had my camp there a long time earlier
---
They seem to be working far as I can tell.
---
Yes, PS4. and it would be 2 hours and 15 min as I type this.
---
I lost 2 nuke keycards to silo alpha yesterday. *Cries in endgame*
---
You have to destroy to get double-sided half walls and triangles. I spent the last few hours building and can confirm. Although I had a lot of trouble with triangles. A lot I couldn't get to work.
---
God damnit dudeüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I don't think it has been mentioned by Bethesda at all. I'm in the console-only camp though. I love my PC games, but 76 PC is bit too "Wild West" for my liking. I mainly want to trade items between my toons on XB and PS. Plus, I can recreate the pointing Spider-man meme at my camps. So, win-win.
---
Idk dude people can‚Äôt let other people have nice things I guess
---
I hope that sort of blackmailing will have serious consequences for the players do so, I won't mind even send police to their home for that sort of nastiness.
---
Sounds like your Internet cut out for a moment 
---
Weird timing
---
Yes, well, I feel violated now.
---
Nukacrypt has 2 sets of codes up at the moment. Seems to be server dependent from what they said.
---
Senator Kelly?
---
Wow, glad I checked Reddit. I thought it was one of the owner's friend's up there, because there was a group of at least 3. But it could have very well been you I saw! üòÖ
---
Found a 3star legendary Yao guai ghoul while looking for tameables today
---
*bethesda hq catches on fire*
---
Its like saying capture one gang member just make a new gang member join thus do not punish any of them, it made no sense. but its certainly better to have enforcement than not. It certainly would be nice somehow they can track the pattern and automate it though.
---
I can't imagine how hard it is that for Beth to do some queries to flag weps that clearly in the unexpected combo of legendary properties and remove them.
---
Lmao, easy fix, noice
---
Give people an inch and they‚Äôll take a mile.
---
Hey Bethesda - please take note:
---
I would spend atoms on a package called 'barbie wasteland dream camp'.
---
Nothing personal. See these posts a lot. Nobody kinda cares. Theres more wrong with this game than these workshop blueprints
---
I had one...someone i was friends with dropped it in mine
---
Its meh...obvs in a private world you can put almost 30 a workshop but at the end of the day its ammo. And like i said just having one in ppls camps isnt game breaking
---
Used on enemies...nobody cares how many rounds someone is carrying. If it was /stimps/weapons then hell ya fuck em
---
But ammo? Not a big deal imo...esp in a private world
---
If they didn't ban mass dupers then this is very low on their list
---
Where is Liberty Prime when you need him&gt;?
---
Your information is incorrect. It's been thoroughly analyzed in the Datamining Discord, and the results have been published for everyone to see.
---
Armor penetration effects work as before, i.e. the effectiveness of AA on a weapon is reduced a lot by having armor penetration from other sources - perks or magazines essentially.
---
So if you don't have room for armor penetration perks or can't/won't equip a magazine with armor penetration, AA is almost as good as Junkie's. If you do get armor penetration from other sources, that 4% gap gets substantially wider.
---
This. Once I finished, I decided to stop until the next season. I'm personally not into the gold/rep grind - still have to finish Wastelanders on XB but did on PS. I played every day on 2 platforms and it left me crispy. Next season, I'll alternate days and hopefully be able to finish on both.
---
Weapons are indeed getting nerfed, with the exception of unmodded weapons.
---
Now people are whining saying that they should bring back *all* the rewards. I swear this community annoys me sometimes. Bethesda will give people an inch and people will end up wanting a mile.
---
I throw explosive bait at those camps. Unless they're creative... punji boards are lame.
---
I don't get the fun in it. I can't imagine you get more junk that way than just finding it yourself. Seems like trap camps are more a childish Ha Ha moment than anything else.
---
On Pc your character data will be shared between all 3 platforms (Bethesda launcher, steam and Windows store), however fallout 1st and atoms will not transfer. Eg. if you have 800 atoms on the gamepass version, if you buy the game on steam, you will have 0 atoms. So you need to cancel your fallout 1st sub if you have it and spend any atoms you have in your account before making the switch.
---
yes, but because of marsupial it's twice as beneficial for us, so we land on our feet in the sky :)
---
They need to be low level I think
---
but likely they can do us back ... legally, which is no fun.
---
Yea very true I was just so worried for him because a lot of my other friends where saying shit like ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt do it you‚Äôll get banned for sure‚Äù but I‚Äôm glad It‚Äôs not a big deal
---
line in the sand is the closest thing we've got. Lol
---
The pet has to be in a random encounter plan. I have tamed 2 deathclaws and only have 3 charisma with animal friend. You don't need to add. Just sneak up close and hit the button. What platform are you on?
---
If you're not Robert House, you couldn't afford a wall-mounted television.
---
Was it at that monument up by Crater? I had a pack of them spawn there before.
---
You're telling me the BASE damage of weapons has been nerfed?
---
I'd love that so much
---
I‚Äôm thinking of making a haunted house random players can come through and give them ‚Äúcandy‚Äù at the end of if there are cool Halloween items coming!
---
Thanks so much for this. Now I have no other reason to not switch to steam except cost lol
---
Only needs to be half your level, but the ones I have tamed have all been like level 20
---
You only need animal friend. but you can only tame animals that spawn as part of a "scene encounter" random spawn. Basically, use [this map](https://i.imgur.com/JxLe1Qp.jpg) to travel around to the different spawn point locations and hope you are lucky enough to have a tameable creature spawn in. You may need Wasteland Whisperer to tame a Snallygaster, but otherwise all the other creatures I have come across (deathclaw, sloth, mirelurk etc.) have been tameable with just Animal Friend Rank 3.   
---
You will know if it is a tameable spawn, as the animal should be alone and will not be hostile towards you (its health bar may show in red, I can't remember, but it will not attack you).   
---
Assuming you have animal friend rank 3 equipped simply walking up to the creature or aiming at it with a non scoped weapon (so ironsights or red dot sights, no scopes) should give you the option Tame aswell as Pacify, both with different button presses. On PC it is E to tame and R to pacify. Once you tame the creature, it is best to fast travel away, as the pet will make its way back to your camp, if you stay with it the entire way you can trigger enemy spawns in that may kill it, whereas if you leave it by itself to make its way to your camp, it shouldn't activate any enemy spawns.
---
We cant even launch nukes right now. Wdym. End game and mid game are both broke. I like the game and what they are doing but its not praise worthy atm.
---
So the giant eye soar of a tree at Tanagra town has Ultracite veins in it. If you nuke the town, climb the tree, farm the vein, you get scorched spawns. If the veins don‚Äôt disappear after the first farm. You can again smack it and more scorched will spawn.
---

---
&gt; Is this to be implied that game mods - like those from Nexus Mods - are  allowed, and isn't a bannable offence so long as the mod itself complies  with the ToS? 
---
The answer to that is pretty much Yes. There is some grey area because that section of the TOS makes it sound like only mods authored with an official mod editor tool from Zenimax are considered mods for the purposes of this section, and as far as I know there is no such thing. In practice, though, Bethesda can and does prevent you from running a modded game in Nuclear Winter but lets you run a modded game in Adventure. Also, the CMs have occasionally reminded people to update their mods when there is a game client update. Which I take to mean that they know about those mods and are basically OK with them.
---
But IANAL and all that jazz.
---
There‚Äôs only 3-4 completely overpowered hacked weapons:
---
Handmade with splitter 
---
.50 cal with splitter
---
Nuke firing minigun
---
They would literally need to run a diff comparison of mods not able to be on certain guns. Miniguns with beam? Come on, I do this for work with huge swaths of data.
---
You joke, but I wouldn't blame it on age. My understanding is that VATS exists in Fallout games at least partially because the games having a less than stellar gun system.
---
That theory has been proven untrue, some youtuber was able to tame a level 91 scorched deathclaw when he was only 20 levels or something higher than it. The high level pet spawns always revert to lower levels upon relogging into the game though, I think this guys deathclaw ended up being back down at level 21 instead. However it proved that you didn't need double the level of the creature, the only determining factor as to whether or not you can tame an animal seems to be if you have animal friend rank 3 and if the animal is part of a "Scene type" random spawn.
---
I don't believe I said that, but feel free to quote me directly if you disagree.
---
That being said, any player using weapon mods, mutations, perk cards, chems, etc that boost damage will see a nerf. That's 99.999% of the player base. The other fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent are the players coming out of the Vault for the first time.
---
Jack o lantern helmet
---
Only specific animals can be tamed, they only spawn at set locations
---
I've gone back to finishing up earning all the scout badges.
---
Raider collectron all day. Tyvm.
---
It would definitely help with some Cultist builders like myself. The Wise One demands I build a proper aesthetic for Appalachia.
---
Yeah the game is fun but there's so much wrong with the game. End game content is pretty much not existent, there's year old game breaking bugs that are still to be fixed etc etc
---
Nukes are bugged right now, so chances are your brother didn't actually mess up the code.
---
Also, if you do find yourself in that situation again, you can freely leave the silo and come back without having to re-run the entire place again. In the storage section (where you replace the mainframe cores) there is a terminal that opens a door which leads back to the first corridor after the ID area, if you open that on your way through the silo it makes dying or having to fetch a card and run back that much easier.
---
There have been times where I assumed I had a card on me but I didn't, got through the launch process only to find out I have no card (oops, should have listened when i went through the grid at the start). But then I just FT to whitesprings bunker and call in a keycard drop location, go shoot it down and go back to launch.
---
If they ban people with them that would screw people over since they aren't even removable, if someone else on your team places one your fucked
---
To be fair....the ENTIRE game of Fallout 76 was recordings until wastelanders came out.  You should be used to it....just sayin.
---
Ballistic Bock dosnt effect heavy guns. Just found that one out. Dosnt make sense much I feel. Commando is way stronger then Heavy Guns when done right and paired with stealth.
---
The other person in this thread implied it.
---
Will give this a try. Thank you!
---
It helps you too

I don't think you can

No.

It's roleplay for me. I just can't imagine being a wild crackhead.

If anyone on Xbox missed it HMU and I‚Äôll build one for you for free if you can give me the materials for it

Be careful, don't want to get flagged by the new TOS. ;p
---
1 it's a drug that grants +5 Charisma and increased weapon accuracy (which stacks btw) 2 idk but you can get the plan from doing Project Paradise and that's also where you get one of the ingredients
---
LOL
---
Just means someone liked a comment enough to waste a few dollars.
---
I love that perk you can just disassemble robots to the point they self destruct.
---
Are you getter Getting endurance bonuses from your armor? Because you loose those when you enter power armor.
---
It's funny because Elder Scrolls Online had the same issue where people were selling ingame items on ebay but Bethesda actually did something about it. There's clearly a game they care about and one they don't.
---
I really wanna see if I can collect all of those vital equipment quest items. Not because you can use them to auto complete dailies, but because I have a bad habit of trying to steal and keep quest items. It‚Äôs a weird hobby.
---
(So far I have the multiscope and intrusion module from Vital Equipment, Dry Kindling from Campfire Tales, a Barrel from Pass The Buck, two out of three cans from Feed The People, and a few different parts from The Messenger. Don‚Äôt even know what I did to be able to keep them, I just found them in my misc section one day and from there I wanted to see what else I could steal from events.)
---
Anyone on PS4 wanna help me with my little vital equipment collection I could pay ya. Or maybe tell me how to acquire more of them?
---
Do you have an under armour on? You also lose that when entering pa
---
I agree! What's coffee?
---
Lyrics?!
---
But if you had no expectation it wouldn't even be around for a week, like anything else, why would you?
---
It just won't be free, which might explain why the time period was so short.
---
uhhh.... it is still *very* mainstream to hate the game.
---
Go to /r/gaming and even suggest to people they should try it on Gamespass for 1$ and you get downvotes. Source is my own personal experience.
---
&gt;Do events you do not normally do
---
That implies events are spawning!
---
And now all the people who were shitting on people who missed them will be applauding beth for making a good choice.
---
Imagine this game turbine into a post apocaliptic GTA
---
Its accessed through your hotwheel. Up on d pad then triangle on PS4
---
Mutations occur "randomly" to everyone.  Plus the Enclave developed mutations to use on their members to enhance them.
---
I'll have to look when I get home thank you
---
The thing when leaving the vault is just the CAMP builder. Your tent will be on your weapon/favorites wheel. Look at the bottom of the screen and there should be an option for it.

Speaking of fixer drops I once got a 2 star bloodied from the queen, still is my main weapon, havent found anything else close to its power in vats. And just like the other people I cant remember getting a single 3 star from the queen, it should be made a guarentee and take out all weapons that first appear at level 10ish, as well as most of the joke weapons, like the rolling pin, just so the drops are slightly better
---
Everything is getting nerfed in p22. Bloodied commando is still going to be your best bet. You will probably want to be outside of pa though. So you can sneak better, get uny boosts, and use vats without draining your cores
---
I dont think a fcking KANGAROO TAIL APPEARS RANDOMLY
---
They both will work.  The Stalkers would technically be better in VATS but the vampire's might be more useful.
---
That and putting the items that everyone actually wants only in bundles with curtains and wallpaper. Obviously it's just a marketing tactic to get you to spend double the price of any other similar item by buying a bundle that only has one item you want in it.  The atom shop in general is pretty high on marketing fuckery.
---
Bloodied auto rifle with unyielding secret service armor or bloodied heavy gunner in pa.  Your choice, but these are *the* two builds in the game.
---
They really should create a few different haunted houses for players to visit - would be a blast.
---
Yeah. I thought it was a weird glitch or I was on an extreme mode or something
---
Blame that on the dev's.  Mutations, evolution doesn't work like that.  Radiation can cause weird things though.
---
I got a bloodied vats crit fixer from the queen once, and I can guarantee that's the only good drop I've gotten from scorched earth,
---
yeah wasn't stressed at all, didn't have any junk so don't know if they were being jerks or just having a laugh and giving people back their junk. being my first was just disappointed the first attempt failed
---
It's bugged out this week. I think there's no codes on pc and last weeks work for xbox. Not sure on ps4
---
What exactly do you mean?
---
This guy gets it.
---
It may not be on them to give incentives to be considerate but they could at least stop giving DISincentives. The xp and legendaries you get in Rad Rumble outweigh the rewards you get for completing with enough ore, especially if you have all the rare drops. Same with Guided Meditation, the consequences of failing don't matter if you just want to farm. Manning the jukebox in OVN means you might be swarmed by ghouls when the legendary spawns and have to count on everyone else there just doing a little tagging damage and waiting for you. All it takes is one person camping spawns at Uranium Fever to screw someone who plans to tag and share out of the legendaries.
---
Yeah, people should be considerate on their own! I'm a bloodied build and it drives me nuts when other bloodieds complain about just how hard it is to do less damage. But a consistent problem with public events in this game is often the best rewards come from fully ignoring the objectives the game tells you to do, and until that mismatch is changed "just be considerate" unfortunately won't go very far.
---
Yup. That's why I said some manager at Bethesda.
---
I'd wait till the damage nerf hits (15th I believe) to decide what direction you want to take your character.  I understand rifles take a pretty big hit.
---
Hey dude, I'm a level 150 bloodied commando/heavy build, and as with being bloodied, all the damage over time areas will kill me instantly, but I'll try to help where I can, gt is the same as my username
---
FUCKING   Y E S ! ! !
---
Also just to add, all your Atomic Shop purchases carry over no matter which store version you're playing - it's only the Atoms themselves that don't.
---
So if you have 800 Atoms now, spend 'em before you lose access to the Windows Store version (you don't have to spend them right away though, they won't disappear if you swap version - but you can't spend them if you can't access the Windows store version in the future)
---
Eh junkies pa heavys also do really well. I played bloodied pa heavy for 150 levels and junkies pa heavy for 200 levels now and I must say I prefer junkies haha
---
But for commando bloodied is the only way to go. I'll give you that one haha
---
I was mostly speaking of other sites, I'm sure there's a lot of that on reddit still.  Remember how every article framed it as a piece of crap at release?  I hated that.
---
The bloodied heavy gunner in PA sounds amazing, but surely you need to be high level for that, isn't it?
---
You do more damage with all the other bloodied benefits though.
---
Thanks for the advice! If you see any build that you recommend me, I'll aprecciate it.
---
Westek is probably the best overall spot.  Mutants give the best XP for effort, and there are like 30 of them.  Kill um, hop server.  Be sure to get your INT as high as possible, sleep before hand, and get some xp boost foods like cranberry relish or canned meat stew.
---
Not really.  You need to be high enough to have pa, obviously.  Are you on pc?
---
I like 76 but no, not even close.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about them , it completely f‚Äôs their camp budgets and then they cry on reddit for sympathy because they are morons, it‚Äôs always ‚Äú my friends ‚Äú fault too lol
---
You do a bit more damage. I can still kill a 95 behemoth quicker than it can stand up haha
---
You definitely do more damage. But as junkies you die less and don't have to manage your rads.
---
I wasn't saying your wrong, just that junkies pa heavys also kick some serious ass
---
Save all the hassle by dropping the item straight in the storage of players that help. Will say fallout is played all around the world. I bet there people from other countries that have missed certain rewards because of going on holiday for a national holiday
---
I have a rifleman build now, it‚Äôs fun sniping regular enemies but pretty rubbish in boss fights. Switching over to commando as soon as I have all the perk cards unlocked for damage. My Fixer can headshot most enemies when sneaking anyway...(not nearly as satisfying an experience but oh well)
---
I don't really die, really easy to deal with.  Rads are super easy to manage with toxic goo and diluted rad away
---
My favorite of these enemies is the blood eagle with a green flame emitting weapon. Melts you in seconds when he gets the jump on you.
---
No. Not even close.
---
I would like that one ;)
---
Oh do one mate you‚Äôre boring
---
Lol it's still my main, you ain't getting your hands on it yet!
---
I know haha, like I said I spent a good 150 levels bloodied. Not really here to argue, just offering another opinion
---
Sent you my GT. If you want help I can see about lending a hand after I get done with work tomorrow.
---
Welp, time to get some booze, and a gun

There's my junkies pa heavy. I run vamps most of the time and junkies for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and love it (can easily be switched to bloodied if you want. Just need to lose a few ranks of gunsmith and throw in nerd rage)

---
And there is my bloodied stealth vats commando build. Don't play it as much but have found it very solid
---
Honestly, you hit the nail on the head and into the coffin. With the big kaboomski just before Halloween, there is both in game availability and tons of gaming assets to exploit. Plus, as you said, a lot of long term use.
---
Freddy's needs some spooky love.
---
Been promised it for ages on console it would make things so much easier for us but still not sign of it.
---
Thanks mate!
---
I lost 4
---
Living in the NCR almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
Your camp was at the left of the Ammo factory, right? Think I was in your public group. Super confused about constant kills and revenge pop-ups lol. So thats what happened. Too bad about the nuke situation...
---
Oh that's interesting I did not know this I think I'll give it a try! Ty.
---
Nope, I'm on PS4, but I suppose I can start with Raider Power Armor or something, right? The problem will be the fusion cores, I don't know how to get them.
---
Of course happy to help! If you've got any other question I'm always happy to help if I can. Most of my 1.3k hours in game have been spent with heavys though haha. If your on xbox I can help you out with some gear as well
---
Heavys are a bit tough in the beginning since they eat alot of ammo. And you don't get perks for them till your mid 30s. And the lowest level heavy is 25
---
I wish there was a 'Solar Powered' equivalent legendary effect.
---
Sure it might take a lot of rolls and double the weight - but a matched Nocturnal/Solar duo could be right up next to junkies with less drawbacks.
---
If your on PC I can drop you tons of lead scrap.... And I mean like 100k or more...
---
Make an alt character and transfer the stuff over to them.
---
Works for exterior walls as long as you can place another foundation or floor down first, then put both of your door frames up, then remove the extra foundation or floor.
---
Just get them from power armor frames.  Every time you see one check for a fusion core.  They are only at 25%, but they're everywhere.  Get the intelligence perk that reduces energy ammo weight because it reduces the weight of FC's by 90%.  Batteries Included, lvl 28
---
Yea no, I'd rather not have to endure seeing Thomas the tank engine running past me sounding like a PA. 
---
For every cool thing that adds to the game, there would be 10 that detract.
---
There are basically two ways in Fallout 76 to reduce incoming damage: damage reductions and damage resistance (DR). Damage reductions are applied before damage resistance, which is why you do so little damage against Earle and the SBQ - they have inherent damage reductions of 80% and 70%, respectively before their 400 and 300 armor rating, respectively.
---
Any DR you get from armor, including the defense mod slot, is basically free (apart from carry weight), i.e. there are no other defensive considerations to take care of. Which means that with Scout, Heavy Combat or Secret Service armor, you get to around 300 DR as a starting point
---
Increasing DR beyond that point has opportunity costs because it happens via legendary effects (there are loads of them to consider), perks (same deal) or mutations (which have negative effects, which in turn can be mitigated by a perk). And there are in almost all cases alternatives that are just plain better than heaping on more DR/ER:
---
Perks that give you DR/RR are considered weak because you might as well spend those perk points on either more damage, which translates into less time for a mob to deal damage to you, or perks that reduce damage: Blocker gives much more defensive value for your perk points than Barbarian. Dodgy+Action Boy/Girl is way better than Evasive and Moving Target provided you have the AP to spare. Serendipity is so much stronger than Junk Shield that the latter is hardly worth mentioning except as a joke.
---
As for legendary effects, at the aforementioned 300 DR, 15% damage reduction does about the same defensive job of reducing incoming damage as adding 250 more DR. A full Vanguard's or Bolstering set adds a mere 175 DR at maximum effectiveness. So a full set of Vanguard's and Bolstering is objectively worse than a single piece of mob-type specific armor (Zealot's, Troubleshooter's, etc.) against that mob type. Which means that having one piece each of Zealot's, Troubleshooter's, Mutant Slayer's and Ghoul Slayer's is better defense against the four most common mob types in the game than a full set of Vanguard's or Bolstering, and you still have one 1\* legendary armor mod slot free for something else, say Auto-Stim or Life-Saving. More DR doesn't help against Mirelurk royalty or insects anyway because their danger comes from staggers and/or poison. Animals are basically only dangerous due to their staggers and melee damage, and I have yet to come even close to being in mortal danger from a group of raiders.
---
And we haven't even considered the insanely strong Sentinel's, Cavalier's and Blocker 3\* effects.
---
In essence, the only instance where Vanguard's and other DR increases are possibly better than the alternatives is Earle because he and his brood don't fall into any of the mob types covered by a legendary prefix. And even in that fight, fire resistance and poison resistance seem to do a better over-all job of keeping you alive than more DR.
---
**TL;DR** even if the diminishing returns effect on DR/ER is weak where effective health is concerned, stacking DR beyond what you get from armor is still, in almost all cases, a worse idea than going for other defensive options.
---
If you'll be able to be around 8 hours from now, I'll gladly take 2k lead. I don't wanna get too overkill, y'know? What I need is acid or gunpowder. If you're able/willing to part with 2k of both or either that'd be cool.
---
Alr then recreating nv would take a minimum of 5 years due to bethesda losing assets from fo3 and nv in updates to their program they use, none of the people who made nv are still at obsidian, only about 2 to 3k of people would play a new dlc for it as its 10 years old, it barely make any money due to it not being on ps4 xbox 1s ps5 as it only be on pc now can you see the problem with a remake/new dlc
---
Ooh a haunted house theme would be cool. Decrepit Victorian architecture and gothic furniture and lots more candelabras and candles, wallpaper and rugs.  I really just want my camp to look like the house from What We Do in the Shadows. Or the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland.
---
If you mean w.o.w as in World of Warcraft- not a fucking chance honestly.
---
I must point out, although the inventory hacking was pretty bad... Bethesda restored all my character (copying it) and gave me like 6k+ atomic points. I now have four characters all at level 200+. And it was my garbage alt with almost nothing got stolen, so I received one additional main character with all the good shit. üò∂
---
What is it? Just started played again last week
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bother with builds at that level
---
Even beyond that, Halloween just always works in games for me
---
I hope not. üò¨ For reasons too numerous to list.
---
I'm spending this week earning possum badges.
---
There is a semi-working fridge, but honestly I think it's got something like 15 slots and only reduces spoilage by 50% so it's not terribly useful. I'd be okay with having to give the thing like 10 power if it was as effective as the perk, "Good With Salt". It already carries the disadvantage of both requiring stash space, as well as only being accessible via stashes, so it's not like it was ever really going to be a replacement for the perk.
---
I wish we could stack drugs to become OP like the Commonwealthers of Fallout 4. Sadly, the denizens of West Virginia can only use one drug at a time.
---
It's a Bloody shame.
---
The problem is if they introduce laser musket it breaks the lore of the game. The minute man hasn't exist yet so no laser musket yet.
---
I did have a laser musket b4, someone visit my camp and gave it to me during Christmas. They gun was showing dealing 3k damage to max level super mutants but it was really only dealing a few hundreds. So yeah, although its in the game it's bugged and broken.
---
They should turn Morgantown high school in to a haunted house
---
If you don't mind me asking, how do you have the nuke codes so early? I'm genuinely curious how it's possible to have them before the word gets revealed.
---
I'm pretty new so if there's like an EZPass or something I'm probably not aware of it
---
I get where you are coming from with the question, no doubt you will here simple flat out out no from everyone.
---
They are right, there is no way any game is ever going to achieve the level of following that WoW has. That being said if Bethesda didn't make so many mistakes from the start with 76 it could have had a huge following. Fallout itself has a massive cult following, so if they could have got everyone who loved fallout onboard as well as attract a new player base it could have been an epic game. Sadly too many people have been let down too many times.
---
Made of Bethesdium....it just works!
---
I'm on PS4 and PC. No hate. I might get it done one day but thanks for the offer.
---
i wasted 4 key cards.
---
It always kind of bothered me when people refer to Fallout 76 as a MMO. It's not massively multiplayer. There are only like 20ish people on a server at a time. MMOs have thousands. So comparing Fallout 76 to WoW just seems like apples and oranges to begin with.
---
It's not that bad really, all you have to do it go to west tec or a fissure site, and sit in the glow for a couple seconds, and you're back to bloodied status, and even better you can carry the west tec f.e.v. with you to pop when you need to use radaway in queen fights
---
Bethesda is too incompetent to pull that off.
---
Or you could maybe save up yourself?
---
Once a level 12 or so appeared over at my camp (out in the cranberry bog) and started attacking me with his fists, so i gun bash him once to see what he wants to do, and then he pulls out an explosive laser rifle and blows my camp to smithereens
---
5000 scrip ready to go, plus 3000 during the sale.  The last 50% sale got me four god roll guns, so I‚Äôve been prepping well in advance for this one.
---
Default is scroll wheel then press t
---
The most fun I've had in this game was nuking a workshop, taking it over, and then fighting 4 waves of glowing ghouls while also fending off the angry group of players that I took it from.
---
They‚Äôre heavy to discourage hoarding.  I never carry more than three.
---
I would be down.  I kinda want to make a haunted house
---
Indeed :P
---
Games like wow have benefited from a hype wave that propels the game to higher user engagement once there the company can sustain that engagement or fail their player base.
---
76 started out digging it's own grave. Since then it's been clawing it's way out of a hole and simply trying to get some fresh air. The stigma around the game is too much. You still see players here on reddit saying "I never played the game because of the bad rep it got and now I'm trying it out."
---
However what will eventually lead to this game being something to deeply enjoy and suck players in more will be user generated mods and private server owners. There, people will be able to cultivate a world full of things. When you have no financial incentive but just work purely for the love of it great things can come from it.
---
Exploding mole rats are real and intentional. They are mole miner pets. The other two are bugs, though.
---
What's on the 15th?
---
Yes, limited time giveaways are fine. The Santatron will probably be free this Christmas as well, don't worry about it
---
&gt; Your unoriginal name speaks volumes on your personality.

ü§°üëç
---
Never played wow,  but a couple of my friends do , and what i have seen of it i¬¥d say not even close. 
---
Played Eso since release and i dont think FO will even get close to that. 
---
I like this game alot but i just cant see it happenning if i understand your question correct
---
Any downsides to it?
---
If the overgrown bats are melting you from range, try equipping the fireproof perk lvl2 (Endurance). They aren't too bad to deal with,  except for the visual clutter.
---
OMG!! 
---
FINALLY someone said what I've been thinking!! 
---
I HATE that voice &amp; I HATE the "Attention citizens..." Nuke drop voice...  
---
( Same voice I think)... At Whitesprings I lower the volume so I don't have to hear it. Makes my skin crawl.
---
Just that I‚Äôve used 3 points in my perks solely on food, but it also restores health so if you weren‚Äôt utilising unyielding armour and bloodied weapons it‚Äôs actually pretty darn good
---
Thank you, I played around w both, and the stalkers has like a millimeter more durability by default and trying to proc the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù is easier. HOWEVER its like an 80% chance that I hit my target if theyre aggro, and a 70% chance that I instakill (using level one of each of the 3 shotgun perks and enforcer)- so far Nuke Card drones resist heavy, Imposter Sheepsquatch resists medium (which I think is fine bc it lets everyone tag), and the Arktos Event Sheepsquatch has about the same resist as the imposter (which is fine bc of the previous reason and I got the arktos bag finally so Im sitting these out anyways). Havent tested on the queen, standard scorchbeat, event wendigo, or earle yet, but Id assume that Ill be doing a third or less of what I was doing on the imposter. The inspect damage says 375 and I am using hardened, ext barrel, and perforating mag for reference.
---
Yeah, it's a bunch of crybabies in here. The fan base is pissing me off more than Bethesda atm
---
Try Guerrilla with a full auto plasma pistol or an auto beam splitter laser pistol.
---
Add in the general damage modifiers like tenderiser, bloody mess and concentrated fire for four leaf clover head shots with crit savvy thrown in, plus maybe glow sights.
---
Modern Renegade seems underwhelming but does trigger fairly often with such a high fire rate . 
---
Burst fire to conserve ammo and avoid wasting carts on enemies that are already dead but haven‚Äôt realised it yet. Use Batteries Included to help carry all the ammo.
---
I don‚Äôt think plasma or laser can be silenced so stealth isn‚Äôt going to be too useful after the first shot. Gun Runner is good to keep mobile until you can get Speed Demon. Stay mobile !
---
Use Marsupial and Bird Bones to leap on enemies and land on a green jet of flame in a goo pile , or in a dissipating red spark cloud with a laser :)
---
In my opinion Guerrillas in particular need to be fairly specialised to get the damage up and casual addictions help with this and are easy to get and forget about. Eagle Eyes also helps.
---
Plasmas do seem to break quickly so take a few and laser backups . Swapping between cells and carts keeps the (very) high ammo usage rate manageable.
---
I'd have to decide which one of mine to eat.
---
Jesus, the Community event rewards has always been limited time only. It's because it's supposed to be fancy to have these rewards at your camp. It's an "I was there" item.
---
Noone puts baby in a corner!!
---
The pipe revolver can be the strongest rifle/pistol in the game.  It‚Äôs too bad that p22 is sending rifleman/gunslinger into the realm of irrelevancy.
---
I'm level 200+, and it never occurred to me. Thanks!
---
No one's getting banned for this. Still shouldn't do it to be safe but they have bigger mirelurks to boil.
---
There have been some pretty good responses. and i agree with most of them.
---
I asked this because I've heard a lot of buzz that fallout 76 could be the last fallout. And that Bethesda is trying to lead us to a road similar to wow, where they will just update the game and add content as the years go by, have seasonal events and such. Like what we're seeing now. and frankly, this decision would sadden me.. but honestly the way things are going, i see this actually becoming a reality. Cause Bethesda wouldn't have gon through so strongly and invested so much on 76 if they didn't see the game going on for what will probably be quite a long time.
---
That revolver is good enough that I‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat, or make a rifleman alt.  Only 15% faster reload would make it better.
---
Wait there are people that aren't using Nukacrypt.com the best way to get your weekly nuke codes
---
I have thru hiker 3 and good with salt 3 so I have 6 points invested in food already
---
I run empath haha. Would be great if everyone ran it. With strange in number it'd be a 99% damage reduction haha (not sure how its calculated but 33% per)
---
Any time!
---
Use trading forums.  If you‚Äôre sitting on junkie/ffr 50cals and plasmas I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get your fixer in a day or two.
---
Oh darn well I‚Äôm that case you could look at it this way, ANY humanoids are food.
---
Even old dead corpses, no need to carry them around etc so there‚Äôs no weight usage. 
---
And there‚Äôs no spoilage
---
[You mean, THIS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKNZJp2jmD0&amp;ab_channel=LammeTak)
---
I guess the game doesn't explain it very well, or it's easy to miss or whatever. But yeah, the code pieces are only needed if you want to manually decrypt the code you will enter into the keypad.  
---
If you just grab the codes of the website like everyone does, then the code pieces are not needed.
---
I'd probably make the Punkin Chucker utilize the Fat Man, but otherwise they're cute ideas.
---
I really liked the concept of the Striker from Fallout 4, utilizing the Fat Man launching platform to accelerate mundane objects. It reminded me of the fun the Junk Jet was in Fallout 3, but using the Fat Man just made so much more sense.
---
I basically have the same gun and I went with perforating magazine (I usually added piercing before).
---
I have loads of AP anyway and ignoring 40% of opponent armor is quite sweet and since you can 2/3 shot a mirelurk queen (until patch I guess) it's not like having a bigger drum is a must.
---
Of course you can always keep a 10/12 shots (or a quad)  as a backup for the lazy farming sessions... üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
[final fallout?](https://youtu.be/QVzzmnRNhno)
---
Here is a link to a good video aort of explaining the jist. With a stretch here or there...
---
You could also grab the carnivore Mutation and make it so any meat chunks are super effective too
---
The site has been around for so long that it's part of the game to me... I'm over 2000 hours play and never managed to find all 8 pieces myself , not even close.
---
Also need to enable it via atom shop. Needs the yellow tick in the left corner.
---
Epic
---
I find that hard to believe.  5k during any Purveyor sale always nets me at least one fantastic piece of armor or weapon.  If I can‚Äôt use it or it isn‚Äôt an improvement to my existing gear, I trade it for something that‚Äôs useful.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll mod your ultracite for you
---
I killed 2 snallygasters at the base of tree tops, where you expect them to be. Then when I got right to the top I had one spawn out of nowhere.
---
Your just fucked LMFAO
---
Still drunk.
---
That's already a thing.  I have one at my camp.  Food last 50% longer when in the freezer.  I think it was part of the red rocket pack on the atom store.
---
Get this. So my 2 star bloodied FFR shotgun takes 6-8 shots to kill a 1 star scorchbeast, but my 3 star bloodied marksman (same damage listed) does it in two shots. WTF? I've tried it multiple times.
---
Because no timed event item that wasn't added as a free item of the week on a Tuesday has ever lasted a week, most are up for a single day to a couple of days max.
---
Part of the problem is it isnt cosmetic only, which was what was originally implied. I don't really care, being able to store food isnt a massive gameplay advantage over other players so it isnt really p2w, but i understand the frustration with Bethesda that people have
---
Wish he'd wander a bit like Grahm. Would love seeing him stumbling through the wasteland talking to broken bits of bots.
---
I just want to play it on something that can go above  30fps,  thats literally it and everyone freaked out lol. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't want keyboard and mouse as well,  but bethesdas lack of keeping the community updated on their plans for the game i wanted to ask,  like I said,  going from 120fps to hardly 30(let's be honest,  console version struggles to even hit that),  so maybe I should rephrase it to chill everyone out,  do they have any plans to upgrade the frame rate atleast for next gen consoles?  It was very dissapointing to see they are for doom and eso but have not said anything about 76.  
---
The only info I've found is some people are claiming it'll only be a backwards compatible title which is extremely dissapointing,  which by that I hope its not the same exact thing just on a new system.  Just about every other studio is moving on from 30fps and id hate to see this game die off completely when it has so much potential still.
---
With all the lag in the inventory screen, you'd think the game performance would also benefit from separate storage boxes for weapons, armor, aid, and ammo.
---
I miss v94 because it made dying a bad thing.  
---
There‚Äôs no consequence for having a bad build right now.  The worst thing that can happen is people whining about minute long respawns in ACP because they have half their perks devoted to hoarding.
---
Makes no sense. If the player selects 42 for number of items he wants to make, check for Super Duper 42 times. Bleep, bloop, blorp, it's a computer. It can do it.
---
A Dunwich bundle? Would like some Dunwich quest myself.
---
Eh.
---
I've either been sitting at my camp waiting on grahm to stop by, or visit others camp.
---
I have it already
---
At that point atoms were far more abundant than they are now so the p2w argument never really held water when the currency was able to be generated by playing the game. 
---
I understand the argument that they were trying to make and it just did a lot more damage than good. We have the luxury of being able to look back at what has happened since and I don't think that the rift caused was worth it... But hey, maybe on some alternate timeline players are having to pay 1000 atoms per nuke launched.
---
Going to try *** but will stop after 2 garbage drops and try a different server. Seems like a decent drop initially increases the chance of getting one good weapon.
---
Exclusive weapon or armor skins would be amazing.
---
Ofc it depends what is usable for each person
---
Fridges overall need a rework.
---
80% reduction in spoil rate, can stack items together to only occupy one slot like Vendor Machines can, and their own separate weight limit that doesn't contribute to your stash (or go the coding route the Scrapbox did, where everyone has a list of all the food items attributed to them by default, and then the integer is just how many of each item it is they have).
---
Then add in a non-Atom store fridge plan that has a 60% spoil rate reduction to one of the Faction Vendors for Gold Bullion.  Requires some steel, plastic, aluminum and cryo cells.
---
all rewards unlocking with community events should automatically adds for players playing at least once during event without even log-in. 
---
But they are greedy,  log-in every day to make a chance to buy something from atom shop.
---
What. Really?
---
I just wanna add that no matter your build, go for these 8 perk cards as soon as possible ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;w=lm2au2at1ik0if2ii0iq2p10 ).
---
They are quality if life improovement and they are extremly necessary to make your endgame experience as smooth (pleasant) as possible. Content in the endgame (+50) require you to be as self-sufficiency as possible. Enemies are tougher, hit harder and activies can't put you against real bulletsponges !
---
At this stage of the game, you really need to be ready. You must know how to mass craft ammo and repair your stuff efficiently. Because if once lvl 50 you focus on polishing your build while you have any of these perk cards, trust me you will cry ! Everything will be too expencive to craft or repair, it will just be a messy grinding endgame experience for you ! 
---
You really want these perk cards before hitting lvl 50.
---
Focus on maxing these perk cards and your main weapon perk cards. They must be your priority. 
---
Also, go as soon as possible get the "Excavator" power armor plans ( a quick google research should get you on the good path ). 
---
Once lvl 45 you need to focus on building this baby so you can start farming lead ores in the "Lucky hole Mine" ( another quick google research should get you on the good path )
---
And to finish, install your camp next an Acid deposit so you can place an Acid extractor on it ( once again, a quick google research on "resource deposits locations" should get you on the good path ). You'll need Acid to turn your lead ores into useable lead. Here the perk card "Super duper" will really helpful...same when you'll be crafting ammo.
---
If you do it right, once lvl 50, polishing your build will be...smooth and easy. You'll have a pretty decent dps, no ammo issue and enough resource to fix your guns &amp; armors.
---
I suppose the 3 star gun has one "magical attribute" (instigating, limb damage, bashing damage, vats chance) while the other obviously doesn't.
---
Lots of good explanations about it on here, always worth a search...anyway, you can turn the bloodied into a magical gun by using a piece of armor with damage reduction when blocking (needs to be a native effect, modding a piece with braced will NOT work, sadly).
---
But I don't know if it will keep being magical after next patch in 5 days. üôÑ
---
I run Stealth/rifleman full health build and with an instigating lever action I can't one shot everything but I don't need to.
---
I would go for both which is get the first rank of each  commando / rifle man perk giving an extra 30% damage for both types of rifles and allows you to equip both sets. Then get tank killer and concentrated fire (if using vats) and max them out
---
I only have 3 points of charisma so use travel agent and tenderizer lvl 2.
---
Agility consider  action boy 3, stealth 3 covert operative 2 Mr sandman 1, adrenaline 3, I have thru hiker 3 as well as I think its a must have and I only use covert op 2 as it gives me x2. 15 sneak during the day but. With Mr sandman theat increase to x3.13 damage at night  whilst on stealth
---
Luck I go with good with salt and class freak and starched genes as I have loads of serums
---
If I'm in a  high rads area I'll through on a stealth suit otherwise I just use mix and match armour with the best legendary stats and cover it with clothes
---
The 33% hit on your marksman one is a bugged effect, there are several. It bugs out the VATS damage through the roof.
---
Would be great, but I assume they don't do this as they want you to actively open the Atomic Shop, hoping that while in there you might also grab something that's not free. Sad but actually logical from a business POV.
---
Also, they can sell the stuff later on again if they want.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree with you, but to say it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs fault and wait for their mechanics to change in order to promote a more considerate community is defeatist. That won‚Äôt happen anytime soon and it becomes an excuse to ‚Äúone shot‚Äù. The more this happens the more elitist the game becomes, which in turn disenfranchises new players. Without new players it won‚Äôt matter what Legendary items you have, the game will cease to be.

Making mistakes from the start, continuing to make mistakes, and failing to correct them.

That's not the issue, Pete said outright that microtransactions would be for cosmetics only. Regardless of earning it in game (you could do this with Battlefront 2 as well technically and look at the shitshow that caused) this is still clearly another lie from someone high up at Beth around 76 and that soured a lot of people
---
I see everyones concerns, but the pc players aren't the problem nor is pc,  its bethesda,  they could stop the hacking if they put in the effort,  players on all platforms are always looking for ways to cheat the system,  its every game ive played,  just like the duping on consoles,  stealing from stash boxes,  magic weapons,  and the ridiculous level 5 guns with 800+ damage, people are always going to cheat if the game allows it which is due to bethesdas laziness.  Allowing crossplay with nw wouldnt be fair in the slightest,  but adventure mode? We can't act like the pvp is balanced at all there lol. Just give people the option atleast is all im asking and I would be fine if they just atleast boost the frame rate on next gen consoles as thats what my original post is about in the first place.  Watoga and Morgantown are damn near unplayable on the one x,  and i can't even imagine people on the og xbone and ps4,  just give us more of an incentive to not give the game up when the new systems come out.
---
Take my money.
---
Son of a Billy Bun! Just traded a 3 star explosive fixer for two two star FFR bloodied shotguns and they both end up doing less damage without the bug &gt;&lt;
---
Do you see people in wheelchairs and ask them what happened too? Cause idk if you know but you usually don't ask things like that
---
Excellent,  marked it on my calender.
---
Slow down there Mr. Moneybags
---
Once on my lvl 62 mule some 300 kept shooting me and gun bashing me and doing the taught, little did he know this was my PvP character so I had full assassin sent, quad tesla, JE laser rifle ect, JE turned around, popped med x, some mags and a stealth boy and whoosh I was gone, then out of no where he gets decimated by a railway rifle, he then goes on voice chat and berates me saying I'm sad, bad at PvP(which is true to a certain extent), that I should get a life. Lesson: Don't judge a book by its cover and don't hit my mule again
---
Had it myself the other day and let him have a taste of my exploding minigun
---
Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre not all like that
---
Yeah i guess it would be like the recon but me personally I don't like using the recon scope
---
Oh lord it wouldn't be beautiful. üòÇüëç
---
I do agree, although to be fair they have fixed a lot of bugs and done a lot of balance changes. The amount of new content as well is quite good. I always try to bare in mind the fact that they are working on fallout 5 alongside maintaining 76. So I can forgive them their failings providing when 5 drops I revert back to a hobbit teenager locked in my bedroom not showering for weeks.
---
I finally finished Dying Light, so there‚Äôs a positive
---
The only thing that could kill a Blizzard game is Blizzard themselves.
---
I hope you know he was joking
---
I agree with you,  ive ran into mostly good players on steam and xbox, i can honestly only think of a few times ive ran into toxic players. but you cant bring something like this up without it always turning into the childish console war,  theres always something to bitch about for people.  Like seriously not a problem if you make it optional.  Pc players have no business in nw though. Lol.
---
Hey man, it's survival of the fittest lol. And if you're bad at pvp he must be god awful because you smacked him. I'm not good at pvp if you ask me but shit, Ive killed more players than players have killed me, as Ive only killed a few player either defending my ammo factory workshop by hiding in the basement peeking and shooting from the windows while my turrets distract, or trolls like the guy I posted about. So I mean by kill/death standards I guess you could say I'm good üòÇ
---
I really want a good exploding heavy weapon. I have an exploding railway rifle but I have never used it as my only real build I have right now is a heavy and I have a 2nd character I'm making for rifles but it's only like level 9 as I love my heavy lol for now the best I've got is a three star vampire flamer, just need to get more damn fuel
---
Yeah, well I am mediocre, I have a stash of stealth boys, 200 med x, quad tesla, quad railway, oh my favourite, the AAE cryo, I love seeing them frozen and not being able to stim and fire slower, I use an AAE cryo and my friend can get them while they are moving really slowly
---
Yeah I know, don't worry. I just wanted to rant about it and I felt good about actually killing him lol. I've met some pretty cool players who have helped me out extremely And I always try to pass it on whenever I can to newer players to keep the cycle going
---
Lol, use that weapon with the best mods, rifle stock, max rifleman perk and also it will benefit from the Gunslinger perk. Add demolition perk lvl 5 and you could even throw in some sneak damage or crits. Literally the best gun in the game in terms of liability. Max damage, low ammo usage, easy to repair and difficult to break.
---
Yeah.
---
Lmao I'd be triggered if I was getting frozen like that. If you have multiple people with cryos would it stack? Just have a 4 man team freezing trolls in place lmao I doubt it would work like that but I can dream
---
If you actually think about it, it's a pretty poorly thought out video. Todd Howard isn't the be-all end all of Bethesda. When he goes, for whatever reason, there are plenty there that can carry on the flame.
---
It also hinges on Starfield being a big success. If it's middling or worse flops, Bethesda need a tent pole franchise to keep the hype going. Knowing how lazy Bethesda is, it won't be another new franchise, it'll be Elder Scrolls &amp; Fallout.
---
If Starfield smashes it out of the park, then maybe 76 is the last fallout but in my mind that's the only situation it will be.
---
Yes, I have alot of PvP gear however my favourite fights are first fights or fights with stupid weapons like in the rusty pick I was waiting for people to come and started fighting them with fists, shame some cocky 79 came and used his gatling so I said you want a weapon fight so I pulled out my explosive gatlign plasma and lit him up
---
Immersion. It is also a more real combat not set in a battle royale. you can actually feel like you killed another person instead of having to go to a fake mode.
---
Yeah, I really want a QE one but AAE gets better dps
---
Calm down.
---
But on the other hand, it also means it could be interpreted to say that you can't tell people to store their vending because a new bug allows someone to take everything in stash.   Or that fast travel works better if you remove the healing mutation.   There must be 100 examples.
---
Agreed. I wouldn‚Äôt prioritize it first.
---
Just make it so 30% of the things you make double.
---
I honestly didn't know the robots inside could go hostile until a guy killed all the front door bots and then charged inside to keep killing. It ended with just a massive pile of dead robots all in the children's store as he hid in there as they all funneled to him. I watched In horror and confusion as he murdered every robo in the hallway lmao
---
Lmaooo immersion is spamming your op legacy on someone who's spent hours trying to get a full cavalier or sentinel set of armor
---
You have to ask yourself this: Is the NUCLEAR WASTELAND really a place where everyone would go jumping in a bed full of flowers, hand in hand?
---
Nor did most of the player base. That's probably partly the reason why Adventure pvp is almost dead &amp; maybe even the reason for NW to exist.
---
Limited resources i.e. workshops make it necessary.
---
I wish it was almost dead people want to pvp me all the time in their trap camps
---
Its great, I finally got to finish wastelanders! Feels like I can just enjoy the game now without the need for chores :)
---
i dont have much experience with pvp in this game and been running passive mode all the time. so if i dont have passive mode active i would have to shoot them back to activate pvp mode? otherwise they cant hurt me?
---
I mean for survival purposes yeah???
---
For fun. Adds a real competitive aspect you can't get in NW. If you don't like it, don't do it.
---
....and they all still collect scrap for you?! That is amazing, I‚Äôm going to make a settlement of nothing but collectrons.
---
Eh could understand but also just switch servers...?
---
Or they can just chill underground when they are supposed to be attacking your workshop. Damn radscorpions......
---
Real competitive spamming legacy explosives lol
---
Correct. I stay in pacifist so when I get attacked it tells me who is hitting me and if I decide to attack back which today was the first time I did, pvp starts. If not, they can't do anything about it but waste ammo or punch me until they get bored and go away
---
Neither, JE is the way to go and laser rifles is what you want. Gat plas suffer from accuracy and unless you have a PA jetpack build then I personally dont use them. The laser however has a tight spread, decent DPS, no spin up, fairly fast reload.
---
You know what? I have an Instigating gauss rifle that's been in my vending machine for a while taking up precious stash space. If you'd like I can give it to you for free, I used one for ages back when I was a sneaky sniper (before I got my vampires explosive gatling gun and switched to heavies.) If you're using mr. sandman and/or the covert operative perk cards it can one-shot most things from stealth.
---
This would make me very happy
---
Are you sure. EVERYONE. Every. Single. Person. Everyone wants to spread love and isn't selfish. Really?
---
what platform are you on?
---
Nuclear winter is literally a mode dude
---
Xbox one
---
Again, if you don't like it don't worry about it. Being a pvper is expensive, and if you get killed by a legacy that you can't get, that's just too bad. Everyone plays the game in their own way, I don't worry about how anyone else plays, and neither should you.
---
NW still needs work done. The load times are an absolute joke! Then when the game ends you have it all again rather than loading you back into a lobby or something. I feel like it needs to
---
Take the fortnite approach to that. No one wants to be back in the main menu.
---
I sometimes went toilet sipping on big quests in Fallout 3 and Fallout NW. Good times.
---
Wow, have you ever nailed not only the idiocy in some aspects of this game, but society as a whole.  Gold star.
---
Which collection are you using? I noticed BOS collectron is not as efficient as fanaschat collectron
---
If it affects how I play then yeah? I should worry about it? People try fighting me all the time. I have a legacy. Not worried about that. I just said I dont understand the point there is no real proving you're better than someone in adventure. Its never an even playing field. And its a worthless aspect.
---
I have a bos collectron but i can't pick what it loots it just says its searching for mission supplies
---
Move 2 points from intelligence into agility
---
Still pvp doesn't have a place in adventure. The high level at least. Low level pvp with non legendary weapons or armor could be ok but even then there's no score or anything you just lose junk and its annoying.
---
But that's something entirely different.
---
I had a guy blasting me with one at my own camp when I didn't want to trade one of my weapons to him. Couldn't hurt me and I eventually just went in my bunker and closed the door since it's locked and he proceeded to unload on it for like five minutes and I just walked away and grabbed something to eat because of the lag and loud ass noise lol. Shoulda just got in his face, ty for the good advice
---
Just look at the downvotes.
---
Scavenger collectron. I notice the decrease after I had moved my camp. If true, here's another extra function of legacy camp.
---
Right? I felt pretty bummed about not getting to blow something up out of pettiness. (I still did in the end, but it wasn't nearly as satisfying)
---
I‚Äôll sell you get you some if you‚Äôre on ps4
---
I've just never understood PvP in general. Why? What satisfaction does it bring you? 
---
All being good at PvP shows is that you have nothing better to do. That's my opinion anyway.
---
It can be plausible, given how Rockstar milked GTA V for years.
---
Cool, it that all you are able to say or is there something else in stock?
---
Dude yes that‚Äôs great.
---
I agree. I even played a little game with my friend. We both drank Nukashine and the mid point between where we landed we raced to it naked with a melee weapon.
---
A lot of people are taking a break. After trudging through challenges and other things for months or years the break is welcomed. At least for me it is.
---
Legit what we do
---
From old heavyweight lockpicks we had a while ago
---
I thought it was just me! PS4
---
I wish. I still have people everywhere and they keep one shotting all the dang legendaries, but I'm broke and Bethesda triggers me so I'm spiteful and don't wanna buy 1st even tho I kinda do for scrapbox and private servers lol
---
STOP MAKING SENSE LALALALALALALALALALA
---
Yeah, the irony is priceless.
---
Says the guy begging for help. GFYS. Blocked.
---
Just tested not working with BOS Collectron. What one are you blueprinting?
---
I have encountered that a few times as well
---
I pressed A once in atom shop and it registered as two presses and now I have a satellite dish on my bunker lol
---
Fall asleep (irl) after agreeing to a big trade and pissing off the other party. Homie ran a silo just to drop a nuke with my camp in the middle. Woke up in hellfire with 2 xbl messages from good samaritans, one saying they repaired my camp and the other identifying the culprit. It's a mad world out there..
---
I'm really close to the vault, I have an extractor of cooper and an iron deposit too, both unlocked with "open" signs just in case, unlocked water x3, i don't have the ammo one yet tho, the only thing locked is my collectron, those are MY chems lol, but the rest of my home, feel free, if is unlocked then is to share
---
Becket constantly complains about me being camped in the bog, wish I could reply with "well no one's asking you to stay." Only reason I keep the guy is so I have a companion but don't have to put up with a üé∏ or commander headache.
---
Its not trolling to oppose micro-transactions. In my experience its mostly young (kids), or old (50+ people) that would spend a lot on micro-transaction in games. I find it calculating and not ok. 
---
Everybody can pay 60$ for a decent game. Yes. And everybody could support expansions to a base game. 
---
But with micro you could spend so much more. And you take this money from inexperienced players, who quite fast will just burn trough their money or their familys money for a game. 
---
I find your use of the term ¬´moral¬ª useless. 
---
Great sin? Well its a bit unmoral to exploit newbs for money. yes.
---
That said, I dont mind paying for some cosmetics and have done so.
---
But if you didn't know what (which many players probably do not) I would expect you imagine it would be at least a week.  Clearly beth agrees.
---
just happened to me on Xbox
---
I've been lucky and have had a lot of good experiences on pc. Every once in a while someone who is bored will take a shot at me, but I just walk away.
---
Adding a number next to your name could be good. Positive or negative number depending on the kills. People would for that. With a friends list board for it.
---
Silly question but since i see this alot on player camps... Are you locking both your console and the hatch where you pick up the collected things? People might be looting it..
---
I get the prize first and then I smash him to bits, but I'm greedy. I'll happily take that gold pocket watch and 1 lead scrap as I'm a junk hoarding boi
---
It's a lot of fun. Especially when the robots keep trash talking you as they're crawling around on the floor, helpless.
---
These people are already overpaid man compared to other artists and designers, cry me a huge river. Its like saying Man United are poor.
---
The game is for the long haul,  but straight from launch they said it wasn't going to be a regular fallout game. They've likely been working on the next main series fallout game this entire time. 
---
This game is epic though.
---
Yeah this is fast travel bug that has been plaguing the game since the beginning, its a very strange bug sometimes you can‚Äôt fast travel to locations but you can still fast travel on your friends using the social menu and sometimes its the other way around.
---
Apparently bethesda has so far been pretty unsuccessful at patching this mainly because they don‚Äôt know exactly what causes it.
---
However on the bright side a couple of months ago they referenced at how they might have found the issue that causes it so hopefully it will be fixed soon.
---
The best method I‚Äôve personally found is to be outside any interior and try walking around and keep trying to fast travel to where you want to go.
---
Definitely forgot that existed and was super disappointed in it. For me the "big treasure" was a garbage revolver lol all that hype for a bad gun
---
I‚Äôd be happy if friendly NPCs showed up green, neutral turrets showed as white, vendors as yellow and enemies were red.  
---
With 35-40 perception, I can see a mess of dots at Foundation from Twin Lakes.  I usually have no clue if the NPC dot I‚Äôm seeing is ten feet away or a mile.  First world problem, I know.
---
Wow I‚Äôm on PC. Hate to see it happen on ALL platforms.
---
Theyre prob just going to be free to claim/caps/gold at Atlas when the BoS actually become established... people shouldnt worry about the rewards, I doubt theyll be exclusive to just the Fortifing Atlas event. Case in point; Ammo Converter &amp; Chicken Coop. Now that I think of it .... I wouldnt be suprised if we see "Automic Onslaught" "Captain Cosmos" and "Ghillie" bundles in the Atom Shop eventually.. prob even during season 2
---
There's literally other games for pvp
---
Wow.  That dude obviously has no idea how to build a character if he killed himself with an explosive handmade.
---
Lol, it's so true
---
I can hear this...thanks
---
Its due to enemies being near by, sometimes you will get a brief popup about waiting to fast travel because of them, sometimes not. Clear the enemies and you will be fine. For me for defiance is the worst culprit.
---
I steal stuff, sometimes people get mad. I get that, even leads to some epic adventure sometimes.
---
The assholes shooting their teammates that just helped them complete an event to rob them of flux. No, those are scum.
---
I‚Äôll see how many times I can walk 5 ft and be unable to fast travel indoors without giving up and just going outside. üòÇ
---
But that‚Äôs really interesting. Hoping that they‚Äôll get it fixed soon :‚Äô)
---
Yes, I always lock it right after construction. I checked it just now and it's locked well.
---
The only ones I know off the top of my head (because I just got the last one I needed) are the BoS T60 paints from Forbidden Knowledge
---
Oooh! So without raider collectron my BoS-collectron wouldnt be able to select "weapons and ammo"?
---
that makes absolutely no sense and sounds exactly like a cop out Bethesda would use because its going to add ***another*** bug knowing their history
---
that makes perfect sense
---
People who work on games are often NOT paid that well. Game companies take advantage of the fact people want to work in games and there's nowhere near enough jobs to fill that demand. 
---
Also, if you had a business selling hats and people stopped buying them would you keep making that hat until you went out of business or would you look at making another hat?
---
He wouldn‚Äôt make it out of Morgantown.  I‚Äôm sure Biv would be rusting face down in the town‚Äôs viaduct within five minutes of leaving the parlor.
---
First wildfire visible from space?
---
I live in BC. This is basically just summer for us.
---
You‚Äôre probably right, but we definitely should still be able to FT when it says we‚Äôre hidden, even with enemies nearby.
---
I had one with hidden punji boards, a radiation emitter,  pressure plate to open the door, (connected to a switch that the owner then turns off) and worse of all... Outrageous prices after all that üôÑ.
---
Luckily a non bloodied build carrying a haz suit so survived and learnt my own lesson (was tempted to go get some radstag and tape).
---
This is probably due to the fact that the collectron bugs out and gets stuck in the environment. Not a problem if no one is at your camp, but if you or anyone else visits your camp it will prevent the collectron from depositing items. Try to move the station around a bit and see if that makes a difference.
---
I noticed this yesterday. Honestly. I thought, I'm imagining this. But, now you say it, I think it might be happening.
---
I own all versions of the collectron and I've noticed since the BOS one this is happening.
---
People take everything literal and only at face value it seems with a lot of these comments lol y'all wild out here
---
Try it in Creation Kit
---
Pretty sure the Prime plans and decon shower fall into that category.
---
Yes I agree it would be such a simple fix to the bug, I have to say I have only just started to experience this bug in the last few weeks. 
---
I know of other fast travel issues in the past but this one is new to me.
---
Interesting.  I‚Äôve been trying to solo all the end game events before p22 hits and I have to forget about Rifleman cards for the foreseeable future.  If anything, I‚Äôve been doing much more ambitious personal challenges now that I‚Äôm not distracted by the score board and my sniper rifles are soon to be obsolete.
---
I just broke the A button on my Xbox controller, probably from wailing on it to craft food and smelt ore.
---
I‚Äôd be over the moon if they brought a few items back! I *need* the Mothman, Mr. Pebbles and Mr. Demonic backpacks in my life, and so far all my prayers to Todd have gone unanswered.
---
And you can also use that mod on power armor that reflects back 50 percent of there damage
---
I've got it on xbox and pc (gamepass).  Mainly play in oc as my missus is on the xbox playing ark survival. I joined a fbook group for xbox f76 and someone gave me 30000 caps and a load of other stuff to get me started which was fantastic but on the pc.. not had anything.  Crawled my way up to level 53 now. 
---
As for mods etc...ive looked on nexus website, not for me.  Its not like it can be modded like skyrim lol
---
Np, send me a PM when ur online. I'm located in western Canada and I work nights shifts.
---
Well understood issue about using too many lunch boxes. Sorry, too assed to find a link to earlier posts about it.
---
Will do! Ty so much.
---
I'd just like them to because Trick or Treating is out of the question for this year :&lt;
---
So they  lower damage and add legendary perks that bring the damage back to what it was originally?
---
Sounds pointless
---
my suggestions:  
---
\- a slide  
---
\- fireman's pole  
---
and a more serious suggestion:  
---
\- half stairs, for when your floors are only half way elevated.
---
&gt; If something lasts 1 hour. With a fridge, it's 2 hours.
---
Is my math off? Isn't 50% spoil reduction of 1 hour be 1.5 hours?
---
Its dope though
---
I use the fences from the defense tab in one of my builds. But I agree that only looks good in a shack build.
---
Spoilable food items in the game are freaking useless... You spend all those time gathering the material, then it spoiled in a few days... Funny thing is bethesda add bunch of aid crafting stuff that nobody brother wasting their time crafting... 
---
We definitely need a freezer that stops aids from spoiling.
---
Have you killed all the enemies inside?  Even if I just leave that low level chef bot alive upstairs, it won‚Äôt let me FT until I destroy it.
---
A lot of fast travel issues are due to nearby enemies.  The 15 second timer is wildly inconsistent.  If it takes more than 2 tries, try to VATS the offending enemy or move 10 paces and try again.  I promise it‚Äôll save you a lot of aggravation.
---
wear any armor piece that has the "reduced dmg while blocking" effect and ALL your shotguns will be magical. have fun!
---
Yeah, i had been monitoring collectron before, with each time it stopped at its station it would deposit one random scrap, but now about every four times.
---
How funny - we literally share the same settlement location. I just moved there today because I was sick of defending the acid/lead location towards the south against Scorchbeasts.
---
Oh dang, I had no idea you could mod 76 :O
---
Does it violate any ToS? Are there any mods that are "game-breaking"? I don't really know how mods work with an online game.
---
Somethings definitely happening in California
---
Scorpions beats mole rats for me. I can handle them now but at low level I really struggled to survive a scorpion attack.
---
I like the Combat helmet/gasmask over the Marine helmet. Still found it kinda funny
---
Scorched beast queen head. I also want to say the electric chinese sword mod that drops from liberators. I think the mounted plans from the laying lowe side quests might also technically count.
---
Would of shat myself, but I thinks its just bad timingü§î
---
Just block them on the social menu and you won't drop into NW with them, problem solved
---
I got a TS/limb/weightless grenade launcher a few months ago, off a mutant at Westek.  When I saw it in my inventory, my first thought was ‚ÄúMischief Night‚Äù.  Hopefully it‚Äôll be as fun as it looks on paper.
---
Hey! What A coincidence! Ive been always in the forest, I'm actually looking into some other locations out there but nothing that got my eye yet, before this, i was in the iron deposit close to the mothman lighthouse but it was too small, i needed something with more room. Sad that even if we are I'm the same console we will not meet anytime soon üòÖ
---
The big one?
---
For me that's especially the case when there are other modes where PvP is encouraged.
---
U are a genious.Awesome.
---
yeah pass. not wasting another 4 nuclear key cards.
---
was hoping to see post codes are fixed. alas...
---
this fucking game.
---
How do you build multiple collectron at your camp ? I can build only one !
---
How did they get on my roof? Did they climb up the damned walls?
---
Yeh sorry I should of elaborated, I know how to pvp and what the meta is etc, buffs and all that. Last night though some kids had full health builds and were doing some seriously OP damage with their laser and he was tanky af. Even standing there dancing at one point whilst taking a JE laser doing 398 damage to the head, his health went down to about 50% after a mag. Anyone else it would of ruined, especially a full health build. Is there a new meta or is this a glitch? Because everyone I know spams quantums with chems and Bloodied builds.
---
Like everything else (special events etc) at the time daily challenges / atomshop reset
---
Should be when everything resets at 12pm I believe.
---
Talk about some immersion breaking shit, how this mf burrowing through my concrete foundation!
---
When things would normally reset at 12pm EST as always.
---
Huh? I ran a couple ACP's the other day, couldn't launch nukes since I only had like 4 nuke cards &amp; don't wanna waste em. I love ACP way more than ASE, I actually ran it with a bunch of low levels, it was funny seeing them get shredded. But they were good sports so I helped em out a bit.
---
Im struggling here a bit.
---
So this means its always: The higher the better? Im running two bloodied builds, so not rly any full health. Since now i even put lesser armor mods on some of my SS pieces to bring it down to 350-450 DR/ER.
---
As you said, its hard to calculate with serendipity counting in. But should i change my armor pieces mods back to max DR/ER? Does a bloodied build with low health benefit as much from it?
---
I can confirm the chicken thing. There's a few that spawn near my camp occasionally they often prevent me from fast travelling until i kentucky fry them with my flamer
---
I had a serious RP play through, on survival. Then a modded, wild wisteland  adventure. And more.
---
Harppers ferry has a spawn there for the plans
---
As someone who preordered the game I'm quite salty about this point... 
---
Yeah I spend 60 (70? dunno) ‚Ç¨ on the preorder ps4 version... twice, once for me, once for my gf. (Yey we also got a crappy t-shirt! :D). Weeks (not even months) later its dropped to what, 30‚Ç¨? and then we got... 1200 Atoms? when the game got basically free and you could get it for 10 bucks all around. 
---
To add to insult - it has now a subscription fee for significant in-game bonuses (I'd call unlimited crap inventore, wich made for 700/800 storage and a survival tent that saves caps and can be used to bug events to play them more efficently that) that is fucking more expensive than even world of warcraft (‚Ç¨15 for 1 month vs ‚Ç¨12.99/month)
---
And, ignoring all the shit people are talking about wow, that game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more massive than fallout 76 is. And, as far as I can tell, the in-game-shop really only offers cosmetics.
---
Well, at least fallout 76 told me to never again preorder a game... I already wasn't that big of a fan of the pip-boy-quality of the fallout 4 collectors edition I preordered, and 76 was the last game for me to ever preorder\^\^
---
Man some how I missed that the nuke codes are (were?) bugged. I decided to launch a nuke went to bravo and started my run. About half way through I see one of the people on the public team with me has started in behind me, he catches up with me as I‚Äôm starting the launch prep. Together we deal with more hostile robots than I‚Äôve ever seen in the silo. I usually run a silo solo so I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs because there were two of us. We get launch prep finished and I use my key card move to the key pad and pull up Nukacrypt to confirm the code and see the notice about the bug. I‚Äôm kinda bummed, I did get xp and level up doing the run, but I did have someone begging to have their camp nuked.
---
Report your friend and take a screenshot. Things won‚Äôt get fixed and stopped if they don‚Äôt get reported.
---
Ooh good to know, thanks!!
---
Thanks! Can‚Äôt wait
---
It's mostly just utility stuff so no risk of being banned, I've used them forever. They're stuff like being able to see the total weight of each category in your in inventory so you can see why you're over encumbered, plants/plans have neon parts so you can spot them easier and there's even a text chat mod. I don't think I could play this game without some of them so I guess that is kind of "game breaking".
---
Completely agree, they are one of the worst enemies in this game. They're tough as fuck &amp; the only real way to incapacitate them is to take their legs out. And even then you gotta watch out for the laser of death. Playing a melee build? Forget about it, those damn assaultron blades will slice you in two.
---
Well, i buy a 60‚Ç¨ game and expect it to be halfway out of beta status and not full of bugs. Deliver what you promise. If you do? I don't mind buying expansions / DLC's (big ones, not "buy a reload for 1‚Ç¨ crap) or support you through a cosmetic, non-gameplay-influencing in game shop.
---
If you don't? I really appreciate hellogames approach to no man's sky. You fuck up, you make it up to your community.
---
I set up a macro on my keayboard that spams E just for this to save my poor keys and fingers.
---
That example sounds much more like harassment than griefing
---
After the FREE addition of the Wastelanders update and seasons the game is in a pretty good state minus a few annoying but not game breaking bugs IMO.
---
You are not wrong , feels like they adding alot of defensive perks though. Never really had an issue with that but
---
Almost feels like pre BETA.
---
It's a reminder a glimpse (just a peak not a full feature) of how good the world was and can be, but always out of reach for you character. Bittersweet, like you said.
---
And give us a month to enjoy it at least.
---
Looks like you're losing, so does the same apply to you?
---
Well, sir, I don't know what your junk addiction problem is but I'm not going to scrap a NEW and FREE Chryslus Corvega.
---
Combathelmet/gasmask &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A shitload of headgear
---
Ive been asking them for this and a qol updated on inventory screens. Be it vendors, npc vendors or pipboy we shouldn't have to scroll the entirety of the list to get to the bottom or top. Plans and aid items anyone? How many known plans must we cycle through, or displayed magazines and bobble heads?
---
Let me hit right one more time while on radio to go directly to stats and vice versa. 
---
Were also still waiting for that key ring...
---
Bruh, its not a competition. He had 4 downvotes so it was clear that people were agreeing with me.
---
Isn't enough the joy to comply?
---
i never use white knight and as bloody commando you wont get hit much. and even if, i always check the armor parts when repairing the weapons and do them also if needed, not a big deal. id rather have a thought about bandolier in the STR special. i carry about 30k ammu that way and its frees a huge mount for the stash. especially as a non 1st user, bandolier is the most important perk to me.
---
Try a stealth build with the Chinese stealth suit. You can kill pretty much everything without them ever seeing you.
---
Of course, this gets pretty boring after awhile. I got so bored with it I switched to the polar opposite build, heavy guns with power armor.
---
Oh my bad. When you said leading game devs. I thought you meant 'game developers' .
---
You might be right about the industry sometimes ripping of their game designers. 
---
Speaking of hats and games, I genuinly feel that games that gets remembered are almost never best-sellers. best-sellers are mostly the least creative and memorable games. Just like a forgetable expensive movies. 
---
Well if you could make a few great hats, like your grandfather did or something, yes I would see a lot of value and probably quality in that (games that gets remembered and maybe enchanced for new gens.). Despite not making one rich. 
---
Of course, you could always start importing plastic hats from China, sell them on a beach and make more money total (like Fortnite
---
and COD) But would it make one proud?
---
I‚Äôve run into that pair 2-3 times since Wastelanders.  I never once thought of those noises as beatboxing, but I‚Äôm a 43 year old NYer and beatbox to me equals hip hop.
---
It sounds kinda like the wanderer rigged an Eyebot with a broken voice modulator into an approximation of dubstep?  I guess if I were to YouTube beatbox videos, that‚Äôs probably what I‚Äôd get.
---
LOL I sound like a crotchety old geezer, even to myself.
---
Corner stairs. It would make builds so much more compact
---
And let us snap them to the sides of floors not only smack in the middle
---
You have left out a fair bit of information. There is a lot of reasons behind a perma ban. You are best finding out why and the specifics then appeal or unfortunately suck it up.
---
You only know dude!if you're wrong let it go. Otherwise it shouldn't be difficult to be unbanned
---
I get it's annoying when someone acts selfishly at everyone else's expense, but at the same time, if someone isn't doing it to grief, you can't demand that they play the way you want them to just because it's more generous/fairer.
---
I play a full health build because a) I don't want to be at permanent risk of dying all the time and b) I don't want to one shot most of the enemies. In events with legendaries, I use one of my weaker guns to allow as many people to get a shot on it as possible. BUT. I also don't expect/demand the same behaviour of anyone else if they get their enjoyment playing differently.
---
If someone is doing it for the sole purpose of upsetting others (or can easily avoid it), I don't think that's forgivable, however, if someone just enjoys playing a different build and they need to do it to play the game/stay alive, who is anyone else to demand they play differently just because it makes their lives harder?
---
It would be like someone demanding everyone solely uses pipe pistols for everything (because similarly, this would give other more chance to tag enemies). I enjoy playing a rifle build. If someone demanded I play pipe pistols to make it more likely that everyone else on the server can get shots on enemies, I'd say 'thanks but no thanks'.
---
I'm sure I'll get flamed for this comment (and to clarify it's intent isn't to justify people who one shot legendaries), but so be it if it helps to promote a little tolerance.
---
Thanks. I need to understand what the legendaries stuff will mean. Maybe I‚Äôll just card swap for now I have a ton of unused levels.
---
who uses non public teams anymore? (cant do that on public teams)
---
Listen dad, I know you're an alcoholic that beats mom, but I just wanted to say, these fishing trips we go on have been a blast, and thank you for the car you got me!
---
Most of our family has given up on you, but I just wanted you to know I really appreciate you.
---
We all did back in 2019.
---
You most certainly did make it a competition back when you were winning, and now that it's swung the other way, you're acting the opposite. Pathetic.
---
I guess your right. I did use these weapons all over the place and probably made a lot of enemies in earl. I didn‚Äôt kill him fast because I actually could not but I guess the amount of dmg I did was to fast for ppl.
---
Omg I have so much to scrip that when the vendor restocks I'm Gunna be out straight away
---
I hate that noise and the fact that I can hear it in my damn head, assaultrons I can take down easy enough with my plasma caster or gatling gun, but till I got a 2 shot gauss minigun Colonel Gutsies were the bane of my existence.
---
Game shuts down 1 in three days.
---
75% of the time when I travel to my GF's camp I'm stuck in the wall.
---
10% of the time people travel to my camp they are stuck in the ground
---
Magic weapons... exist
---
Several quests can't be progressed belong certain points and need to be restarted (vault break in for the raiders, when the mutant steps into the scanner &amp; creating the vaccine, when you need to mix the ghoul blood.)
---
Stuff like "create the ammo machine from the ammunition plant in your workshop" exist.
---
Rerolling wepons by scrapping collectrons and getting weapons that were patched out of the game exist.
---
Eternal load screens exist.
---
I stumble upon several invulnurable enemies each day. 
---
Server lag is real.
---
Duping happens whenever a patch hit.
---
Too many corpses and the game becomes a glitch stuttering 0,5 fps mess (ps4)
---
People are grieving other players camps with low-level-questitem lures.
---
And, the most annoying thing: Fucking long load times for EVERYTHING. be it inventory management, loadscreen, you name it. PS4.
---
Thats just what I came up with on top of my head
---
I'm saying its not. It was just obvious who was in favor of what. Nobody has yet to explain why pvp is even a thing. Like all pvp players want to do is argue.
---
And all you do is whine, despite being given explanations.
---
The SBQ is nothing compared to Earle.  Monongah mine is much more challenging.
---
The v94 raids were truly challenging.  The poison damage in there was crazy, and you really had to prepare in order to succeed on expert difficulty.
---
Glad you had fun and here‚Äôs hoping you succeed in the future!  I think you‚Äôll enjoy the upcoming Daily Ops.
---
Got 5000 scrip to go for three star armor.
---
I plan to test out the loot pool theory; whether or not certain legendary effects tend to be rolled in group. So one server might have a tendency for a certain legendary effects while others have a tendency to give an other group of effects. Not sure if I'll have enough data points with 5000 scrip but it'll have to do for now.
---
I invited someone so he could place a fusion generator in my lower level camp, but he also placed an ammo factory 
---
I can't delete it even if I remove the foundations
---
What I've found most people do in this situation is shoot at the bag a few times. Tends to get their attention and point them in the right direction in a non aggressive way.
---
Agreed.
---
Absolutely gonna have to do this
---
dropped from pails too, i have sold a few in my vendor for 1k each.
---
And this is why it's good to voice your opinion. I'm happy for you guys that missed claiming the Collectron during that ridiculously small window.
---
Really? 
---
Ok, industry leading game development companies. I didn't feel that it needed explaining but there's the correction for you. 
---
Just so you don't need to get any further anally retentive, I don't mean the front line devs doing the grunt work but at the bare minimum senior management, possibly the studio head and (most likely) some executive manager who loves to micromanage.
---
Is that sufficiently clear or do I need to dumb it down for you further?
---
Then that's probably how they know you used glitched weapons, you'll of most likely been reported numerous times??
---
I've seen that too. It's kind of adorable that they even bother. Like a 3 year old throwing punches at you.
---
I had crickets explode on me the other day.
---
The earliest one I've seen is a mole rat making Sentry bot noises.
---
The game doesnt need people like you. Get fcked
---
Well if they miss the next one then tough.  But it was a valid point that 3 days wasn't enough. 
---
They need to look at other live services and how they do community rewards.  It's a lot smoother than Bethesdas system.
---
Riverside manor could be cool
---
I would think the rewards would automatically be added to the players, like completing quests/events. If they did it the usual way, we wouldn't even be having these post (no whining to whine about lol). I wonder why they decided to do it differently?
---
I've been able to plenty of times, including a few days ago. On PC.
---
If  mumbles is 50% off then you already getting double essentially
---
You missed the PoS, sorry BoS collectron? Oh well, here's looking forward to an Enclave one.
---
move your camp even if you actually keep it in the same spot.  everything built gets  Blue printed and stored. you can replace everything you want to keep and delete the ammo plant. and its blueprint.
---
40 caps and a little bit of rebuilding to not get banned ( if they ban ppl who have it) worth it imo.
---
This game has a massive issue with storage why you cant just build another box is beyond me and why items in my vending machine are still taking up space in my stash is just non sensical. When i finish the wastelanders story what is there to do? Just events etc???
---
I can help you out with it on PS4 once the nuke codes aren‚Äôt bugged
---
A lot of people are going off how other games do community rewards.  Which make more sense than how Bethesda approached it.  Can't argue that as now Bethesda have added extra time to redeem.
---
A proper community reward system should require the interaction at the start to initiate the unlock.  So basically accepting the challenge should be the only requirement.  Then there needs to be a live ticker in the game, not on a bloody website they dont update.  People were wondering if we even completed the event the other day as the site didn't update.
---
You put all these signposts in the game and your player base are aware of 1. What needs doing. 2. Time required.  If they grind a few days and add to challenge, they will have it auto unlocked.  The only requirement was the initial accept at the start.
---
 love finding camps with these lol . I empty them out and come back to do it again a few times. thanks for the free ammo, ill donate it to the next low lvl I find.
---
Thx bud
---
It lets me fast travel out, but always after the 15 second countdown, even when I'm in hidden state.
---
This is not what I am saying.
---
But ironically you say yourself what you need to understand: 
---
The keyword is "chance". The level does not make the power (you don't gain %damage or %mitigation with the level), only the chance. The level just increase the probablility. nothing else.
---
however, this will change soon, with legendary perks. Then, and only then, more level will mean more power.
---
I'm a sucker for holiday Themed things, especially Halloween. For a game that has Halloween stuff scattered across both the current and previous release, i'd hope they'd have a field day with a bunch of stuff on the atom shop.
---
It's coming back the 15 of September
---
Taken in stride like a man owning up to the fact he's probs fucked up a bit. Respect to you OP.
---
May I enquire, what two clauses were addressed in their rationale, and did you breach them following accepting the new ToS that came out?
---
Did the pressure plate door lead into a hole full of pungi boards and a seperate room that locked you in with the radiation if you managed to not fall through the hole?
---
Check out riflegaming on youtube. He does exactly this. Has tested just about every location you can think of with a nuke!
---
It does look fuckin awesome though.
---
You are kidding right? Best weapon for pvp and against pve mobs. I use a suppressors tesla and shredd every mob in 1 maybe 2 mags without perk cards lol
---
Events are great for xp too.
---
Guns alot of them are in your perk cards. You wont be finding some good stuff tell ablut lvl 30ish. 
---
Example if your doing a shot gun build you have more perks in shot gun. Also zone matter to
---
1. You'll find that as you events and quests, also, lvl 50 is max a weapon will go, so expect to be changing weapons alot until you yourself are lvl 50.
---
2. Events are so worth it, materials, weapons, junk, caps etc. Events give it all. Though quests are also important to do as you get alot of stuff from them also.
---
Formula P is all there is. ü§§
---
One round from my shotgun and they‚Äôre gone
---
If you're new, the best way to get better weapons is by picking up all weapons and scrapping them for mods. You can up weapon damage significantly through mods.
---
Events are definitely worth it. Best way to level up for low levels for another 5 days. Update comes after that which will change a few things, you can find more info on this sub or bethesda's website.
---
sometimes the social tab doesn't work properly. Have you retried since last attempt?
---
Its for the vault 94 armours.  The thorn and solar sets.  Best armour in game for a stealth commando.
---
You cannot pick them up? You mean you wont get atom reward?  
---
I feel the same, i used to sell mags for 33 and heads for 44, yet people bought them like peanut butter and jelly and some said its too cheap etc. I increased the price and I legit cannot hold any mag or head more than 2 days.
---
Truthfully not *that* often. Been slowly getting better with free furnishing items, but there was a lull in stuff there for a while.
---
There's a different exclusive item every month, like this month it's a neat vault-tec armor bench. And there's exclusive discounts on non-exclusive items every week I think.
---
Wonder why all of your comments got removed yacommiecunt!
---
Tesla is bad for pvp ? There's a reason why almost all players that enjoy doing pvp have tesla and that's because the current pvp meta is made of flying invisible teslas and immortal power armor builds spamming legacy plasmas and aid items , the Tesla is really good weapon for pve too allowing you tag multiple enemies during events to get free xp and can do enough dmg to be used on normal day to day game time
---
Okay, thanks for the answer. I was just curious
---
Badly. I guess she doesn't like my compliments anymore...
---
Am I the only one really bothered by it being Picklock in game?
---
Lol don‚Äôt do this. Larger/more complicated structures often cannot be re-placed.
---
Has anyone told him to get a job....?
---
You‚Äôll need to learn the plan to get legendaries
---
I've seen the bits a bobs that are free and you're right that Vault-Tec bench is pretty cool! Thanks for the answer
---
Fallout 1st items don‚Äôt get added very often at all. It‚Äôs poor really.
---
You need plans for: The Fixer, Bear Arm, Sheepsquatch Staff, Sheepsquatch Club, Shepherd's Crook, Plasma Caster, Gauss Shotgun, Gauss Minigun, Gauss Pistol, Cattlepod, Gauntlet, Meat Tenderizer. All the other weapons you can get without the plan learned
---
Thanks üëèüèΩ
---
Does build matter a lot?
---
Will do thanks ! Maybe it will inspire me to launch some accidental nukes myself :)
---
I still recommend it. If F76 is your hobby it's justifiable but that's just my opinion.
---
So it's just the event and gold bullion weapons you need the plans for
---
It's the only game I play at the moment. I've sort of got bored of FFXIV so I figured I would play this instead as I am a massive Fallout fan!
---
It's just the new stuff added with later patches. Everything that was in the game day one can drop from the purveyor (except explosive energy guns).
---
That sucks. The scrap box is pretty cool though!
---
One guy doing something = etiquette. Got it!
---
I'm still seeing the odd nuke on PC. Not sure how that's still happening.
---
Out of 1000 hours combined on 2 characters I've killed a grand total of 1 player.
---
I was in my camp going through my stash when a level 23 (I just hit 101) came in and was looking around. 
---
He was puzzled when he saw Yogi, my pet Yao and after a minute of fumbling with his pipboy and squatting a few times he raised his hunting rifle and started plinking away at my pet...
---
I quickly rushed over to him and did the thumbs down emote, but he kept plinking away. 
---
So I took out my grognak and gave him a good whack over the head. 
---
He took off with a sliver of health remaining but then popped back around the corner trying to snipe me. A few rounds from my handmade was all it took and I never saw them again.
---
Pretty much sums it up üëç
---
That‚Äôs the weight of the burden you carry for actually thinking about dropping another nuke after what happened to the world!
---
Again, just don't buy them. if they're so useless and unimpressive, why do you even want them? You're not missing out on anything. xD
---
Whats yout plan on how to get the 3000 during the sale?
---
Twin Lakes is a great location in the Savage Divide, close to Foundation and Whitesprings. If you want a more beginner-friendly location maybe somewhere between Whitesprings and the dry lakebed in the Forest? Or north of Morgantown.
---
Back for more attention I see. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Think it's time for you to grow up buddy ol' pal, your parents need to change the WiFi password.
---
I've had exploding rad roaches and crickets, my favorite was a legendary protectron that was labeled as a glowing rad roach.
---
Damm never thought of that , have him stuffed inside in a corner lol
---
Thanks for the tip
---
He brings it back to his pod, you can pick up the stuff he collects from a box around the back of the pod.
---
Same, I always get good gear from ACP. ü§ô
---
I ran out of my camp yesterday without my PA on to kill a level 5 scorch that was shooting at it. Clipped my front porch post with my explosive gatling gun and instantly killed myself. I'm level 300. While I was spawning in it destroyed my collectron and a couple of walls. All while the settler wanderer sat on her ass playing her guitar and my 2 turrets shot at the wandering merchant. Fun times in the wasteland.
---
The one day out of about 40 I didn't log in I missed the Halloween vendor.  I'm hoping lots of stuff becomes available a few weeks prior.
---
It's a fantastic opportunity for players to get festive in their camps and also brings in some revenue for the game.  Win win :)
---
Hey thanks for reminding me, I have a question about that. Should just get the vault steel or try my luck with her?
---
That sounds about right.
---
You the close up far away disappearing  running death machines? Yeah they suck.
---
I'm rebuilding my camp, moved it back to the Twin Lakes area because I need to scrape some budget back and it was easier to just start over. Going to go resource farming at the weekend and see if I can make it to level 300 before the patch hits, 5 levels to go.
---
The one thing that concerns me is what people have been saying about the damage changes, I'm hoping my junkies doesn't take too much of a hit as I swapped to it from a more conventional build several weeks ago and I'd hate to think it was all for nought.
---
I have had a break the last couple of weeks as well so I think I'm freshened up and ready to go for Season 2.
---
And comes in many colors!
---
Me too- I think this game is great and is only going to get better.
---
To be honest, I actually hope the do charge full price for the game. 
---
More revenue means longer life span.
---
I actually like the biege one!! (I forget the armor type.... Fibreglass colour?)
---
RIP.
---
If you think follow through is bad, go check blood sacrifice.
---
Stopped playing when I finished season 2, took a break from the endless gold grind to play some other games ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But I do like a snarky robot.
---
How about you drop the whole 'limited availability' BS for community unlocked items? I'm sure someone in finance or whoever comes up with this crap for you guys told you guys it was a great idea to manipulate customers, but all it does is piss people off. Stop being such a terrible company.
---
\&gt;10 seconds is not legendary
---
That's what my wife keeps telling me... üò¢
---
I‚Äôve seen a good handful of enemies explode on death that aren‚Äôt supposed to, usually have a crown next to their name for me. üëë
---
Had a L21 mole rat poison me to death last night.
---
it was one of the two that hangs out by the WS bunker.  
---
L241,  I spawned in At full health, in PA.
---
Killed the first one, the 2nd one attacked, I killed it, took 2 steps, turned green, and died.
---
This 100%üëÜüëÜüëÜ
---
Reinforced
---
I see you also like me is a Lone Wanderer , the perk Lone Wanderer under Charisma is very valuable to us. Light armor is pretty bad tbh , you should try to aim at 300-400dr. There is also a few mutations that help alot. Damage mitigation is more important than DR though, im not so good at explaining since my language is not English
---
Still don't care
---
Yes, at least in turtles pts video.
---
Hoping for fixers and tenderizers.
---
I am SPEED!
---
Illegal is something that goes against the law.
---
Since no laws have passed concerning FO76, nothing can be illegal.
---
Question,  if I pick settlers can I still get the gauss minigun from raiders? Or am I lock out of it?
---
No!!!
---
I figured it's all going to be watered down trash by the time we get anything from here on out.
---
Was doing ACP during meat weak, The guy that launched the nuke asked if we all got a shot in on Earl, waited a min or 2 and just melted Earl in seconds. Because the cook off was about to start.
---
It's a lower amount of time yeh but it hardly matters like who is not shooting an enemy more than once every ten seconds for sneak attacks anyway. 
---
Add on the fact that follow through is multiplicative damage that everyone who is fighting the enemy the stealth attacker damaged means its an insane debuff.
---
Will a mob survive 10 seconds after the first shot anyway? I hate the point of 60 seconds if the the mob died from the third hit at 4 seconds in?
---
Did they nerf it? that would honestly be hilarious...SINCE MY BUILD RELIES ON REVIVES
---
Obvious Troll is obvious.
---
I'd love to cash that in a get a car to place at my camp!
---
I've said this before we don't need a working fridge. We need a canning station so we can, can cooked food and make it last as long as you having a good with salt 3 card
---
I can‚Äôt wait to set up a trick or treat vendor with free or cheap goodies to hand out to all you wastelanders good or bad
---
I have found just 1. I've been thinking of just buying the plans.
---
I'd say once you get all rewards from it once, not really.
---
I tend to use UGL on him and the spawns, so I get random low amounts of ammo. 50 Cal or Minigun is also a net loss. The best return is for Prime Gatling Gun 5 shots yields 30-70 prime ammo, but the gun is just too slow in general. I presume people farm for screws so they can craft more weapons and learn mods, not my thing though.
---
As for the damage, Earle has 400/400/500 resistances and ignores 80% of incoming damage. The queen has 300/300/300 and 70% ignore. That comes out as 67% tougher than the queen.
---
That bed was originally intended for Valentines Day and even had an animation that got cut out
---
Lol, they can't kill you and take your junk unless you shoot back. So either you accidentally shot them, or you purposely shot them. Either way it's on you.....
---
I prefer the crown store for it's selection. You get so many choices of cosmetics. Hair, tatts, skin colors.. 
---
The atom shop has one hairstyle.
---
It's maddening honestly.
---
Naw. Just a California sized dumpster fire.
---
Its very powerful for boss fights. The 10 secs dont matter in a boss fight because youre always refreshing it with your hits.
---
There really should be a mode where they could PVP. I suspect Bethesda encourages it to push Fallout 1st sales. Ain't no PVP on private worlds unless you want to for some crazy reason.
---
No one in their right mind would "manually" decrypt this cipher. The probability of human error interfering definitely approaches 1.
---
A mathematician--even a cryptographer/cryptologist--would find someone who had already written the algorithm they needed (or something close enough to use with slight alternations), collect the code pieces, and plug them into the program...just like we do with Nukacrypt.
---
Thanks! I already have Lone Wanderer but just noticed I could rank it up so I've done that! :) I was thinking the same about light armour but unfortunately that's the only crafting option I have so otherwise I have to rely on drops and looting which is pure luck :(
---
Yeah I pay for 1st just for the scrapbox, but the tent is very handy when you need to store items etc before fast travel. Or for getting stuff out for trading. Atoms are a bonus some nice things in the atom shop but they need a bigger camp budget as I can‚Äôt build half of it. üòÜüëçüèª
---
5000 immediately off 5 characters.
---
150 a day x 5 = 750 scrip.
---
4 days x 750 scrip = 3000.
---
8000 scrip in total.
---
This is awesome. Now this would be a trap camp I would like. Add a little danger to it. If you win you get a prize. If you lose you die. And you deserve my junk, but then you can fix it and I can go again.
---
166 or so rolls is a drop in the bucket, even just sampling primary effects.
---
If you join the enclave, you'll be able to purchase plans and mods for scout armor. 
---
On the other hand, it might help to know, since you've obviously gotten well into the Wastelanders questline, what perks you have loaded and what (if any) legendary effects you have. If you don't have any, don't worry; I typically don't mess with those until after level 50. However, early on, there are perks, such as barbarian, ironclad, and evasive that help with your damage resistance. There's also lone wanderer for solo, and bodyguards for team play. There are also various perks for damage avoidance/reduction (I'm not as well versed with those, but I'm sure someone knows).
---
 For staying with your current, metal armor: I would try crafting, and then scrapping some pieces (if you can craft them), until you get the alloy mod.
---
WORKSHOP NIGHTMARES, every. single. time.
---
I have a job! Safety Inspector at Faslane but it kind of looks after itself so i have time on my hands for Fallout.
---
Shotguns are insane dmg in vats if you know 1 how to use em. As in I've killed earl 3x faster on that character then any other build.
---
The last time there was a 50% sale was a year ago.  Modules have never been discounted, and won‚Äôt be in the foreseeable future.  I‚Äôd go for the sale since you can grind modules for the same price year round and, historically, Purveyor sales are rare.
---
A good location I've found, but it's become rather crowded as of late, is the barn outside of Charleston station. It's still in the Western part of the map, but it sees a lot of foot traffic, by both low and high level players. If you're on PC though, would you let me know. When I first settled there, it was cool, but now I have to jump 5 or 6 servers.
---
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. You're right. The sides are clear, so let me explain why pvp is and should be a thing(that needs fixing and should be expanded upon). 
---
1. It adds more immersion to player interactions. 
---
2. It expands on the role-playing aspect. Fallout describes itself as a post apocalyptic role playing game and raiders have always been a component of it, so making people play as one only makes sense.
---
3. **My opinion!** It gives people a challenge. This is a more controversial point since most people will 1 shot you anyway(*that's why I think that pvp needs to be reworked*) but what do I mean by challenge? Take workshops for example. They wield **bonus** resources(*should be much more to add to the competition*) which anyone(e.g. a raider) could take from you. This also connects back to #2. 
---
4. **My opinion!** It keeps you on your toes. You never know whether someone just wants to trade or put a bullet in your head.
---
As you can see, most of these points trace back to more player interactions which is a good thing for a community since it keeps everything freash and exciting. For this to be effective however, Bethesda would have to fix pvp first and let's be honest, they **WON'T**.
---
Ive never played wow, but I think the day will come when we cant accept the graphics anymore and I dont think beth is able or willing to create a modern engine for the game. I guess we get a new engine for fo5 and perhaps they will try it again with a new multiplayer addon.
---
And I dont think they can keep up the player base for a long time, if they just add tiny content updates every half year. I‚Äòm still addicted, but I‚Äòm starting to get bored.
---
No response shame
---
The exploding mole rats are with mole miners. If you look closely they have a landmine strapped to them.
---
It has a shortcut on my phones toolbar.
---
The way the perk system is, there is a lot of incentive to specialize in one or two types of weapons. You can still play the game without specializing, but it's a lot more challenging.
---
Polished and alloyed heavy metal has the best DR, my set was about 330)  but is lacking in RR and ER, especially if you are also running a high capacity backpack.  
---
  I used a set of heavy metal + BoS shielded underarmor for a long time.  Still needed PA in some areas.
---
  SS Butressed, along with SS Shielded underarmor, is the best (350 DR, 250ish RR and ER), but you have to complete the vault raid and collect a good amount of gold to get it.
---
Retribution perk is incorrect here. It doesn‚Äôt deal better damage, it restores AP and HP.
---
Already a thing. There are two versions that I know of. A silver one and a green one covered in blood.
---
Are you on xbox? I'll sell you my bloodied, reduced vats, increased vats chance fixer if you can put a silencer on my bloodied radium rifle.
---
I never carry white knight on me but I equip it to repair, it reduces the material cost really nice, screw spending mere ballistic fiber than I have to
---
Hide and seek with a prize pool exists. It's called Nuclear Winter. :P
---
Yeah and unless people do the glitch its boring.
---
Same with when you take over a workshop. Its almost a mini horde type event. Again, its wildly boring. I wouldnt trust the AI not to spawn the furthest point away from you they can and just stand there if they brought in a Horde Event.
---
Or just get stuck in the ground for 10 minutes.
---
If the fridge were available 24/7 in the atomic store then I‚Äôd be inclined to agree. But getting it involves being on at the right time, or missing it for months. 
---
As for earning atoms, well, that‚Äôs a whole other thing. Changing the utility of the fridge would screw over higher level players, who may have spent their atoms a while ago under the expectation that certain items wouldn‚Äôt suddenly become more useful. Sure, they can earn more through seasons, but you‚Äôd need to get to rank 40 to earn enough for something like the fridge, whereas new players would earn them pretty quickly just through playing (how quickly I‚Äôm unsure. I know they tweaked some of the challenges to award ‚Äòcare packages‚Äô, but didn‚Äôt check how many.)
---
Oooh, good question ü§î
---
What weapon are you using? My armour is a horrible mishmash of whatever random legendaries I‚Äôve found with useful stats, but because I‚Äôm a stealth sniper, I almost never get found, so don‚Äôt need to worry about getting hit aside from the occasional surprise mole rat. But if you‚Äôre running into the race of enemies with an axe or something it‚Äôll probably be different.
---
If they release the patch on the pts it will be half baked. The problem is we don't know when they will get around to adding improvements to weapon balancing ie the weapons that were weak already will be worse. I think they're not worried about losing long term players ( since beta ), it's the newer players they want who didn't know what the game was like before.
---
If it is shit which I think it probably will be then that's the end of the road for a lot of people.Newer players will keep going.
---
Exactly which still baffles me why people think its rewarding to one shot someone in adventure or spam quantums or whatever pvp is, if they wanted to kill so badly nuclear winter is literally a free for all with a more leveled playing ground.
---
Maybe it's less about you armour and either you combat style or you're just challenging enemies way too tough for you. If you have more than 2-3 enemies firing at you at once, you're doing something wrong.
---
Also where are you finding that you have the most trouble at? What locations?
---
Light metal armor is not that great - OK damage resistance and weak energy resistance. If possible, level up to 50 before you do anything major about that, though, to save on resources.
---
The easiest options are Scout and Heavy Combat armor. Both Scout armor and its mods (polymer is best for damage protection) are available for lots of caps from the vendors in the Whitespring bunker once you have gotten to the Enclave part of the main story. Heavy Combat armor plans can be bought from the Freestates vendors in Harpers Ferry and the Whitespring mall as well as the Watoga station vendor from level 40 upwards. The BOS combat armor mod for best protection can be bought from the vendors in Grafton.
---
Generally speaking, you won't be invincible in plain armor. Power armor is good for defence and rad resistance but you buy that tankiness with a marked lack of other bonuses. The right legendary armor and the right perks can make you almost as tanky as power armor.
---
Be aware that Lone Wander, while quite strong, only works when you're solo. As soon as you are in a team - even if you are alone in that team - it stops working.
---
If something is still alive after 10 seconds, why have you stopped shooting it to let Follow Through drop off?
---
Well you're so close to level 50 anyway the answer is going to be the same, just push through the last few levels to start gearing for end game.  
---
That being said advice would change a bit depending on your build but hes a few general tips/notes. If you're a stealth user the Chinese stealth armor is insanely cost efficient and your DR matters less when you obviously dont get hit in stealth often. If  not your quickest bandaid will to be to hop in your set of power armor until you can get a workable set of legendary armor.  
---
Vanguard for full health builds or unyielding for blooded builds. Keep an eye on player vendors you can often nab 1-2 star legendary pieces fairly cheap if you compromise on the type you're using. Vanguard's effect alone is better than the value of many base armors when the effect is full on. 
---
Some other notable choices outside of armor. Build dependent, evasive or barbarian can be a huge boon early on you can swap out of later when you get your armor to a decent state. The general consensus is 350-400 DR, so you can use those to get yourself there to start and as you gear better you can swap them out. Ironclad is okay if you have that much endurance but honestly there are better options. Lone wanderer if you are solo but honestly you shouldnt ever not be in a public team. 
---
If you aren't a stealth build its in my opinion that blocker and fireproof should be in your build. They are % reductions that are huge, cost effective, and dont have diminishing effects. Rejuvenated is also a sleeper good perk, it essentially gives you 25 max hp and % ap regen at the cost of 2 perk points and upkeep which you should get into the habit of staying well fed/hydrated for the effects anyway. If you're a bloodied build serendipity is the most powerful survivability perk in the game. 
---
Lastly, i'm in camp class freak on every single build you play. The value to me is just so crazy. The way I see it is thats its 3 perk points for every mutation you wouldnt get without it. Scaly skin is 50 DR and ER but at -50 ap thats super harsh, but with class freak its only -12 ap. Ill personally take that trade off any day. Iron claud is 5 points for the same value. Everything after scaly skin is pure icing. Adrenal reaction on a non bloodied build? why not its only -12 hp. Grounded mutation if you dont use energy weapons as your main arms is 100 energy resist with class freak i used this even when a gauss rifle was my primary weapon because it was only -12% dmg (though i have since dropped it). 
---
Sorry if wall of text is rambling or formated poorly, I wrote this in bed on my phone. Cheers and enjoy the wasteland!
---
Yee, pvp needs to be rebalanced. *looks at tesla*
---
My camp in the ash heap has a megasloth tamed. On the pts it has been bumped up to level 75.
---
Thanks for this! ^_^ Unfortunately, although I've heard about legendary effects etc, I don't really know what they are! So much still to learn about this game...
---
In terms of perks, I can give a quick run down here. I have to admit though I don't really have a build or anything like that, which I realise is probably to my detriment! Maybe it's not best to be a jack of all trades. But anyhow, a summary of the defensive sort of perks I have are : Bullet Shield, Ironclad, Adamantium Skeleton, Rad Resistant, Lone Wanderer, Evasive, White Knight, Lucky Break and Junk Shield.
---
I'll try the tip about the crafting and breaking. It's resource heavy but ultimately worth it I'm sure! I've also not done anything to do with the Envlcave yet but I'll keep an eye out for that :)
---
I like them, but No kill like overkill would need a hard cap. Overtime people would just kill low level mobs, slowly stacking excess damage until the dry could one shot a boss
---
Thanks for the tips :) I've done the vault raid but have a ways to go for my gold collection! I take it crafting plans for heavy amrour are just randomly around the world? I've come across some looted heavy armour but nothing particularly decent thus far.
---
I have rolling pin plans for 20 000 caps. hit me up.
---
I've read somewhere that apparently that goes against zenimax's new TOS that they released. Can't say for sure though
---
&gt; I‚Äôd go for the sale since you can grind modules for the same price year round and, historically, Purveyor sales are rare. 
---
Oh yes, why get 20 modules right off the bat and then more in the following days, when that Mariachi's Guitar Sword of Disappointment is right there, waiting for the right mr. tambourine man to play a song for the Purveyor.
---
Oh that‚Äôs great news Thank you!
---
Seems a bit steep, I'll offer you 25,000 caps
---
Yea that makes total sense, 200 is far too low and I hit it after doing 2 or 3 events
---
no they won'y target random locations. what will happen is silo codes won't work.
---
Still found two nukes last night. One was super weird someone must have hated the M named cat in the ash heap because he aimed directly at it. Found its dead corpse trying to figure out why in the world someone would nuke there. It was a trap base with a pet cat.
---
Its just a magic
---
I guess I‚Äôve been doing it wrong with two bloody fixers I got from Purveyor sales.
---
dont give me mod ideas lmao
---
I know it's not Halloween stuff but if you want to make Fallout a bit spookier there is a mod which makes night time much darker and improves the realism of the pipboy torch. It literally turns night into survival horror mode, giving you that amnesia/outlast/RE:7 feel. Highly recommend of you want to get a bit more immersion.
---
I have a pipboy replic, but thats just.. yknow vanity and for cosplay  
---
but a pip-pad on the other hand...
---
you‚Äôve used all of your extra character slots inventories?
---
he straight up fire
---
oh damn, 350 hours in the game and i didnt knew it reduces the costs, shame on me. thanks for that man!
---
Scrip limit is intended, you are not supposed to gain scrip from everything you find.
---
You can put your extra legendary item in your vendor machine. Some people don't have many time to farm legendary and will be happy to buy some at a reasonable price so they can have some scrip. You can also sells them to npc, or even drop them. It's not a bit deal.
---
However, I would be glad to have a weekly limit rather than a daily one.
---
Hmmmm.... Not sure if same person....
---
Thanks for the info, very helpful :)
---
its fine tbh  
---
beatbox can varythere is simple hiphop beats, then there is straight up techno too lmao, well and so much more
---
consider boosting luck to 4.  THat‚Äôll let you use starched genes2 and class freak2. (Don‚Äòt lose mutations, and offset mutation negative effects)
---
I would consider tryin to max, or close to max, 2 categories, that‚Äôll give you a  primary weapon and a strong backup  / secondary specialty.   
---
For example, I run 15 STR and 13 PER, which lets me switch between melee as a primary weapon, and auto/semi auto as a secondary,
---
Depending of your launcher, take one on another (steam, Bethesda or gamepass) but yes, some people do it and it's fine
---
How would I safely mule between them? Surely I'd need to bother couriers here or use world containers?
---
i like the Mayor :(
---
My mate and I have finally hit the point where our builds are good enough to actually contribute to both ACP and SBQ and no one can launch nukes. Typical hahahaha
---
Can I do 2 from Beth launcher? Or does it need to be from another source?
---
because Nukacrypt has never let us down before?
---
I'm kind of a jack of all trades, but my most commonly used weapon is a Furious Short Gatling Gun and a Combat Shotgun. For range or stealth I have a Marksman's Sniper Rifle and a Bow. I also occasionally use a laser rifle.
---
For a second account do not use the Bethesda launcher, instead run the fallout76 exe directly. I made a shortcut to the exe and put it in my start menu. I start one copy, log in find a world then I right click the icon again and choose run to start the second copy. I log in and join the world that my main is on.
---
Ja kan je niet maken man...
---
Because it broke the promise of cosmetic items only. This backlash seemed to take Bethesda by surprise (I have no idea why), so people who didn‚Äôt want to pay atoms had no fridge, and those who did pay them had something that looked like a fridge but did next to nothing. It was a clumsily handled situation that satisfied nobody. 
---
As for the daily and weekly challenges, they may have been more generous with atoms than the new seasons mechanic, but you still paid with your time. Plus the difficulty of those challenges was often all over the place, so you couldn‚Äôt say with certainty ‚Äòit‚Äôll just take x amount of time per day.‚Äô On reflection, though, I still prefer them to seasons.
---
Seek help immediately.
---
&gt; Is my math off? Isn't 50% spoil reduction of 1 hour be 1.5 hours?
---
Yes - you are doing the math the wrong way - because it's a reduction.  You are thinking of it more like durability.  If it had 50% increased durability (and durability decayed over time), then that would be the correct math.
---
But - this is a reduction in spoilage time.
---
So think of it instead (not actual numbers - but an example);  a item has 1000 spoilage points.  It spoils at a rate of 10 per minute.
---
50% would reduce to 5 per minute.
---
If you reduce the spoilage rate by 90%, it reduces it to a spoil rate of 1 per minute.
---
OK, so the Beth launcher auto logs my main in. If I shortcut to the .exe on my desktop it will ask for a login everytime and I would use a 2nd account that I would have registered with bethesda and bought a game licence for? Just checking i have this right, thanks
---
if you really dont want to bother anyone, you can leave and rejoin public servers really fast on a different character, itll most likely put you in the same server
---
If you are not actually using the weapons and armor then just get rid of it.    Sell at your vendor, or at the Rusty Pick.
---
Lame living on reddit like a tard
---
Thats a pretty risky strategy, although I agree that is normally what happens. Thanks though
---
The Reason for more then 10 seconds is to be viable in boss fights. I'm heavy gunner PA build and it could be useful at Earl for example. I can do sneak attack in the beginning but then he stands up and the wendigos spawn = detected. Now I have 10 seconds left instead of 60.
---
I got stuck in a camp today on PS4. Was standing at the vendors. They shot out a floor or something and I dropped into a pit with flamethrowers.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt have any junk on me as I‚Äôd just been to my camp, but I didn‚Äôt want them to ‚Äòwin‚Äô and kill me, so I quickly closed the game before the flamethrowers could kill me.
---
Does that annoy trap campers?
---
It's the exact opposite. If Earl detects you it's very unlikely to get hidden again with all the spawns. Especially for non-full-stealth-build
---
Boss Mobs.
---
My stash is full and so is my character. With the sale coming today I'd like to keep the scrip for some extra rolls
---
Cuz cuz cuz this is JESUS! JESUS CHRIST!
---
As I said before. I'm heavy gunner - PA - Build. I could use that Perk especially on SBQ or Earl because i can do sneak damage in the beginning but once detected it's hard to go into sneak again.
---
If you use the launcher it will log start the game using the login that you used for the launcher. Then run the exe and log in your second account. I just run the exe twice and do not use the launcher.
---
Another is better I think, I didn't see two Bethesda launcher working at the same time.
---
You can maybe have a fallout key for steam for not so much, some site have some for
---
Awesome, I can grab a cheap copy off CDKeys and create a 2nd Beth account. This seems like the easiest, independent method, thanks
---
For an example, I'm currently doing ally missions for Commander Sofia. I went to kill a robot for her and unfortunately spawned close to a level 48 Glowing Gulper, a level 48 Albino Yao Guai and a level 48 Super Mutant Overlord. At first it was only the Gulper, which I struggled with but when the other two showed up, it was easier because they were distracted by each other and I used about 5 or 6 Stimpaks out of the 21 I had. Next up, I went to the robot. Of course, it was a blasted Assaultron (stealthy) at level 46. I defeated it, but used all my Stimpaks and it was a horrible fight üòÇ However,  I appreciate Assaultrons will always be tricky. Next up, I went to my next location in the next mission. Shortly after I fast travelled, I was attacked by a level 30 Sentry Bot and died very rapidly. It didn't help that I had lost all my Stimpaks a short while before but I feel at level 46 I should be able to deal with a level 30  Sentry Bot?
---
So IDK...maybe I am being too over ambitious but apart from the example above I'm generally quite cautious and know when to back off. Like the other day when I was doing a quest at Whitesprings and got attacked by more than 5 level 62 ghouls! I was like a bat out of hell there...
---
Yeah, badly worked on my part, I meant 2 accounts registered with Beth. There is a method described below and if it doesn't work will only have cost me 10 quid. Steam is much more for the game
---
I guess that will happen sometime during season 3. Because Nuke drop event.
---
Well atleast theres not many enemies that survive over 10 seconds, and if im understanding the perk it will refresh on a boss anyway ?
---
I‚Äôm going to enjoy this next run and not feel so much anxiety about logging on every single day and grinding the weekends. 
---
I think collectively we as a sub did it to ourselves.
---
The only downside of this method is you have to type your login and password manually. I have my main acc on beth and my mule on steam. I manage to merge beth and steam clients into the one so I only keep one copy of the game on my PC and I don't have to type any passwords myself everytime I log in on my main or mule.
---
Ah ok, thanks man
---
Hmm. I‚Äôve only done ACP once (thought it was a whole bunch of meh) but I didn‚Äôt have s noticeable issue with fire.
---
Actually nice. Don't make me laugh.
---
Hmm... It sounds very much the things I mentioned and probably a quite an inefficient build. 
---
You might want to create a separate post regarding suggestions to improve your build and maybe what weapon to use.
---
Good luck with it however you go with this issue.
---
Ah ok, thanks for the info. I doubt I will use the mule too much, so hopefully it won't be too much hassle
---
Not a good sign to keep nerfing things, thats all I‚Äôm going to say.
---
XB1..Got disconnected, now F1st, Atom Shop and Legendary run all failing to load. Game works but can't access stash box.
---
Must be server issues.
---
Thank you very much for this! :) You've given me a lot of food for thought and I'll go away and research what you've mentioned. I'm only three weeks in so I'm lagging behind a lot so the help is much appreciated! :)
---
I don't have a build ATM,  I'm sort of a Jack of all trades which I think isn't benefiting me so I hope level 46 isn't too late to start one! 
---
But yeah, thanks again! :) I'll put all this info to good use hopefully!
---
I think another similar idea may be possible if Super Duper perk has potential bug.
---
Just make an executable production sequence UI and automatically exxcute producting one by one in a relatively short period.
---
Gotta love dat gamepass access. Music playing and kids screaming over their mic, annoying agro, its like gta V until they realize how easy it is for them to get their own asses handed to them.
---
Solution: make it take some extra time based on the number of items crafted. Then have the game on the back end request the super duper trigger X times during that wait period we are given. Crashes or log offs during this timer gives partial crafts equal to the amount of requests the server has already received
---
I almost never come across player CAMPs organically, I always fast travel to them. No idea if most people play like that, but I'm less worried about high level footfall to my CAMP for that reason. If it's low level players you're looking to attract, anywhere around The Forest would work for you.
---
Exactly the reason the perk is now 10sec duration. You are not supposed to use it as a heavy gunner to proc once at start and have it last entire fight. It is meant for stealth characters.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure I've seen one all the way over in Flatwoods either. I'll never understand the joy trolls get from setting up new players. Luckily most players seem to be pretty decent! Glad you figured it out before he trapped you.
---
If he's perked for it, and in PA to get the 40% AP, then yeah, it's possible. He can do 150 dmg per with headshot if you were standing still
---
It's also possible that he shot you more than twice, and game lag caused it to not register on your system.
---
I'm stuck on this. Very annoying
---
Typical Bethesda make a final mission so stupid even the game doesn't want to run it
---
Armor is only half the equation when it comes to defense.  In other Fallout games, you could get away with it on lower difficulty settings.
---
In order to deal with stronger and stronger enemies, you have to use damage mitigation perks.  Perks like Dodgy and Blocker make a massive difference.  Being able to simply ignore a large portion of incoming damage, then allowing your armor to deal with the rest, makes it much easier when you‚Äôre getting mobbed by a swarm of ghouls or shot at by a bunch of mutants.
---
The Ricochet perk will proc constantly when you‚Äôre being shot, and reflected bullets don‚Äôt hurt you at all.
---
Who says that? you as a commando build?
---
I can empathise with these comments, I have been a supporter of the Fallout landscapes since Fallout began, owning and playing all iterations. There really has not been adequate consideration for those who try to balance  work and life responsibilities, and cannot commit the excessive time to what was a massive grind, the aforesaid Legendary Run. 
---
I really hope the forthcoming iteration, and myriad changes associated with same, delivers a better experience.
---
Not at much if you're lower level. By the time you get to level 50, your weapons and armour will stop leveling with you and you won't get additional points to add to your SPECIAL when you level up, so it'd be worth starting to get a build together before you get to that point. Until then, in my experience you'll be changing your build regularly depending on what weapons and armour you pick up.
---
It wasn't before as 60 seconds is a good time to tag and have 1 minute of better damage.
---
Well you don't have to have IQ of 150+ to figure it out.
---
Angry turtle has shown that as long as you are in caution you get the buff. This includes boss fights where other people are agroing the boss. In these situations you would not be getting sneak attack dmg but would get the buff.
---
If you do some daisy's you get 200 Scrip a day
---
Split level homes!
---
So I fight legendary enemies, waste ammo, weapon condition, possibly stims/radaways, nuke cards, encryptid cards, stable flux, my time... all in game legit actions, and because of all the ‚Äúintended‚Äù limits everywhere I have to be cool about selling 3* legendaries to a bot for 278 caps or dropping them in a paper bag??
---
ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Couldn't have said this better myself. Pvp definitely has a place in this game, but in its current form its complete shit. But I do have hope for them fixing it. They actually mentioned something about future content for pvp in a Q&amp;A during quakecon, but that isn't until sometime next year. This upcoming damage rework is giving me hope that theyre going to keep their word. Theres definitely a long way to go, but this is a big step in the right direction for a balanced pvp system. Next they need to fix cola spam, and after that is the real work of balancing damage caps based on weapon type.
---
where is my heavy gunner perk then? To deal 40% more damage?
---
I have been wanting this since day one.
---
This is correct. I don‚Äôt think the fireplace is going to be bullion or atx. If you missed it, you missed it
---
Hey my ID on fallout is falcon788. Look me up next time you play. I was actually just looking at my stash and planning to gift a bunch of stuff to a new player.
---
Humans are competitives creatures.
---
"Taking One For The Team - Enemies take 40% more damage when they attack you, if you're on a team" - Right here.
---
The collectron doesn't physically drop anything off, that's just an animation. Items appear in the collection box over time on their own.
---
Thats one place.. The maps kinda big just sayin
---
That‚Äôs not what a ‚Äúpaywall‚Äù is. I get what you‚Äôre saying but your using that word wrong. And you already explained how they are limiting real money trading... by making end game gear untradable. Whats the alternative? Hiring full time people to patrol trading websites?
---
As if i don't know that "passive" activating perk. That's not active one where i can just shoot an enemey I must wait for it to hit me...
---
That sounds about right then.  Do you run a specific power armor?  Excavator is obviously better carry, but not great for radiation.  I have a full set of T-51b that's got the increased carry and a jetpack.
---
Maybe it's just me, but you shouldn't be getting any stealth bonuses while clonking around in PA with a heavy gun. Especially not for a minute at a time.
---
Count your blessings that you can use it at all.
---
Which happens the second you start attacking your enemy
---
Just found your post when googling for easter eggs. Great video. Way more than I expected.
---
Good point you make about the fact that they outright block usage in NW but not Adventure Mode.
---
They do not appear to define Editor Tool but mention third party often.
---
Thanks for you reply!
---
Yup, my PS4's frame rate was totally forked
---
Yeh in all honesty I understand and didn't really know how to word it. I appreciate your reply, just wanted to see or hear if anything could be done about it. Or is everything going to be non tradeable from here on out, as in new weapons and armor. As I said though totally understand you point, makes my head hurt thinking about the whole situation.
---
Its not BOS will only do junk . Raider does ammo
---
Stash limits exist for server stability. Same with aid weight. At the start of the game stash was only 400 pounds
---
Why not. The PA has a stealth boy mod and you got all the stealth perks you can use...
---
PTS? public test server? how do you get in it?
---
I will have to look into this, it sounds like this could help me
---
well we just have different opinions on that then. I can only repeat what i stated in the title :D
---
In a few days when One Wasteland hits, the whole map opens up to high level characters since enemies will be scaling. This means places like Grafton Dam and Steel Yard will now be good farming spots. I would say your best bet is to cater to low levels since high levels will be exploring more locations and will come to you.
---
The game directs you early on to Morgantown, and that location has lots of ghouls and Scorched so it's likely to see more love from high levels going forward.
---
Stash limit is there for stability of the server. If it was an offline game it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary really. 
---
Glad you are having fun though. See you in the wasteland!
---
PSA:  public team members can fast travel to your camp for free
---
Try to place camp near popular destinations and setup public team as leader
---
Most buyers know how to look at camp owner and can see public teams 
---
This is how I shop now to save on travel expenses or quick jumps across full map to crater/foundation
---
It's to dry out the gray market and hit those that trade up and buy their gear.
---
First they up the lvl cap on mobs, then that on the toons, somewhere in between they add nontradable gear that's better than what can be bought for money.
---
tbh I have no problem with that.
---
I would imagine most new gear will be locked behind a new currency as and when they come out so don't see them being tradable.
---
Well they buffed the deathlaser once and they stay way to long invisible.
---
It's a low cap but it force you to hoard less and play less (that's a great thing) plus you can give or sell your crap to other players...  
---
I decided i was giving all the one\* crap weapon and all the crap armor till i have clear my inventory.  
---
I would have never find some gem weapon if everybody was able to scrip everything, most of the time from vendor machines but sometime still from bots vendors and that's where i was finding most of my legendary stuff before the Vmachine, especially in whitespring aka the hub.
---
I kind of like it. Then again I'm a "couple hours a week" player that's been at it since July and just reached level 50. (PS4 died, had to start over on a different platform). I take my time, I wander. And it's been great! Honestly, I dread getting to the point where I'm just going to be grinding Queens and Earl for legendaries. That will be the point I'll move on to something else.
---
That's very disappointing. that a more worthy title gets the back seat.
---
I wouldnt put it past myself
---
PC, Atom Shop and Legendary Run are giving infinite loading circles of Doom.  Seems like something on Bethesda's end.
---
This is the example i bring up when people say "cheating doesn't affect me".  Yes it does.  It affects game development.  Its why we ended up with so much character bound gear.
---
As far as stopping it?  I don't know.  It seems like every game with player 2 player trading has this to some degree.  It's not even unique to MORPGs.  The only thing you can do is have really good tracing tools and people to comb through it and make sense of it.  I don't think they have enough team members to do that.
---
It's not a matter of opinion. Yours or mine. Fact is they are designed as i just told you. You just want all the benefits from all the perks, even the ones not designed to be used by your build.
---
A lot of your defence doesn‚Äôt actually come from armour. Perks are the key. Blocker. Serendipity. Dodgy. Iron clad. Adamantium skelly and then there‚Äôs the mutations for boosting defences more.
---
Oh you finally got around to replying? Block
---
As long as players can freely trade items between each other, RMT will exist. Blizzard tried to make it a part of their game with Diablo 3. 
---
This is one place where daily limits and maxes work. You can‚Äôt have bots or farmers just run endlessly on an account and then sell stuff.
---
But really, the only way to get rid of it is to not allow trading at all
---
Cheers!
---
Seriously, im aware that with the background radiation and horrifically mutated wildlife and poorly engineered housing sterile isn't exactly an option but it should at least be kept clean of filth and debris, these are delicate chems im brewing
---
Sad the lamp doesn't work on both...  
---
Marine helmet should have a night vision mode but marine armor looks bad to me... Like cargo shorts...
---
that's my plan. Finish the story lines and the quests and then move on to something else. Grinding for status just isn't my thing. I'd rather play a game than feel obligated to a grind. I've watched people that log in day after day to grind earl and the queen and for me that's a big no thanks.
---
&gt;I'm a heavy gunner
---
&gt;I have reservations about follow through
---
I'm sorry but the problem here is you, not the perk. it's working fine for actual stealth builds.
---
They dont put gear behind a paywall, they offer the opportunity to get something the game will never give you because of its horrible rng.
---
If they want to stop this, they have to make loot more likely to be good. Nobody pays 20 bucks for a gun he could get in the game if he could actually get it. 
---
Without trading with duping people or rmt guys, nobody here would have a really good gun.
---
Thats rough, what system?
---
I was actually wondering if I'd missed the weapons workbench that goes with the armor one. has it been released yet?
---
I don‚Äôt bother with turrets or traps. I go to my camp and kill anything that spawned with me. Repair if there‚Äôs broken stuff.
---
At this point, camp repairs are one of the few things to use resources on.  There are some places that are naturally not subjected to spawns too.
---
All that‚Äôs said, my understanding is that the spotlight increased the accuracy of camp defenses. Figure out where the mobs typically spawn and set turrets and spotlight there
---
So your alternative is just to give everyone all the cosmetics for free? Psychologically people wouldn't enjoy them anywhere near as much if they didn't have to work for them in some way.
---
The fridge is probably shit being only 50% reduction because of their stupid promise so it wouldn't be considered too "pay to win", but I still stand by the fact that if you wanted it you could have just paid for it with the FREE atoms you earn playing the game. The community response was stupid.
---
Reinforced is red
---
They just need to make new plans so the ones I saved for a whole year are still worth something.
---
This I agree with, seems like there is no real fix besides putting everything character bound or making the likelihood of getting a god rolled gun or piece of armor higher.
---
But I need to be the first one to see that 21k ammo for sale is 20k .38 and 1k 10mm
---
I just like exploring. Even though I'm level 150 there's still a surprising amount of undiscovered locations on the map.
---
They run the same as the double xp and double score dailies weekends. Thursday 12p EST to Monday 12p EST.
---
Thank you for hearing the community and responding positively. I have the collection but read so many did not so bringing it back is awesome.
---
The deep reclaimed mining helmet or something like that, I think it's from an event but I never saw one in game
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reclaimed\_deep\_mining\_gas\_mask](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reclaimed_deep_mining_gas_mask)
---
I'm on PC so I don't get the load time issues but all of the other bugs haven't really effected  my enjoyment of the game. I've had one mission breaking bug the whole time I've been playing and I'm level 220.
---
no witch hunting. plus that's not really stealing.
---
it's a D move, sure. but it's a mechanic within the game.
---
bro thank you so much
---
Reclaimed deep mining gas mask - its a rare drop from A Collosus Problem
---
A while ago the sbq gave me a two star bloodied fixer, it's been my main weapon ever since
---
So many stupid and useless things to buy with Gold Bullion, the Settlers should have a real canning station. Canned corn, canned carrots. The end.
---
It's part of the game and what you're doing here is just as spineless and shitty as what he did.
---
I'm sure they needed that steel to make a new Cauldron and the acid for their next witch's brew
---
The dried up lake bed near New Gad has lots of flat locations and fits your criteria.
---
yes.
---
I also play the game
---
And I do that.
---
It's the Reclaimed Deep Mining Gas Mask, one of the rewards for completing A Colossal Problem.
---
Rule 9. Also that just part of the game man. If you die you junk is up for grabs
---
Thanks! Hoping to bring one out by the end of the year!
---
It works as fine for you as before they just nerfed it!
---
No witch hunting, yes. Just a friendly warning for all players. Your day can be ruined as easily as mine
---
My biggest advice is invest in the blocker perk in strength... you get 45% reduction in hits from any animal which makes them feel like a little tickle
---
There is so much junk to collect in the silos. Especially lead that I usually don't pick up cause I can't travel out at the end. I went in and cleaned the place up. Should look nice when nukes are ready.
---
she is rare, like who is very lucky? like never change?
---
Well this is false. I‚Äôve gotten bloodied faster fire rate handmades and junkies explosive combat rifles off enemies. RNG is tough but you don‚Äôt need to trade to get good gear
---
Np =)
---
Same time as always
---
One of the mods I ran on every game of Fallout 4, no matter what else I was running. Wish they'd bring console mods or just darker nights in city areas.
---
I guess. my handmade shoots what, 10 rounds per second? I'm guessing even bolt rifles could make the cut.
---
No. It starts at the usual time.
---
This might be false for you because you are very lucky, the majority of people just get shit rolls, btw a combat rifle always is a shit roll.
---
that qualifies witch hunting.
---
If he barely got anything from you, why did that ruin your day? It‚Äôs literally just part of the game, and junk is too easy to come by
---
Someone was able to nuke last night on my server
---
Well, assuming the card follows the  ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard (that is, if it is the same size as a modern credit/ATM card) and made of depleted Uranium it would weigh in at 670.74g or roughly 1.48 pounds.  So that's a little high.
---
If made form lead it would weigh in at 0.88 pounds, so a little light.
---
Best bet from density would be electrum, a gold/silver alloy with an average density of around 12.5 grams per cubic centimeter.  Has the benefits of being highly conductive, relatively soft and not particularly susceptible to corrosion.  Oh and it shines up nicely to impress the rubes.
---
Sorry to keep beating this horse, but did they also have you try to delete your save game?
---
They sent me an email with port forwarding instructions and adding people to a special friend's list and power cycling
---
Told em that did nothing and then they came back with delete save game and if that doesn't work we'll do unlink as a last resort
---
I am 320 and just found the north something lookout tower. Never go up there. Top of map.
---
Ok. Maybe all of you right. It's just very upsetting to lose all the scrap over such a person. I think this post should be deleted—ç
---
Wait those still exist? I thought those were all patched out
---
I use a choo choo cannon or a broadsider 90% reduce weight as my secondary for getting a hit on air guys
---
and I spat on my monitor ...
---
makes my day .....!!!
---
Probably not.
---
Well in the trade window the only you *can* do is sell items for caps, and if you want to swap weapons with a person you have to drop your stuff, very risky as then they could just snatch it
---
Nope, there are two live right now, one in the trade menu where they force the trade to go through, and the other where they steal from your vendors, even things not for sale.
---
Both pc and consoles!
---
ZAX is not happy, I‚Äôm sure. Not nukes means no pyroclastic storms and no testing.
---
I mean, people wouldn‚Äôt really be playing nuclear winter anyway with the season, but still, it‚Äôs nice to think that ZAX is having difficulties.
---
This happens to me when I run a lower resolution in full screen than native resolution of display.  I.e.  I run 1440p full screen on 4K display
---
It‚Äôs like the engine can call the collision correctly.  If you look up or down and start moving in a direction. Then swing camera down you can move freely
---
Again it‚Äôs like the engine can‚Äôt calculate the collision boundaries of walls or items correctly
---
I know this sounds weird. But I‚Äôve tested it several times
---
Switch back to 4K/4K no issues. 
---
Only happens indoors or caves
---
I havent seen anyone do it yet, guess I'll have to be more cautious, thank you for the warning friend! And this is why I always power down my vendors when I want to afk,
---
I‚Äôve had him
---
Yeah, if you have an issue with a player, report to Beth. If you even mention a name in passing you‚Äôll get banned for 2 weeks here. Been there, done that.
---
You can still buy from unpowered venders.
---
I love FO76 but there isn't enough to do. The legendary run and atom shop are not content and Bethesda needs to realize this.
---
If they actually add content to the game via camp building,  factions, etc, I could see this game lasting way longer.
---
We waited nearly 8 months from the vault raids to Wastelanders.  They can't do that anymore or players will find new things to play
---
That too.
---
With such a variety of weapons, you probably don‚Äôt have many damage perk cards, so you‚Äôre probably not killing enemies fast enough to stop them hitting you. You might want to narrow down your selection/synergise your weapon choices so you can stack damage cards. Eg at the moment I have a hunting rifle for sniping long distance, and then a Fixer for faster close range fighting. Both are boosted by Rifleman perks so I‚Äôm always putting out max damage so enemies can‚Äôt reach me.
---
No! Not the sliders! Anything but more damn sliders!
---
Just gimme a spot to type in a quantity. I am so sick of playing keep away with the damn slider bar when I want a specific amount. I mean it may even be tolerable if the thing didn't accelerate always shooting me way past target.
---
We are not playing a console exclusive,  so please stop treating it like one and give us some basic keyboard controls. Hell, even the consoles these days have full kb&amp;m support.
---
Does anyone wanna check out my ebay store, xbox and pc. Got all sorts, pm me. Otherwise you fuckers ain't ever gonna get that armor you wanted. I'll beat anyones prices. üëç
---
Oh I love that game! Did you get that expansion? I think it was called the following.
---
Well it still hides your camp from other players, and I guess that's the most I can do as player vendors are my main way of getting caps.
---
Yeh I got the enhanced edition for PS4 and it came with it. I started it today! Having a vehicle makes it a different game almost, it‚Äôs so much fun in a different way
---
I love them.
---
You won‚Äôt know pure joy and satisfaction until those mole rats are lvl 75 and 100.
---
Do you know about the way of bloodied? The one and only build for 76. Here is a guide on how to build it, check the video to see if it fits your playstyle, also see how the right perks cards help to mitigate damage
---
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1KDLtvkwVa7thH-zvXRkxwIs2DNm1a6R-EIltxeFXDVU
---
Oh I'll have to check that out.
---
Potential that he was trying something. If he was on your team, I‚Äôve heard that your IP can be exposed (via the protocol they use for voicecomm) and the fact that we have our login name as our in game name is terrible for security. Maybe he DDOS‚Äôd your IP, and attempted to brute force your password and Bethesda automatically made you change it to be safe?
---
Either way, shitty person, and zero there about trading etiquette. You were just dealing with a crazy a-hole
---
I love that buggy so much, i think i spent more time procrastinating the story to just ride around splattering zombies than i did actually doing missions, lmao.
---
If DL2 doesn't have something similar I will be a sad boi.
---
So all I need to do is having a nuclear key card and clear out site alpha, beta or Charlie?
---
I'm just on that mission but it's boring having to return to whitespring bunker for the locations.
---
‚ÄúGet this patch out the door, Jim.  Worry about problems later.‚Äù
---
how rare is it? how lucky are you? never change that? or rare like - oh did I ...?
---
You might die? I haven't played since first week of wastelanders. Did Beth make changes to PvP or bring back survival?
---
Oh wow same here. I never started the following. I got wrapped up in the other games. I remember how much that gave me the heebeejeebees. Those zombies.
---
Lol people had like 3 days to claim it, thats more than enough time
---
Try adjusting your TV colors to attempt to fix the washed out look!
---
I personally dont have this problem but everyone has different tvs and monitors so it makes sense. 
---
I look forward to your comparison between the two. 
---
(I think it's best fix we have right now)
---
I like the suspense it adds.  PvP in adventure mode has some issues that need to be addressed, but without it, other players outside of an event would lose their flavour to me.
---
Have one if you need it. PC
---
Opinion - I wasn‚Äôt playing then..but from what I understand it was the pvp mode needed.   Same map as adventure and everyone is an enemy and it‚Äôs everyone for themselves.  That‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed now I think.  Pvp disabled completely in adventure mode for ‚Äúfoodies‚Äù like myself who want nothing to do with pvp and survival for those who want to roam the wasteland and kill everything they see, including others camps.  üëçüèª
---
I've always thought they should redesign the inventory and other interactions to be more modern and user-friendly... but then felt that long-time Fallout fans might consider it heresy to remove the lo-fi behavioure of the Pip-Boy and terminals
---
That‚Äôs the problem in a nutshell.  Line in the Sand and One Violent Night already make my graphics card sound like a jet about to take off.
---
Full set to get double ore
---
&gt;	btw a combat rifle always is a shit roll.
---
Not really. It takes  down scorchbeasts in seconds. Are there better weapons? Sure. Is it ‚Äúshit‚Äù? Far from it.
---
414??? Lmao try 710
---
Torso.  The description is wrong. 
---
Whole suit for the carry bonus.
---
The amount of times I‚Äôd be sneaking around in the dark, open a door and just see a hazmat guy staring straight at me. Slam the door shut like ‚ÄúNOPE‚Äù
---
What‚Äôs so great about this collectron?
---
They do
---
Any price really. You're lucky to be seeing one for caps. And the only reason you are is because it was duped to hell. Use to be a trade item
---
10 to 12k is normal price forces arm plan.
---
If you get lucky 8k
---
Rad Shower plan from launching a nuke on SBQ.  If you read it, you won‚Äôt get another one.
---
I'm not sure honestly. Nobody has attacked me but when I played before people attacked me left and right. Plus I played a lot of GTA and toxic games like so it's kinda burnt in that players will attack. I feel like I remember hearing something about changing the pvp but it could have been some other game.
---
I would pay 30000.  Unless you run in a dedicated team or  know somebody that duped it to oblivion it's very hard to get that plan.
---
  I do neither so I would pay max caps.
---
 It is one of the very few plans I don't have in this game.
---
Please
---
You mean you have found even more?
---
Yes actually, east of the whitesprings.
---
No, sorry. I thought the same at the beginning, like "well my 800 is almost full, time to build another stash box" just to find out that you can't increase that bloody low stash space.  :(
---
No. Hee hee, no, no, no.
---
Well, i do have spotless house nearly up to pre-war building and maintenance standards and rusty chem stations drive me crazy :,)
---
You won‚Äôt see a lot of the lining plans once learned.
---
Yes! That game was creeptastic! I always was so afraid at night. I remember the first time night hit. And I was standing in the wrong place. I ran like a .... I died but damn what a great scare! While game was put together so well. I can't wait for 2 to arrive too!
---
75...to you. But that's the point of OW. What level is it to a lvl 30 that happens by? Or, to OPs question, what level is it to a moleminer with a shotgun?
---
/sad af
---
Thanks all. Saw it for 10500 and scooped it up. Glad I didn‚Äôt overpay!
---
Same i try to keep things a s clean as I can, but my crafting room just looks a mess, I had to make a shed out back for it, everything is so dirty
---
I wanted the flag.... that‚Äôs the one I missed out on
---
It's another aspect to the game when all the useless events get boring and the quests run out
---
Dang.
---
Thank you for replying.
---
If i ever figure it out, I'll make a post.
---
Omg id love one
---
I‚Äôd rather see a ww2 related update and then the Halloween atx update. This is 25y post war and ww2 ended and started the beginning of the end and somehow we got a German lmg, a drum fed .45 smg, the handmade, and the radium rifle is one just remove the radium m1garand Todd you blessed us with a reskin of the handmade to look like a Vietnam era m4 can you give us a 1911 in 9mm or .45, a 20 round straight mag for the smg, the m1garand, a mod to remove the radium rifle‚Äôs radiation system. I enjoy Halloween as much as the other guy but I‚Äôd much rather see these also Ann Ik you guys see these posts PLEASE HELP US FO76 DEV TEAM .-.
---
Web u sell it will give u the suggested price, that's what I sell it for.
---
Are you dead set on Berserker? If so I would lose Nerd Rage - if your HP gets that low you're probably already dead.
---
If you're not, I'd lose Barbarian and Ironclad. That's 8points for 90 or so DR. That's just not much against any higher level enemies.
---
Plus a big boon is if you skip Berserker it open sup the ability to get the legendary armor effects which can be very very useful. Shadowed armor even non-legendary does a good job enhancing stealth.
---
I'd use the perks you free up to go towards more damage myself, as I see you haven't maxed out those perks. Also, in terms of weapon itself, it might be worth considering using heavy guns of some kind (I like gatling gun for ammo efficiency) since then you don't have to swap the rest of your special cards out for a secondary weapon, just change what you have equipped in Strength. As a heavy gunner I use bear arms, but if you commit to only carrying 1 or 2, you can skip that.
---
YES please
---
I doubt it. A big part of wow was the social aspect. Without some type of guild system thats not going to happen in this game. They basically left it to players to figure out their own groups, and if youre doing that then why not play a different game with that group. Also, the lack of upkeep and policing of the game is going to damage it even more. People are rocking camp ammo factories like they where a legendary run prize, and the bugs keep piling up without being fixed. It doesn't make it unplayable, but who really has any faith in the dev team at this point. It just doesn't inspire loyalty to the game if it feels like its dying. Lastly, next gen is coming quick. There's going to be a glut of big titles coming out, flag ship games and titles people have been waiting years for. Why come back to what feels like a buggy, dying game with obvious frustrating flaws, when you can play one of the other titles with your friends you had to make using third party workarounds to find.
---
I‚Äôve gotten a mini nuke, purified water, ultracite and 50 cal ammo from mine.
---
You simply think PvP is all just legacy spamming, how about you just pick your fights wisely, that's all
---
Yes please. They are so ugly without it
---
You download it with the [Bethesda.Net](https://Bethesda.Net) Launcher. It will use one of the recent copies of your character. You can check it out. Perhaps they have fixed the issue on the PTS already? My character was definitely bugged. It was just around 1% but still, it was visible. Now it's gone completely.
---
Yes! I got this too it‚Äôs cute
---
how can we tell, we don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre wearing, what your mutations are, etc
---
Not rare at all anymore. It has a 5% drop chance (someone correct me if I misremember), my guess is it will eventually become as common ad the prime plans from the Queen. I have gotten about 10 masks myself from the event, and I don't di it all that often.
---
I've read that arms provide 2x and torso (must be with arms, won't work by itself) another 2x. Will test to confirm/learn and edit post later. Full set for +100 carry capacity.
---
Nup not yet. This is the first one I've seen too.
---
That would have been outstanding
---
it does if you get a junkie's legendary weapon
---
I bought for 9k. I would love to earn it but project paradise is so rare to have pop and the right people online. It needs to be triggerable again.
---
I don't think it works like that.
---
Are nukes working????
---
I just put one on my vendor last night for 50caps
---
I've tried without dropping gear. I look at the map and note a few player camps.  Then I switch toons.
---
I've never come back in on the same server.
---
Im surprised I dont get griefed a lot given my camps location. I mean i think its a good location but i could be wrong.
---
5% drop chance at the colossal problem event, good luck.
---
I paid 15000 for it on PS4. It was the first time I had ever seen it in a vendor so it was worth it to me. It seems pretty rare.
---
It's not so rare anymore. I have had 6 drop and sold 5.
---
If you go look on the trade site no one is offering anything for the mining helmet.
---
Two weeks ago it was hot and rare just like the new rug/head/plushie plan.
---
Now everyone has them.
---
They are starting to pile up in my stash as well without doing the event a crazy amount.  Have multiples of all of the rewards, except the Earle rug.  Still haven't gotten that even once.
---
Even if it was 33%, then 33% of the remaining 67% it'd still be very beneficial for everyone to be running it. Like I said I have no clue how it actually stacks 
---
Or are you not thinking it stacks at all?
---
All they‚Äôd have to do to ban him is look at what he has blueprinted. That‚Äôs stored server side, and would be an easy check. 
---
If they decide to ban people, they won‚Äôt go by who has it where, but by what is and what has been blueprinted
---
5% drop rate, plus of course you have to await a nuke drop and win the event both of which decrease the real life rate considerably compared to fixed finds that rely solely on a drop percentage.
---
Sadly when your camp is in a popular area this is a daily headache. Count your lucky stars you weren't playing earlier on when your CAMP strait up disappeared if you loaded into a server that had a build in your area.
---
You are correct. It doesn't work like that. Empath doesn't stack.
---
Came looking for this.  Really hate the reset being around noon USA time.
---
You will absolutely get it eventually. Rarest for me have been the heads, but all the rewards from the event have a really decent drop rate.
---
Yeah and ima melee build too ;(
---
* PA is good for your level. normal armor is way better when you factor in legendary effects and backpack but if you keep dying, it might be worth the little effort to get a full PA until you find armor pieces with good legendary stats. I propose PA just because it is so easy to come by while waiting for good armor drops can take a while. you can get easy and fast increase of resistance number that way. 
---
* legendary effects are very important. Some people only want the best armor with the best legendary effects but that will take a long time to collect. I use marine, scout, combat and secret service armor as long as two out of three effects are perfect.
---
* good primary legendary effects: unyielding, vanguard, weightless maybe one chameleon and/or one auto-stim piece
---
* good secondary/teritary effects: powered, cavalier, sentinel, weight reduction, harder to detect while sneaking
---
* honorable mention: less damage while blocking (makes any shotgun 'magical').
---
* always aim for the best but realise how difficult it will be to get the perfect armor.
---
* It also sounds like you need to work on your perk cards. Armor can only do so much. first aid, born survivor, field surgeon, nerd rage, serendipity, bullet shield, blocker, ... You have a plethora of perks that vastly increase survivability.
---
The ghost are called floaters
---
As long as you're in pacifist no amount of shooting will hurt you
---
Glad you're having fun! W keep exploring waste lander! You'll get better gear eventually!
---
You had this more than once? That's just bad luck, I only had 3 PVP encounters since launch and 2 of them was in the very beginning.
---
All the anxiousness for the sale, only to be totally let down...again.  The good news, every now again someone does actually score a god roll and you know they'll post it.  We can be happy for them as we secretly begin drinking away our sorrow.
---
camp companion
---
I'd try around vault 76 just to be sure you're in the forest region
---
I rate it up there with white wolf fedoras
---
Perfect strategy. I'll buy all your rare plans and every legendary you have for sale please &amp; thx
---
For sure. Trying to figure out where my next ally mission is can be a pain when I have to work through all the clutter of turret blips.
---
I know Its a constant state of anxious/excited but you never know, what we think is crap might be worth a lot to someone else!
---
Seems like a good deal to me. I've never seen one for sale in a vendor and only occasionally see them for higher end trades on the market sub. Good find!
---
I'd rather people but more for less caps than less for more
---
Haha yeah I'm up to 35 fully scripted easter eggs and  I want to try and find another 30. I've given up on the idea that I'll find more than my first video but theres a few I haven't fully investigated so I might be able to get close fingers crossed!!
---
It is in the forest region specifically named Morgantown airport.
---
I've still got that one left to do, I wonder if you try where the door is at, like if you were going inside to get the back pack? If not there, is there a main entrance, or front side of it with any kind of signage? Curious about this one myself, the Forest are the only photomode challenges I  haven't done yet.
---
Its actually funny, they're popping up all over now. I can see him feeling that way, it feels like the game is done with policing the players. If players are willing to obviously exploit with ammo factories on their front lawn, with the reward really not being that large, then people really have no fear of repercussions.
---
Most of these players used the XP glitch when the game first came out.
---
The One Wasteland update and the start of the new season
---
You don't have to go so risky, add some friends in the game (just fire out a bunch of friend requests if you don't know anyone) then you can join their server from the main menu.
---
You'll still need to use world containers, but you'll be able to rejoin the same server reliably.
---
Puncturing pole hook
---
Electrified assaultron blade
---
Prime receivers
---
Bladed commie whacker
---
Most of the underarmor lining plans (exceptions are like shielded variants and protected raider/marine)
---
Decom shower
---
Beer stein plans from events
---
Originally the vault 94 plans
---
T60 BoS power armor paints
---
These are all top of my head, might be missing something.
---
Yes! I fought Earl an hour or so ago. Not seen a nuke since.
---
I put my ally out back where the camp gets attacked, I don't bother with turrets. It takes her longer on the PTS, but she mostly kills them by herself.
---
They need a timer of how long they can stay burrowed for and how long they have to wait before they can burrow again
---
Ah that makes a lot of sense I understand u/ZachyChan013 thanks for the clarification as well!
---
Great job. There's a few in your video I've seen and just never made the connection or didn't even know the reference at all.
---
its not exactly widespread but you hear similar stories every now and then since the game launched.
---
I never read anything about what causes it.
---
The only thing i can say is that on few occasions a support ticket can help.
---
Most of the time people tend to recieve responds among the lines of "sorry we dont have the tools to rollback your character"
---
but i can recall seeing two stories of people who actually got a rollback of their character and therefore getting their items back.
---
anyways sorry for your loss and i wish you luck üëçüèº
---
Yeah its sad that I use my 3 nukes up the moment I get to play because if I don't my lobby will sit afk the entire time I swear
---
That's how I am as well. It's pretty rare that I stumble upon somebody's CAMP unless it's very near mine.
---
I just moved mine to the Mire, so I'm pretty confident that I'm not going to get much foot traffic anymore. I was previously just upriver from the Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center, but I wanted to glom onto a junk extractor.
---
I'm on PC. I thought I mentioned that.  
---
Well, I'm sure someone else is in a similar situation.
---
Time to have an army of communist robots *ni hao tongzhi*
---
My BoS has collected ballistic fiber as well as Super Stimpacks and .45 ammo
---
Someone already bought it. Add me, I'll give you one that I wear myself
---
Thanks for the info!
---
it may have been a lucky soul that has a workjng code before they bugged out
---
And on marine one aswell
---
I've never used heavy weapons or those larger rifles in 76. üòÜ  
---
I'm on PC and I have the ammo maker. Thing is my build and playstyle is around hiding, stealth, and killing things that don't know I'm here.  
---
I'm a casual player and not really interested in moving points around. You could say I'm stuck regarding this character.  
---
I have all the Rifle perks so that would affect that weapon right?
---
I've seen a couple on other maps as well.
---
First Australia and now this when will it end
---
Hell yes. there isn't nearly enough Halloween or spooky stuff in this game about apocalyptic war that happened during Halloweek.
---
No, they are not getting nerfed. No weapons damage is being changed to be higher or lower. A change to the entire damage calculations isn‚Äôt a nerf
---
Currently the nuke system is bugged. You are probably going to have to wait until a fix. Bethesda is aware and they are working on it.
---
I've had a history of running a gunslinger's handmade, along with a 10mm pistol and had quite a bit of fun with it.  
---
Anti-armour really helps, though.
---
First of all your double-speak regarding "paywalling" for someone who is going against ToS to make a profit is a little much. It's not a paywall, it's a black market. Call it what it is.
---
Secondly, this is a non-trivial problem to solve. Even if Bethesda was a competent company that could put all its resources into this game, the engine and the game itself is so far behind the 8-ball it'd probably take many months if not years to plug all the exploits and loopholes. On top of that, this issue is so far gone that even if they were able to stop it dead today, it'd still affect the game negatively probably for years to come.
---
The only way they could truly deal with the problem is to powercreep weapons and enemies such that these items are valueless. However, since the engine is rife for exploitation and bethesda is not exactly competent and experience enough to find and deal with these issues promptly, it's only a delay at best. What you've already alluded to regarding SS and other untradables is pretty much this powercreep strategy.
---
With bloodied build and no albestos chest, it's almost insta-death with fire which fall from the ceiling
---
Not if it's an instigating explosive, it's not. I've got one of those, and it's pretty good, also a couple of bloodied autos, and vampire explosive auto modded for .38 cal. They're not handmades, but they're definitely not shit.
---
If your on Xbox I would give you some plans and stuff
---
I seen 3 nukes launched on PC about 9pm EST last night....somebody figured it out.
---
Dear Bethesda, /u/ladydevann et al: the Daily and Weekly challenges have been what's kept me engaged.
---
Since completing the Legendary Run I've not logged in, waiting for today and the new set of non-LR challenges to pop up.  Not sure why I should log in today. I don't care if it's Atoms or Bullion or XP or some other reward, it's simply having a _goal_ that drives engagement.
---
What's the goal I should be chasing today?
---
Damn rip, just bought it
---
I got 3... must b lucky
---
Full health Junkie in PA
---
They are always worse than handmades and fixers with the same perks.
---
Edit: and insti explo is always shit, because youre damaging bystanding mobs with the explosion which renders the instigating effect useless.
---
Which is why I always put stuff in player vending while it waits it‚Äôs turn for scripping.
---
Try the air traffic control tower. If you need a photo of the airport it'd be the most noticeable and iconic part.
---
Tbh I haven't really done these challenges.
---
Plasma, maybe flamer? Mine melts anything I have ammo forüëç
---
give it a while. this game slowly eats away at your good will until there's nothing left and you just punch your screen in a fit of rage.
---
They need to allow stacks, because there is _zero_ value in storing ten individual food items.
---
I agree hate that the light isn't operational
---
&gt; I cant put soup in the vending machines.
---
Really??
---
Absolutely. You can still max rep for both factions even after you choose one or the other.
---
Like fallout 3 or NV?
---
&gt; the stash has a limit to it (why is this a thing? I don't understand). 
---
It's an online game. No company has limitless storage resources. Storing it locally onto your hard drive like with all the single player games is also not feasible as it makes it rife for hacking and exploitation (more so than is already happening).
---
It's why we have limited stash and a camp budget. It's all about cost and performance of operating the game.
---
What a huge pain in the ass! I stopped doing any kind of creative building after they made those changes but noticed the fix on regular sized walls. Thanks for confirming in the event I ever get the urge to build again.
---
Brilliant! I don't mind sitting there for a minute if I don't have to be mashing the button.
---
Where did u get it for 10 bucks?
---
Easy answer: it wasn't.
---
I hate having to cook 70 glowing meats for maximum resell value. Lately I‚Äôve just been selling the raws to save time. Would love the option to craft multiples instead of one at a time.
---
I use Excavator PA with Emergency Protocols &amp; Calibrated Shocks, to get my carry weight back up near my Unyielding carry weight. I swap my perks around to put Traveling Pharmacy 3 on, to make up for losing the Chemist backpack mod. If you get radiated down to about 8%, a diluted RadAway should only take you back up to 18-19%, keeping Emergency Protocols active. A diluted Rad-X will cut incoming rads by about half.
---
Glad you're having a good time of it. When you're a higher level, pay it forward!
---
Radroach 3 floors up is losing his mind because he knows exactly where i am and cant path to me. Meanwhile i cant even use the audio to figure out wtf its coming from lol.
---
I was in a server where 3 nukes fell... so is it still not working?
---
Water is wet,  sky is blue...
---
That used to be me too. Used to laugh at the game a lot. Was able to get it for 20 bucks or something so I decided to try it out. I have about 900 hours in now and am still loving it. The bugs will eat away at you. Its all the small bugs that does that. The annoying ones. But still, I love this game and play it daily for hours. It has a lot of potential to be amazing.
---
Yes is quicker to type.
---
Eek, a mouse!  Wish I could eke out a living selling food through a cooler box vendor
---
Yess I know this! I was just wondering if ppl randomly were scrolling on map, what would first kinda catch their eye
---
Ahhhh Bethesda
---
Oh man I completly forgot about that, thank you for reminding me
---
Reminds me of breaking bad and how many times Walt goes on a mad one about cleaning the lab before anything. Mr White would've never let the chemistry station look that bad. ü§£üòÇ
---
Bombs? Rope? Lamp oil? You want it.
---
I love it when my legendary mole rat just carries on burrowing after he's dead and then im forced to say bye bye to my loot.
---
ran into an inadvisable gutsy in the bog I think last month.  Made a post and some people responded that it's a glitch and most likely should have been an assaultron.  That SOB took me out before I even knew what was happening.  Killed it and it never uncloaked.  I did manage to loot it and it was not even legendary.
---
why not bring back all of the rewards for a week? I already claimed the collectron but missed the emblem/sign. I guess I should've complained more and maybe they would have brought that back too.
---
Its too steep... should be 29,999 caps
---
FYI the robots have human voice actors and the human NPCs are also recordings of human voice actors. This has been ‚ÄúA Peek Behind the Curtain‚Äù, thank you for reading.
---
Why didn't you just wait for him to reply hahah
---
If you're that disillusioned and bitter at the game why wouldn't you just quit playing it and go do something else?
---
I played beta and the first few months after release, then off and on until the Wastelanders expansion. While the game *was* a buggy mess on release, to be fair, some of these bugs were rather rare. Personally, I almost never experienced anything terribly game-breaking, and I was having enough fun that I was able to brush past the bugs I did experience. There was a frenzy of negative YouTube coverage when the game first came out and it made the bug issue a bit overblown. There's no excuse for this in a AAA game release, but they weren't *that* bad. I'll probably get downvoted for this, lol.
---
Wonderful, this is exactly the kind of quality help I love this community for.  You've answered all my mechanics questions.  May I ask what you use for weapon preference?
---
That one is "A Colossal Problem"
---
Some groups struggle as is, so some tend to not like lower levels being there, but it sounds like you were helping.
---
The damage requirement is only for looting the corpse. The event reward is just being present.
---
Honestly thought I still needed the heads too but the last run I did before nukes messed up dropped a (known) heads plan.
---
At the end of the day I'm just in it for the screws and acid though lol.
---
Gauss rifle uses rifleman perks yes, if your ps4 character is set up the same way, then you can have it.
---
It wasn't bad, yeah it had issues but it was blown out of proportion. Fallout fanboys wanted Fallout 5 and this isnt that, it's like fallout 4.5 or fallout 4 online. The game was criticized for reusing fallout 4 assests (and still gets shit for it) but IMO its fine because it's not even a true sequel. It's a good game it just wasn't the game a lot of people wanted it to be
---
3000 hrs later I know how to deal with the limits thanks, but that doesnt mean I have to agree with them or stop asking for them to be changed or removed.
---
See thing is, they didn't make the game better. They just made it more fun, somehow
---
I never pick up loot either, and it never crossed my mind to go back through and pick up loot. Now I‚Äôm kicking myself.
---
So... you want a WMD?
---
Kinda reminds me of when the hand scanners bugged out and you couldn't get inside. I tried last night and it didn't work. To bad the good stuff is locked behind nukes. Now nukes are broken. Brilliant.
---
Wait so you need all the flux and what not to craft a whole new jet pack just to slap a new skin on it?? That‚Äôs so lame
---
It was a mess. Imagine taking a hand-me-down swingset and trying to build a working passenger airplane out of it. Now imagine that first flight. That was this game for the first 5 or 6 patches.
---
If you go into the settings you can turn on pacifist mode on then you can't start PvP unless your in a workshop.
---
I mean, what could be more destructive that feedback from a stranger on the internet? ;-P
---
Dude no joke, flamer meta is real, you heard it here first. Have an executioners/+50% lmb dmg flamer with faster reload and it literally one shot a level 65 bloated ghoul without a single damage perk equipped
---
you make it sound like it's my fault and not the game constantly \*ing its bed.
---
besides, it's been like this for almost 2 years now. since release. since the beta. if none of the **major** F ups in the past managed to drive me away, I'd wager nothing will.
---
If I see a really nice house I tend to leave a box of sugar bombs or even just a cola.
---
I don't think magic shotguns really need any perks for shotguns, well maybe weight reduction if you carry alot.
---
Perks would just go into the overkill pool
---
I would loved to have that ring... my precious
---
Feedback from insultbot.
---
I do like the pun in the name though.
---
I‚Äôve had a mole rat come up through the grate upper floor...
---
Can't answer for OP but I bought a boxed PC copy a little over a year ago from a local department store for 15 dollars.  Probably not super common to find this much later but a lot of stores tossed it in the clearance bin since it wasn't exactly flying off the shelves after release.
---
Definitely have gotten a lot of gameplay for my 15 dollars!
---
It was never ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù. It was certainly more unstable and did have more bugs but it was always fun
---
I‚Äôve got a collection now, I know I‚Äôve got to hit up the trade forums but it‚Äôs so annoying having to use third party programs to make a decent trade and then having to find a courier to make a fair trade because the trading features suck in thisngame
---
If you have 3 points for one rank of each shotgunner perk, I'd say try them. Some enemies have more hp and that 30% dmg can come in handy
---
Yea I‚Äôm about 1200hr and it‚Äôs happened twice to me.  But I‚Äôve heard it countless times when I vendor hop.   
---
Low lvl player begging the camp owner for stuff out their vendors after the camp owner crafted and dropped stuff for them.
---
conformity sucks , specially after I paid for a product.
---
I wouldnt complain at all about Fornite or Warzone locked items or limits... they were free. And If I dont have the ‚ÄúGrau‚Äù because Its unlocked by playing multiplayer (pay full game) then its my problem.
---
Here we paid for a game that has nothing but intended limits. And then we gotta pay more to unlock unlimited junk storage... 
---
How about a microtransaction of paying 1$ to unlock limits?
---
Oh calm down. It‚Äôs not like their committing genocide, shooting people they‚Äôre supposed to protect or using chemical weapons on their own fans. 
---
Also, I don‚Äôt think anyone wants their lawyers defending them on Reddit. I can‚Äôt imagine going well for anybody.
---
Was that actually a thing?  I wasn't around at halloween.
---
Maybe Blue Ridge can expand to deliver letters and mail....lol
---
&gt;I'll probably get downvoted for this, lol.
---
I mean, considering they somehow managed to break nukes, **again**, this far into the game's lifespan...
---
everyone experiences major bugs, everyone. even if you're not aware of it. that's how broken Fo76 is.
---
I really enjoyed last years Halloween event... Hope they bring back the mayhem.
---
The first Tuesday of every month they give us a new free item. So we got one Sept 1st and the next should be Oct 6th
---
Cool
---
Do the shotgunner perks stack?
---
&gt;Blue Ridge
---
As long as I don't have to escort any brahmin to get it...  
---
I would do a 5-step quest to unlock mail delivery.
---
I never said that nor did I mean for it to come across that way...
---
This game has had plenty of issues and still does.  But if I disliked something that much and made me want to "punch my screen in a fit of rage" I would simply turn the game off and go do something better with my time.  Why would you waste your time playing something that you clearly don't enjoy or think is such a horrible product?  Probably because you like it more than you want to admit.
---
Nothing we say or do will make the developers fix issues any more quickly.  If people are unhappy with how Bethesda does business they should spend their time and money elsewhere instead of hate-playing the game.
---
I'm all for constructive criticism and have given it many times in the past, but this isn't it.
---
There are plenty of discords out there, I could refer you to one if you'd like!
---
As much as I'd love a big hallowe'en event I imagine with the pandemic and a big expansion to work on we probably shouldn't get our hopes up.
---
It won't work as a skin for the 10mm pistol because the 10mm animations break the Deliverer Mesh
---
Hell im not sure i ever got one of those
---
I‚Äôd love to have this too. Crafting ammo in bulk is a PITA
---
Full Black skins for almost all weapons and armors would be cool.
---
U can change ur name on BES site.
---
Nope.  "The wastelander provides."  That red line filling across the health bar is scary as hell to a new player eating a can of dog food.
---
Lol, what a symphony of self destruction. This story couldn't be any more perfect unless you had friends there to see it so they could make fun of you for it.
---
It's now additive instead of multiplicative
---
this camp dialectical materialism is insufficient , filling report. You must work harder Comrade
---
I know, but what is currently being multiplied to find the damage?
---
Dont even worry about legacies. Had a guy with an explosive plasma gat try and get my workshop but little did he know a magic lmg does far superior work. He didnt come back for round 2.
---
im just down to this one now the portside pub an moma dolcies were the last ones so now 19/20   
---
i took pictures in the main building the towers standing on the main tower nothing proc'd the dang thing
---
I was laughing so hard. I really wish I'd thought to get a video. The perfect shitstorm lol.
---
I might be wrong since I never really played Berserker, but I think -any- DR lowers your damage, not just the DR from armor. So you'd be knee-capping yourself with Bodyguards, Barbarian, and Ironclad. Those perks are a waste, anyway -- DR has diminishing returns in the game. If you want to try Berzerker, then you either need to rely on non-DR defensive perks like Ricochet, Blocker, Mysterious Saviour, Dodgy, Lifegiver, etc. Or you could try a kind of stimpack tank and slot Born Survivor/First Aid/Field Surgeon to spam heals.  It's all a lot of effort for Berzerker's, though. You're better off just using Junkie's or Anti-armor.
---
Good to know. I really wanted to use one...friend of mine recently quite the game. And gave me pretty much all his gear and junk. With that was a few hundred fluxes...was going to make them in to fusion cores
---
tried that one no dice   
---
all the rest were easy had to look one up as its renamed after wastelanders dropped but im now 19/20
---
That would be awesome please.
---
are you on PC? I‚Äôm sure I had a spare I can give to you for free but I‚Äôd need to double check when I get online
---
Low/good prices - "Your Vendor Prices are so low your best customers are mole miners"
---
too high prices - "Not even the secret service can afford your garbage"
---
Hard to find vendors - "it is amazing you can even sell anything, your customers are clearly bloodhounds with where you hide your machines"
---
Poor camp design - "Construction must be your Passion" (reference to - [https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/018/866/e44.png](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/018/866/e44.png) )
---
Great camp design- "if only your face was as well put together as your home, you may find more friends"
---
What build are you playing?
---
The worst part was I've been rolling gauss shotguns and not paying attention to my scrap box. I had to transfer some circuits over from my low level to rebuild my collectron because I was out.
---
That's true. Black suits everything. I just really dig the desing of the Secret Service. Especially with how the helmet looks, it's very Star Wars like.
---
I think you misinterpreted my post. I never said, nor implied that I disliked the game. that's probably a given considering I'm one of the og players.
---
and the thing is that it's entirely possible to like a bad game. I enjoy playing it. I just absolutely **hate** the literal mind-boggling glitches and most of the decisions regarding monetization, balancing, etc.
---
yeah you bet I'm bitter that Bethesda is too incompetent to handle Fo76. but that doesn't mean I dislike the game. there's nothing 'constructive' about them failing, miserably, to fix basic db entries that modders got right years ago.
---
A binder for notes we cannot drop would be great too.
---
Yeah, everyone on pc shares servers. If you're on a non steam version you can actually tell who's playing on steam because their name is a bunch of random looking letters and numbers instead of their actual user name.
---
Hahaha--so, an insultbox?  Sponsored by your local insultbot.
---
u/ladydevann and u/valseek for good measure!
---
They have to be kinda dirty and matte though to fit in better.
---
Makes sense and definitely makes a lot more since why i was seeing those extremely random usernames in the lobby! Thank you.
---
I thought at one point fast travel points were set by the vendors. I wish we could have a fast travel point, but obviously the trap issue is a problem. Maybe allow fast travel points, but if you die in a player‚Äôs camp you don‚Äôt drop junk?
---
100% agree
---
Might want to wait for the sale to start.
---
Its not half off yet I dont think
---
I‚Äôd rather not do trades with strangers on Reddit, but it‚Äôs what we have.  I‚Äôve never been scammed, but I also minimize risk.
---
Try to trade with players that have a good amount of positive karma to minimize chances of getting scammed.  If it feels sketchy, listen to your instincts and demand a reputable courier.
---
I too am very intriguedüòÇ
---
I need the nukes though. Must. Farm. Earle
---
Yeah I just noticed it‚Äôs still the normal price. Ffs I was ready, but thanks for the heads up
---
I'm on PC.
---
the lore ship has sailed long ago friend
---
https://discord.gg/ZVKax7m This one is my personal favorite, lots of things to do, great people around, and they're always working to make it active :D
---
Just under 3 hours to wait.
---
Your perks
---
Two at the moment, Bloodied ranged on one character and non legendary/non mutated on the other. I have a junkies heavy gunner too but don't play it much anymore.
---
That‚Äôll definitely cause a blue screen of death. They need to prioritize game stability over all else, and I don‚Äôt think this is important enough to implement given the stability issues with crafting. 
---
And yes, there‚Äôs an argument that a AAA studio should be able to do it, but I live in the real world where they don‚Äôt. So I‚Äôd like to see them prioritize game stability over QOL for now.
---
it's possible, who knows with them, what they did to break it this time haha.  perhaps they were just trying to fix the silos sometimes saying you had already entered a correct key.
---
Yeah I forgot the servers haven‚Äôt hit ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù yet, thanks for the heads up tho
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you only get it if you launch the nuke yourself or are in a team with someone who did.
---
Sometimes the bugs work in our favor, though, haha. No nukes this week, but it's been fun popping SBQ and Earle simultaneously this last month.
---
"Duck and Cover...Nuke incoming..."
---
Np man. Here i am just fucking waiting to go crazy on the 1000 scrip i saved
---
i know that i just cant choose what it picks
---
Hell ive launched too many to count. I might have to check my build screen and see if its there. Any idea what category its under?
---
Pls no us console users can't handle that
---
I‚Äôm still not done playing that... sigh.
---
I wonder if the purveyor is going to get crowded, has Bethesda ever done a sale like this?
---
I'm looking forward to people asking why hasn't it started for the next few hours
---
Put a support ticket in. I had to do this with a challenge that I know for a fact I completed, and got my atoms the next day from support.
---
RIP u/lonevaultwanderer and all the other CMs I can never remember the games of.
---
Super Duper alone would make it worth a slot
---
and you know your heart is dark you better repent repent toniii iii iight
---
The front entrance where it actually says Morgantown Airport on the building may be your best bet! When you land, run up the road a bit across from the station and head in to the left!
---
what does ACP stand for? people keep using abbreviation on the subreddit, and us newbies can't tell what's what
---
I‚Äôm just happy people stopped posting about the bos Collectron
---
for normal inworld enemies you wont find additional benefit from perkcard damage if you one shot them anyways but for earl and queen it is useful
---
This and an armor workbench with a completely different skin. I don‚Äôt want the smoke from it in my base.
---
Very good
---
If you know you will face some (for example during a silo run) bring a vampiric plasma flamer pistol. Usually outheals the damage while melting them, would not hurt to equip some pieces of troubleshooter armor as well if you have problems.
---
Just get high and walk around. You will find some funny encounters every so often.
---
Man, now I want a Frankenstein skin for my Collectron.
---
Ah gotcha, i read that wrong. In workshops you can‚Äôt choose what it picks, you have to build the right collectron. Only in your C.A.M.P. you can choose what it collects, IF you have multiple collectrons unlocked, otherwise it will only pick up its default targets.
---
Spoiler, it wasn't the Institute that invented teleportation tech. It was Arktos Pharma *all along*.
---
this
---
tried that one is there a sign down by the main road perhaps
---
They do stack. But you're better off using 3x 1* Cards than a fully upgraded 3* Card. If you have space for more, go for it!
---
true. but even then, a few weeks ago there was a gold and score glitch. care to take a guess at how long it took them to fix both? let's just say it was less than the broken nukes.
---
so it gives you an idea of what their priorities are, and it's definitely not fixing bugs that negatively affect the player. it also shows that they're able to fix things in a speedy manner, when they feel like it.
---
Finally someone gets it... Since I finished the Legendary Run a month ago there has been almost zero reason to get on and play daily. I‚Äôve been having such a hard time keeping atoms that even with Fallout 1st it‚Äôs rough. We need some kinda way to earn atoms. (If you‚Äôre like me where you‚Äôve been playing for 2000 hours and have almost all of the atom world challenges beat, then there‚Äôs absolutely no way to make more atoms.)
---
A Collosal Problem. The new boss event
---
Rather partial to Urban Scout Armour Helmet + Medical Goggles personally
---
i feel like its the places list where ive been to beckly in the ash heap or abandoned bog town in the cranberry bog it still wont count them
---
Oh damn is that what they're going for? Didn't know it was that rare of a drop.
---
I really need a few more dozens of nocturnal black powder pistols, hope this time murmrgh would answer my prayers üôèüèª
---
Right here, Officer.
---
How else are they expected to fight teleporting mole rats?
---
Yeah I think this is something I need to adjust. It's tricky for me because my play style in Fallout (3, NV and 4) has always been to use a variety of weapons but it's seems it just doesn't work that way in 76. Eeesh, it's going to be tricky to narrow down my gun selection! More research to do. Thankfully I've already unlocked a lot of the perks.
---
Next time just disengage.
---
so paying for a game means you have the right to bypass its rules?
---
interesting concept.
---
Thanks for the tip, I've unlocked it :)
---
And that's still a stupid hill to die on, of all things to whine about this was by far the least relevant or meaningful.
---
3 hours before you get that Instigating Minigun
---
Whats FO1st???
---
mmm. well ok, but I don't have an answer
---
Many thanks! Yep, I essentially don't have a build, so that's my next project: be super cautious and pick a build so my character is more focused rather than all over the joint! :)
---
I think it's kinda iconic. I can't remember how many low levels, including me, wore this around the wastes.
---
That's a forge 
---
How else would you make formed plate armor?
---
That‚Äôs all the reasons I haven‚Äôt made any trades it‚Äôs a giant pain in the ass. Ive lucked out and found two passable fixers that I bought now it‚Äôs time to upgrade.
---
Thanks for the tips :)
---
I've heard this mentioned but don't know anything about it! Thanks for the link  - I'll look into it :)
---
Well, clean vault tec one from Fallout 1st are pretty ok
---
I wore a gas mask/green hood combo for a long time. The insurgents outfit just looks great with it
---
On the normal bench, it‚Äôs just a bucket of hot coals. I just want a bench where that doesn‚Äôt exist on it.
---
Perks, legendary effects, food/chem/aid items
---
My original idea was to kill people if they lost but it's very hard to fit both the wiring necessary for the game and enough traps to actually kill someone, so destroying the prize was the balance I found.   
---
I did have an alternative idea to float the camp over a cliff and use roofing for the floor so I could destroy it and drop the players if they failed but I thought it would be too much hassle.
---
Thank you for all of this...very helpful :) I think for sure I need to up my legendary game...a visit to the Rusty Pick but I also believe Events and some daily quests are a good and reliable way to pick up legendary gear?
---
same with me for Beckley
---
I‚Äôd be on board with a freezer or canned food station, if it were a gold bullion item that everyone could earn.  It would be a fantastic amenity, so everyone should be able to work towards it, like the ammo machine.
---
As an atom shop item, I think the fridge is fine.  I don‚Äôt use it because it‚Äôs hardly better than simply carrying the food on your person.  It‚Äôs a very minor asset that can be ignored.  It doesn‚Äôt offer a clear advantage for people that pay.
---
There‚Äôs a very fine line between pay to win and paying for minor convenience.  I think the 1st scrap box is dangerously teetering on that line, but simply opening your wallet and being able to hoard dozens of jars of cranberry relish or scorchbeast stew indefinitely would be a clear pay to win situation.  Food buffs can be very strong when you stack them or are able to amass large quantities.
---
Indeed! I have a lot of the defensive ones already but there's a few I'm missing so I'll work on that  :)
---
It‚Äôs a plan like any other camp item.  Edit: it should be in the last category of the build menu along with tents and such.
---
This! Or something very similar
---
I'm from Portland, keep getting crazy photos of back home from friends and family. Stay safe out there.
---
convenience != rules
---
Robots without humans seem to do some pretty wild things. Cargo bots and robots could bring them. Deathclaws come from salamanders so I could see them sneaking into the dilapidated building. The scientists could have brought normal animals that soon mutated after the war or maybe they mutated the animals themselves?
---
No, you can change on the terminal
---
There isn't a montage video of all the issues (at least not one that's both comprehensive and accurate) that'll bring you up to speed.
---
The TL;DR version is that Bethesda went hard for the cash grab, launched a product that clearly wasn't ready according to the very very short beta period and has demonstrated again and again that its management are, to be the absolute kindest, inexperienced and out of touch. 
---
They broke a core promise of only selling cosmetic items in the MTX store, have not delivered on features that they said they would, even to this day (the legendary perks that are coming soon are more than a year late). Bethesda has shown that they have no qualms burning their reputation and their player base all for a short term profit. 
---
They have a chronic problem of being unable to meet a deadline and an inability to manage version control of their software, a technological framework that's decades old. To my knowledge there isn't a patch yet that they haven't reintroduced a previously fixed bug.
---
This all coming from a supposedly games industry leading multi-studio, multi-billion dollar corporation.
---
As I mentioned before, that's the short version.
---
I wouldn't call it luck given the current state the game is in (fine but not that good really too). You just happen to start playing when the game is in a relatively (cannot emphasise this term enough) better place.
---
I used to do it to force people to tour my camp,but the novelty wore off and I like making caps so they are now the very first thing you see upon fast travelling into my camp
---
Look at it again. It's a bucket of hot coals with a billows on it to add air to make it really hot. 
---
You put your metal in there to make it soft(ish) than you hammer it into shape on the anvil that is on the left side of the workbench. There should also be a big bucket of water next to it too but honestly it doesn't have to be super realistic after all. 
---
There really should be one on the weapon bench too if you are using to forge swords and stuff but it looks like it is more centered around machining parts for firearms.
---
How are the items effectively destroyed?  Would it just break the vendor?
---
* ally quests, colossus and scorchbeast queen events all give legendaries
---
* many farm videos for legendaries exist but make sure you watch a post-wastelanders video. many locations have changed since the making of a lot of those videos.
---
* definitely go to the rusty pic, the 50% off purveyor event starts in 2.5 hours
---
Bloodied Gauss Shotgun. Does around 1500-1700 damage. One shots most things in VATS.
---
Not the actual combat itself maybe but more the fact I can walk up to you and shoot you and actually deal damage. It adds weight and consequences to your actions.
---
try to get your dr to about 300, which is enough (from 300 upward it wont give you much more protection because of how the game works) any powerarmor gives you a 45% reduction in incoming damage anyways for example 240dr in powerarmor will protect you more than 300 outside of powerarmor.
---
use perks like blocker or serendipidy for added damage reduction
---
and sneak also helps.
---
in general you will be able to craft secret service armor on lvl 50 so you will probably be exchanging your armorpieces for secretservice ones if you get good rolls soon but a ap refresh or better sneak armor piece on lvl 40 is still worth keeping in use!
---
Yes, I just destroy the vendor so they can't access it
---
A company lying to consumers, especially alongside the other fiascos centered around the product, is a valid reason to be upset, whether you agree with their grievance or not.
---
Pete could have, you know, not lied. He could have not been shitty to Fallout 2 fans when they asked about pre-war jet (because if jet is pre war it means Fallout 2 didnt happen which raises all kinds of issues). The point is this isn't one incident, it's several from a company that has been determined to damage its once beloved name. There's a bigger picture than people being upset about one lie, though they'd be absolutely valid in being upset if that was all there was anyway.
---
I guess it depends on how badly you want the gun or how important it is to you.  I personally have no problem taking 10 minutes to upload some screenshots to Imgur if I can have a B/25/25 fixer (or whatever) at the other end of my trouble.
---
Edit: a b/25/25 fixer is well worth a full day of aggravation in my opinion.  That thing is monstrous, even on the PTS.
---
Ooo the enclave could have contracted them to make formula p so they could heal their militarized deathclaws? Or the government before the war. Fev virus was around way before the war so mutations were commonplace in the military already.
---
Mumbles needs some cats. Each time she coughs up a nocturnal black powder rifle......
---
..BANG. One less cat.
---
The team has multiple times referred to the game as Software as a service. The whole point of continuing to develop games like this is based on the ability to monetize and yes of course expecting that over time people will regularly spend more money on the game. 
---
That's by design and the days of flat fee games went away with flat production games. You're paying pretty much the same price for a much more polished and final product game then original console games like nintendo and sega offered and those days when a game came out, it was out. If it was incredibly broken, it stayed broken forever. 
---
These days people want ever growing new content for the same game and non stop bug fixes and patches and that all costs money. You're fighting a fight against an entire industry that's changing, so yes end of the day it's trolling microtransactions because your problem is with a direction games as a whole are going and you want the cool stuff but don't feel like you should have to pay for it. 
---
Let people spend money how they want to, especially these days where most people are locked away in their homes 24/7, if they want to spend their entertainment budget for the month on a game to dress like a pirate, fuck man, let people live their lives and do what they want. 
---
This is a very American complaint because this has been so common place in games all throughout asia for more than a decade.
---
What time do you usually play?  I'm on the weekends early mornings.  Hit me up if you want... Mr Joker21
---
I think it was sarcasm, dude
---
I started farming exp/legendaries again. It's nice. After Meat Week and the arrival of Earle, I stopped doing it as much. I'd just wait for a nuke, go kill SBQ and Earle, then wait to do it all over again.
---
One thing I noticed but probably isn't obvious for most players -  1st members have the option to buy some things/bundles currently not available without the subscription.
---
For example the Red Rocket bundle (with the PA skin) was available for me yesterday - bought it already when it first showed up in the store - but it did not show up for a friend without 1st.
---
Yeah  problem i also seem to have is the jet pack not appearing.
---
they are hiding in the ventilation shafts
---
Raiders and Settlers coming together to shoot the Vertibirds out of the sky.
---
* I'm stuck in the foundation
---
I am and appreciate the offer.  It will drop eventually though and I don't think I would even craft one anyways so it's all good.  Just mostly commenting on my weird lopsided rng.
---
Not really sure if all plans have the same drop rate for the event or not but I have at least 6 spare plushie plans from the event and none of the rugs lol.
---
The heads and rugs always drop for me, but still no mask.
---
He asked for advice on his shotgun build not your Amazon review of the game
---
I'm rolling 2* ranged weapons.   Looking for a few things for my own use, or things I can sell for about 700 caps in my vending machines.
---
Not sure the exact method, I haven't tried it, but it involves placing the collectron on a concrete platform and blueprint that. There are YouTube videos that explain exactly how.
---
May all your rolls be God. Praise be RNG!
---
 Pc player but was great having a civil conversation for once. Its a wonder what age does for that. I always wonder who comes up with the ideas for updates for these game companies. Just ask your player base for ideas and let them vote on it or something.  The map has so many great locations to build up add more buildings make others that can be entered. As for the bullet sponges yea the Mobs don't need more health they need better attacks. Make some of the attacks so massive if you get hit you die they are avoidable mind you.  I laugh sometimes they have a gun pointed at you but just don't shoot like they know its all over.
---
Oh shit wrong post lol ty
---
Maybe birds? Cats are to domestic imo, I‚Äôd be that guy that challenges you to pvp because you shot a cat
---
I think the laboratory AI tries to copy the fauna and flora of Appalachia.
---
I have my camp set up near alpine river cabins right on the river and there‚Äôs like an ungodly scream that keeps happening and it‚Äôs awesome as Halloween is just around the corner.
---
Infinite Grenades and Blood Packs , its great
---
Tho i wish it didnt brought the swords , weights a shit ton and gives only metal and etc, almost everytime i have to check the box to get rid of the swords
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Didn‚Äôt see anything in what I read. It was more about making it clear they would not allow real world trading of any kind or purchasing accounts. Plus, I don‚Äôt see how they could monitor that. It‚Äôs not against the rules to give someone weaker better gear, how could you prove a player gave himself those items over someone else just being kind
---
1000 plus the 150 you get today. So 23 pulls if you are all weapons.
---
Yeah. It's a nice idea but that's never happening. PC just isn't a priority. 
---
If Bethesda is openly admitted that the single most requested feature, text chat, isn't a priority for them, this has no chance sadly.
---
At launch, it was extremly unstable ( server crashes every 30 minutes or so )...we just couldn't own a public workshop...
---
It was really buggy, some quests were also as much buggy, affecting some ppl progression with the main questline.
---
On top of that we played the first 2 patches without any depth of feild setting. You could barely see what was happening 25m-30m away from you. The environnement was ugly...
---
There was so many broken things...it wasn't feeling like a beta but it was feeling like an alpha...
---
Every patch was bringing new bugs. Personally...trust me nobody knew i was playing this game. Unless you never played a finished product, Bethesda was really hard to defend on this one. Bugtesda made honor to its reputation...they even sold the game as a finished and amasing product when it clearly should have been sold for 20-30$ max.
---
Do i enjoy the game now ? Absolutly ! I have been one of their most frustrated and desapointed customers. Now, i'm really hyped for the futur, we are definitely going somewhere !
---
But I don't have a keyboard on PlayStation! Not fair haha! It would be nice to put down a "letter piece" and then be able to edit it. 
---
And why can't we get billboards we can modify ourselves?!?! If I wanna sell soiled food for 15k each I want to promote it! Some people pay top dollar for my spoiled meat!
---
I don't think the friendly creatures are the only ones bred by the robots for the experiment. I think the creatures are a mix of those bred there &amp; ones that have been able to get inside via unseen holes in the walls/ceiling. The deathclaw only comes after you've collected enough venison, so maybe he was attracted from aboveground?
---
Aside from the Grafton Monster, the Sheepsquatch, &amp; the Deathclaw, every other creature seen in Project Paradise is a fairly common, mutated variant of a prewar animal, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility that the robots have been able to recreate them.
---
Thank you for sharing your Sarcastic Survivor Story.
---
That's not true. They expand it, just because we have missing knowledge on how something happened doesn't have to be a Crack in the lore.
---
YeS thankyou! let the Bethesda gods bless your rolls as well fellow wanderer! Praise be RNG!
---
Got lucky and got it on my first run. Now all I seem to get is the plushie plan. Received 8 in a row.
---
The first time I did this quest , with my Alt, it went fine. Now I'm back ,a month later, with my Main, and Ra-Ra just stares at the terminal. She wont unlock the door. This is the room with the Power Armor.   Holy Crap!!! I was typing this while rebooting the game and it started me outside the dungeon on the road to Grafton Mine. Now I gotta do that crap all over again?  Maybe some other day. I'm gonna go play Assassins Creed and try to forget my sadness. 
---
I normally would have given up on a game  this buggy but I frickin Love this game. Its so sad that a game I really, really enjoy playing is the game most wrought with errors. Why Bethseda Why???
---
The best is when you approach them to turn in their quest - only for them to teleport away from you.....
---
Don't forget to compliment her on her clothes or hair, she likes that.
---
Once p22 goes live, it‚Äôs also worth considering the poison and fire resistance perks.  Those are the only real damage concerns I have as a min/max guy.  Fire is very rough for my sniper, and poison is nasty for my power armor heavy gunner.  Conventional attacks are pretty easy to deal with once you get damage mitigation perks stacking together, but fire and poison are completely separated from % defense and DR.  The fireproof perk helps a little, but it doesn‚Äôt quite allow you to trivialize fire damage like legendary armor does with poison resistance.
---
Im not sure if they have but id imagine itll be thick for a bit
---
I‚Äôm just curious. Not trying to be argumentative. As a fallout player since 97 I can‚Äôt think of anything that doesn‚Äôt jive. What instance definitively doesn‚Äôt jive with lore?
---
That the one where they're getting in trouble for decorating it for halloween? If so i too hit that up very late, only realizing it was there for one of the old atom weeklies that had you take a picture from each lookout.
---
Damage recalc in patch 22 coming on the 15th perhaps.
---
I could see that being necessary for metal armors, but that level of heat shouldn‚Äôt be necessary for combat and other ceramic armors to me knowledge, and certainly not for wood, clothing or leather.
---
I was thinking about that.  You wont get a god roll but you will get a major and a good 2nd star like FFR.  Gonna be 25 scip so that is a lot of rolls.
---
On behalf of the League of Grandpas playing games I must slap you on the wrist with a dead molerat for this comment. Please stop locking away your Grandpa.
---
Now where is my licorice again...
---
Other then that, he's telling us that he's played with a cheated weapon that can ruin the other players experience and he wants advices...üòê
---
Gotcha ill have to check for it then
---
Money = unlimited junk stash
---
[I just did it.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17KFclvDgsU5jKwYI6y6fcHu2GortuP0Q/view?usp=sharing) I went to the front of the airport where it says 'Welcome to Morgantown'
---
hahahaha - definitely need this one!!!
---
Just building another box does nothing when talking about server space. Same reasons vending machines and displays take stash space. You can always complain it‚Äôs not enough space, but it‚Äôs a perfectly logical reason why you can‚Äôt do those things
---
Give us a thanksgiving event. Make it so we collect
---
enough foods that the waywards, Raiders, and settlers make a meal for super mutants but then, once we finish cooking scorched beasts and scorched come to steal our food and we must defend our dinner of friendship!
---
or maybe kill some scorched? Hunt a tasty Sheepsquatch? I absolutely love the idea of a seasonal Thanksgiving event where the two groups come together!
---
Fed76's price prediction is kind of all over the place. but next patch Anti armor may be a smidgen more useful due to the upcoming damage recalculations
---
That would actually be awesome.
---
Nerf
---
I just never know if people leaving stuff at my base is them dumping junk or not (I have 100% left a bag full of grenades I don't want at someone's house just because I don't know what else to do with them).
---
I don't remember if I crafted my first set or got it from Mrgph.  
---
I know once I got the first piece, I spend a lot of scrip trying to get both heavy metal and WR for all 5 pieces, and either Alos managed to get bolstering or vanguard on a couple of them.  
---
if you are PS4, I have the plans.  I have several mod plans, but I think I learned most the mods through scrapping.  (Its the mods that really boost the DR.)  For example, IIRC, the basic torso is 76 DR, but after modding to alloyed, it jumps to 117.  The limbs start at 30, but after the same mod are 45.
---
Didja take a look at car-henge?
---
Damage calculations are being changed. Aa will stay in the same rank it is currently at
---
That site is also pretty much junk
---
ok ill give that a try then ty!
---
yea that makes more sense
---
Has anyone from Bethesda ever commented on the Scrip Limits in their game design. Why and if it actually seems effective for their purpose?   
---
I can't imagine anyone is happy with them and its a pretty common complaint.
---
I am holding on to Vampire and Anti armor weapons for the next patch. Still keeping all my bloodied weapons to see how bad the nerf will be.
---
The pool is to small to make anything on ACP rare.
---
Yeah, I'm not doing any of the meta builds, so I don't really care about a god roll.  Doing the 2* weapons,  you get to look at twice the number as compared to 3* weapons.
---
The blue neon letters do snap together so I have no idea why the rest don't to be honest.
---
They ‚Äòll just bump up the drop rate on previous items/plans. Add spooky collectron skin and a devilish vaultboy cardboard
---
How long does the sale last?
---
Accessibility sadly is ever an afterthought in development.
---
'What's that you say? You want us to change jetpacks?  *Poof*. Ok, now their fuel is gold bullion'
---
ive always kept my vampire's stuff, being there as a PVE tank in ACP can be nice especially if my team members are all bloody and falling over every few mins
---
Ah, I didn't realise they snapped (just got the plans but haven't used them yet).
---
It's even more hilarious that this design existed in previous games aswell; where ammo had NO weight, meaning by the end of a campaign you might be carrying 10s of thousands each of lesser used ammos
---
The lack of proper directional audio bothers the hell out of me.
---
I wasted 3 cards last night, I was really upset. Wish I could get them back! Any word on an update for this morning?
---
I have no faith that my pets will survive this update.  My mirelurk king is several months old. He loves messing with the bees that spawn at my camp. I‚Äôm not sure how he will make it against level 75 bee swarms. I will make a memorial for him and not tame another pet when he dies.
---
Wood, clothing, and leather are covered by the sewing machine on the right side of the bench (along with straps and things) 
---
And it actually the opposite for combat than you think. The heat required to produce ballistic ceramics is insanely high. It would strait up melt pretty much anything in your camp. 
---
But of course this isn't going to be realistic. You can produce a working nuclear generator out of tin cans and duct tape.
---
It might make a difference for the enemies that require two shots from a magic shotgun. Some of those like gutsies and assaultrons might turn into one-shot enemies with a bloodied magic shotgun since their remaining health is very small after the first shot.
---
That'd be very strong. I'd love to have something like that but i'm thinking it might be so good that it's a must have for almost any build, which isn't optimal if you want people to be able to play their own way as much as possible.  
---
Still a cool idea tho
---
ACP always gives a guaranteed 3* plus a random 1-3* from Earle himself.
---
At this point the Old World Blues HoI4 mod cares more and adheres more strongly to the lore than bethesda does
---
I didnt even think about the fact that im about to get 23 3 stars
---
If it only effected one class or combat style, maybe you'd be right, it might be a nerf.
---
But it affects all combat types, and is a change from multiplicative to additive damage calculations.
---
Me, I would call that a recalculation, because it affects everyone. But than again maybe it is because Im not stuck with the vocabulary of a kindergarten child.
---
Fuckin kids these days eh dad?
---
Point your gun at her and tell her to give you the good stuff.
---
shoving super mutants and the BoS in every game, no matter how unlikely and absurd the justification might be, is not good story-telling. they're there just because they're popular, not because it adds to the plot somehow.
---
oh, and because the assets are already there. silly me.
---
I wish we could leave terminal entries to each other along the lines of this
---
LOL! Fed76...
---
Don't waste your time with Fed76. The dev for it openly admitted to biased data and don't factor in any in-game pricing.
---
They're probably basing their idea off the fact that damage changes shift damage buffs from being multiplicative to additive. 
---
For normal damage calculations, this ends up being a nerf but if the same is applied to AA weapons (and I've yet to see any actual evidence for this from anyone on the PTS so unless there is any, I'd take it with a grain of salt), it actually improves AA damage potential.
---
Multiplicative AA gets dimishing returns after the first AA buff. So if you stack multiple AA effects, the more you add, the less and less these extra AA buffs impact damage. With an additive model, each AA effect would theoretically contribute its full potential to armour reduction and therefore damage.
---
As I mentioned, unless you see hard evidence of improvements between live AA vs PTS AA, I'd be wary. Especially if it comes from Fed76.
---
it's a recalc that nerfs everything across the board.
---
so you might as well just call it a nerf.
---
Fed76 isn‚Äôt reliable why do people still use it?
---
That‚Äôs part of why I‚Äôd like a version without the coals - it doesn‚Äôt have to be 100% realistic.
---
But thank you for expanding my knowledge!
---
Ooh, can I be one of the dirty cops that gets caught up in unsavory business when I can't pay off my debts?
---
Yea, thankfully I‚Äôm not looking for a holy grail, I‚Äôve got a AA +33vats + 1p and a vamp +10dmg +dr while aiming fixers. And a small stash of handmades. But you‚Äôre right, I need to trade off some of these HW weapons and free up stash space.
---
Yeah but how does expanding the lore break it? They showed us parts of the History we didn't learn in other Fallouts.
---
I'll take those off your hands if they're too heavy for you to lift. ;P
---
The Thanksgiving table and chairs from last week beg to differ.
---
And her perfume. Being trapped in the same fancy suit for years isn‚Äôt easy for a lady.
---
Quick estimates are attracting alot of people
---
Are the supposed AA improvements actually the case? I've yet to see any evidence to confirm one way or the other.
---
Yeah, thanks! I need to add him to my quick list :)
---
A few minutes or until you‚Äôre out of scrips.
---
An AA Fixer is going to be pretty valuable with the new damage calculations after p22.  I was messing with an old AA/E handmade on the PTS and it‚Äôs not too far away from B/E handmade damage, at least vs lvl 75+ mutants.
---
Drives me nuts!
---
And since in 3 and New Vegas it has up to 4 digits
---
Very stupid that it only goes up to 3 digits in 4 and 76
---
I hope hope hope they do something better with Halloween this year. Last year was dumb, they didn‚Äôt put a single Halloween item in the shop until the week before Halloween then added more the day before Halloween
---
Wow no fast travel. What about public events? Or do you really just run everywhere and skip the far away events?
---
They kinda buffed AA if they changed the way it stacks to additive. Make for more of a linear curve vs diminishing returns.
---
The one thing I do know is that it will only count when it says Morgantown Airport when you are looking through the lens.
---
I told you not to build THAT close to whitesprings come on!
---
Seriously, they are the worst. There should be a cool down on how many times they‚Äôre allowed to do it or how often they can. The amount of times I‚Äôve had to watch a mole rat repeatedly burrow multiple times in a row...
---
And there is going to be level 50 mole rats after this update.
---
Don't waste that flux on fusion cores! Cores are easy to come by in the wasteland and you'll be laden with them faster than you know. After you prime that gat, then use your low cores for fresh new ultracite cores.
---
So it seems like you might not know about the upcoming patch and what it means for you now. Tuesday, The formula for how damage is calculated will be getting a nerf. Energy weapons in general are getting a significant nerf. Who knows if they‚Äôll adjust it again in the future. This is being called a balancing for all guns, but it seems like it‚Äôs aimed specifically at the duplicated Gatling plasmas and laser legacy weapons that have been all over the place lately.
---
People in the trade Reddit‚Äôs are starting to try to trade away their Gatling plasmas for things more like your 50 cal that are hardly affected by the nerf. If I were you, I wouldn‚Äôt make Gatling plasmas part of my long term plan.
---
anti armor is still gonna be the same, but since damage calculations are lowering damage across the board, anti armor may get pushed up the "Meta" flag pole. plus with one wasteland enemies getting tougher and having more DR and ER, anti armor will help with the punch
---
so I have enough points to re spec so I will give it a try as a full shotgun build, thanx for your advice
---
Agreed!
---
What platform I would love to give it a go(have no use for most of the prizes though ight contribute some though)
---
Yes, all xp boost effects stack.
---
I am gonna give the full bloodied shotgun build a try.  I have more than enough points to re spec.  also, be interesting to see how much damage I can get up to.
---
Mom get off of reddit and go to bed
---
Because it‚Äôs just by chance that there is always a group of extremely similar super mutants despite the source they came from always being different
---
Thank you that's very helpful
---
Just dress up all the white springs robots and npcs and let me go trick or treating
---
that sounds like fun, thanx for your advice.
---
try to sell it now, prices are dropping. 5% drop rate sounds low but eventually everybody will have one.
---
I'm an xboxer, my IGN is Korindabar
---
Fed76.... Why do people use that piece of shit site. It has nothing to do with real item values.
---
People have already done a lot of testing with bloodied. It's not a bloodied thing. The issue more is that bloodied build have so many synergies that their relative number drop is much larger than other builds by comparison.
---
However, the damage changes are proportional. It pretty much doesn't change the position of builds within the meta. Bloodied will still hit the hardest, followed by Junkies but the gap between the top tier builds vs lesser ones will be smaller, that's it.
---
People are mostly crying that their big numbers aren't as big anymore. Several youtubers have demonstrated that in terms of effective gamplay, aside from some exceptions, the impact is negligible in practice.
---
gonna give the full bloodied shot gun build a try.  I got the points to switch back and I would like to see what the max damage I can get out of this build is.  thanx for your advice
---
They‚Äôve released like 3 or 4 versions and most could have been bought alone too
---
I want a werewolf costume
---
Early days: 
---
to initiate pvp you did ‚Äúslap damage‚Äù initially until the other party fought back. Problem was that some players ‚Äúslap damage‚Äù was actually an instant kill. So that got ‚Äúfixed‚Äù. Caps lost from being kill was proportional to how many caps you were carrying so you could actually lose a lot.
---
Legendary energy guns would drop with explosive bullets. Since energy guns don‚Äôt fire bullets, it was fixed so they no longer drop. The existing ones remained in game as legacy. 
---
Camps could be destroyed without provocation.
---
Stash space was literally half what it is now.
---
Fighting the scorchbeast queen was actually a fight instead of being the cigarette break that it is now. 
---
There was no player vending.
---
All in game venders had 200 caps each so to sell off your unwanted items you‚Äôd have to fast travel from train station to train station. Uphill both ways in the snow no less. 
---
There was no such thing as a legendary scrip machine or purveyor to help you get rid of unwanted legendaries. Most people either sold them to train stations or dropped them on the ground. 
---
There were no npcs. Just 23 other players on the map doing their best to avoid each other for fear of being instakilled. 
---
There were no public teams.
---
Leveling up was actually a challenge in spite of the fact that a lot of enemies awarded higher xp gains than now.
---
Nuking whitespring resort was the hottest thing. Damn near an event in itself. 
---
The map was empty. Telling a story through holotapes was stupid and boring (speaking for myself on that note as I know some people enjoyed it). 
---
According to many people it was a buggy mess. Personally I never experienced any of the bugs that most people reported. Call me lucky. Server crashes happened at inopportune times though.
---
YouTubers banded together to relentlessly troll the game calling utter trash, ass phlegm, just bad, etc. but only after playing it for roughly 30 minutes.
---
Yes, that one.
---
They do stack, yes. I usually use Inspirational and Strange in Numbers/Herd Mentality/Egghead mutations and perks, and already have a high base INT on my character. Different foods and drinks will increase it even more, most notably cranberry relish. Run all of this on a double XP weekend and you'll level up like crazy, assuming you're not already a LVL700.
---
I like the idea of a Thanksgiving feast, possibly a reskinned Meat Week with some different rewards.  Grahm is the natural choice for a host.
---
With the end of the year packed so full of holidays in American culture, it could eventually be one limited event followed by another.
---
Black Friday could morph into something pretty crazy in the Fallout universe.  The possibilities are interesting and potentially dreadful.
---
It's the same virus on the same human race?
---
Yeah, I've had a scorched conqueror explode like a robot on me before.
---
Hand a bloodied build a vamp mini, help your fellow man in realizing that tiny envelope they spend their lived in isnt worth it.
---
I'm bloodied and run quad magic shotguns I don't use any shotgun damage perks at all I can basically kill most thing in one go. Only damage parks I use are nerd rage, adrenaline reaction and gun-fu.
---
Nocturnal does less than base damage/DR during the day.  That is why it is hated upon.
---
depends on the source, example. you CAN stack Lunch boxes (X4 for +100%), 1 bobblehead, 1 sleep bonus, 1 food/drink and 1 perk 
---
my favorite stack is Max lunch box (+100%), Carnivore + Tasty Squirrel Stew (+20%), Shared Inspirational rank 2.. unless someone can share rank 3 (+10%), 1 bobblehead (+5%), 1 well rested/rested/lover's embrace/kindred spirit (+5%)
---
After hearing of the dmg changes I‚Äôve never been so happy to run an adhoc build, AA and furious weapons for this guy
---
I have always wanted Biv as a camp companion.
---
lovers embrace (or sleeping) does stack with food related bonusses, as well as inspiring perk.
---
other than that every special point of INT grants you plus 2% xp and there is the lunchboxes bonus (max 4*25%)
---
so theres the leader bobblehead (5%), ONE food bonus, sleeping, lunchbox (max 4 aka 100% bonus), inspiring (max 15%) and maxing you INT is all the xp bonusses you can stack.
---
ps: carnivore doubles the xp bonusses as does herbivore for the food part
---
pps: stranger in numbers can boost your xp from fooditems if you have carnivore herbivore
---
maybe it doesn't, which is highly, highly, highly debatable- to say the least. but that doesn't change the fact that the justification for not doing so is always some deus ex machina loosely held together by strings.
---
what I said in my op has several meanings, one of them being that Bethesda is guilty of poor story telling, not that it necessarily breaks the already established lore. but even then, you'd have to take their crappy excuses at face value for it to work.
---
Where do u get the witch and skull costume again? I‚Äôve gotta get my outfit.
---
That sounds disgusting.  Best I have is a Bloodied Combat Shotgun that does around 350-550 in my unyielding gear.  Thanks for replying to me so much later!
---
Losing a keycard sucks but replacing it is almost trivially easy. The computers in the Enclave bunker even tell you where the keycard cargobot is.
---
Because two-shot was already nerfed.
---
Thats very useful
---
I used to get one every couple of days and sell them for caps. I think it's getting tougher to find buyers, unless you sell it for super cheap.
---
what is the outfit skin?
---
And the ability to change the color on the reclaimed mining gas mask üò∑
---
Call it whatever you want big boy, it is what it is
---
It's ran by a bunch of man hating women.
---
So did they finally fix spotlights? Last time I tried - and I must admit it's been a while - they would shut down whenever you left your camp and stay dead till you rewired them (or added a switch to turn them on again)
---
No, I totally get it. It's a game. We don't need that level of realism. I  hate the billows too but only because it sticks out like 2 feet into the middle of the room. 
---
With that said, I actually just looked up ballistic ceramics production. I'm actually a little surprised in myself for never having done it before since I'm pretty curious and have a background in material production (mostly plastic though) 
---
It looks like there are several steps to the process, but the hottest one is only around 3,000 F. That sounds like a lot but really isn't. You could do it in camp with the right equipment, but the whole process of making combat armor from scratch would require enough equipment to fill  the entire camp area 
---
Also, the ceramic layers are usually formed over an interior metal core so you would need the forge anyway (not to mention having to make all the various buckles and such) 
---
God, there needs to be an alarm that goes off when you begin to nerd out like that. Ha!
---
I would never threaten Mama.
---
On the adverse of the same coin, it‚Äôs a real kick in the teeth for folks like me that ground super hard to acquire rare and powerful items legitimately.  Things change in live service games, so I‚Äôll adapt and grind again.
---
Do you know of any evidence to this?
---
I know theoretically, it may well be this way but there have been surprising results with real world testing that run counter what theoretically should be the case.
---
Highkey im surprised they skipped halloween because the war started a week or so before halloween
---
10/31 *twenty-four seven*
---
yeah, and that's the only exception. which answer's op question. but even then, we need to check how it stacks against the diminished bonuses from perks, etc.
---
might end up a nerf too, regardless.
---
Bethesda: Limits your storage capacity  
---
Also Bethesda: Limits how much you can sell
---
Don't worry, they won't. Its deadline will just be pushed a couple of times such that it'll be held during Christmas.
---
Less
---
I guess some Bethesda things never change eh? Just let the midders make the QoL changes and drip updates for us plebs.
---
"Move your damn spawn point..."
---
Saw my first invincible ghoul after an sbq last night. He's fast.
---
I knew there was a dmg nerf coming...didnt know the details on what guns were being effected more...well at least i wont have to worry about cores for my pa for a long time...i think i have enough to make 100 cores and they are at the 116% and I user the fusion core perk lol
---
You don't really need friends to mule them **for** you. All you need is a friend that is online and stays on the same world.
---
drop your stuff in a container that nobody passes in a world that one of your friends is on. switch characters. Go back to the world of the friend. Collect. There is a little risk involved if the friend changes worlds in the meantime or somebody loots the container. So for transferring scrip, the risk is acceptable. Good role gear I wouldn't do this way. I only lost my gear once this way and that was because I chose a way to popular container. Don't use trainstation containers...
---
It's  150, not 200
---
And inventory management is an integral part of this game, love it or hate it.
---
Remove enemy teleportation as well. I have seen enemies teleport around when they are not even stuck on anything. Kinda cheap if teleportation isn't one of their abilities. I hate this stupid game.
---
If we did that, my mailbox will be filled with messages like 'Your base is gross' or 'Why?!? Just WHY???'
---
I wish you weren‚Äôt right but you so are lol
---
Yeah it‚Äôs nice to have a stockpile.
---
Same here, on XBox I am level 400 and I like to get in on a good fight.  It seems when I go in everyone expects me to do kill Earle myself but its not what I do.  I want to play the game like everyone else. ign:  Send Me 4 I Am
---
Insurgents
---
I wish I weren't right either but we have to accept Bethesda for what they are, not what we'd like them to be.
---
oh yeah, +22 INT. Max 15, +5 from mutations (Egghead and Marsupial) and +2 from PA helmet Internal Database
---
The Jetpack disappearing is a known issue, I will check in on the mods issue as well.
---
Whatever you can sell a gun for is it‚Äôs value. Not what some drop down menu says.
---
interesting.  So I have the following Gauss shotguns I was going to roll with Bloodied with either limb damage or bashing can't remember (and don't remember the last perk either :)).  Instigating 33/25, and Quad 33/90 % RW  would you mind sending me you build.  So as of right now I specked out for a bloodied command with no bloodied commando weapons (may have a line on one).  Do you have any accuracy issues?
---
I thought I took a screenshot before going into the mineshaft to fight Earle, but I didn‚Äôt. Either way, all 8 of us going in were wearing them. I‚Äôve sort of taken the approach to rarity being related to whether or not I have one. Or two. Or more. Soon it will be as rare as the greaser jacket or crumpled fedora.
---
You are totally right I have no idea where I got 200, probably thinking of the bullion cap hahahah

Exactly. Most people in the game world are clueless just like in the real world. When they sugarcoat a nerf as ‚Äòbug fix‚Äô or ‚Äòrebalancing‚Äô, most would pretend they understand and accept it like a sheep. Just like in the real world when they plan to further depreciate our income via taxes, they would brand it as ‚Äòpatriotic‚Äô or ‚Äòpunishing the rich‚Äô, works every time because the general public is dumb af.
---
Good luck. I saw the sale and was able to get my 2nd and 3rd character to level 50. I can't believe I saved this much scrip without spending, and it's about to be all gone soon.
---
Sometimes mine works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
A Colossal Turkey
---
not worried about the keycard :3 more worried a main feature in this game doesnt work üòÖ so i put it down and come back another tine ü§£ maybe the brother hood of steel ü§î idk when they arrive but ill keep eye out
---
No, they're not landmine molerats. They're molerats that have the same visual and sound effects upon death as an eyebot.
---
same as always... thursday noon eastern until monday noon eastern.
---
This is a letdown. They stated it somewhere?
---
I have tried nearly every day since I got the game 3 weeks ago.
---
You don't think that this is an [efficient gaming experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn332J-xAXk)?
---
I can do that, I finally got silencer for it a couple days ago
---
That‚Äôs a bummer...it‚Äôs so cool, just wish it worked properly
---
I can‚Äôt be bothered with players like that. Just fast travel away, hit social tab and ignore...
---
This is a great idea.  
---
We can build a fusion generator, and wire it to a (built) decontamination shower, but we cannot run electricity to a fridge.
---
Thanks dude. There are definitely ups and downs with player interactions, but the vast majority players I've met have been chill and fun.
---
I wish there are dance emotes for non FO1st players, it's always nice to just pass the time waiting for ACP with a dance party xD
---
I've seen this Jhal guy in other threads, he just likes to argue and his points are never that good. Just let it go lol
---
Some time vats is a nightmare and you have to be In and out of vats. Other than that just use vats and should be ok. I've heard the gauss shot guns has vat bugs but that's only way to get them to magic using vats. I'll post my build next time I get on. But it's basically just every weight reduction perk you cans use best part of magic shotguns loads of carry weight .
---
Oh God, especially when I'm trying to track down a bleepy ghoul who fell into some bushes.
---
Here is a good [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cb43a7/guide_how_to_run_multiple_instances_of_76_on_a/) how to run 2 instances, works for myself since a long time.
---
This is the first time since release that there has been any issue with nuclear codes. It‚Äôs being addressed at this time. 
---
Feel free to take a break, though.
---
Deviant materials will be *confiscated*
---
Or when they have perks related to directional audio...
---
Liquorice in civilised society :-)
---
Yeah I had scorched doing robot sounds and lasers then exploded like a mr gutsy :p
---
I don't have any nerve damage but I second this, slamming the X button to craft over and over is giving me cramps. Not to mention this is another obvious feature, like the No Mic emote, that Bethesda has just... left out since forever, for reasons unknown. One wonders if anyone at Bethesda HQ has actually played the game itself.
---
Sorry for the double question, it just occurred to me.  Are they not able to repair it?  I understand it isn't in the spirit of the game for them to do so, but you know I worry about poor sports.
---
I'd like to see B release those split-flap displays from Watoga.  Seems like they could add up-down arrows to edit them, hopefully lockable or owner-only.  That's certainly not keyboard entry, but it'd be a nice upgrade from hand-placed steel letters (at 0.2% camp budget per letter).  Edit with a camp terminal would be even better, but a scroll-and-pick interface for each letter would be painful there.
---
I suppose they could come up with a marquee sign, too.  Make a set of letters that are craftable non-camp items (junk or misc items), then make the sign as a display CAMP item that can only display those letters (similar to the way wall weapon displays can only display certain weapon types).  Then you could add/remove the letters from your pip-boy interface, one at a time.  That's pretty cumbersome, too, but it'd certainly be better than spotting those individual steel letter plates on the wall.
---
Like the skeleton pinned down on the side of Seneca Rocks
---
Well we beat the game...a live service game.
---
Achievement unlocked.
---
i agree with this exactly.
---
It rarely works. Non of the spinning lamps do. But you can trigger the animation by storing it and then place it back, fast travel away then back.
---
True story
---
Blood soaked armor would make berserkers useable
---
I don't think they can because it becomes invisible and there's nothing to click on for a repair but I haven't checked it more closely. I haven't seen anyone repair it at least.
---
Pretty sad that there's even the need to ask for this, it should have been there since day 1. But the jank ass coding of this game of course can't handle it.
---
It really seemed like a very basic contract. I was confused what about it was new
---
Every day max carry https://imgur.com/gallery/RFjYsTk
---
Yes I have.
---
That would be awesome!!!
---
One of my favorite tropes in sci-fi is "robots continuing on with their programming beyond the death/end of the humans that made them." The Ray Bradbury short story *There Will Come Soft Rains*, the Doctor Who episode *The Girl in the Fireplace*, GLaDOS in Portal, and almost every robot in Fallout, always one of my favorites. I can totally see the Arktos pharma-bots continuing to find, bring in, and breed more and more dangerous animals so they can continue their testing.
---
I'll buy guns rather than modules for a change.
---
I have only seen mine work as intended one time and it looked amazing. The rest of the time it just has a faint purple glow and it's a massive disappointment.
---
Poorly.
---
Yeap, that's the one lol
---
Ah yes I remember those days about two years ago.
---
Agreed. Those small steel letters are a mess.  They seem specifically designed to get lost in walls.  I don't know if snapping is a fix for that, since half the time you can't get them to lay flat on a surface, but it'd sure be a good start.
---
These are fantastic!
---
That is a great build. I made a similar setup but the doors just opened randomly. Would you happen to know how to setup those wooden traps? I don't know what to use to trigger them. We don't have the trip wire. What would you use?

 &gt; These are fantastic!
---
Thanks, I did have a read of that, but there seemed like a lot of steps that were not 100% necessary?
---
Exactly i have 3 .50 cals and maybe need to fix 1 amomth
---
55 to 60 lead at each one. The robots scrap, so much stuff. I also found a tinker workbench in the large storage area last night so can scrap it b4 fast traveling.
---
Spent 20 minutes searching a room for a magazine following the audio cue one day, it was literally on the other side of the room, where I could barely here the sound.
---
Oh i didn‚Äôt know that , thanks.
---
yeah the vats on these things can be rough.  concentrated fire helps, I think skeet shooter may help as well.  I was thinking the bonus you get from the full set of unyielding would help because of that perception.
---
That‚Äôs to common I think.  I‚Äôve ran ACP countless times and only got the mining helmet once.
---
I got it to work.  I checked the word board in the bunker like they said and the one they said *should* work did.
---
Then it's absolutely wonderful.  You're a very creative player for all that you've done for this community, and don't get enough praise for it.
---
I had an anti-armor somerset special sold it for 350 caps
---
If you don't like them don't go to locations where there at because their not common at all

are you telling me what to do "hey billy get in here"!üòè

BETHESDA LISTEN TO THE MAN YOU‚ÄôD MAKE SO MUCH MONEY IF YOU DID A CRAZY STOCKED HALLOWEEN FILLED ATOM SHOP THE MONTH OF OCTOBER

You only really have two technical data;)

When I was using it as single shot, I felt like it was a little weak compared to some of the other rifles (at least for single target). However, now that I switched to commando and then gave it the auto receiver, I just melt stuff with it.
---
Thank you for the post! We're discussing with the team different possibilities for future seasons.
---
Agreed. First time I fired it up, I thought it was the coolest thing but I seldom even have it working properly lately. I don't know if you have to scrap/store and replace it it every time or what.
---
Thank you! I just sent you a friend request! I woke up to my camp no longer being where i left it lol and it asked me if i wanted to move it or not.. so confusing indeed. 
---
I'll be on later today sometime after work! Appreciate it.

I love the Gas Mask / Assault Helmet Combo...

I HATE that the Gasmask Visor looks so 2007. Just make it transparent.
---
This "Glass" looks like 'Static Car' Glasses from FPS Games from 2005. You know what I mean, its these glasses you try to shoot at but are indestructible.
---
think it's the rarest ACP drop
---
It's for the "real" community. Not for those casual players that play only every second day.
---
I‚Äôm waiting with fingers crossed and at least 1600 atoms on hand lol
---
I play a lot of berserkers and you‚Äôre right. Using armor perks also counts and you can‚Äôt have a status effect that brings you to negative dr or else it‚Äôll make you do little damage. Btw when armor is broken you still keep the legendary attributes so it‚Äôs possible to keep an optimal build but it‚Äôs payoff will be worse than bloodied
---
" did Beth mislead us?"
---
no.
---
For a second I thought this was going to be about the issue I had where it wouldn't let me create a new biometric card.
---
I changed servers, closed the game, and reset the console and still couldn't make a new card in any silo. It would only let me erase the old car and scan my self. The terminal to make a new one only had the welcome message.
---
Use the wasteland trapper gasmask. Its a shiny, tinted glass that looks pretty good
---
 Only issue is that its pretty massive
---
Your request popped up then disappeared! What‚Äôs your ID? I‚Äôll try to add you. Or you can try to add me again. I‚Äôm on fallout 1st so you are welcome on my private server whenever I‚Äôm on.

Would almost definitely get turned into an exploit of some sort...
---
Never thought I‚Äôd actually get an official reply... Thanks for taking the time.
---
Something telling me you stole the image from a guy name bungo by screenshoting his YouTube video when he released 2 weeks ago and then poorly editing the screenshot
---
Nope, rewards are no longer collectible! However the Chicken Coop, Ammo Converter and Lunchboxes will be available for gold bullion in path 22!

Yeah..I‚Äôm hoping they can survive somehow, my base is near 3 super mutants spawn so it‚Äôs unlikely

---
Aa does 5% less damage than junkies on average for.normal enemies. I beleive AA actually does more damage than junkies vs SBQ and earl due to the lower damage numbers in general vs %damage reduction and very high DR. But have not seen actual numbers for them yet.
---
Thx.  I had seen other posts to the contrary so I thought I would just ask.
---
yeah I've just used like 300 plastic,  completely ran out and realised that I've need it for crafting üòÖ
---
Oh what? I just figured the player count went down during the week off and the usual nuke-launchers were taking a break haha
---
Always a good idea! :D
---
Since AA is actually a debuff on the target, it still uses multiplicative damage. On the PTS, this currently puts it just under junkies. This could change at any time Bethesda decides to do more tweaking
---
There won't be any low level mobs once one wasteland hits.
---
It was part of the Mischief Night Halloween event.  In addition to blowing up cars, killing robots, lighting bonfires, and spraying graffiti on cottage walls you also had to "fork the lawn" in the Whitesprings courtyard.  
---
I thought this was a really fun event.  Lots of explosions.
---
bethshit won't ever ban these hackers
---
The WORST one is that piece of work at the White Springs Spa!! 
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Except that you had plenty of time and notice to do exactly that. But you didn't. And it's over.
---
That looks awesome and I have the black Easter egg  will and will be on in about 6 hours or so (21:00 gmt)
---
Edit: damn actually don't think it's possible to place that item in your camp..
---
Can you tell me how  did you get it to work please? Was in a server earlier and 3 nukes had gone off.
---
I have loved blowing up Whitespring cars for a while now.
---
Just sent you another one! :)
---
Also my ID is: AloushMan
---
I dont understand your reply. I have 203 in my inventory
---
Alpine River Cabins is a great space for a Halloween event. With it‚Äôs spinning portraits and ground rumbles. I‚Äôd love to see them do something in this space like the museum of witchcraft from F4
---
This camp has everything.  Aliens....drones....a hidden cabin........Dan Cortez.........
---
Well no, if you intend to run 2 instances of the game at once at the same PC you will need the original exe/ini files along with the renamed ones for the 2nd account. It isn't that much work anyway - copy/rename the exe and the 4 mentioned ini files and you are done. Whenever a patch is released, make a new copy of the .exe file. 
---
If you can spare the storage place, I guess one launched via Bet launcher and one bought/launched on steam would work too. But that means twice the storage space used and patch downloads twice.
---
I was kind of annoyed when I logged on the other day that it wasn‚Äôt there but I wasn‚Äôt to annoyed cause I didn‚Äôt actually play since alpha was on but i do hope I can do the 50%of legendary though
---
There's a note on Nukacrypt that the codes *might* work... but won't the vast majority of the time.
---
That looks really cool! And a great photo too üëçüèº
---
It'll be the same as last year..
---
Go to the White Springs bunker. Go to the word board in the command center. If the word board says in progress you use a certain code. If the word board says complete you use another code. And if the word board is just a mess of numbers no code will work.
---
That's awesome man! Sadly the black Easter egg was atomic shop and can not be placed in others camps
---
Obviously. Sometimes it‚Äôs required to kill during a mission tho. Not everything is as easy as ‚Äújust don‚Äôt do that‚Äù
---
I was surprised how small it was!!
---
They def wouldn't shill out the money for elvis. They probably could buy the rights to a 100 songs and it would still be cheaper than one Elvis song.
---
Still lower in the forest. And I'm sure people would still kill squirrels or frogs
---
The armor bench, rug, and sleezy bed are neat, not opposed to free camp items in FO1st. I‚Äôd love more outfits and armor skins though. 
---
(I‚Äôd love a black scout skin, shiny black and chrome like the enclave robots. Hell Id even settle for a shiny brushed steel skin to match the reclaimed deep mining helmet.)
---
Seriously though, if they really want people to buy more stuff, stop giving us new furniture we lack the budget for, and give is skins to things we already have and want a different look for.
---
&gt; This is the first time since release that there has been any issue with nuclear codes.
---
Actually no, [this has happened before](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-has-been-a-nuke-free-zone-since-january-1/). Check out the date on the article.
---
Although that time it was apparently a bug introduced by the new year (the first new year after launch).
---
How about halloween survival tent? Boo!
---
We're aware of the Nuke issue and have isolated the problem, we're pushing out a fix for this that will require no downtime however it is looking like it will be out tomorrow instead of today.
---
Great idea, but what if they also added an organ to the instruments for the camp and had it so you could set it to play that spooky organ music from the church in the mire?
---
I really want to be able to add that spooky organ music to my camp somehow...even better if it was a device so you could set it to trigger.
---
In fact, how about a door activated trigger for power systems? You open a door and it activates like a switch? That would allow for a lot of interesting effects for a horror camp I think.
---
I know my camp is where scorchbeast Spawn's
---
Thank you for the support, also I'm a lady lol but thank you!

I think you need to look up what 'ambiguous' means. 'Claim your rewards before the season ends' is pretty explicit

You don't need to do shit to the game to run 2 accounts. Just run the exe directly and log in ingme. Done and done. Only thing you might do is shortcut the exe to your desktop. You can run the exe twice with no issues.

During Fasnacht, I moved my camp over near Sutton. There's a big field across from the train station and back down the road a bit there's another big field, give it a look.  Plus, you're near the Overseers house, I didn't have many issues with finding a server there.

I feel personally attacked.

Update to this, they found the issue and are working on the fix. There will be no downtime but not it's looking like this will happen tomorrow.

They didn't skip Halloween, we had the *Mischief Week* event. It just coincided that the majority of that week happened after the 31st.

---
Do you have unclaimed rewards that you can't get or are you saying that based on what you've heard from others? Just curious.
---
Keyboard and mouse support even if its just for building would be nice.
---
Inconceivable! would be great! Two kills for 1 bullet on maxed out damage build (or two kills 3 bullets if mons take 2 hits now)

For real. They should have called it a Planetarium Nightlight.
---
You didn't read the article, however, the Bethesda tweet specifically states it was an issue with accessing the nuclear silo, nothing to do with nuclear **key codes** \- as they mentioned.
---
I went to see Biv this week twice and both times he was glitched into the wall. Seems like he‚Äôs having fun
---
I collected  40 key cards yesterday. So not a bad day off.
---
Awesome idea
---
Almost all if not all robots will go hostile if you hit them enough
---
And so i won't get potentially banned for crafting 500 leather left arms in a row
---
_Laughs in heavy guns ammosmithing_
---
Lol, I honestly thought it was the size of the wood effect spinning nuke globe..
---
I think it'd have to have an expiration timer, on the order of tens of seconds, like the other chain damage-affecting perks (Adrenaline, etc.).  In practice, it'd end up being a free critical shot after killing a general mob. It would sure be nice for high damage, low RoF builds (Rifleman mostly).
---
Thanks. When you say a certain code??? So you can‚Äôt use nukacrypt codes? Sorry to be annoying.
---
That's just the Display Name for forums etc, not the login name which is the one Fo76 uses
---
Honestly I hate using those
---
Junkie's is a great option if you don't want to go Bloodied. 
---
Also take advantage of stealth bonuses if you aren't using power armor.
---
You want to make sure you are using one of the prefixes that give you the "magic" damage in VATS (Junkies is one), otherwise shotguns are trash.
---
Yes please. It‚Äôd probably take 5-minutes to do. I‚Äôve had a mod for years now on FO4 that did just that; turned off Pipboy, and used a PA helm light source for Combat helm light. Weird to come to 76 recently and remembering it never worked.
---
Have you decided on a build?
---
Start selling your junk to robot vendors. You shouldn't be having weight issues at lvl 25.
---
I was picturing like the greenhouse dome, like an actual planetarium to go in üòÇüòÇ boy were we wrong
---
I can remember trying to level a mule up at Whitesprings and there was a 3* 65 and I was only level 12. It killed me so many times and kept going back hoping some high level would help. Gave up in the endüòÇ
---
Great job, one of the coolest camp ideas I've seen in the game!
---
Now that would have been something! üòÇ
---
I‚Äôd like a note writing system to write custom notes lol
---
I actually randomly joined that event for the first time. On completing it I got the formula. I remember hearing people talk about it but didn‚Äôt think much of it
---
I've gotten at 5 of them so far and at least 4 of every cursed weapon
---
nukacryt has two sets of codes
---
That buzz is almost entirely a handful of YouTubers saying something controversial for views.   If anything the evidence points towards Fallout 76's monetization hasn't been what Bethesda planned.  ManyaTrueNerd has a great analysis on the History of the Atom Shop where he points out how they've been retooling their monetization.  And beyond his point, you can look to the Legendary run's reduction in atoms as another sign, they're trying to change how the game is monetized.  If it is working, they wouldn't be tweaking like they are.  
---
In addition, Bethesda's was very clear at the time Fallout 76 launched -- this was never intended to be Fallout 5 and that there would be more installments in the future.
---
Or, "Pull my finger!  Too late..." üòÅ
---
While you could do that, all changes to things like full screen, windowed, borderless, resolution, sound... would apply to both instances because there is only one set of ini files to store the information. I prefer to have one version full screen and the other one in a smaller window on my 2nd monitor without sound  whenever I start both.
---
... unless you live in N. California or Oregon, in which case you can just look out your window to see orange skies
---
We're discussing different possibilities with the dev's for future Seasons.

You might check your CAMP budget.  Pets do count against that.  I don't have confirmation on this, but it might be withholding the tame option because you don't have enough budget to keep it.  Can anyone confirm or deny this?
---
I would LOVE this, but I also feel like the potential for abuse is way too great :-(
---
I'm getting stir crazy not being able to melt a scorchbeast queen into oblivion with a gatling plasma though
---
Recently found out that you should definately collect millitary ammo bags and millitary duct tape from early on
---
Thanks very much! Excited
---
Yeah I skip out on most events, unless I just happen to be close by. 
---
But yeah I just run/sprint everywhere. He's still pretty low level just cuz I don't get to play him too often and doing quests that way is really slow lol.
---
Finally going back to my camp feels amazing, and I really rely on those train station stash boxes and work benches out in the world. But it's a fresh feel compared to the fast paced location hopping of my other characters. Makes me think of FO4's survival mode too, which I liked.
---
Edit - fast travel in 76, to me, makes locations feel like a bunch of little boxed arenas separated by loading screens, instead of a huge open world, since normally you just fast travel there, do the thing, then hop back to whatever the quest giver was.
---
Give them an insane speed buff and lets chase turkeys!
---
Are there any alternative sites to help with pricing?
---
Hi, I'm happy you come across cheap vendors as you sound like a newer player out there. I'm also happy I am not the only one just thinking about caps since I sell all my food for 2 caps, my receipes for 5 caps, plans and weapons for -50 to -60 it's ordinary price, ammo and grenades for 1 cap, stimpacks for 9 each. A lot of players even come to revisit my camp several times a day because of this and I am always at 30'000 caps... never ever broke or short in caps since putting nice prices to the things I sell..
---
Also, when there is a plan for an ordinary price of 3000 caps I decide to go down as much to 1400-1200 caps for them on my vending machines. People buy them immediately.
---
Yup.
---
You are keeping way too much garbage to be out of space at level 25. If you're stockpiling weapons and armor, unless you somehow have legacy stuff, get rid of it. You'll find better stuff as you rank up. Without knowing what you have it's hard to give advice. Maybe you have 40 mini nukes or 6 sets of PA or 4000 gunpowder idk obviously scrap junk before storing and only keep what you need for repairs and minimal building.
---
The bot and animation is all UI. I have an underground camp. He sometimes falls to above ground (weird sentence now that I type it...) and I still get junk without him able to get back to the station
---
Happened to me yesterday and just got disconnected from colossus... Sometimes I hate this game and wish they'd fix all the broken shit before pumping out content.
---
I got the atom reward, since I have I like to help others find the games.
---
This is how I managed my inventory before FO1st and it was a great system for me.
---
Collect Everything. Scrap all junk. Use tinkers bench to bulk all junk.
---
Leave stacks of 5 bulk for all items. Couple rare things you'll want to keep everything (Lead, Acid, Ballistic Fiber). You'll figure it out, start with stacks of 5 for now. Anything excess of 5 bulk stacks you should sell the the vendor.
---
I would work on getting traveling pharmacy (or appropriate back pack mod) and Bandolier. Keep all aid items and ammo on your person. Your stash box will only be used for junk storage and weapons.
---
Try to keep some strength bobble heads, alcohol or ragstag steaks on you when possible. Or if you have a couple pieces of unyielding gear. This way if you ever get over encumbered  but don't have anything to discard you can increase your carry weight quickly for a fast travel.
---
Per some other comments a few days ago I did select, and am in, pacifist mode. All I noticed was when I came out of the vending screen these guys gave me a thumbs down and then started shooting. I wasn‚Äôt sure what was happening so I just quickly fast traveled back to my camp. 
---
Do you know, if they had followed me (can people see where I went?) would my turrets have fires at them for attacking me?
---
Your base is full of meat piles, isn't it?
---
What platform?
---
There's no reason for it other than a "gameplay comes first" perspective.
---
If it'll ease your mind, think of it as the enemies coming in due to hallucinations on toxic substances running through the lab's air.
---
I am!  Do you know how I add people?  I can see how to add people who are in my same server but I don‚Äôt see how to look up or add people when all I know is their username.
---
All of the more involved recipes should produce better food results. And one part of that should be they last longer.
---
In fact, there could be a whole update centered around cooking like there was with scouting. Include things like chances for legendary recipes, extended bonuses for eating foods, outfits, and more. 
---
Attach it to farming and you really got something non-combat going here.
---
Lol I just looked. Thank you nuking timeü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

Last year, I went back home (I'm originally from WV but have been living in MN for the last 6 years), visited a bunch of the real life game locations, took pictures while dressed as my character, and posted side-by-side in-game/real world pics.

I‚Äôm on Xbox mate
---
WOW! Thamls for tips! The Gasmask looks pretty dope actually! I saw the Outfit and said to myself "meh" but the mask looks cool.
---
But the outfit was time exclusive right? And I missed out back then :/
---
This seems like a vanity idea.
---
I could not agree more!
---
I'm hoping for a Pristine Vault-Tec Chemistry Bench next month... But, a clean workbench **should** be available to all.
---
Mine is berkeley tooüôÅ
---
Very cool - Love the vid. I just had to rebuild my camp last night...learned a lot about camp building &amp; wanted to take advantage of that knowledge.
---
just wait until someone sends a platinum chip
---
When you are away from camp yes, but I tried it and if you or anyone is at your camp you don't get materials until he deposits them they dont just appear randomly in the station.
---
found a really good video explaining concentrated fire and the different ranks, it does appear to have a bonus to VATS accuracy, but I may not have noticed due to high perception.  not sure if i can post the link here but its on youtube called 'concentrated fire: fallout 76 perk spotlight' by 'Fisty McRib' just uploaded yesterday looks like so should be up to date info
---
I think Blue Ridge has better more profitable things to do then send, "I Like You" messages.
---
What platform you on? Would you be willing for me to visit your camp?
---
Partially, it is.  I put a lot of work into my base and it would be nice to know that others like it.  But also, I have no idea how my prices are - are things not being bought because nobody is visiting?  Because I don't have good items?  Pricing?
---
and a guest log book at your camp doesn't offer the same level for abuse?
---
That it is. Don't worry, it pops up from time to time
---
Don‚Äôt waste time (or screws) on weapons before lvl 50. Use what weapons you pick up and turn in all starred weapons for legendary scrip. I wasted soo many screws repairing and maintaining certain weapons that I liked. Looking back I would have trashed them and moved on. 
---
Also, there are a few side quest that give special weapons. The one I can think of off the top of my head is for Perfect Storm. It‚Äôs a 10mm that does additional burn damage. You get it by completing a quest for a nanny bot that‚Äôs looking for a missing kid up at the water park above Grafton. The gun(s) you get for quests like this aren‚Äôt craft able and are locked in to the lvl you are when you complete the quest. So absolutely do not do those type of quests until you reach lvl 50.
---
Forgot to mention the most valuable tip. Invest at least 4 point in luck and get Class Freak and Starched Genes. Then hit up player owned vending machines and look for Serums. These will give you mutations without having to deal with the radiation lottery. The ones you want to snag immediately are 
---
1) marsupial
---
2) speed demon
---
3) healing factor
---
4) carnivore
---
5) scaly skin
---
6) adrenal
---
The starched genes and class freak make sure you don‚Äôt ever lose that mutation and the negative side effects are reduces substantially. Keep those two perk cards equipped at all times!
---
I read those in my head with the insultbot's voice.
---
XBox as well - be happy to. I'm not 100% finished yet (since it was a complete teardown &amp; rebuild), but I should be done later today / early tonight.
---
The thing I‚Äôve found is I can really only do well buying plans because most good weapons and armor is out of my league since I‚Äôm only level 17. Learned that after buying stuff. Sad face. 
---
I also try and buy various grenades and stimpaks. At some point I got a piece of armor that slowly regenerates my health over time. I really love that. 
---
Do you know where to find like good plans?  As in plans for larger generators or purifiers?  In just looking around I find lots of recipes but rarely plans for items to build. Most of those I bought.
---
Thanks!
---
Literally the one reason I didn't get the nukashine brewing bench was b/c my fermenter is right next to my brewing station....at least they match at the moment.
---
I'm always glad to help educate the less fortunate! Definition of nerf: (of a video game developer) reduce the power of (a character, weapon, etc.) in a new installment or update of a video game.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Lvl 25 is the threshold for getting the excavator power armor, go get it.
---
Even if you don't plan on wearing it all the time, it's good to have especially at lower levels.
---
Same here...sad...maybe they will fix it...next year.
---
Keeping a eye out for ot now man! Thanks
---
Guess you missed *Mischief Week* last year. It's a parade through Whitesprings vandalizing and fighting mobs, culminated with a bonfire and legendary spawn.
---
That sucks...hope they fix it
---
I wish turrets didn't suck
---
My vendors are my camp. I'm lazy
---
You start finding camp plans usually around 80+ level.
---
Those red toolboxes, for example, seem to spawn them randomly.
---
I had a tower camp build and they would teleport to the ground floor from the 6th mid conversation. Great for immersion or getting mission details.
---
Won't be a problem for those of us who put our CAMPs out of enemy spawn areas.
---
Thank you
---
Or, they jump in front of teammates' guns as the boss is getting close to death, that way they can grief steal because the game thinks they didn't start the fight? What a condescending little troll you are.
---
Np. Other ones that look good are Scout mask and the Green Hood, scout mask I think works on the combat helmet as well but I may need yo check. The free states helmet also looks good with a gas mask
---
Mischief sucked
---
Edit: it could be better!
---
They did buff the turrets in the PTS - but I don't know how much it will make any difference....Steel walls are your friend.
---
Like I said, they did not reduce the power of a character or weapon. They changed the way damage is being calculated. Nothing about it is a nerf, they did not directly reduce the power of anything
---
Sounds good. Send me a message once complete and we can sort out a time or day when available üëç
---
This could be done üòé
---
*Bookmarked for later might see it in the next build thanks for the idea/design layout üòÅ
---
What does the magazine sound sound like? I got that perk a few weeks ago to try it out and I‚Äôve still never heard the sound
---
It's a 30 percent chance though, not strictly 30 percent. So theoretically you could get super duper 100 times in a row
---
We'll now I'm excited! I've bought the game in near round when RDR2 came out but am recently starting it (I had a bad habit of buying games to not play for along time)
---
same time as always
---
Unless they recently changed how the Purveyor Sales work, you can't get any weapon or roll outside of the World Drop loot table during the sale. The same goes for Mystery Pick.
---
That means no Fixer, Bear Arm, Gold Bullion Plans, etc.
---
This also means that if you're hoping to roll a B/SS/S Power Fist or Deathclaw Gauntlet, it is quite literally impossible unless you're paying full price. You can, however, still get a Mole Miner Gauntlet with those rolls.
---
This is a bug, but for World Drops there are some unarmed and melee weapons that are incapable of rolling a 3\* that isn't 50L/90RW. Some are only limited to that 50L, however. 
---
**TL; DR is You can't get a Fixer or Wastelander's Weapon during sales. Don't Roll Melee during the sale. Roll Ranged.**
---
I have a couple pc only.
---
Probably 12 eastern.
---
It starts at the daily reset time, just over an hour from now
---
Not if the options are pre-populated/from a set list.
---
I had major problems last night, several servers in a row were very laggy, then id leave or get disconnected.
---
Hell yeah. üòé 
---
My CAMP is on a cliff and below it are enemy super mutants who are too fucking dumb to notice me. lol
---
My camp's in the bog. I like it. Plus, I hoard junk anyway, so as long as I've got the mats, I'll just defend &amp; rebuild. It's a pretty spot.
---
if it has before, yes. if not, then no.
---
It never has previously, it would be awesome if i did but i won't hold my breath
---
It's like a 'boing' noise iirc, I haven't used it in a while tbh. Build perks take over lol
---
I‚Äôm level 294. I still carry an excavator with calibrated legs. Stupid really as my carry weight is 460 now and 450 with the PA lol. Really need to give it away
---
I would wait for the update to make a build.
---
I have an idea or two üòÅ 
---
*Copy Pasta Style üòâ
---
I‚Äôm sure I saw someone earlier say that they aren‚Äôt included
---
ThxüëΩüíö
---
*Communist Fence Intensified*
---
Bummer, thank you though
---
Whitesprings. Ghouls are pretty easy to kill and don‚Äôt shoot back. There‚Äôs a ton of them
---
Most likely not - which stinks.
---
Hopefully I can find a workaround üòâ
---
Correct, it‚Äôs why I‚Äôd like it mate, give the wasteland a great feeling when you get a note that calls you a foodbuild whilst fighting a lvl 400 pvp build lol
---
Yeap, im aware this happens. But its simple don't shoot as this could be the result, or vats the shot. Upto you to make that decision. And it doesn't make you agro anymore if they kill a team mate.
---
In general, menus need to be completely redone and keys need to be made bindable.
---
I saw a video by "SH Games" on Youtube and he showed that they aren't that effective
---
Clear West-Tek and Huntersville
---
Clear the Whitespring of ghouls
---
Events with waves of enemies, like Guided Meditation, Line in the Sand, Radiation Rumble, One Violent Night.
---
Horde events and Enclave events also tend to have nice groups of enemies to farm XP off of.
---
Always be on a Building team, get your INT as high as you can through mutation/perk combinations (like Inspirational + Strange in Numbers + Herd Mentality + Egghead), and look into food-based INT-boosters like cranberry relish.
---
I don't have time to explain how numbers work to you, but to keep it simple for you: regardless of how it's done, reduction of damage output is a nerf (direct or indirect).
---
I though that the sale wasn‚Äôt until next week?
---
Yes, I think you describe the situation well. But it doesnt change that micro often support cheap games. Polished games these days...I dont agree. They might be on the surface. But gameplay is often poor. And if they dont earn fast enough they just abandon games. How is beta stage for 1-2 years a proper game. I dont find the quantity and cheapness of most modern games either interesting or healthy
---
I‚Äôm still curious about the specific instance that Bethesda went against lore. The bos was a group of military personnel and their families. They contacted and met with other groups of surviving military families. It only makes sense they contacted as many military units they could across the country. The fev virus was being experimented with before the war and what fallout 1 said about human trials that basically in almost every instance the same mutations were found (they created super mutants) who shared the same look and behavior. As far as the two examples that anyone has put forth of discrepancy, I don‚Äôt really see any loose strings or far reaching on Bethesda‚Äôs part. It‚Äôs actually quite seamless from my perspective. Again not being argumentative just sharing perspective because I know very few people now a days actually played the original fallouts let alone hyped it as much as I did. I‚Äôm not the end all perspective though and am so open to discussion .
---
Thats like the opposite of my experience. Used to enjoy every second of it and now I'm trying my best not to hate it.
---
Magic shotguns are the way to go right now for shotgunners
---
I put a lot of work into my base. However. I do so for me, because I enjoy it, and what others think, isn't really important. 
---
Figuring out prices is pretty easy. First, consider there's a cap limit. If I'm playing a lot, like most days in a week, I generally find once or twice a week, I'm near the cap limit. If it's Monday I buy gold. There's 6k. I'll go and buy a high priced plan from a vendor bot. 
---
If it's the end of the week, I'll go buy a mutation serum. 
---
If things are sitting in my vending, I lower the price. (There should be a change price option rather than just cancel sale, but I can work with that). 
---
I generally price things based on rarity and or importance. Cosmetic camp plans that are always available, 5-20 caps. Seasonal plans, depends. Use the same logic for everything else. In fact, I don't worry about trying to price things to make caps. 
---
Because if you offer anything of value, it will sell. I sell junk. Lots and lots of junk, chems, even food/drink that doesn't spoil. 
---
I don't need to know if someone thinks my prices are too high. Because someone else will probably think it's a great price. I'm not looking to make a sale off everyone on the server. Some people clearly think my prices are too low, and go on a shopping spree. Unless they are buying for all their alts, can't see anyone needing 5 Chally the Moo Moo backpack plans unless they think they can sell them for more. Go for it. I got the money i wanted for them. 
---
Caps will never ever run out. Same for gold. Or scrip. Nothing in this game ever ever runs out, unless they remove it from the game forever. 
---
I don't play this game for feedback from strangers. Even when they want to praise me for having a cool camp, or great prices or whatever.
---
Since you are on PC, there is also the text chat mod available on nexus mods.
---
Basically adds the ability to text chat with others who have the mod installed.
---
I drop one of my million notes for them to read. "I'm watching you" is worth server hopping for
---
The route I use is the Charleston Capitol Building, then the Whitesprings golf club and cabins, then off to Huntersville, then West Tec, then National Isolated Radio Array, lastly the Burroughs at Harpers Ferry. Since youre still at 82 that should result in a full level each run. Better if you use all of the XP boosting abilities and are on a building team. You'll also have a handful of legendary drops.
---
Yea, I am concerned about this also since I like to build elaborate camps. My strategy for this is the following:
---
When the next patch drops, I will test it out to see how bad it is. If it turns out to be horrible, I will start playing a new character with a minimal CAMP and lots of turrets until Bethesda address this issue. I figure that it will probably work out best anyways because of the 'level up daily' challenge. So using the lower level character will help with that.
---
Good to have you back !! My advise is dont listen to all the damn griefers on here
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! HE'S BACK!!
---
Go full bloodied on the head
---
I'm not sure what you mean. Doesn't that defeat the idea of letting strangers leave you messages?
---
It's what we get though.
---
Welcome back mate! You can start to enjoy it again!
---
The Thing is Im currently replaying the METRO Games on Switch and came up with rebuilding the Spartans, making a good METRO ish feeling with AK - tunnel camps and of course some dope looking gas masks but all the in game gas masks feel sometimes too cartoonish.
---
Resprirator looks nice I refuse to pay 5 bucks for it.
---
It‚Äôs another one of those ‚Äòit just works‚Äô kind of brokenness.
---
You can pick up a million of them. You can only use one.
---
Just a heads up: getting Legendary Charisma is not advisable if you want to share higher level perk cards. In the PTS, and I assume this will not change, a boosted Charisma with Legendary Charisma **does not** allow you to share higher level perks. I have tested this multiple times, and it has been discussed multiple times on the PTS. 
---
I believe the reason it doesn't work is related to how they fixed that exploit early on where boosting your charisma with chems/Unyielding/etc would allow you to share higher level cards without actually having a higher base Charisma.
---
Example: I have a base Charisma of 4. I add a maxed Legendary Charisma on top of that, so I will have 9 Charisma to use for Perk Cards. I attempt to share Rank 3 Action Boy; doesn't work. Game says I need at least 3x Charisma per rank of a card to share it. 
---
You would be better off moving points into your Charisma directly, so your base Charisma is the level you want it to be at, and then using a different Legendary SPECIAL to even it out on the stat you just took 5 points out of.
---
Welcome back, and enjoy!
---
Which would lead to a lot of people getting in trouble for using the system for griefing and abusing people. Which, considering their current update to ToS, they are sick of people being assholes to others in this game.
---
&gt; Always get a secret service jetpack chest for any build, but I recommend grabbing some thorn armor for a sneak commando.
---
Don't you need to use the full set to get the bonus?
---
Except for those spawns that accompany visitors that FT to your camp, right?
---
Lucky
---
6 digits!
---
I still use mine at lvl 140 but mainly for big events like the Queen or Earle, otherwise I need the AP bonuses of my full set of ultralight armor for everyday questing. It also comes in handy when leaving Rumble or Fever cause I loot EVERYTHING before leaving.
---
Now, if it counted the overkill from everything you did damage to with something like a mininuke...that might make them pretty scary again.
---
Drop a mininuke into a horde of squirrels or radstags or something minor to build up a ton of overkill damage then hit something big. 
---
Might make explosives more useful.
---
Well from your definition you‚Äôre contradicting yourself now. You said reduction of a character or weapon. Nothing about changing damage calculations if changing a specific character or weapon, it‚Äôs changing literally wverything
---
I would pay 3000 atoms to have him at my camp. I want him so bad. Of course, I would hate to separate him and Bricky
---
There is no real ability to consistently affect your spawn point. This rumor really needs to die.
---
Any story or experience you have that it‚Äôs ‚ÄúcOmPlEtElY tRuE‚Äù across all your characters is equally refuted by players that see zero results, despite all methods used. Downvote away.
---
Drops (your the asshole) notes or (you‚Äôve been insulted)
---
Now you can grind rep, get insulted by Mumbles, and rip Earle's balls off (if you can launch a nuke üòê).
---
Him and Bricky have taken their friendship to the next level
---
Lol. Bought the game from Circuit City.
---
How does it float?
---
There were promotional pics of the T-65 armor in a matte black finish....would be awesome if they ever released it.
---
My man, it‚Äôs 10/31 *twenty-four seven* over here.

Negative.   I made a bes account using my email.  So my ingame player name was my email name.  
---
I went onto bestheda site and it gives the option to change ur ingame name which I did.
---
I thought it was based on where the C.A.M.P was located?
---
What Bethesda puts in the game, and what people put in the game, are two different things. 
---
And I used You're an Asshole as a mild example. What you would get would be far worse if players could type out their own notes. And if Bethesda put in a word filter, that wouldn't let you type out certain words, that would be an issue.
---
Well, the original idea was to have a set list to pick a message from - I'm not really interested in something that lets people leave me hate mail because they think I should have done X when I've done Y.  And I would be much more likely to leave a comment for someone if I could pick it from a list of choices then if I had to try and type it out using the controller.  That's why I think a list of 5 - 10 options (with maybe a few seasonal ones added when appropriate) would be a good solution.
---
The extra armor mods probably add a little weight so there is a tradeoff, but they will definitely still protect you better. I agree with DerGudy's post about non-PA though - the DR per perk point of the defensive perks, and apparently Vanguards and Bolstering as well, is too low for those to really be worth it. The defensive perks that list a damage reduction percentage, like Blocker, or chance not to be hit, like Serendipity, are much more effective per perk point and stack more advantageously. As for bloodied, you are always on the edge of dying so you need all the resistance you can easily get for the inevitable moment when you let something hit you.
---
Why don't you ask for pristine version of *every* craft station? Beth can add this. I wont be using any of them, but i admit that some people want to have particular things and have right to demand it.
---
I've had my vendors and displays empty themselves and I've never been in a silo.
---
I hate them, it's so garbage. At least in FO4 when a rad scorpion magically dirt teleports right next to you you could vats to slow time. 
---
That whole burrowing thing was a neat idea very badly implemented. I've had molerats burrow through the wooden bridge over the highway near the river gorge bridge. That doesn't make any sense! 
---
Also they need a climbing out of the ground animation instead of just instantly attacking. Idk man, I just hate them.
---
I always offer food and water to anyone who stops by.
---
It was just a weird situation - never had a silo half-load like that, then followed by seeing my vendors empty....don't believe they were totally related, but man, it sucked!
---
Just wait until he sees those colossal wendigo sacs.
---
Yeah, was just kidding.. I understand that others notes would have a chance to be very vulgar compared to the already used notes in game
---
You only need to use the code once a week also if you nuke from say Charlie then when the wait time runs.out you can nuke from there again you just need a nuke card.
---
I swear I sold like 25 frag grenades at a vendor bot yesterday. Why not sell them, unless you're at max caps?
---
‚ÄúFormal Complaint‚Äù from the Mire church with organ music playing at night.
---
You don't believe that 1-2 years beta phase makes sense for a game they intend to last 8-10 years? In the devs own words, there are inumerable differences and combinations of interactions that can occur and to test every variable before release would be nearly impossible and certainly not at a sustainable level. When it is released to the public they are able to get end user reports, the more clearly defined and reproducible the easier to fix. The abstract something happened that made something else happen to me but I have no details or video or coexisting variables list - those types of problems take forever to fix. There's also some issues that survived in the code since fo4 that they've been patching as well. 
---
The alternative would be games like they used to release that would be abandoned within weeks after release and simply just expecting you to keep buying the newer version next year.  I don't know how anyone can think that's a better model for development than 100% optional self funding ongoing development. 
---
You could have bought game at release and never put another penny into it now almost 2 years later and still be getting access to new free items and content. Along the way if you want quality of life easements you can pay a small fee or for cosmetics or minor function utility items for additional cost you can buy with in game earned currency or again optional personal funds. 
---
Especially since the game is essentially free to play now and Bethesda has proven with ESO and now with 76 that despite major initial issues they aren't going to just abandon the title and if anything double down on development to improve and expand.... I know which option I would choose between the two every single time. If you prefer $60 vaporware, you're welcome to it.
---
Yes, this is why I was thinking a pre-populated list could be a solution.  They don't all have to be OMG U R SO AMAZE!  but it could be cool - even if it was just an "I was here" kind of thing.
---
That would be cool.
---
No doubt - it's a pain having to reload everything. After it happened to me, I made a blueprint of my displays after I refilled them so next time it won't be such a hassle.
---
oh thats low. I thought someone would beg for stims or wood or steel or something.
---
I remember when I had my camp there. The super mutants would stay by the bridge and shoot my base. Sadly I moved it because I didn‚Äôt want to clear the enemies every time I went there.
---
Urban legend. On my main I spent around three or four hours(yes, I have no life) moving my C.A.M.P. around with no repeatable results. I ended up leaving it where FT would spawn in behind it, in the water(that C.A.M.P. is located under the bridge thing on the east side of the map). They really should add in welcome mats(ft point) again, but the only problem is preventing people from using them as targets for trap C.A.M.P.s.
---
I got so frustrated I just tore my entire camp down &amp; started from scratch. I was going to do so anyway...this just gave me that push over the edge to start over.
---
This.
---
I'd also add Harpers Ferry and The Burrows.
---
Think that‚Äôs what it is he just never drops the flamer or ammo. Still does a job on a character PA or not.
---
I don't get this. Just play something else? Every game has a lifespan. If you are done with the story and exploring the world just find a new game to play. This doesn't have to be a forever game.
---
If that doesn‚Äôt scream 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt know what does lol
---
I have the black Easter egg on Xbox
---
I definitely see your points, but it sounds like we have different game experiences.  My base is in a rather remote location and I only play about 90 minutes a day, so it wouldn't be weird if nobody visited my base.  I've had 50 cal rounds in my machines for 1 cap and they sit for days because nobody visits (and that's fine - I chose my location for the view, not the foot traffic).  I personally like external feedback--but not everybody does, and that's also fine.  It wouldn't be something you have to have at your camp.  Unlike the theremin, which everybody should have ;-)
---
That's hilarious because I did the same thing  üòÇüòÇ nothing like an evening spent rage-building
---
Some of them you can't sell :-(
---
I have gotten 2 or 3 rugs but so far no helmet.
---
Add me on xbox my gt is in one of the photos bottom corner
---
Only wear the jetpack while exploring, change to full thorn for battle!
---
the jetpack only weighs 1 if you put it on a weightless armor.
---
Yup, thats usually the reason (ipresentIntervall=0, either by editing yourself or with mods). Setting the max fps with the nvidia or amd tool to a little bit below the actual monitor frequency fixed this problem for me too.
---
Well, mainly because other stations don‚Äôt look as bad as chem one (except for armor station, but that just was fixed) ü§î
---
I feel bad for my buddy. He got to hear me rage build for two hours while he was questing.
---
I believe you meet them at another location, if I'm not mistaken. Check your map for the icon.
---
yeah, good point. one of my teammates brought a scorchbeast to my camp the other day. I wasn't happy.
---
Just did
---
The funny part is that the problem isn't even the additive formula itself: it's what that formula itself is basing damage calculations on. With multiplicative, there was never any reason to figure out what that initial damage number was because of how high things kept going, even without Bloodied.
---
I did some digging on the PTS, because specific weapons seemed to be almost entirely unaffected, or so minimally affected by the additive formula that it didn't make any sense. Why would a Railway Rifle do **more** relative damage on the PTS than it does on live? Why does a Gauss Rifle have like a 20% damage debuff, but both the semi and automatic handmade have \~80% damage debuff? Why the hell does my J2590 UGL do almost exactly the same damage?
---
The answer lies, ultimately, in the game's weapon modification system. The Gauss Rifle, the Railway, and most Heavies all have one thing in common: they don't have a mod that increases their base damage by extremely high amounts. Sure, you can add a Prime Receiver to a UGL, but it's not a massive boost over the base damage in comparison to a standard receiver and a powerful automatic receiver on the Handmade. 
---
All weapon damage calculations are based off of the original, fresh off the crafting bench, no perks, no mutations, absolute lowest damage number. 
---
For the Gauss Rifle, that is 201. 20% of that is roughly 40 damage, etc. That all adds up. Fully spec'd, Prime Receiver (as that is literally the only mod for the weapon that can increase its damage), with 3/3/3 Rifleman, full Demo (it gives decent boost to Gauss Weapons) and Bloody Mess ends with around 442, iirc. Kills things dead quite well. On live, that maxes out at 599.
---
The base damage for a Handmade, again fresh off the crafting table is...45. 20% of 45 is 9 points of damage. That's why this is happening the way it is. The additive formula **does not account for weapon mods**. I've brought this up in the PTS forums with a more detailed breakdown, but that's what they'd need to do make perk cards matter on weapons with an extremely low base damage. 
---
Wouldn't even need to rebalance base damage for weapons (I mean, they should, but that's a different conversation). If the formula accounts for weapon mods, everything will be A-OK. 
---
...expect that change in Patch 22.5, or Patch 23.
---
Go to Freddy Fears and go to the basement.
---
Mine is going through every wall
---
Ah. Figured if you could sell frags, which seem to be the most common, you'd be able to sell others. My bad.
---
You got any update? It's getting really boring.
---
If you want to ditch power armour I'd move points to bring strength up to 15 and run Blocker at 3*. 
---
Are you having any issues with Enforcer not crippling recently? I tried it at 3* on my main with a low level pump action without success (wanted to try soloing Radiation Rumble)
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can sell you one
---
The shed with the elevator is the main entrance to 79 once you completed the quest. Go to Freddys house of horrors for now...
---
Oooo. I love your ideas. I kinda do half stairs by using the ramp to offset foundations half a wall higher and using the wooden stairs. 
---
The slide and the pole sound cool though! Haha
---
I looked...OMG I looked, the horror, the horror...only fire will cleanse!
---
Yea if it could boost Fast Travel chance from 0.2 to 0.5 that would be an ‚Äòinstant‚Äô game changer.
---
The game does not play nice in a window or if run in borderless fullscreen. I don't think that anyone's ever figured out a fix for this.
---
Oh Biv? He's still waiting on me to get all the stupid fluxes for his moonshine that I can't reject the quest for.
---
Could 100% just be me not doing something correctly, but there are 3 or 4 types that I can't seem to sell to anyone.
---
What? Best event ever... love blowing up cars
---
I do that no matter where I am. I would crash the server single-handedly if your dropped items spawned into the world as items.
---
Fair. Thanks
---
You did great :o that looks amazing!
---
Brought a SB? That's a helluva house warming gift....I usually just bring a bottle of wine!
---
Petition to have Jumbo Mr. Fuzzy's spawn as items and not go into your loot bag.
---
Hey there! It's now looking like this will most likely be fixed tomorrow instead of today.
---
I run borderless since a long time without fps issues, had to adjust something tho:
---
Try  this: go to documents/my games/Fallout 76 and open the file  Fallout76Prefs.ini with notepad  (maybe make a backup first). Look for  the line with 'iPresentInterval=1'  and change it to  'iPresentInterval=0', this unlocks fps.
---
IF  you experience movement problems indoors (usually in PA), limit the max  framerate for FO76 via nvidia control panel/AMD tool to a little bit  under your actual monitor frequency.
---
As  a side note - sometimes this setting is reset by a big update/patch. It is not recommended to set the file read only, may cause  other problems.
---
Is it just me or does anyone else blow up every car they see
---
No. I‚Äôm not telling you what to do. 
---
I‚Äôm putting the issue in perspective, and then supporting whatever decision you choose to make.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how you came to *your* conclusion.
---
I wouldn't call it much of a build currently. Right now I'm running commando with 10 perception so i just keep the .44 on me to pop low level mobs.
---
But here's what I'm running with currently. I'll switch out evasive and sneak related perks in favor of gunslinger cards when I feel like being a cowboy. Lol gotta keep the gun, though. Really drives home that quick draw feeling. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/Tg37HP2
---
yes and make combat helemets a little more common not much just a little
---
Seconded.
---
Yep they were there. My marker was telling me Vault 79 but as soon as I went into that basement it switched to there. Very strange.
---
Yeah its a cool idea! They NEED to implement a feature that says lvl of the player when hovering over their camp on the map. They also NEED to make it so that you can choose where you want people to spawn when teleporting to your camp
---
I would love this! I love telling people how much I love their bases! I had someone shit on mine once and it kinda bothered me, so I prefer to spread positivity when I can
---
lmao only knows one word.
---
"eVeR hEaRd oF dUnNiNg-KrUgEr EfFeCt? I aM sO SmArTTTTT"
---
You are like that chess kid that's fucking bad at chess acting like he is that heavenly out of the worlds sage.
---
Save it.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt have an icon until I actually went into the basement, altho I ALSO had a local icon (not on the map) for past the keypad door in the cave so idk what happened.
---
Sweet! Thank you for your reply.
---
Yep got it, thanks.
---
I can't wait to add all those new 3\* shovels and pipe wrenches to my collection. 1 character, 21 shovels so far...just got to be too many to keep them on my wall of shame.
---
But depending on the platform you can already send messages
---
I thought that was an issue with nuclear silo access overall, not the nuke codes themselves. 
---
Either way, twice in about two years isn‚Äôt catastrophic. Let‚Äôs see how long the fix takes.
---
Take a deep breath, let it out. :-)
---
Once you hit 50, you can start using your level ups to move around SPECIAL points.  Every levelling decision you have made so far is reversible.
---
We have lasers and plasma, surely we could find a way that's slightly less.. medieval.
---
Also, the power armor workbench.
---
That may be a problem with game pass version of the game. I'll see what I can do
---
ü§î its a joke lol have some humanity in you enclave
---
Best part is they bailed on the battle before it was over.
---
I heard of One Wasteland, yes.
---
Someone never heard of "paragraphs"
---
Also, give us the ability to turn off teammate waypoints.  I like the public team feature, but it really clutters up the compass.
---
My favorite game when I'm bored is the drink Nukashine and then try to find my way back to C.A.M.P. on foot without the map.
---
With only a brain and no liver you can only get more and more drunk.
---
I would pay 2,500 atoms for a decent bundle that included outfits, camp items and PA armor.
---
Thank you for letting me know it was a joke. My apologies. 
---
I‚Äôm accustomed to having some humor in jokes. Perhaps this is a cultural difference.
---
It's pretty difficult to use shotguns in a way that accomplishes more than the bare minimum against bosses.  They were brutally nerfed early on in the game's life and never recovered.  The only way they are halfway viable now is through a VATS glitch that causes them to have long range and/or apply the full damage on each pellet.
---
The role you can fill, though, is the crippler.  Enforcer is a great perk for crippling limbs, which can either slow or prevent enemies from moving.  It also causes the Scorchbeasts to land, and when crippling is re-enabled on the Queen next patch, that will be a vital role once again.
---
The problem with this "magic damage" bug is that it gives you a false impression of viability.  If and when it's fixed, you'll probably find your whole arsenal to be lacking.
---
Ahhh gotchya..thats how i got so many...found one somewhere as a lower lvl player...did the quest not haveing any idea about the brotherhood or any of the main quest line...needless to say I went to a player vendor who was selling 200 of them...I bought them at 3 caps each(at the time it was all the caps I had) thinking I could turn them all in......lol  They just sit there as a personal joke to myself of dont be so gullible. Then when I saw the game news months ago that the BOS was coming back I thought maybe.....just maybe these may be worth something again...
---
Just get any shotgun with 33%vats ,50%limb, 
---
Because when using those in vats it becomes a magic weapon. Way OP.
---
Greetings Fellow Shoveler.
---
That nice!
---
lol alls good üòé has there been any word of a update üòÖ ill skim thrue twitter but nothing
---
Yep.  Two-shot is not entirely unusable, but it's not what it used to be for sure.
---
It only does junk or Christmas presents.  I think it depends on what other ones you have.
---
Great job. How about locking the silos so people don't keep losing keycards? Not everyone is reading Reddit or the Beth forums and some people are a bit on edge on area chat.
---
Feds are supposed to be trustworthy.
---
For my vendors to sell (all at super fun low price) - Costumes are being gathered. Treats are being accumulated. And tricks to be collected for all the mischief makers. I have been doing vendor room  themes leading up to this day. This week Asylum with me dressed as a nurse with plague mask on
---
Dan Cortez is the CAMP ally. The traveling vendor is a vampire named Sidney Applebaum.
---
I spawned into someone's locked base once, so I messaged them in case they wanna fix it. Told me to fast travel away and walk over but there was nothing nearby.
---
I've also spawned at cliff edges and fallen to my death enough times to wear pa pretty much all the time. The bases are cool, but I don't know how anyone gets to 'em.
---
 Is there a way to know where the spawn point is when we build our bases?
---
Ok the 50% starts today but at what time. Is there a schedule for the reset of vendors and end of day? Almost 18:00 (6PM) here and the prices still the same.
---
The glass diner door can be like ‚Äúhopped through‚Äù by jumping and crouching repeatedly at the center bar. Havent tested it on others yet. Figured it out while getting frustrated trying to photomode
---
Given the sheer amount of Mothman content in the game, it's safe to assume Bethesda understands the significance of the lore.
---
A Jewish Vampire.  Nice.
---
I'm always at camp either way... just waiting for nukes that is. It really sucks cause no one is doing events and events are unfun solo just for 2 treasury notes. I'm kind of casual, so I don't have infinite treasury notes. Getting 8 a run from ACP and whatever amount SE gives you adds up, especially if someone nukes 3 times, then I feel less inclined to do events the next day and just go exploring instead.
---
Nice try, dad.
---
That assaultron effect I've encountered before - it usually happens when they first activate the laser...it stays charged for them for an extended period so they can fire it over and over with no charge. I find that if you can keep by cover and keep them firing it now and then after about a minute they go back to normal and have to charge it again so you can deal with them a little easier. 
---
First time I encountered the problem was right after one came out of it's spawn at the end of a hallway...with no cover. That was not a good fight.
---
Welcome back brother!
---
I never get bored, always something to do.  Welcome back!
---
Once you start the forbidden knowledge repeatable quest, when you turn any technical documents in, it removes all of them.
---
How/why do you have 203? I'm not trying to be snarky, did you never turn them in?
---
I can almost hear the console boys yelling and screaming in the background.
---
"ur pc ur dun matter"
---
"no use ta us"
---
"sony roxx, pc suxx"
---
No idea where a game pass version stores the ini files, but a quick search for Fallout76Prefs.ini with windows or explorer search should give you the location. It still is a Bethesda game despite the launcher, so I bet it's somewhere on your hard drive :-)
---
I never bother to cook food due to spoilage.  It would be nice if one could keep their cooked food until its needed. So, I eat dog food all day, with the good doggy perk.
---
Beth. Give us a 3 point perk that stops food spoilage by 90%.
---
Floater nades cant be sold. Pumpkin nades cant be sold either. Baseball grenades as well IIRC.
---
The same goes for my Nuka bottle lamp which still doesn't work. It amazes me Beth can nerf the damage - rebalance an entire game but can't fix my lamps lol... I bet if this sub cried as they have for the damage nerf about the lamps it would get fixed :)
---
When hasn‚Äôt this game felt like a preBeta?
---
For a few great games, continued development is great and needs support. For many cheap games there is a close resemblance to casino-games
---
JrArevalo956 I would love to buy one.pm your gt.plz
---
nope, there too focused on the next season and legendary perks and updates, that honestly would be cool though. I have seen someone with a mothman statue at there camp once from the atomic shop though, and its pretty cool im not gonna lie.
---
I agree with pretty much all of this for non-PA. It's especially interesting about Vanguards/Bolstering vs. mob reduction sets, I'll be on the hunt for some new armor on one of my characters.
---
I think I understand now how a single instance of damage reduction gets applied, it reduces the incoming damage before it gets fed to the DR-&gt;Damage Coefficient equation, but am still not clear on how those reductions stack beyond that. Do you add together the damage reduction percentages, or multiply the damage coefficients? Do multiple pieces of Cavalier's/Sentinels offer the chance for more damage reduction, or just better odds of getting the 15%?
---
I added an Additional Damage Reduction field to the top of the non-PA page of the spreadsheet. It's set to 0 but if you make a copy of the spreadsheet you can adjust it to see how individual damage reduction perks or effects perform. I'll add in support for multiple perks/effects once I know how they stack. My guess is multiplicatively, since additively would be super overpowered and require a hard cap like Skyrim.
---
I got a 3* bloodied flamer from earl earlier. Pretty happy about it.
---
Alternatively, repurpose Deathclaws with a new skin.  Turklaws.  GOBBLE GOBBLE.
---
Yes, all silo codes are now set to 12345678. Try those.
---
Sry for ignorant question, but but will spec ops entail?
---
It truly is a grand tradition is it not? I enjoyed keeping a couple for dealing with lower level enemies just for that wonderful sound...sadly with the changes of one wasteland my full health unarmed build might fall behind the curve too much and there won't be any more low level enemies to shovel against.
---
Halloween is my favorite, even better than xmas.  Hope they do something
---
Plasma is material (some sort of plastic probably) that is superheated and then launched from the gun. The plasma itself wouldn't really be useful but maybe you could modify the heating mechanism in some sort of kiln to soften the metal. You're still have to shape it somehow. 
---
Seems like a lot of work. Ocham's Razor says just use the wood fire.
---
I did see my ally teleport, but they'd never teleport through locked closed doors, could be a trailer problem.
---
I'd like to have a "owned bed" feature more, I don't want strangers just come in and sleep on my bed.
---
Os4?
---
Don't neglect your misc. tab. Many items there can weigh you down quickly, and many folks don't think to check it (gunpowder, ore, tokens, etc.) Also, make sure to turn your spoiled food into fertilizer since that weighs less as well. Periodically check your scrapbox for junk items that missed getting broken down. It's easy to store all junk and miss an item or two getting stored as-is, which increases its weight. Also, learn pocketed and deep pocketed plans for your armor as soon as you can. Check player vendors. They USUALLY sell them for much cheaper than bot vendors. Pocketed &amp; deep pocketed are lifesavers for hoarders like me.
---
That's correct. And for others not seeing this option, after you get the first screen in the terminal, you have to hit enter, or space, or another button to go to the next screen where you can pick the list to collect.
---
This is like going to Walmart Halloween‚Äôs not even here yet and they got the thanksgiving decorations out . But yes op I‚Äôd like a fat mutated turkey to kill and eat with some cranberry relish on the side as well ! Definitely need more verities as the game evolves.
---
Welcome back! There's big changes coming, some good, some controversial, but I think the game is going to feel a lot more fresh this fall
---
I would actually collect all junk, figured what materials I needed, and sell the junk I didn't need to make caps. There a bunch of raw materials you can't sell that you may not need a whole lot of
---
He blew it...door's over there right?
---
"Ugh," would be my response.
---
There's been enough hints from the datamining that this BoS isn't to be trusted, and yet, because they are also inextricably linked to the new Daily Ops content, it feels like we're going to have a situation where we have a morally dubious faction we're just *expected* to support, and I don't like that.  Unless it turns out that there's a schism within this BoS and we end up choosing to throw our support between one side or another.
---
There's also just the general issue with the BoS itself... it may not have made sense to bring back one of the dead Appalachia factions, but I'd be a lot more interested in something like the Free States than rehashing the BoS again.  I just don't know what more we can really add to the BoS story at this point.  Their inclusion in 76 felt obligatory, and this is no different.
---
Inappropriate solution to the problem, akin to banning cars to stop drunk drivers.
---
The power armor bench is really just a large engine lift used to pull the heavy parts off the frame. It really doesn't have any kind of forge capabilities (game mechanics not withstanding of course)
---
" I thought a suppressed 10 mm would fit, but 10 mm's are crap," not facts. instigating full auto 10mm's wreck....and that's without any guerilla perkcards.

What you really mean is a (Craft all)

When I heard Bethesda was releasing a new Fallout game I was so happy.  Fallout is one of my favorite franchises ever.  When I found out it would be a multiplayer game I was still happy.  My cousin and I had always talked about how much fun it would be to roam the wasteland together and build joint settlements.  Then the game dropped and the reviews were basically that the game was an unplayable dumpster fire.  Videos of bugged out game play turned me off from this game and I decided it was gonna be a no from me.  Then it hit Gamepass and I thought "why not give it a try."  I had heard that Wastelanders improved the game vastly.  Now I cant stop playing it.  Its only been a few months but I am still enjoying my time with this game.  So glad I finally gave it a chance.
---
Thanks will try sugestions there :)
---
This community has been asking for this since launch I‚Äôm starting to think it can‚Äôt be done on there end . I‚Äôd love a bright headlamp for this as well !
---
I couldn't find this in ATOM shop. What am I missing? Looked under fallout 1st....
---
The A button on my Xbox controller is only 1/4 as hard to press down as the others and sometimes gets stuck, I blame it on crafting in this game and running in GTA
---
Thanks! Glad you're having fun with it. Really hoping they rework some of the cards add some fire rate options for the revolvers (fan fire, pls) to make gunslinger more viable.
---
Nice choice, that's what I do. Looks good with full scout armor.
---
For real. Gunslinger is way too fun to be as weak as it is. At least at endgame, anyway.
---
The worst, IMHO,  is killing a legendary right as it burrows and then you never find the corpse, walking away knowing that mole rat had the 3 star weapon you have been trying to roll for months (rather than the likely reality being it was a nocturnal pool cue).
---
I ran across someone‚Äôs camp last night that had a sign specifically saying only lower level players 0-30 (something like that) were allowed.  Although there wasn‚Äôt anything really keeping me from exploring the base, I stayed away.  Hopefully they found some players that could benefit.
---
Pull my finger, win a prize!
---
Oh yes I remember those days not fun
---
Truth.

I knew the one was an engine lift, but what the heck is the other one supposed to be?
---
Oh just for travelling when over weight. Not for any kind of defence
---
Well, did your post break rule 6?
---
Just looked and rule 6 is use descriptive titles and not clickbait. You broke rule 6. You can't say your a victim and being targeted when you are breaking the rules and they are enforcing them.... This is what is wrong with society. Smh.
---
A nuke-shine trip is always a fun way to find stuff you might otherwise miss!
---
How cool, didn't know there is a festival. Will look it up, yeah would be a shame if Beth didn't do anything with it.
---
I'll say...
---
Exactly - I've seen some really cool ones and I want to tell them that I think they have a cool base...
---
Oh yeah. Problem is you cany access that folder. That's the drm they use. That folder is inaccessible unless you do some proper illegal stuff I guess. I managed to access the sub folders but never found that file and I'm not willing to go further to risk consequences. They cant fully hide files but access to them Is denied.
---
It‚Äôs a time saver. I don‚Äôt mind and I‚Äôm definitely not complaining. This rep grind is one of the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. 
---
Anything to shave a few minutes off of the same task over and over again is quite fine by me.
---
I mean Tse was still crazy. That was fun haha
---
Welcome back, now open you stash and start sharing some of those legacy energy weapons we all need so bad. Lol.
---
Part of the problem with just locking the silos is that *some* servers are still valid to launch on. 
---
If you server hop enough you should be able to find a server that works, determine by the contents of the word wall in the bunker.
---
I think its maybe a diagnostic unit?
---
That is true lol
---
I'm sure you could, the console might not...
---
Agreed looks a lot like click bait. Probably done by the auto mods
---
I agree completely.  My base is built on the side of a cliff, with the main entrance at the bottom of the cliff. When you fast travel there, it spawns you at the top of the cliff on the otherside of the cliff. Really ruins the flow.
---
That's not my dad. That is a cell phone.
---
I have that statue and the neon signs, it‚Äôs old stuff from the Atom Shop. I would have thought for sure they would have taken advantage of this and created new items in addition to an event. Ah well, maybe next year.
---
It can already happen in game. The various letter sets allows you to write anything you want. And voice chat lets you say anything. I've experienced players who verbally get abusive.
---
Rule 6:
---
&gt;Use descriptive titles when submitting a post. If the average user has to click on your post to understand the context, then it is not descriptive enough. If you're posting a question, put it in the title and give further information inside. Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.
---
Your post title:
---
&gt; I was this close. THis CLosE.
---
I would have had to click on your post to get the context your title was missing. I'unno, feels like a justified removal to me.
---
Where do we find grandpa?
---
Always store gunpowder, or else its gonna weigh you down immensely
---
Earl finally pays off!! I usually get a bit of ol tat!
---
Actually I don't think they pull posts.  I think your post has to be reported and then they review to see if it broke a rule.  If it did they pull it.
---
I could be wrong.  Maybe if they see a post that breaks a rule they do just pull it.  However there are rules for posts on this sub.  They are on the right side of the main screen.
---
That is pretty much rule 6.  That is straight up a click bait title.  Just follow the rules and your posts will not get pulled.
---
I hope that helps.
---
Yeah the most important here isn't that much to start putting your build together right from start. 
---
With all the stupid perks you are forced to pick, because the game doesn't allow you to keep your special point for later (better perk cards), you may eventually fuck up your build a lil. You are just better wait until you hit lvl 50 to start fixing all your build. Right now your best option is to make make sure this transition will be as smooth as possible for you.
---
Just put these perks cards when necessary...
---
All you need on a new character is his main weapon perk cards. So you can easily get these quality of life perk cards on your road to lvl50.
---
For vet players it isn't a problem, because their main characters build are already completed. They can just send some ammo or material to their alts thought private servers containers (as exemple).
---
But the best you can do is making your new character self-sufficient. It will just make the transition toward your completed build way more fun and smooth.
---
‚úå
---
ü§ï
---
Yeah, I don't know why they don't have a welcome mat. Make it only able to be placed outside to prevent trapping people.
---
Same. No change in price
---
They should absolutely bring back the Halloween event that was the best most laggy game freezing/crashing event they‚Äôve ever had. It was hilarious to hear the people scream in area chat as their game crashed as the cars exploded and explosive guns overloaded their OG Xbox Ones lol.
---
Ok, i get what you mean by pre-populated. As in your choice of feedback is already picked.
---
That will just lead to people wanting other things added, and the list would just get out of hand, and then people would complain it doesn't allow them to personalize what they want to say. 
---
See, I've thought, man it would be great to leave notes around the wasteland. You would need to make some paper, which you could do out of cloth. Then a pencil or pen. Leave the note and then pin it up somewhere.
---
But then I just imagined what some people would do with that.
---
Me too.  I haven‚Äôt gotten one from the event yet, just through trades etc.  edit: I never see them sold in vendors either.  I vendor hop constantly.
---
I gave you an upvote because for some stupid reason you've been down voted, do love reddit
---
Content creator is riflegaming‚Äôs job..have you seen how much money can be made?
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/Kdh_MP78-YY)  shows a route of them
---
I threw it on the ground. My dad‚Äôs not a phone.
---
Probably not, asked about it myself a while ago and the general consensus is no.
---
Seriously?
---
Rule 6:  **USE DESCRIPTIVE TITLES AND DO NOT CLICKBAIT**
---
The title of your post: "I was this close. THis CLosE."
---
Troll? Dense? Not sure.
---
yes totally worth risking losing your account so you dont have to rebuild your camp lol
---
next time dont use a vague title like "I was this close", as we then HAVE to click to find out what you were "this close" to.
---
For the generators, you get the plans by doing the power up events for any of the 3 power plants, you would still need help to do those tho since the enemies inside are level 40 ish I think, my suggestion to you would be to go sneak (high agility and perception) and use the sneak attack multiplier to help you out in combat.
---
Shhhhh. Most of us like skipping the rediculous grind.
---
I don't think it stacks at all, but it is still worth pretty much everyone running it if they almost always play in teams.  Great mutation.
---
I agree with you about the mods here being ridiculous. You don‚Äôt really see it cause it‚Äôs all behind the scenes, until they don‚Äôt agree with your views on something. Then there‚Äôs no discussion at all. Just get shut down in really demeaning ways in messages.
---
Yes, on ps4. Very rarely worked, I just scraped it.
---
If you place the camp module down before building then fast travel away and back, that should give you an idea
---
Yeah well you can only drop junk anyway so everything else like ammo weapons etc you will keep and only drop if you want to through your pip boy. Yeah it happens I just stand there and wave, thumbs up or do a little dance :D Last time it happened to me someone nuked whitesprings then I was running round and this person was giving the thumbs down and shooting me (guessing it was there nuke) but I just went on my way. Must of done it to someone else tho as 5 mins later someone nuked his camp.  I've never done PvP around my camp but I guess they would but also they can destroy your camp. Also if your in sneak they wont be able to see you on the map until you stand up and they will only be able to find your camp if you have vendors, on the same team or if they find it by looking like if they see your at a place for a while they could come over or if they get lucky trying to find it.
---
they went to the festival that occured right before the game launched to promote the game, and even gave out posters with the 76 Mothman on them. not sure if bethesda themselves went back after that, but the fallout fanbase have at least.
---
Only used one a little on PTS, but is seemed fixed.
---
Well this was EXACTLY what I needed except I needed unyielding, don‚Äôt you guys know that?
---
(I‚Äôm a bloodied commando build and collect weapons) I enjoy the weapon weight reduction so I can show everyone my inventory and I don‚Äôt have to transfer my legacies over. The AP bonus is also what I need for my vats)
---
Don‚Äôt return it then, go kill some raider thief and all, then come back to meet Ward again. There‚Äôs your easy fix, no need to bother Bethesda for it.
---
Yeah, I think the ONLY way it would work would be with pre-populated choices.  I like the idea of crafting paper/notes--but I think you would still need the set response options.
---
Yes I have. What I am saying is I thought when I found the first one and did the mission...that it was repeatable ....so I was out in the world saw 200 of them at a player base...bought them went to turn them in..not knowing it didnt work that way
---
Brilliant
---
Correct, we do not speak about unintentional features.
---
As far as being a solo player, I like to play solo as well so I understand. However, you can join a team without running with them but you can still get the damage and experience bonuses that are associated with being on a team. Plus you get any shared perks and you can share perks as well. 
---
I didn't realize how beneficial this was until recently. (I'm only lvl 46) Of the teams I joined, I've only interacted with one and that was when my team mates saw me die a couple of times and came to help. No pressure. Dropped in, helped, waved, and left.
---
Then, the team leader dropped a bag of plans and weapons at my camp. It was an overall great experience.
---
I'd say don't overlook being a "team-solo" player.
---
how much do you think i should sell for? I have the rug too, any price suggestions?
---
Boohooo
---
two spots that works for me in addition to all other mentioned here
---
1. Solomonds pond - you head down the road ( south ) and you will encounter behemonth
---
2. Pylon V13 Cranberry bog - clear the pylon + abad. bog town, you can claim workshop there and do the first defend :)
---
Probably will be a F1st skin just like the armor bench has been.
---
yeah, but there's going to be a whole group that hate the pre-populated and a whole group that want different ones. And a whole group that wants to be able to make their own. 
---
Making such a feature a regular crap show of never ending complaints and suggestions.
---
Scared for your life??
---
How?
---
The teleportation is to prevent stuff from getting super glitched out. So i doubt they'd remove it.
---
It's under C.A.M.P. Items, for some reason, IIRC. Not the FO1st section.
---
You build the walls up from the ground than erase the ones that are at the bottom
---
Honestly I shouldn't say it sucked, I just think it could have been more. I just wish events like Mischief and Grahms Cook out were actual EVENTS that took some time they just are done so quick.
---
Also wondering this.
---
You‚Äôre scared for *your life*?  Explain that. 
---
How is having a post removed a threat upon your life?
---
Especially since we can‚Äôt celebrate actual Halloween this year :(
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I mean, as long as it's working as intended I don't see why anybody would complain üòú
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure why your post was taken down. I saw it and laughed because I got a roll just like yours, not noct but ghoul slayer with nice 2 and 3rd rolls, so I knew what you meant.
---
I have cant comment on anything before 76 as 76 is my 1st fallout game. I have watched some lore videos on them and think maybe they are bringing them back based on the player hype...as well as being able to fillin lore holes since 76 is technically the "begining" of the BOS as far as the story line of 76.
---
I think you are posting in the wrong thread. Or are you deliberately trolling?
---
True true
---
I've just been chilling out and actually exploring a lot of locations while looking for glass. But instead of fast traveling I've been walking, running into random encounters and sometimes even passing by other players doing a quest or something. 
---
Except the mire, fuck the mire. The only place in Appalachia more boring than the mire is the close to out of bounds area of the savage divide and even then at least I can SEE. 
---
Other than that little rant, I've sort of written walking everywhere as my character getting drunk and just taking a really long neighborhood stroll... through all of Appalachia.
---
I refer you to all of the internet as example of why people would complain. 
---
What you think the list should be populated with is not the same as everyone else in the world.
---
I was just about to write this. Many have had posts removed for one reason or another, to say you‚Äôre scared for your life or being attacked personally because of it is... something.
---
Thanks, my dude
---
I wish I'd known this before I built my base.  50/50 chance to spawn at Beckett's bar or on the side of a cliff (which does have a safe path up and around to my base, but it takes a minute).
---
If you're running low health I'm not personally a fan of grounded because you take damage as well, but you look pretty solid.  Switch out your chest mod for Emergency Protocols to take even less damage.
---
üëç
---
Really unlikely, i would say definitely not, but Bethesda make questionable decisions at the best of times.
---
You would need to be well in to the thousands before they care, and even at that, it depends on the item. Considering leather pieces can be crafted easily, right off the bat, I don't think they'd care if you had a million, as having loads of leather pieces isn't going to break the economy the same way having lots of rare items would
---
Edit: Read this as a question, not a statement.  My bad lol
---
I'm not part of YA SYSTEM
---
I have an idea for something similar.    
---
Messages are free and like any other Note. The CAMP object would be a mailbox and skins available in the shop for cheap or part of a bundle.    
---
This new system would be much bigger. Like another MMO I know of, you could send caps and items (limited slot space) to ANY character you want as long as you know their username. It is account wide so the character you want to get the 'stuff' would have to pick it up. Given there are Railroad stations in many places they could implement this. A small fee that increases (not much) according to the # of items or weight. It's like a char has it's own P.O. box.    
---
The quest alone to unlock it can be done my any character.
---
Really?  'Cause as far as I can tell all they do is run away from dogs and lose cargo...
---
Baseball and pumpkin nades can definitely be sold to vendors. Floater nades are just trash. 
---
FLOATER GRENADES ARE FUCKING TRASH!
---
Yea, that's what I find myself doing most of the time in ACP. Wander about crippling spawns so they're less of a nuisance. 
---
I agree with you this magic weapon thing, I haven't been looking into that as getting used to glitch damage like that will only make actually viable builds feel lackluster once the glitches are fixed.
---
I'm going to wait for the patch to see what happens before deciding on a build, mine is working well for now so I'll look into optimising once patch goes live.
---
Many thanks
---
Idk man I used it yesterday on radiation rumble and the lag was extremely bad I couldn‚Äôt even loot people
---
You have a YouTube channel?!?! I'll check it out!!! I love yer "builds" :)
---
This is a great idea, honestly. I'm so proud of my current CAMP build and i would love to hear other dweller's impressions of it. Or if they want to know where i found something.
---
Who the hell is so salty about people enjoying this game lmfao downvoting every single comment are you serious? Probably not because you‚Äôre probably 9 years old. News flash buddy, it‚Äôs just a game! And people like it lol get over it.
---
And btw, glad to have you back OP. When you finish everything and get bored with the end game, be smart and play something else instead of bashing everyone and everything that has to do with this game just because YOU‚ÄôRE bored with it. People need to realize there is other good games out there! Just because 76 doesn‚Äôt have endless content like other mmos doesn‚Äôt make it a bad game.
---
LOL.
---
I really enjoyed blowing everything up. That being said we really need some more cool rewards.
---
I had a week away on holiday over the majority of meat week and let me tell you, as a plan collector it's been heaps of fun again vendor hopping with some hope there may be a plan in that camp that I don't know!
---
yes i do, i started it like two weeks ago :D thank you very much man and i hope you enjoy it üëçüèº
---
Try the perk card, batteries included. Bum Bum Ch ü§£
---
Im tired. Please excuse me
---
&gt;bulk all junk
---
Plastic, lead, and aluminum lose a nominal amount of weight when bulking them. Nothing else does, and will only waste plastic if you're bulking it to save space. Only bulk excess junk you want to sell, unless trying to get the little bit back you get from bulking plastic, lead, or aluminum.
---
Pumpkin Head Power Armor Helmet skin anyone? ü•∞
---
Good luck with your channel.  Hope it takes off for you!   üòÉ
---
How? Events would effectively double in size, with clones of allies taking up the majority of space. Unless they make the companion Gary, that might not work.
---
Might want to use smaller images on your next article, spent nearly a full minute loading the page lmao
---
I'll see about the changes when the update goes live, didn't think that it would be coming so soon, thank you!
---
It seems to be working for me but I don't really have terms of comparison as I have just recently started playing :(
---
I hope holloween is lit. I want a really cool event. Like a random scary haunted house poped up and u have to go inside and zombie ghouls por out of everywhere lol
---
I've had successful launches for the entire week but something has reset/changed today.
---
Every silo, tested Alpha, Bravo and Charlie on 3 different servers, tells me that my credentials have expired and I need to input the new code. Which doesn't work. When I enter a code there is no green or red "flash" to signal wether it's been accepted or not. Absolutely nothing happens. Seems as if the game doesn't even recognize the code input anymore.
---
I'm not mad about the lost keycards, those can be farmed again, but the fact that there is nothing in game that informs us about silo issues is a bit disappointing.
---
And while you're here, thanks for all your work. Without you guys nukes wouldn't fly everywhere. :)
---
I saw your post and didn't open it because I didn't know what it was in reference to..
---
Subscribed!
---
Apparently ESO gets pretty laggy if a bunch of people have pets with them, and that game runs a hell of a lot better than fo76.
---
They're limited to camps and scripted interior locations for technical reasons.
---
No pet followers like WOW in this game.
---
I was being sarcastic üò¨
---
I'm a bit confused as to why you think I want to give away all the cosmetics. I simply believe the atomic shop should be limited to that class of item, and others of actual utility should be made freely available. It's the skins for those items that the atomic shop should be focusing on.  Regarding challenge, it would be entirely possible to still earn utility items in game via a quest-line or the like. 
---
As for the fridge, the community recognised it as a slippery slope, and that's why the response was so vehement. Let Bethesda know the fridge is ok to have a 500% buff, and be sold for atoms, and they sure as hell won't stop there. That we have a limited supply of FREE (loved the block capitals btw, they really won me over) atoms to purchase some of that stuff is irrelevant to the end result - which is an unbalanced game unless you pay up.
---
So blaming the community for the fridge being shit is technically correct, but only because Bethesda insisted on selling it no matter what.
---
I am relative new to the game but I wouldn't mind that either. I would like a clean room like a science lab type. Even add some beakers and and burners for the decorative. Go for a science style room or even a evil scientist lab. I think that would be cool.
---
thank you very much! im enjoying it so far and im gonna see how it turns out :)
---
Yeah, Your right lol, my friend got warned for putting half the n word on his house tho
---
Well I may be wrong but I think that's what they are doing... After getting a bit fed up of the radio I created my own Spotify list with added songs from other games and oldies I liked, and after adding some of the fo76 radio songs I noticed how different they sound from the original tunes, so it may seem that Bethesda trying to cover their behind is doing actual covers of songs to avoid licencing issues, but I may be wrong.
---
thats about a 15% increase in subscribers for me lol :D
---
Yes, exactly!  Sometimes I see something cool and I want to tell them that their camp is awesome!
---
I think this is a great idea. FYI, if you want more people to see this you should make the title: BETHESDA, YOU NEED TO GIVE PLAYERS A WAY TO LEAVE MESSAGES AT OTHER PLAYER'S CAMPS! /s
---
Plasma flamer is a mod to plasma pistol/rifle, it melts people
---
We're all in a simulation being run anyway...there has to be the odd glitch in the matrix.
---
The All Rise is garbage. Please drop it and get any bloodied 2h.
---
Instigating is bad on 1h knives because they hit like flies. Without substantial buffing, this falls off hard.
---
Vampires heal is based on number of hits, rather than damage. This makes slow swing weapons the worst users. Try to get a Vampire's Buzzblade.
---
Haha.... asking for a friend...gotcha.... üòâ
---
I‚Äôve only played since Sunday. What is a power up event?  How do I know when they are?
---
I feel ya on that...
---
THEY ARE!
---
Really?
---
Another great shovel tradition is leaving one at the solders grave.
---
I believe the costume plans are. Think there's also a Witch one... Found the mask plans a couple of times but never the costume.
---
Yes.
---
You only need he torso. The arms dont do anything.
---
Been in the game since launch, random spawns.
---
A little bit.
---
Holy shit, that‚Äôs amazing!!!
---
I had a friend sell a helmet for 28k but I‚Äôm sure that is an idiot. Right now the helmet sells fairly well from what i hear at 1,5 K. Only the meat pile is still rare among seasoned players. Start at 1,5 k and evaluate if it doesn‚Äôt sell. All i can say from personal exp is that they fly at 300 caps but i price everything to fly out
---
When sales of FO1st don't increase an acceptable amount or start to slide then they'll release something great to get the numbers up again. That's just speculation on my part but would seem likely.
---
Multiple damage reductions almost certainly stack the same multiplicative way as armor penetration, i.e. incoming damage is reduced by the percentage from one effect, the remaining damage is then reduced by the percentage of the second effect and so on. I admit I haven't tested that, but given how the rest of the game works, I'd be astonished if it didn't work like that.
---
As for multiple  Cavalier's/Sentinel's pieces, the most logical approach would be that the reductions are added, so that two pieces give a 75% chance at a 30% damage reduction. And if I understand the [Legendary Common Armor Perk](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/004F6D79) and the [Sentinel's effect](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/004EE54C) right, that is indeed what happens: Each piece of Sentinels adds 15% to the LGND\_LessDmgStandStill actor value, and the perk, which is a common entry point for all kinds of legendary armor effects, applies that actor value to the incoming damage, provided you roll a D100 value of 75 or less.
---
Are you on ps4? I think I ran across one of your builds a couple weeks ago. Very nice
---
have you found out what time? i thought it was supposed to be right now...
---
I actually found one In a vendor for 500caps.   I snatched that up quickly.  Lol
---
Prices too high. There should be an auto post feature. The 1/100 player with reasonable prices will be secure enough to understand
---
Yeah I have been experiencing the same. All I've done is server hop for 45 minutes looking for something decent to do and then giving up
---
Nice!
---
Very rare to find them, though.
---
I always make sure there's one there when I pass by...if not I'll drop one, or a 1* depending on how many I'm carrying.
---
Ah okay, thanks for updating me!
---
Plans are rare.  Not forest camo jumpsuit rare, but rare.
---
God fuckin damn it.
---
Where? I've been server hopping by the one spot for route 65 and I've never seen the trick or treater. Costume spawns in the game at one of the watchtowers. The halloween one.
---
\^\^\^Same thing I tell my wife, but she doesn't believe me....
---
They never go on sale. Not really suprised.
---
Although i did have a sliver of hope lol.
---
Nukes are fixed guys get nuking
---
The ini files for the Gamepass version might be in
---
Program Files\\ModifiableWindowsApps\\Fallout 76
---
Not sure if you can actually edit them in there but it might work if you copy the ini to the folder OldBaud mentioned above.
---
Unfortunately it was just made last week and I'm on xbox üòÖ
---
Oh I was at the actual fallout folder inside gamepad files
---
What is the black easter egg?
---
Mods did it for free, and they have the same function with mining helmets
---
I've gotten 3 rugs and 2 of the statues of Earle. So I decided to make a shrine for Earle cause why not?
---
I learned a TON of mods by scrapping weapons and armor early on. I ran my INT at a higher level for my first 50 levels for this reason, then dialed it down in favor of LCK perks later on.
---
what a fucking joke....
---
I'm aware of that. Bulking everything is most convenient for me.
---
I can't really help you with inventory space, i mean it's all about your strenght and the Backpack quest ( a quick google research should help you here ).¬† 
---
But i can tell you that if you are a new player, no matter your build, go for these 8 perk cards as soon as possible ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;w=lm2au2at1ik0if2ii0iq2p10 ).
---
They are quality of life improovement and they are extremly necessary to make your endgame experience as smooth (pleasant) as possible. Content in the endgame (+lvl50) require you to be as self-sufficient as possible. Enemies are tougher, hit harder and activities can't put you against real bulletsponges !
---
At this stage of the game, you really need to be ready. You must know how to mass craft ammo and repair your stuff efficiently. Because if once lvl 50 you focus only on polishing your build while you have any of these perk cards, trust me you will cry ! Everything will be too expencive to craft or repair, it will just be a messy grinding endgame experience for you ! 
---
And to finish, install your camp next an Acid deposit so you can place an Acid extractor on it ( once again, a quick google research on "resource deposits locations" should get you on the good path ). You'll need Acid to turn your lead ores into useable lead. Here the perk card "Super duper" will really be helpful...same when you'll be crafting ammo.
---
If you do it right, once lvl 50, polishing your build will be...smooth and easy. You'll have a pretty decent dps, no ammo issue and enough resource to fix your guns &amp; your armors ( as long as you don't stop scavanging and grabbing your loots ).
---
What system are you on? Wife can't do the event due to sensory issues but is willing to buy/ trade for one.
---
Console user here . You guys get all the cool toys !
---
Do you enjoy Fallout 3 and 4? If yes then give it a go.
---
It‚Äôs all randomized. Usually between three and six different spawn points. Sometimes less. Sometimes more. And sometimes new ones will spontaneously appear despite not touching anything for over a year.
---
Rotating the CAMP does nothing consistent, and results in pulling from the same random pool. Moving the CAMP has no effect either.
---
Anyone that swears it does is reading meaning into random selection.
---
Lmfao, sorry but there is no way they can rewrite code in 5 minutes. They probably couldn't even add the idea to their to-do list in 5 minutes, lol.
---
Going across your specials you could have better cards without changing your special points IMO.
---
S is fine
---
P is fine
---
E you could lose dromadery and aqua boy for 2 ranks of fireproof (explosion and fire resist)
---

---
I Nerd rage should be 3 and then I'd use first aid 2
---
A I would use dodgy rank 3, lose thru hiker and probably adrenaline 5 and action boy 2.
---
L change good with salt for ricochet
---
These changes should buff your survivability a lot and also increase your damage
---
For power armor you want emergency protocols chest mod and you want to play at 20% HP. It will reduce incoming damage by half and you will have nerd rage buffing damage AP regen and damage resist.
---
Hah, gotcha. Well, you have competing aliens on ps4.
---
So far you have them beat tho
---
I go by the shopping mall for no other reason than to get the chain reaction of exploding cars in the parking lot.

I also launched a ghoul into orbit using exploding cars at the whitespring...need to figure out how to post the video though.

I didn‚Äôt know this, that‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve wanted to go for a while. Next best thing would be Bethesda doing an event. Haha.
---
What if you could build notes with words and sentence fragments. Like dark souls. ‚ÄúTry tongue but hole‚Äù

You could buy game pass for a month if you are on pc or Xbox and if you don‚Äôt like fo76 you will at least have a lot of other games to play.

A literal easter egg ü•ö fallout give out on easter *last* year (I think) I missed the event item üòî

Using it for an Alien Egg üòÅ

We did it....him not being around is no more

I‚Äôm mean it‚Äôs online game. I thought other players were our companions...

Much appreciated üëΩüíö more to come still have to deco the inside üòÅ

I'm having weight issues with all my AID items mainly. I keep my equipped armor a shot gun a rifle and a pistol or SMG.

Did not know there was builds

Suggested this a few time but, get shot down because dupers will take advantage. I've got 4 mules worth of weapons cause I play a lot is love this.

Hey if ya need any help leveling up or just doing events message me on xbox my gamertag is L0stmytaco
---
I found them at a random encounter spot southeast of R &amp; G processing. Look for a dead NPC in a costume who has the full outfit plan plus a holotape for the pumpkin house.
---
Thanks for the confirmation looks like I‚Äôm rolling the dice on all armor .
---
I assume this is your first fallout game?
---
If so then it is just a case of building you character up by doing simple easy repeated tasks. Try completing simple events around the forest/ash heap/toxic valley up until you are level 50. Focus on getting your build right. Make sure you are collecting suitable legendary gear to complement your build. Its going to take you until level 80+ before you start sailing through the game with ease.
---
Yup
---
I've seen any of the projection lamps actually work about ten times total. Four in my camp, including the planetarium, and they almost never actually project. (The planetarium never has.) I really wish they'd fix them.
---
YES
---
If I ran I pistol build I think I'd want to play around with the fact they have the lowest VATS cost and thus run high AP and the luck perks to max out crit utility.
---

Nothin yet. Sitting here on lunch break refreshing their page every few minutes like a lonely puppy.
---
On the bright side, at least they aren't the nocturnal harpoon guns I usually get; my five characters will be overencumbered for a week. But yes, please increase the cap!
---
I do feel sorry for all y‚Äôall, I couldn‚Äôt imagine spending the last two years perfecting a build and learning all the ins and outs just to have Beth say nope,  no more
---
Yep I went for it and did not pay off. 500 script of nocturnal ss armor :/
---
Im hoping for a nocturnal missile launcher with bash damage.
---
lol  RIP
---
There are three power plants. One south of the forest (starting area) One east of the forest (harder) and one a lot further east (hardest)
---
Just by being close to them you can trigger the Power up event. It's about entering the power plant and repairing it. 
---
If repaired it will give you event rewards, and power up workshops/settlements in the area.
---
I recommend doing it with at least 3 other on your level, or 1 high level player.
---
I find no fault with the mods keeping kids at bay that need to post pics.
---
sale already started
---
Yeah at noon.
---
Got maxed saved going for 1 ranged and the rest armor but I‚Äôll probably get the usual dumpster fire üî•
---
i know
---
Ive noticed you always seem to spawn to the north of where the camp module is placed. I‚Äôve started moving mine to the northern most point of my build zone so people spawn well away from the camp and don‚Äôt end up in the foundation
---
It'd be cool to pick a message, plug it into the Mr Messenger Handy, then have it delivered to them.
---
Insult Bot and Prize Bot never have a problem finding people, anyway.
---
Whoa. That's unreal!
---
thanx I will give it a watch tonight
---
Try it on game pass if you‚Äôre on Xbox or pc, as someone who didn‚Äôt enjoy fallout 4, I really like fo76
---
Bloodied bone hammer with increased swing speed
---
Being able to hire the insult bot to send to players would be pretty fun and a decent cap sink.
---
yeah man you n me both
---
That‚Äôs not at all what he was suggesting
---
Yeah, this has been around since the inception of vendors
---
I‚Äôve played and beat fallout 4. This game just seems so much more difficult to even get built up. Just hardcore struggling and SUPER frustrated. That helps a ton knowing I‚Äôm not even close to being where I need to be level wise and armor wise. Thank you for the tips, much appreciated!
---
Just spent 2k scrip... nothing.
---
Yep its great
---
With all the people around here asking if [specific thing that happened] is normal, i don‚Äôt think we should auto-assume irony or sarcasm.
---
That's not a bug. That's how the machines work.
---
Maybe the brotherhood will have periodic nukes striking fissure prime? If they pick up where the Appalachian chapter left off
---
MAKE GRENADES SCRAPPABLE
---
People will tell you that you should have stopped and hopped to a different server. They will be correct.
---
Imagine being a courier? like, people pay you caps to get things from people half way across the map and in different servers? Thats a coooooool idea.
---
Blood soaked armor makes absolutely no sense, the rest are fine
---
It's always possible to fat finger the code.
---
At level 45 you can get level 40 or 45 gear.  The level 40 will not be max level. The level 45 will. 
---
Mama Murmrgh will not give you something you couldn‚Äôt equip. 
---
Just things that you didn‚Äôt want. 
---
*I‚Äôm looking at you, Nocturnal Reflecting Agi+ Lead Pipe...*
---
Can't imagine how a missile launcher bashing to your chin would feel like
---
So many games do this, it's frustrating.
---
Powering machines makes them show up as vendors on the map.  That's about it.  They work rather they are plugged in or not.
---
At least 50.
---
At 45-49, you'll get level 40 or 45.
---
There's no way it's total RNG. Rolled 8 times before switching servers. 4 berzerkers hunting rifles. I swear 20-30% of my main's rolls are berzerkers weapons.
---
Congratulations! I was so excited to see this post.
---
Same on Xbox 1, always have to leave the building before fast traveling, right after the daily
---
How would that help? Did I take a wrong turn and accidentally end up at the dollar store purveyor, lol?
---
Not even a hunters harpoon gun!?
---
"I'm not your dad. Probably."
---
Hmmmm, sounds like someone had an eventful youth.
---
That's the one I was thinking about lol "live chic darling"
---
hopefully you haven't quit your day job in favor of the comedy club circuit...
---
While I would prefer a general increase on daily Scrip, personally, I think that during Purveyor sales, it only makes sense to increase the daily Scrip for the length of the sale.  You're basically causing a decent number of players to cripple their play experience for the next several days while they work through the backlog.  If they don't have multiple characters to switch to, it's really not fun.
---
shrug emoji
---
Push through your 30s with whatever grinding you can do.  It does get better in early 40s.  It is something a lot of people experience.  Late 20s to late 30s, early 40s is tough for some reason in FO76.
---
No exterminator knuckles?
---
Let me know if you find it I'm also looking
---
The plans are fairly rare at this point, yes.  The dead Trick-or-Treater used to be a more common random spawn, but as there are a lot more random spawns post-Wastelanders, the odds of finding them, and then having this specific plan, are quite low.
---
maybe try sneaking? with a mod to silence a weapon (combat rifle, assault rifle, handmade, hunting rifle) you get double damage for each shot under \[caution\] or \[hidden\].  and enemies cant target you as well.  Assaultrons can see through sneak pretty well once you start attacking, so make it count.
---
there are perks + armor to help you sneak better as well.
---
look at your perk cards in general, you probably want some + damage cards for the weapon you want to use. and there are usually 3 levels of cards, regular, expert, master. first tier of each is +10%, then +15, +20, so get the first rank of each first. 
---
Look into getting better armor. will help you survive longer. and hotkey stimpaks so you can use them rapidly. 
---
assaultrons are a pain for me and im higher level. but i can usually take them out.
---
Pumpkins can? Weird I thought for sure Pumpkin nades couldnt be sold, just tossed a grip of them from my stash based on that notion. I'll have to try selling them again.
---
My first play through on 76 I was over level 100 before i had a strong enough build, I always used heavies in the last games and tried it on this one to find they are shocking. If you want to get the extra DPS then go for a junkies/bloodied vats commando build. Its quite easy then to 1 shot lvl 62 ghouls.
---
Well once you pick up an item you need to pick up 180 different items for it to respawn in the same spot.  Bethesda  put the kibosh on server hoping for the same items in the same place.
---
Bummer. We're on xb1
---
There was a time when the Mothman Museum sold those posters too.  They don't have them anymore, though.  It was a pretty cool, unique illustration from Bethesda.
---
Who‚Äôs been banned?
---
it will be on the game's website. you don't need to try and find it.
---
I know lol.
---
Just tired of all time gating "features" they already implemented.
---
Looks like you're on the right track. But if you're having survivability problems, try looking into the Dodgy perk under Agility. You'll be losing AP, but the 30% damage reduction works wonders for tanking!
---
And yes. Emergency Protocols chest mod like Vetheros said. That's a 50% reduction at low health as well as increased damage/move speed.
---
For Earl specifically, equip Fireproof rank 3 under Endurance to help with the incoming fire damage.
---
For a better weapon, the Wayward questline can give you a BSS Sledgehammer if you pick the appropriate reward at the end. Me love that Sledge long time.
---
That's all I got. Good luck, soldier!
---
Out of 40 rolls, the best stuff I got was a AA50+1P Lever, B10+1A .50, B50MS LMG, and some V fixer
---
thanks, that's good to know, and also sad
---
will show up here I'm pretty sure: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news)
---
Your teammates should have pacifist mode on to avoid this, if that‚Äôs what they want.  PvP team mechanics has been changed so it won‚Äôt affect you.
---
The game is designed to not be completed by lower levels. I'm level 80 and still working on the main quest. Participate in events, explore, craft, do side/ally quests to level up quickly.  the game has a rep as a grind for a reason.
---
Yes. It's going through the kitchen wall on first floor al the way to the bedroom upstairs.
---
My first welcome was a CTD then nuke codes didnt work... War changes more then this game
---
Its rng but its seeded badly. Yesterday I got 3 uny ss pieces in a row. I believe the seed is time and not server based.
---
You went to Grandma Murmghr, instead of Mama Murmghr.
---
Grandma Murmghr is the one that sells you secondhand  stuff straight from the scrip machine. You can tell because of the bowl of hard candies, caramels, and paper clips that she has on the counter.
---
Poor guy have a big ol bear hug with my brand new BSSS Bear arm
---
Wanted to check before I made a post. It is an absolute joke. They should make a disclaimer next time they feel like talking shit and fucking us over.
---
Thanks!!  I‚Äôll figure out how to add people today!
---
Single player Fallout is a fun and relaxing experience for me. After long days at work I just want to explore the wastes and do quests. There's enough enemies in the game already and the last thing I feel like dealing with are some level 350 tryhards who wanna go around killing other players because "it's pvp bro git gud" as they hide in stealth and then spam fire their legacy explosive gatling plasma.
---
Luckily I've only had a tiny amount of negative experiences involving pvp in 76 and now I avoid it entirely by turning pacifist mode on and only engaging with workshops in private servers.
---
PvP was never necessary for this game and has never been necessary in a Fallout game. Bethesda saw the popularity of games like Fortnite and PUBG and thought that's what everyone wanted.
---
For the record, I believe this game needs two distinct servers. One for full on, hardcore survival mode with full pvp at any time and one just like our current adventure mode but with absolutely zero pvp.
---
Summerville.   When u load in, the first house on the right.   Burnt books everywhere.  Ez quick place to reset ur loot counter.

I actually complained on another Reddit post about the Meat Week event being done too quick because several people just camped the drums &amp; spits. It was perhaps my most downvoted post so far. People seriously misinderstood my point &amp; so I'm glad someone else is saying pretty much what I did. I can't believe the backlash I got from my post.
---
If someone is part way through a quest, they don't get the chance to make it to the event in time because it gets done in less than 30 seconds. Some quests will reset if you leave before completion, so some people can't just abandon their quest. If you're mid-conversation in the final part of a quest, you have to see it through, even if it only takes 2 minutes. By that time, Meat Week is done. I'm completely on your side here with what you are saying.
---
Just ask them to Moooooooove
---
Sucks especially if you're on PS4. We get all the cool toys because PC is where all the mods are made, not like you can use xEdit or the Creation Kit on console. üòÖ Only mod I've found that includes a combat helmet light for Xbox is Unified Clothing Overhaul.
---
Thank you! üòÑ
---
Actually it is specifically for Berzerker's. You can use broken armor and still get the legendary effects, so if you have 5 broken pieces you get 50% damage reduction, not damage resistance. Meaning you get 50% Damage Reduction, plus Lone Wanderer adding up to 70%, and with Dodgy go up to (in-game balance) 99% Damage Reduction.
---
Ok, thank you. Some of the other wordings I‚Äôve found confused me on this so I just wanted to double check. Some of the wording said ‚Äúcloser to your level so you can use it ASAP‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt know if that meant level 45+ would give 45 and 50 or what. Once again, thanks for your help!
---
You are.........THE NAVIGATOR
---
&gt;They should make a disclaimer next time they feel like talking shit and fucking us over.
---
Huh?
---
Yeah I got DV'd about Meat Week too
---
I never understood players arguing against a mode that can be switched off and thus have zero effect on them.  Don‚Äôt participate if you don‚Äôt want to, but why prohibit the fun of others?

If they did a weekly scrip event, alot of whiny people would be "what about me? i cant play on \_\_\_\_ day?!?! how dare they! this is so unfair!!!!!!!!"

Gamer Karens ruin everything.
---
Stalkers fixer. Oh boy
---
Lol, thx. Nice pull!
---
You know, I can only do so much ;)
---
23 rolls, the "best" item was a two shot auto grenade launcher with limb damage and 90% reduced weight.  I did get a fixer, but the rolls on it were absolutely useless.
---
These events really just let us see in one burst what we already know from the math, the loot in this game is bullshit.  The pool is polluted with too many useless legendary properties and weapon types.
---
Purveyor sale, everything on sale bar legendary modules and vault steel. They should mention that. Cheers for the downvote though xox
---
yeah
---
This would be epic
---
I'm new to trying to decipher that stuff outside of the editor but I think you're right - each piece of Sentinels armor adds 15 to an actor value, then the perk does one roll to see if it applies if any of your gear has the relevant keyword. Interesting that there's an "IsSneaking = 0" check on Sentinels, that really screws over stealth builds, though I guess you're choosing between Sentinels and Better Sneak tertiary effects so it sort of makes it a no brainer for those builds.
---
Only reason I have't yet is because on my main, I had the final quest and must've auto-completed as soon as somebody else launched a nuke while I was in the stage of going to a site. I assumed I still got credit for it but the satisfaction of completing it myself wasn't there.
---
Amazing, love it!!!
---
Kevin Costner NPC with Ford Lincoln Mercury assistant or nothing!
---
Sucks. Also, I actually like to get the critters. I must be the only person collecting intestines... I make Fasnacht Sausages with them. When the event completes in under 30 seconds, I have no time to collect those juicy intestines &amp; once the event completes, the critters &amp; corpses vanish. It'd just be nice to have a chance to do stuff!
---
1000 scrip still isn‚Äôt that much.
---
&gt;It's a legendary SUPER sale! Until September 14, get 50% off any legendary weapons and armor you buy from the Purveyor Murmrgh at the Rusty Pick in the Ash Heap
---
That's the main menu news notification. They aren't "talking shit and fucking you over".
---
Modules and vault steel have never been included in sales as long as they've been available for purchase.
---
So you're just sadly mistaken.

The two things that stood out for me immediately, are that you have a great voice and you are very knowledgeable. If I may make an observation or a friendly critique... I think that a lot of YouTubers, when not doing a live stream with viewers, will use the clips or footage from their gameplay and then do a narration with a script. It seems that allows for a smoother narrative and allows them to make their key points..  
---
I think you have a tremendous amount of potential here. Do you have a Twitter account? I have seen many, many people who are on twitch and YouTube support each other. When you feel more confident and comfortable with what you're doing , connecting with fellow content creators might help you grow your viewership.
---
I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only. Let's see here... It's from... Paige at Foundation? You've got friends in high places. Looks like that's it, got to go.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Need something?
---
Really?but i don't really encounter them that much.
---
Nice idea. Though the "Prices too low" is hilarious. I sell plans for like 5 caps a piece, you're not my supervisor.
---
Maybe they are still discussing about the release date for next patch.
---
&gt; Most of my armour is level 40 light metal armour with the painted or polished mods. Only other options are combat or leather, which are weaker. 
---
So with the BOS mod combat armor is quite good, especially the sturdy and heavy variants and will probably be better than the metal armor. The BOS mod plans can be purchased from the Responder Vendor bot in Grafton and it is not too expensive.
---
As others have said, you should start to focus your perks to a specific build. You are limited in the number of perks you can have, so you want to make the most of them and really focus on one maybe two weapon types. This will free up some perks to help with defense, like serendipity, evasive, blocker, etc. This may also mean that you have to give up some quality of life perks like things that reduce weight of chems and food.
---
There seem to be a few set spawn points for your CAMP. I noticed 3-4 areas where I spawn when I fast travel to my base. One area is a large circle that you can spawn in quite a few different places that are relative to a certain spot. The others are pretty specific; I land in the same spot every time I land there. But I find at least 3 different spawn points for a given CAMP.
---
You spelled "feature" wrong.
---
Aye well fuck them for making me have to read. They should be a disclaimer about reading too.
---
game has never been bug-free either but that would also be a nice change of pace regardless.
---
Furious ffr fr fixer was my first pull, after that only good 1 was a bloodied auto grenade launcher with vats hit and something else. The fixer made it all worth it.
---
You're probably seeing nukes from people who found an old server with old codes working.  Because I launched a nuke after the reset using old codes, I don't have to enter a code to launch them from that silo for the rest of the week.
---
Only reason i am able to play is game pass and I'm not toxic like these people. I've never had anyone playing music in their mics, most people including trolls have no mic and just communicate through emotes and messages
---
Burrowing and scorchbeast's swooping/take off ability need a cooldown. A long one. I want to fight your monsters, Bethesda, not wait for them.
---
Too often the Queen takes off immediately after landing, not before swooping around for 5 minutes straight.
---
Computer RNG is based on a Seed, sometimes it‚Äôs static for a while. By changing servers you‚Äôre forcing a new seed
---
Eh,the only reason i want to do it because im bored out of my mind.
---
Oooh good one.
---
Can you get banned for it tho?
---
Its almost every day I see douchebags like this being a nuisance
---
69 rolls. The best was a BE15 Lever action. Now I have 2 great lever action rifles I'll probably never use.
---
I did not start to play the quest till lvl 50 so i get rewards at the highest lvl possible. Explore tue map.
---
This happened to me and I actually got excited about it but it left my inventory once I handed the quest in. I would love to be able to skip the quest each day on my alt, doing the grind on multiple characters is excruciating.
---
I'll be playing Star Wars Squadrons by then...

I marked the more valuable scrap for search early on, so I could just pick everything up with a search icon next to it and be on my way. Def a good call to grab these early.
---
There is no "can't be done" to attach a light to a mesh. All they have to do is open the helmet file, add an emitter, and re-export that shit. It's not rocket science. It's game-development. In other words, they have other priorities and that's not one of them.
---
Everyday is Halloween(well like 2 days before) in the wasteland my friend. Decorate away

Great idea that sadly won‚Äôt be implemented :(

Yeah its annoying,  the nuka cola lamp is the same way. Works sometimes.
---
Nice! Now lets see how much trash fits into that cash register by Sunday.
---
I didn't have any Corn Soup, but I was able to put several other kinds of soup in the vendor.  Is Corn Soup specifically excluded?
---
As someone who works in games; It's as easy as attaching a helper to the helmet geometries hierarchy that calls in a light emitter. Easiest shit in the world. They just give no fucks.
---
Did they mention that the modules and steel would be excluded any time in the last month? How many other 50% off sales have they had since wastelanders?
---
I just got one of those and a nocturnal lol

That‚Äôs the trick, shoot the legs. If it has not seen you, throw some mines out, back up shoot the legs, if you fail to cripple back peddle and shoot the mines when it‚Äôs close.

Highly doubt it. What do they expect you do, miss out on collecting the rep you get from the only daily quest that gives the best rep xp for the faction while they work on a fix that won‚Äôt come out for a year from now?

I‚Äôve had this feature for longer than 3 weeks. Enjoy it while it‚Äôs available.

At least it's a fixer. I just pulled a stalker broadsider ffs
---
Also, we just dumped like a billion pounds of junk on the brotherhoods doorstep. How about they quit being stingy with the goods and unlock the armory for a little machined guns ONLY legendary sale. Cheap bastards.
---
Hang around the Charleston area for a while.  Lots of workshops near there for the taking and retaking.  With the next patch coming soon with better leveling for enemies, things should get easier.  Or join a team of higher level players and just tag everything with an automatic pipe rifle.  Also, if you need anything, just ask (if you have a mic).  Players who have been at this for a while are usually more than happy to toss you some chems, stims, or leveled weapons.
---
You started playing on the last day of the season. Try again 9/15 when season 2 starts
---
You got one shot, make it count lol
---
Holy Mothman, that's amazing!

You gotta hop servers if you don't see any of the 3 rolls that you like. Meanwhile, if you see multiple good rolls, roll.a few more quickly.

There‚Äôs a video by RifleGaming that I used to base my Fianc√©‚Äôs junkies rifle build off of. It was a really good guide, goes into all the detail you need but it‚Äôs a long video. You can definitely use it as a blueprint for any weapon type you want to build around.

The legendary run, finished and there won't be any daily or weekly challenges until the beginning of season 2, Armor Ace, which starts on the 15th Sept US
---
Ooo, that'd be cool. Maybe Bethesda make it quick because it is a once per hour event. Having said that, Fasnacht is once per hour &amp; that can't be rushed. I feel something should be added to Meat Week so it lasts a minimum amount of time, 10 minutes or so.
---
They never mentioned they'd be INCLUDED either.
---
There haven't been any 50% off sales, but there's been 1 or 2 25% off sales, and modules and vault steel were not included.
---
Modules were also available for purchase before wastelanders, and they were ALSO never included then.
---
I already quoted what the in game notification says.  I'm not saying they *shouldn't* be included. 
---
I'm saying they never have and BGS never stated they would be so there was never any reason to expect they would be. That's all.
---
Right on, thx for the tip.
---
Basically you get addicted to up to 5 Chems (I have a sub saved with the 5 best ones to get in my opinion I can send u it) and they make your damage better
---
I want to come to your base!
---
Or a feral ghoul scorched beast king. If that's possible lol
---
Thanks. Not all hope is lost. I've checked everyday since Saturday so I'm hoping with server maintenance or something they'll be back.
---
I think that's why I was ok with Fasnacht
---
It doesn't make your game experience harder to do some damage to the legendary and then back off and wave people over. If you can't manage to let other people get the legendaries too because you'll die, you shouldn't be doing the event. Excuse it all you'd like, its selfish to one hit kill legendaries in an event with tons of over people no matter what your reasoning is. No one is demanding you use a pipe pistol. I'm a damn heavy guns build and I just hit it once with a bash if I can and if it's too far, a .50 round which I use almost all the time and don't have to change weapons so other people can get the drops. Sharing the opportunity to get drops is not difficult, and not doing so is extremely selfish. I don't care is someone wants to play with a build they like, I care when they use that build to ruin the event for everyone else. Make your excuses all you'd like. Its selfish, stop one shotting all the legendaries.
---
Oh yeah, that's true. But where is the -2 penalty coming from? I have 3 END perk points, but my endurance is only 1 when wearing PA.
---
Maybe build better defenses or move your camp? I mean come on, the solution is easy. With the blueprint system (i know its not perfect) its pretty easy to move the camp around.
---
Probably but I love the idea and would love to see it happen
---
We'll most likely get one or two Pitt locations when the Expeditions come in winter.
---
11/10 - would pay caps to troll my husband with the insultbot
---
Hey there! This week's Inside the Vault is delayed and will be out tomorrow afternoon instead.
---
That explains why my endurance goes from 5 to 3, but why does it go all the way to 1?
---
It would be nice so I don't lose my arm jetpack
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get home and roll some rolls. I know I haven‚Äôt gotten crap since that amazing night her sweet ass gave me 3 bloodied weapons in a row which included my first bloodied fixer
---
October

I‚Äôm not American and don‚Äôt do thanksgiving but I do love that idea. Definitely upvote for that üëç

 &gt; Hey there! This week's Inside the Vault is delayed and will be out tomorrow afternoon instead.
---
Thank you so much for your quick replies guys, Just bad luck on my part
---
Corvega Buick parked outside
---
And the plastic covered couch.
---
I will forever be a diehard fan of the stealth commando. Stealth has always been my preferred style of playing for those sneak attack damage boosts. But they're usually a glass cannon. Especially when played as Bloody. But it's fun to sneak around and not get noticed.
---
Ahh no worries, thanks for the update
---
will you please stop posting this
---
That would be so cool!  And then Mr. Messenger Handy just roams the wasteland looking to deliver "Trapped in base - send help."
---
I would sign up for this.
---
Also last night I was getting some awesome drops from legendaries. I literally played for a hour and at whitesprings there was almost 15 legendary ghouls. Half of the weapons where bloodied or furious. If the sale was live I would‚Äôve spent my scrip but I didn‚Äôt
---
Nope too bad. I have a stockpile of good explosive and ffr rifles and heavies.
---
I pulled a JFFRFMS The Fixer on my 5th roll the a TSFFR1a 50 Cal but I think I ran my luck dry with that Fixer so I‚Äôm sure everything else will be garbage this weekend
---
And when you're shot in the face?
---
If you place conduit down first you can place a wall over it with no issues.
---
üëçüèΩ
---
Wait until the damage readjustment and see which one is most viable. But since you like the first one, it sounds like that‚Äôs your best bet. The Scorchbeast land and you‚Äôll be fine. 
---
Also, since you magic heavy weapons, just put one of those on it. You don‚Äôt really need to perk those.
---
Three identical posts in less than 30 minutes is neither necessary nor appreciated.
---
I have found that even absolutely awful Fixers still sell for above their scrip value. So it's probably worth posting it at a decent price and sit on it
---
Damn, that‚Äôs the dream.
---
Basically, just the Ultima Online giant turkey event but much less samurai abilities.
---
I got a V/FFR/2% vats assault rifle so not too bad
---
Holy fking moly! Best camp i have ever seen!!!!
---
No, 1000 scrip of trash.
---
I thought the same until I saw angry turtles video on the poison and fire resistance ones so now I want them and infiltrator and follow through and specials
---
I don't know now I'm looking forward to playing around with them
---
Ok thanks, never fought behemoth in 76 only in fo4
---
Subscribed!! Good luck!! üëçüëç
---
This post would make more sense if it was decaffeinated.
---
Basically like if this happened on the next bug update, 
---
on Tuesday 9/15/2020, the in game clock would be 12/01/2103, your servers already running since the weekshift, so if you log in at say 8pm eastern on Tuesday, 8 hours of realworld time would filter through the timescale onto the clock, so for me, the longest i‚Äôve made it is maybe October 30th, 2102, that involves claiming and holding multiple workshops etc. very fun the lower your level/ the less pvperz. So, if you log in, on 9/15/2020@8pm it will be 12-7/12-8/2103, but if you log in at noon tuesday, itll be 12/02 maybe?
---
Agreed. Turtle said Master Infilrator was his favorite, which is why I put so much stock in it.
---
I don't grind Colossal Problem, so perhaps i can get away with Fire Proof and the Abestos lining for SS armor.
---
We are catching up with energy sugar waters a nuka cola woulda articulated this for me, ir it would have deleatered my account lol
---
ThxüëΩüíö more to come inside decor üòÅüëç
---
Shiiit I was just doing a SBQ on my one X and it locked me up and booted me.....
---
New data mined stuff?
---
That is a glitch that happens from time to time. Did you leave the server while someone was at your vendor? I've seen it happen then sometimes.
---
My dad's not a phone! DUH!
---
Somewhat related: I exchanged three 40 script guns and somehow the vendors are out of script for my side character. I have to wait a whole 24 hours. To be able to walk and fast travel again.
---
I have nicknamed that behemoth "Gornit" after the pirate giant from Everquest that we would kill every x number of minutes repeatedly.
---
I was literally coming here to post this. The most comprehensive I have seen by far.
---
They mostly come at night.. mostly. Awesome build!
---
i just checked and unless this isn't THE mothman museum, they must have gotten new stock. and yes, this is the same poster they gave out when Bethesda was there
---
https://www.mothmanmuseum.com/store/p187/Fallout_76_-_Exclusive_Mothman_Museum_Poster_.html
---
No, I am very careful with that. Always wait for people to finish their job. It‚Äôs weird.
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to type this out! I'll be taking a lot of these recommendations. Just gotta take a few minutes this afternoon and start changing out some perk cards.
---
This sub is often just people asking the same questions that have been asked over the years hahah xd
---
Damn I‚Äôd shlurp your shmeat for the auto nade tho
---
These key cards are used up as a single use item. Simply go collect them again. i dont know why Bethesda did it this way with this one particular set of keys.
---
Thanks! Definitely getting after Dodgy and Fireproof, and I have to find an Emergency Protocols mod. Sadly, I did the Wayward questline when I was like level 35, so I got a low level weapon from it! Didn't know. I keep rolling legendaries, but haven't gotten a good Bloodied weapon I like, yet. I'll get one eventually, and the Vampire's baseball bat is fun in the meantime.
---
The private servers are working just fine. At least they were last night. (thought I would share)
---
Fire
---
I'M AN ADULT!
---
I'm already done with my decorations I even rebuilt my camp to go with the theme lol it's never too early!
---
I'll retaliate with my broadsider!
---
are you referring to the daily 150 scrip exchange limit?
---
This was the case for me when I built near Lucky Hole Mine. (Off topic, but that name makes me chuckle every time...)
---
I just pulled a Quad FFR Fixer, not awful.
---
I got JE+Perception Minigun, so I'm quite happy
---
This has been requested for a long time. Sorry to shoot you down. It would be rather difficult. Part of why I think it would be difficult or impossible is that if you have multiple player accounts on one console the game only loads and displays the pictures taken by the main account. So I have three accounts on my console, mine (the main), my girlfriend‚Äôs account (she quit playing a while ago so I use her account for mules), and my friend‚Äôs account (he‚Äôs out of town a lot so he gave me access to his account for limited time events). When I log into the game on either my girlfriend‚Äôs account or my friend‚Äôs account, the only photos available are the ones that I took with my personal account. Meaning, if photos were display-able, and I logged into my friend‚Äôs account any photo frames he had in his camp would show my photos, not his. Which would disappoint me a bit because I know he‚Äôs captured some really funny moments. It also means that photos are saved to the hard drive of the console (not sure about pc). I know this because when my friend logged into his account (at his house on a different console) after being out of town for a week, I asked if he liked his new profile photos for his various characters. The photos that I took on my Xbox on his account do not show up on his Xbox, so for him his character profile photos hadn‚Äôt changed.
---
In short, Beth would have to change how photos work and fix them so they aren‚Äôt tied to the hard drive (maybe not the hard drive but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going with) of the console. But instead have them tied to the actual account. 
---
Considering all the other updates and fixes coming over the next few months I doubt this will make the list. It would have come with modding which is in the future of the game according to Beth but not anytime soon.
---
I'd like it if it looked like a proper chemist's table.  Lots of beakers, a microscope, some of those bottles with the weird long angled necks and all.  Y'know, proper stuff so I can say "I'm not making drugs, I'm making **SCIENCE.**"
---
I agree with that. It‚Äôs just a bummer.
---
Angry Turtle said this was his favorite legendary perk, which is why I put stock on this one. I can see its value, but I also see the arguments against it. 
---
Definitely  ot a priority upgrade at first.
---
I put the settler wanderer's guitar facing off a cliff.  She teleports to it and immediately falls and breaks her legs.  Half the time she gets stuck in the crippled animation and scoots around camp on her knees
---
Perhaps they where crouching at your vendor
---
Glad I could point you in the right direction
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Wendigo‚Äôs drop fiber optics. Do a few A Colossal Problem events. Just shoot the Wendigo spawns, don‚Äôt flee the mine at the end, and don‚Äôt die after Earle is dead. You won‚Äôt lose your junk but it will eject you from the event and you won‚Äôt be able to loot anymore.
---
Wait for the patch to drop to see which character is more viable, I guess. 
---
I hope Bethesda keeps on tweaking the new damage model. Because as it stands now, it will make optimising your build almost useless and further cements the build supremacy of faster fire rate bloody commandos and heavy weapons.
---
I'm on my 4th character and I just found like 3 marked locations in the Forest that I'd never found before...seems like every day I find unmarked locations too!
---
That's good know thanks.  It seems some servers are working and some are not.  Which is good as I've managed to get a few nukes in since :)
---
Got a V/E/1per minigun, nothing better than this
---
"Dude, relax, it's just a prank bro!" It sounds like you understand that making a post calling for the death of a public figure breaks a rule, even if you think that it's funny. Keep explaining the joke, though
---
Curious to see what you use for pvp if it's not a lagacy laser a tesla is probably the easiest to pick up and use without vats.i will agree they bog the server when you have a bunch of clowns spamming near by.
---
V/33/25 Fixer. First decent one of those I've ever rolled.
---
Nice roll man!
---
  Depending on where you are running across the (insert high level enemy here), a server hop may lower the level.  
---
Some areas scale enemies based on whose been there recently; if a high level has trekked though and not killed them all, then when you get there, they still exist.
---
For example, blackwater mine is usually L40 glowing mole miners, but if the server has recently reset and no high level has been there, the Mole miners are non-glowing and L14.  If I kill them all, they will respawn as L40s.  If I don't, they stay L14s until thet are killed.
---
Similarly, Whiteprings itself, I've seen L22 reavers and no more than L42 ghouls.
---
Lewisburg and the Garrahan mining HQ building are like that as well.
---
Of course, once One Wasteland drops, enemies are supposed to adjust to your level, but that's another story :)
---
"Thanks for the slingshot!"

---
I did ok out of my 1k [https://imgur.com/a/jUM4CFF](https://imgur.com/a/jUM4CFF)
---
Oh I see how it looks! I haven‚Äôt explained properly. My first character ran out and my second one was also out even when I didn‚Äôt use my script. It‚Äôs fixed now though. Better edit that post. :/
---
Thanks! Pleasant surprise!!
---
Yeah that's honestly about the best I could hope give the purposes I use it, basically just tagging at things like Line in the Sand.  On the other hand, it's not like my current tagging weapon was at all insufficient.
---
Right? And he could be beneficial in some way as long as you keep him supplied with alcohol. Or he could make his own given a brewing station and appropriate mats.  
---
If you don't though his delirium tremens nightmares begin coming to life and destroying your camp.
---
you glorious son of a bitch.
---
thanks buddy üëçüèº
---
modules would be 25, 3* armor scrips for 27
---
Yeah I'll probably put it up for sale.  I think it's Medics/33 VATS accuracy/90% weight.  If it had reduced VATS cost on it I'd actually put it to use.
---
I want to become an ammo factory first and foremost. The other legendary perks are okay, but rolling out serious amounts of Ultracite .45 and 5.56 ammo is the dream.
---
Edit: oh, and Taking One for the Team. How did I miss that one? +10% - +40% damage when something attacks you if you're on a team? Unlock: easy mode, that sounds awesome.
---
I did the math and I've got enough coins to max 3 cards and bring one to level 2. Will be maxing taking one for the team for sure.
---
Will also be for sure taking, funky duds, sizzling style, 
---
Considering, electrical absorption (if the healing is not a bug), legendary luck, what rads, and far flung fire works
---
Funky Duds for that Poison Resistance
---
Master Infiltrator because pretty much mandatory
---
Ammo Factory because you can never have enough boolet
---
Then I guess INT and STR for more XP and carry weight.
---
It happened to me last night - very annoying.
---
Well, could be. I hope noone ever crouches again at my vendors. I‚Äôd hate to scrap my bear and mr fuzzy collection by mistake.
---
You know Bethesda would still find a way to time gate it.  
---
"Unlimited scrip on Sundays!  Limit of 10 scrip max per hour"
---
A quest similar to the dmv and military training quests combined where they make you run around to verify your identity and train you to become a postal service worker.
---
So very annoying
---
Join a build team, open a lunchbox  or two, consume either canned meat stew, cranberry relish or brain fungus soup (or all 3).  Once bound, you should get a 100% XP bonus.  Do the whitesprings loop.  If all the ghouls are high level, you should easily get 10k per circuit.
---
Radiation rumble is another good one.  At 228, I gained 1-1/2 levels for being in a successful  event.
---
It scrips for 24 not 27
---
Sadly, no. I gave up...
---
We have mechanic overalls, just need a white mask with brown messy hair

My Junkie commando build  https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwcMBwMECQcBAQEGAQULDQ8QKE8DJwJ3A8QBA3sDEAFvBT8DzQEBfAOAAQOCAQWlAQNRAzYCGAG7AQPVAQMkAxkDAA==
---
If not in team: Lone Wanderer in Charisma
---
To increase stats sometimes I play on low hp in uny armor. Junkie has great damage on low hp. Not bloodied, but enough for all Wasteland creatures incl. players) Dont forget that J effect is Magic one
---
Easy to convert build for heavy guns https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwcMBwMECQcBAQEGAQULDQ8QLE8D8AEDTgPkAQHEAQN7AxABzQEBfAM7A4ABA5gBA4MBA6UBA3EC6gEDNgIYAbsBA9UBAyQDGQIA on boss events to shoot from magic heavies
---
2 must imho mutations Alcohol &amp; Psycho, bcz u‚Äôd use Ballistic bock/High voltage Hefe &amp; Psychotats/ buff to increase dmg
---
Doing it on a particular day would really suck for a lot of folks. Just increase the limit or remove it.
---
We need a Frying pan of some sort for a weapon.  they already have a rolling pin.
---
There ya go that's what I'm thinking
---
Now until the 14th
---
Ugh, Nocturnal, the only property making items WORSE than nothing.
---
Friend of mine has it; said it worked correctly once (when it was placed), but for subsequent activations, it has only rotated - no image on the walls.  
---
Ditto the nuka-cola lamp.
---
currently active. ends on monday the 14th at noon eastern.
---
Local brahmins disliked that.

---
I saw one of the UFO with same building techniques in the whitespring golf zone few weeks ago(the one I saw was saucer without spacing and with dome in the middle as the entry to the saucer part), really felt impressive of how flawless it was, really hope I can pay a visit to your UFO one day as well, but I'm on PC though..
---
Tagging at LITS was precisely why I‚Äôve been looking for a reduced weight auto-nade. In the meantime I‚Äôve been running a bloodied m79 but sometimes I accidentally one-shot the wave ü§≠
---
Same with ultracite 2mm EC. Might make the gauss minigun actually viable in terms of ammo consumption
---
You get an average  of 12 scrip for a module spent on armor. 20 scrip for 2 modules spent on a gun and 24 scrip for a module and 10 vault steel.
---
Remember if you're explicitly going for XP it may be more cost effective to add Charisma and grab Inspriational, than just +5 to Int, if you're not already using it
---
Not true. You can get rid of it by moving your camp and deleting the blueprint.
---
I like the idea. But neat to leave a message stating that your vendor prices are too high!
---
Anyone selling ammo for more than 1c per ammo is too high unless you're selling plasma core. I normally sell those for 20c per core.
---
Grounded isn't the one you're thinking of. It gives you energy resistance for reduced energy damage
---
Fire roll, would u trade or sell it? Also- what kinds of rolls did you get around this one? I‚Äôm trynna figure out the drop pools so I can hit that BSS tendy too ü•∫
---
Even if it cost like 500caps per insult I‚Äôd send multiple ever time
---
All that does is cause the phantom budget glitch where it‚Äôs stored but can‚Äôt be scrapped, so it just takes up your camp budget.
---
Yeah, this one is the hottest! The Master Infiltrator is awesome because you really need only one rank to unlock anything. I'm also wondering is it possible not ever eat or drink again with Survival Shortcut?
---
Modules still at normal price,
---
Up to now I've been using a full weight Two Shot M79 (with two other useless properties I can't even remember), and it works great.  Man does it break fast though, I go through a couple Improved Repair Kits per event.  I'm actually worried about my supply now that Scorched Earth is run less often.
---
Yes I use a laser. After the last patch my tesla when from my main stash box to my weapons mule. It lives there now, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs home. I also don‚Äôt vats. Lots of the time stealth boys come into play anyway
---
You're right.  I derped.
---
September 15th
---
Did wild turkey whiskey exist yet? I think you may have your timelines confused.
---
Do the effects of the Chems wear off at all?
---
I hate you. I just spent 1000 scrip on 2* melee weapons and not a single tenderizer at all, let alone a BSS one.
---
Already have it!  This would just be more icing on the cake.  Plus it'd let me slot a QoL perk or two, like Gunsmith, First Aid, or Batteries Included.
---
Ty :)
---
I would offer my 1st born.!and maybe I will throw in a little extra just to balance it out.  Nice roll!
---
That sounds good
---
I've had this bug for maybe 2 months now.. at first  I could do this quest over and over again while server hopping. But since last update it does it once a day now. And I also cant drop/remove quest item from my inventory so yeah it's a free quest now
---
Oh yeah let me sell every gun I own to get one. Nah I‚Äôm good, I‚Äôm not spending my money I make for my family for a game and I‚Äôm not giving away everything I earned in game for one gun.
---
I'd love a robot parade.   Fastnacht, but with pumpkins.  We could even have it at the pumpkin house!  üéÉ
---
The effects will but once you're addicted the negative effects won't go.  Also if you don't have mutations go on YouTube and find a video on how to get them and the perks you need
---
Is your melee weapon +1 endurance and getting unequipped when in power armor? Other things could be Perks, chems, or alcohol.
---
Oh I see he runs electrically charged, so your advice still stands.
---
That's a negative, Ghostrider. Wendigos are the screw farms.
---
Fog Crawlers drop fiber optics, though.
---
I'd be happy if the ones in my camp would simply *stop shooting everything.*
---
Wow, this again. How novel!
---
Yeah, I'm using these in a similar way "finally I can have bandolier AND blocker!" haha
---
And on the Ranger Helmet as well, it actually has a built-in LED flashlight.

And the xp to effort ratio during the double XP event I was getting like 1500 XP for the sentry bots at the white spring in exchange for mabye 7-10 shells
---
my nuka projection lamp does the same thing. sometimes it works and it‚Äôs gorgeous other times it‚Äôs just sad
---
Just get the Raider one and collect on them chems. Farm you out 200+ psychobuff and join the junkies legion.
---
Seeing as they trademarked * ¬ÆThe World's Only Mothman Museum‚Äù I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the only one selling these lol
---
Mind telling me what you ended up doing? Stay on gamepass or purchased it on steam?
---
I managed to convert 1000 scrip into 800 scrip.
---
Bethesda pls
---
at least do Halloween Scorched ;-;
---
Got a Mutant's/Explosive/+AGI Fixer.  Also several different flavors of railway rifles.
---
Turrets have always had a hidden feature that makes more enemy creatures spawn.
---
They're never worth having at your camp.
---
I would recommend getting your self max rep with the settlers and getting the Gauss shot gun plan.  you can craft your own legendary shotguns which have some good range and great damage.
---
Lmao my granny drove a big ass buick
---
Dude I feel this like half the time I'm coming back from the queen fight overweight and these assholes jump me on the edge of the city while I can't run.
---
OP could have made the ‚Äòtarget‚Äô the ‚ÄòBug in the System‚Äô, but decided to go for shock value by joking about murdering an actual human.  Exceptional short-sighted and immature.
---
Hey thanks that‚Äôs a lot of help for my build!!
---
I'm half and half on Master Infiltrator. On the one hand, I currently skip most locked terminals and doors because I don't feel like swapping out perks every time, so Master Infiltrator would certainly be a quality of life improvement. However, if/when they eventually roll out perk load outs to console, we won't need that card anymore. So it's worth it now but I'm not sure for how much longer.
---
Take my upvote! Halloween is a great time of year for me as I simply love the holiday. I‚Äôd be a literal Fry saying ‚Äútake my money‚Äù
---
Stronger NPCs are a non-issue.
---
Fortunately, the AI and spawn mechanics are dumb enough to be manipulated.
---
Haven‚Äôt you started decorating alreadyüòÅno really do what makes you happy, this is all for fun after allüëçüëç
---
I can help you out.   
---
(GT WIDERBOOK914)
---
Right now still gamepass on pc but I will get the steam version probably tommorow.
---
Wow thank you very much!! Lots of really helpful information, thanks for taking the time to let me know :) will really help on my way to a new build!
---
Wasnt around for Mischief Night or any of the halloween plans last year so I'll have to wait until events roll around this year to really decorate. Only thing I have close to decor is the scarecrows. Hoping to get pumpkin stand plans this year among a few others
---
Well thought out. I feel like we need a few negative ones. Aside from low levels, i doubt any of this would be a hinderance to anyone. Not that they all need to be a hinderance. Just a few should be. Especially if triggered from a failed event.
---
Sounds like a great youtube skit waiting to be made
---
Nice, you‚Äôre over here living in the year 3102.
---
Are you very close to camp budget max?  I think as you get real close to that some lamp stuff acts up.  The Nuka Cola lamp does same thing.
---
You really don‚Äôt have to do that lol I just took one gun Iooted and mainly used that to trade up from there. If you look on my profile I have a huge trade list now. I kinda cashed out on the legacy so I don‚Äôt have too many end hand weapons for sale, but it‚Äôs respectable.
---
Got you. Thanks. Yeah I'm thinking the same but when it goes down to $20 again (on steam). I shall see.
---
The last couple of days have been quiet.
---
A few of the quest rewards are halfway decent end game weapons that are worth waiting until level 50 to get, so I wouldn't struggle too much trying to complete everything early. Final Word (though I think that might be locked at 45), All Rise, and Slug Buster come to mind. Also some of the random legendaries you get from companion quests end up being good.

Make sure you have a good damage per second gun. If you're a non-magic shotgunner or semi-auto weapon build, there aren't a lot of good options for sustained dps for things like scorchbeasts and assaultrons, so consider hybridizing into commando, melee, or heavy weapons so you have something to deal with "uh-oh" moments. When I did mayor for a day on my first character, a stealth rifleman, I struggled with the gutsies in the final fight, kept dying until I tried using the plasma gatling I'd just looted from the mayor's office. Now that character is a rifleman/heavy hybrid, and pretty fun to play.

I‚Äôve already begun. Beckett‚Äôs in the Halloween suit and I‚Äôve started hanging up my bats &amp; skellies. Still need to gather pumpkins for my racks.
---
I got almost the same one, but mines a Q FFR FR pipe revolver instead. :(
---
I suggest using isthereanydeal.com to find deals
---
I clicked expecting porn, but I was not disappointed.
---
Probably not. The legendary run promo was more of a teaser for the next patch. My guess is there will be a trailer for patch 23 - or whenever the BoS finally return - but most of the content for this patch isn‚Äôt really trailer-worthy or has already been completely unveiled. If you‚Äôre looking for specifics on rewards, every rank item is listed on the Bethesda.net page now!
---
The good thing, you don't have to spend any perk coins on upgrades so you can swap it later if you want.
---
There is also another option: managing your inventory and only selling enough to keep you at or under the cap limit rather than putting all of your stash into the vendor.
---
Haha it happens. It just seems to happen a lot kore to my friends with the OG Xbox one. Lol
---
But it's coming back for a week soon.
---
Please allow jetpack to be always hidden while wearing an outfit. The whole point of "coverall" outfits is to hide the armor.
---
I have the lone wolf perk card on would that change anything once I join a group
---
They're bringing it back to the shop just for people like you. Try not to miss out this time though!! It will be a hard sell to get them to bring it back a third time.
---
üëçüèª‚úåüèª
---
Honestly haven't had the issue myself, I'm on PC. They aren't that bright in general I find but I dunno if that's what you mean
---
It's been in the game files since the SS was added in.
---
Soon (tm).

If you're on PC, pm me for the mod that enables it

I‚Äôm not saying all trading is bad on there, I‚Äôve done a few myself. But most time when someone posts a legacy check out what they want. Or like the last time I made a post to trade a tendy plan for a b2525 fixer I had a guy willing to do it and then some body came on my post to talk trash on the trade and never got to do it. So now I just skim through the trades but basically just get my own stuff. The guns I have that I could trade up with I don‚Äôt wanna get rid of so again I don‚Äôt wanna trade a bunch of my stuff or my fav stuff for one weapon. But anyways, thanks for the info
---
Yeap! Gonna do that. Thank you!
---
I sent a friend request
---
Like all other great magicians, he always finds a way out
---
Six rolls, five of which were various pistols or revolvers and the last was a Ghoul Slayers missile launcher.  Swapped toons and rolled 4 ultracite gatling lasers in a row.
---
Nukes going off in their Silos is how you get the divide from Fallout New Vegas: Lonesome Road. Then you get these little subterranean troglodyte like creatures burrowing out of the ground trying to take over the surface, little bastards can actually rip the head off a Deathclaw with ease...
---
(On an unrelated note, I‚Äôd love a courier duster as a FO1st item. I made a black retexture for Ulysses‚Äô Duster back in New Vegas and it looked awesome.)
---
and you know there will be people who will miss it again and complain.
---
I think I came across that camp, unless locking the guy inside the circus trailer, giving him the jacket and the collar is the new META. 
---
Nice looking camp.
---
Then there would be absolutely no point to the limit anyway. Literally the only reason it's there is to prevent people from maxing out quickly before purveyor events or cashing out large amounts of duped items. Not to mention the already excessive bitching about people feeling like they need to log in every day, imagine if they added more 24h limited things
---
It's hella confusing but I found out: on your map there's a menu in the top right for "Social"
---
Increase the sales cap pool, cut prices, have door busters, and hordes of ghouls surrounding every vendor.
---
Close. You can sell baseball and pumpkin.
---
The Santa Claw outfit combo got me. You should use a Mole Miner Gauntlet with the Candy Cane paint to complete the look
---
Yup! was only up for like 3 days :(
---
Well, I googled it and evidently on Xbox you have to add them through Xbox live!  How crazy is that?
---
Without a doubt.
---
If it was at the very bottom of the Ash Heap, yeah probably my camp. Thanks!
---
Fallout 4 mod.
---
It's not possible in 76 without .esp plug-ins and with our non-functional Nifskope.
---
I'll be on later this evening and all day tomorrow.
---
No, spawns for yourself and people coming to your shop are different.
---
I keep that new helmet from ACP for this reason.  If I need the light it‚Äôs a lot better with that then the pipboy one.
---
People Who Haven‚Äôt Played 76: This game sucks how can you actually enjoy this lololol
---
Same People After Trying 76: Everything we were told about you, was a lie.
---
(Welcome to the family. Ha ha ha)
---
Yeah lots of people are dicks on there for sure lol. Cheers.
---
On the PTS not the live servers.
---
Rate seems normal to me.  I have been and continue to get crap rolls from the purveyor.  And from events.  And from mission rewards.  And from Earl.  And from crafting end game shit.
---
1: personal preference, and it means you can‚Äôt eat some foods
---
2: No it is not
---
Same here. 1000 scrip worth of stalkers pipe and mutant slayer‚Äôs junk weapons. I pretty much cash in my scrip for crap weapons then log off every sale now.
---
So glad I‚Äôm not alone in this. 
---
Catharcism stops me shouting at clients
---
Unbelievable build, really wish we had wall mounted laser turrets for stuff like this
---
Headless horseman power armour?
---
I stopped crafting SS armor and rolling weapons at the purveyor's. The legendary items I get just by playing for an hour (events and enemies) are enough to make me reach the scrip limit. 
---
I have been selling them cheeaap also, like, 1K for a Junkie's Tesla, or 500 for a Bloodied MM Gauntlet. Assassin's Powered armor for 900. That means I get to keep playing.
---
*Caveat venditor*
---
If OP manage their business better this will *not* be an issue.
---
I don't know, I view them as 'minions' :P
---
Transfer them to an alt character
---
Mabey you could find a mailman and could have them deliver an item or message to other players or their basses.
---
Nuke plant meltdown with a radiation area around it.

That doesn't work.
---
This is fallout 76, not 4.
---
I got a mutant slayers broadsider with bash damage which was perfect for using on the dimwit that took more than 5 minutes at the scrip machine while I waited patiently. Gave him plenty of time to scrip out and then after the 5 minute mark fired all the cannonballs I had on me and then proceeded to bash him with it. Felt pretty good to use it once before scripping it.
---
Personally I would have stopped after the second harpoon gun. Maybe even the first.
---
RNG be like this. Am about to drop 3k scrip rn.
---
Or maybe they have a weekend that's double scrip limit. Maybe they don't need to put the two together cuz that would be a ton of scrip and discounts going on at once, but I agree a double scrip event would be a good addition to the normal events.
---
If you are on PC I can give you a 1\* Bloodied SS to get you through for the time being.
---
Really? Man I thought I was the only one lol. 40 rolls because I got max scrip on 2 characters, and I got all garbage.
---
Why are you all aggressive and weird with strangers on Reddit. Please get mental help. You fuckin need it. You just seem angry. Who hurt you? üòÇ
---
what are they "at again?"
---
Even a complete Power Armor Jack O'Lantern skin would be awesome
---
I always seem to find the quiet spots. Been in a new spot for a week and haven't had a creature spawn.
---
A bunch of server hopping and loading in to different worlds all week and nothing.
---
The trick is to place your camp in a god awful location with no resources what so ever.
---
BOS Collectron isn‚Äôt cosmetic.
---
I believe next update, 23, they said they were taking out food and drink being needed and there will be a bonus for it instead
---
I complained months ago.  Beth doesn't respect chemistry.
---
Dude I scoured Appalachia for a ring just for her.
---
Incase it helps anyone, I launched a nuke on my private server to test it and it worked from alpha using 45836295, all the terminals at white springs said "in progress". Launched it at the Queen and beat her, everything was fine no spawning issues. Last night it failed at charlie (both codes) so maybe avoid charlie?
---
Desperately need them to adjust the Camp device so that we can rotate it and adjust the location people spawn in.
---
I need people to spawn directly in front of my base but because my base faces south no matter what I do they spawn into the middle of the front house portion.  If I move the device further back they spawn into the walls or foundation of the back side. 
---
Managed to finagle it so that people would spawn in the middle between the front and back structures of my camp, but at the cost of having to lay down carpets so they wont fall off the cliff there, and lights to guide them back to the front. Yet still people get lost and have to be manually guided to the path of my vendors or they just give up in seconds and leave. 
---
It's a Silent Hill styled camp, so they start with a mostly normal looking house with clues of something more sinister afoot,  then from a hidden door cross over Into a nightmarish blackened hallway filled with smoke that looses air raid sirens. In the other side is a nightmarish structure that has a massive drop to a creepy burning alter.
---
Sadly tho, by spawning into the center or back of the camp the surprise of how deep things go is spoiled completely, it takes too much time for them to find the proper entrance.
---
Desperately want new camp device functionality or for welcome mat functionality to be returned.
---
Rolling for stuff from the purveyor has pretty well been obsolete for me since WL. It just makes more sense to spend scrip on modules.
---
I'd almost rather scrip 1000 a day and only spend 150 lol I have so much gear spread across 4 characters, I'll never get rid of it through current exchange rates.
---
Halloween hasn't even happened yet and you're already focused on Thanksgiving lol
---
I have the exact same grenade launcher. Fully 200 percent repaired, and gunsmith 5 equipped, you can shoot it less than 20 times before it breaks. 
---
It got stashed, and it was replaced with a Bloodied 40mm single shot M79. Reduced weight, of course.
---
But it used to be fun (somewhere, some patch fucked it up, because it used to last longer).
---
I have actually.  I love just exploring randomly.  But when the codes go green I've got some cards banked to farm some flux.
---
And when the message is delivered the game spawns a skeleton in a vault suit under the house.
---
Rolled for all 1000 scrip I've had. Notable mentions:  
---
\- LMG: Junkie's, 33% VATS, +1 to perception (2 magic effects on single gun!)  
---
\- LMG: Stalker's, 33% VATS, +1 to agility  
---
\- Gauss Minigun: 2 shots, +10% when aiming, 90% weight reduction (will wait to test it after damage re-balance)  
---
\- Minigun: Junkie's, 50% crit damage, 90% weight reduction
---
I dunno, i got some crap, but i got a 3* Junkie's handmade, thats no use to me, so in the vendor it goes...
---
Congrats on the first nuke.  That‚Äôs a cool mile stone.  Hope there‚Äôs many more to come.  üòÉ
---
I‚Äôll have to give that a try it definitely melted me.
---
Are you wearing the veil?
---
I think he just wants a universal clock that is synced across all servers so that players can track how much time has passed lore-wise. Like how Bethesda just claimed that wastelanders takes place 1 year after the vault opening, but didn‚Äôt have any sort of in-game clock to support that.
---
I ignore the sale and keep doing my normal rotation. 3 items every 2-3 days or so.
---
It's really weird I got one out of 20 rolls and it's the first one I've ever rolled. But I felt good about it because lots of the rolls leading up to it were good rolls on the wrong weapon e.g. aa ss +s shovel. Few more days to try at least!
---
Which wooden traps? The spikeboards that throw you? They need to be hooked to a switch of some kind (a switch, pressure plate, trip wire, etc). They are a little challenging to wire because the connector is on the bottom, so unless they're sitting on something else (or you're using the wire mesh floor) they won't connect. There is a tripwire in Fallout 76 as well.
---
Dang...that‚Äôs what I was saving for.  I don‚Äôt really need more of the suppressors harpoon or hunters pipe gun she normally gives out.
---
Ammo Factory, nothing else.
---
Craft and carry molotovs. Fire works for longer, always tag, never kill.
---
I use an explosive bow (lightweight) or orbital missile attacks. Because fuck those scorched.
---
I got some nice rolls but on lesser weapons so I had a good feeling. There were probably 5/20 that I thought yeah that might be worth something and many more that were just missing 1 of the 4 things to be great (weapon type and the 3*s)
---
Apparently OP thinks that RNG is different during a Purveyor sale, but has only anecdotal evidence to support this. 
---
Last sale I got a few nice pieces like an AA/E/DRWR .50 cal and a Junkie‚Äôs FFR/FR Handmade. 
---
OP‚Äôs logic is like saying that because they didn‚Äôt hit the $100k scratch off this week the game is ‚Äòrigged‚Äô. It‚Äôs just random chance, that‚Äôs all.
---
Well obviously there is more to it than that, but it for sure works. I do it all the time. But thank you, I had no idea what game I was playing.
---
Could be fun to have quests where we have to deliver letters by foot, being attacked along the way by raiders, scorched, or local flora or fauna.
---
"Look at these nerds" - God Howard
---
Herbivore or Carnivore are definitely worth it because of the xp buff foods. You get double effect on the appropriate one.
---
Removing mutations is completely random, which sucks.
---

Csb
---
Once and it was because the veil had become unequipped.  I had to put it on, leave the base, then re-enter to get it to let me in.
---
Ok.i got my hands on a aae laser rifle few months back but I'm just getting into the swing of pvp.i seem to off myself with my own laser on accident..I'll keep playing around till I find something that can be my go to.thanks for your reply though
---
We turn them off when we reach max caps.
---
Don‚Äôt think Bethesda has announced any exact locations, but they have said part of the intent of expeditions was to be a fan service. It would make sense they would hit well-known real world and in-game landmarks that they don‚Äôt intend on (re)creating in WV
---
I might start using power armor more with something like that.
---
Its not like the player buying from you knows that you are at max caps. What are they supposed to do?
---
Or instead of 150/day, make it a standard 1100/week. Buying bullion from Smiley already works like that.
---
But then mobile games are designed to be inconvenient, and having features that would be convenient for actual players goes against the grain, right.
---
Plasma is a net neutral ionized state of matter.  Noble gases are easiest to ionize.
---
I got an antiarmor and junkies that where decent, everything else was junk. Nocturnals and what not. Managed to get two Nocturnal fixers.  Quite a few crossbow and broadsiders.  Spent two thousand script and have an alt at 200 pounds over weight.
---
I will have a video here shortly the interior needs deco but this is the most symmetrical build I've made yet üòÅüëç
---
Yes it does. The Pip-Boy has a clock. That tells you the date and time. 
---
It‚Äôs been one year in-game since the Vault opened. The date changed from 2102 to 2103. Everything we did pre-Wastelanders happened in that 12 month period. And everything we do in Wastelanders will occur during whatever time period is decided upon at the next DLC. 
---
If they mean they want something like in FO4 where the date just kept going, that‚Äôs not really feasible in a multi-player game. And certainly not necessary.
---
Can‚Äôt complain. Got another Bloodied explosive 10mil submachine gun.
---
I found that makeshift warrior wasn't really necessary on my slugger build. I would ditch it in favor of First Aid and either more nerd rage or maybe batteries included - the boosted heal over time will help keep you alive. If you know you are about to get smacked in the face upon entering combat, preemptively hit your stimpack hotkey so that the heal over time is already going before you get stunned. You'll go through a lot of stims though, and they're pretty heavy. I run traveling pharmacy instead of blocker (really hoping for a reduced chem weight PA mod some day), but if you're able to make weight what you are doing is better.
---
I'm afraid to cash in 20 plus ranged weapons because I know I will probably just leave half in a suitcase.my stash box is at 750lb that's with my junk in a scrapbox.might erase my bobble heads and mags next I'm not sure
---
how do we get legendary perks
---
Yeah. Pretty sure I was thinking of gauss weapons honestly.
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
You know, repetitive results on random are very very common. Not just in computers but in real life. 
---
If you know a real computer engineer or someone into statistics, they will tell you this.
---
The best thing is to NOT just sit there hitting the buttons and hoping for a different result. Go do something else, come back. Even if it's a little something else.
---
That's the point of this post: I don't want to continue wasting time if it's not going to materially change. I've seen just about everything in that 1/6 of the map, and 90% of things are ghost towns once you clear out some scorched or cultists or eagles of death metal. Example fail: the mothman museum. It could have been awesome. Instead it's empty. And you can't even steal the mothman statuette for your dream camp.
---
I started up a game of new vegas and it's ten times better so far. Will take your advice.
---
Oh yeah, that won't affect server load at all...
---
Mutated turkeys?,perhaps instead of the SBQ we nuke the rift and a huge turkey comes out?
---
I‚Äôm really hoping that‚Äôs true, how would it effect herbivore/ carnivore serums? Any thoughts?
---
I still don't see a sale.  On Xbox as of 2 PM Eastern Time US.
---
Best thing I got was an AASS DCG and a VSS super sledge, everything else was utter üí©
---
Instigating swing speed agility power fist is the only thing that stands out. Good backup roll for my berserker for when I want to put on armor
---
Snip long blob of text, I was in the wrong file. Found it now and set to 0. Lets hope for proper results!
---
And that's if the fast travel bug or obnoxious load times don't pick that exact moment to screw with us.
---
Really felt like it needed a final phase where were eating as much meat as we can to load up on a lengthy buff that lasts a good while.
---
You can remove herbivore or carnivore by taking the other tho!
---
Yup sounds good to me.
---
Yeahp. There it was. Nice old west freak show vibe.
---
Krampus is what I was going forüòÅüëç
---
8 2* weapons, only halfway decent thing was a QFFR hunting rifle :(
---
You really have to make alts and save 5000 scrip to get a lot of mileage out of these sales.  It‚Äôs RNG, so you have to throw as much as you can at the problem to really have any chance at good stuff.
---
I got 6-7 very good weapons so far.  The standouts are b/25/ag handmade and j/10/25 gauss rifle.
---
Turn off your vendors before starting an event you can't easily quit. That won't stop sales if people stumble across your camp, but it will remove your vendor icon from the map.
---
And more budget üò¨ ..ü§£
---
Why is no one talking about Power Armor Reboot? 40% chance to revive with full health when downed in PA.

Do you have a perk card blocking the ability to become addicted active?

They could do something with that Torrance House! Such a good horror reference &amp; not really used much.

My only break is when I‚Äôm forced to by bethesda‚Äôs arbitrary character cooldown on the silos. If I still want to I have to go on another character and that‚Äôs just effort.

Your Grandpa says "I was hoping for a pension but all i got was detention"
---
I just did the Morgantown airport responder quest at level 50. I think we might be playing different games.
---
Sounds like it's more about the combat grind than about the map, which is the picture I was getting so far. A few pretty sights; not a lot of fun dungeons. No doubt there's a ton of stuff I haven't seen so far in the way of enemies and battles; I would hope so.
---
You get a thumbs up from me; not only for sharing your article but for being truthful with the content found in your writings.
---
Foundation?
---
What we need is an effective caps to scrip exchange rate, I tried moving stuff for 25 caps to 1 scrip but they just don‚Äôt move at that price.
---
Theoretically, yes.  Whatever the bonus is on the lone wander card goes away when you join a team.
---
Running solo, if I consume meat stew before I start the run, all the ghouls at WS are high level, I get the mole miners outside blackwater, the 3-4 ghouls at the electric substation, and the 4 at the flatbed trailer near the main bunker entrance, I get over 9k XP.  IIRC, each ghoul is about 130xp, whereas running in a 4x bound group with the various bonuses, its 220+ per ghoul.
---
I run solo most of the time, don't mess with my perks much, so usually end up leaving  it equipped even when I am teamed (which is usually only when a particular challenge requires it, then I go back to solo).
---
May not be the most efficient, but I'm OK with it; I'm not overly concerned with the daily level up - getting the repeatable for 10k is worth more to me, and the level 3x/week challenge is sufficient for my purposes.
---
The only good Appalachia is a nuked appalachia.
---
Mine is the baseball helmet and a blue bandana, it‚Äôs kinda my signature headwear. And I can craft Marine helmets.

Nope! Never used it.

I got a few decent rolls, but they dont work for me, dont do junkies and the anti-armour i got is a double barrel shotgun, if it was a combat id be laughing.

Someone positively agreeing with me on reddit? What in the world
---
3 hours left at work. But i have 5k scrip waiting for me. Im getting a bit too exited i think
---
same, foundation is not a real issue with half elevation. Only the wall behind the stairs is not matching.
---
Going up, once you have different level floors, there's no way to use stairs. I used different kind of stash boxes and tables, but it should not be too hard for them to add half stairs. 
---
Anyway, we might see a lot of new functional building objects added with the "shelter update".
---
Is my favorite activity breaking into people's homes and sleeping in their beds all creepy like.
---
Should start doing that in the game too.
---
I have a level 25 Raider character. His CAMP budget has about  a tenth left.
---
The Planetarium works fine, the Nuka-Cola lamps have never projected since I acquired them and they were placed before the budget was even at half. 
---
Go figure...
---
As a ghoul I approve this idea! Give us silly hats!
---
Addiction gets triggered by multiple small delays between drug usage. If you take 100x psycho over 100 hours every hour, you're not gonna get addicted. If you take 100x psycho in 1 hour, you WILL get addicted
---
We don't see many birds even this soon after the war. It's possible that they intend for turkeys to all be dead, kinda like how they've treated horses (which is something I've never agreed with)
---
I heard about the holiday scorched last year!  Basically just do that, but with ghouls.  Cause they're more thematic with spooks.
---
They definitely aren't that common. I've done the event at least a dozen times and have yet to get one.
---
Plushie, yep. Collosus rug, yep. Multiple cursed weapons, yup.
---
Still waiting for that damn helmet.
---
This is great life advice. I second this.
---
The normal scrip price is 20 caps a scrip i think. I always buy a ton at that price
---
Really want a collectron that makes those sounds, and plays creepy music.
---
Bruh this is gold xD
---
Oh really!? A trip wire? Ugh another plan I hope to find. Challenging is an understatement. I will try the mesh floor. Thank you! Where should i try to farm the trip wire plan?
---
As a guy who dies a lot, I‚Äôm almost considering blood sacrifice for my boys. Or Follow Through.
---
Oh, that's how it works? I figured it worked by the same rules it did in Fallout 4. Yeah, that might explain it. Though still seems a bit odd I never got addicted, been a few moments when I've popped 5-7 chems within a thirty minute period.
---
Though, I've also been told your Endurance affects how likely you are to become addicted, so perhaps that's also given me a bit of "insulation" against addiction.
---
What have you poor, poor soul seen to expect porn lol
---
Enclosed camp structures need night lighting effects, we can set up such great moods at night,  but during the day everything becomes bleached out.
---
my whole life revolves around halloween, and i've missed out on most halloween events/plans in past years. i've done my best to decorate my camp with anything remotely spooky, but i would love to go all out!
---
You can still pretend to do it by fast traveling to a random location and killing a random enemy because that's all Ward is going to ask of you anyways lol. You can make sure to kill a raider if you want a truly authentic experience. Haha.
---
I have one alt, just as storage tho so they don‚Äôt know any useful weapon plans. Although, now that I think about it, can you teach an alt just fixer or tenderizer plan for example and only roll those? Or are there a large amount of auto-include trash melee / pistol etc. weapons in the pool every time you make a new toon?
---
I don‚Äôt think giving a company a carte blanche pass and accepting there treatment of the game and the community with open wallets because *sometimes it gets it right* 
---
This is how you enable a company to keep giving you inferior and sometimes illegal products, lacking the ability to hold companies accountable for the sake *of playing a game* is the sad state of affairs we are in these days, and not just Bethesda
---
I thought this too, but I only looked at modules. I had to take a second look at the 3 star guns to make sure they were reduced to 50
---
Pop them fast. As fast as you can spam it. 4 to 6 of any given chem is all it normally takes but if u have 10 of each chem you want to get addicted to just slam all 10, then repeat for the next chem.
---
Takes a bit to get the hang of. I killed myself a million times when I first started using lasers lol.
---
sorry 1 year, but that was what I just explained. 
---
While I don‚Äôt think it matters to have it, don‚Äôt really see your logic how it wouldn‚Äôt be simple. Bethesda already has in-game timers, they just don‚Äôt use them for players benefit. All you would do is sync up the Pip-Boy clock to speed you‚Äôd want time to pass in-game. It‚Äôs actually not that uncommon for multiplayer games, as it‚Äôs an easy way for MMO‚Äôs especially to mark development in their game worlds.
---
I don't like molotovs because you have to throw before the enemies even spawn if people have high damage.  The travel time of even a grenade launcher can be cutting it close if people are being dicks.
---
Instigating explosive lever action with +1 perception and +50 armor piercing plasma pistol that i converted to neat flamer (gonna blast some robot asses with this thing! :D)
---
find the 5 things you want to get addicted to. get 5 of each. pop the first then pop a different one and then another one and another alternating each time. Do this very quickly.
---
I just did that at almost 90. Somehow I missed the camp tutorial for 200 hours.
---
It was great on opening day.  I saved up 5000 scrip and here‚Äôs the highlights....
---
AA/E/AG pump shotgun
---
B/25/P combat shotgun
---
I/10/AG gauss rifle
---
I/10/FMS handmade
---
J/10/25 gauss rifle
---
J/25/AG handmade
---
J/E/250 hunting rifle
---
F/CRIT/25 10mm pistol
---
F/CRIT/CRIT fixer
---
Just facts man, not trying to be agressive.
---
Let me guess, you assuming stuff about his personality due to his reddit name is prefectly fine &amp; normal right? ü§° Who hurt you? ü§°ü§£
---
You know this time they're gonna make you pay :-)
---
You have a point, though in other fallouts exploration was rewarded. If I return to 76, I'll look at some quest FAQs and see what I missed there.
---
Guess who may drop by!  Is it Athena?  No, it's a scorched ghoul who looks like Axl Rose.
---
Thanks for the straight response. I was kinda getting the idea that it's not a great solo game.
---
Looking forward to trying out One Wasteland. Honestly, I haven't played the game at all since completing the Wastelanders story mainly because most of the enemies feel like an absolute chore to kill (Charred Ghouls, Assaultrons, and many more), while a lot of enemies I feel should take some effort weirdly enough don't (Sentry Bots for example, they're some of the weakest robots in the game). I'm also hoping the energy weapons finally get a much needed buff, it feels weird playing a BoS style character who has had to resort to using things like homemade rifles just because of how weak laser and plasma weapons are.
---
Needs more upvotes so Bethesda takes notice.   
---
^  o^
---
I spend most of my time vendor hopping, hoping to find that one big score (legacy, super rare outfit) but usually just end up with piles of scrip bc I can't help myself. Based on absolutely nothing, I'll spend about 21 caps per scrip, so I'll pay up to 850 for 3* and so on. I couldn't bring myself to pay 1k for a scrip weapon though. I recently started to be a little smart about it and buy based on weight. No more 12lb shotguns for scrip but I'll buy every knuckles and tambo I see üòÖ
---
F2515 gatling gun (meh) and 3000 worth of scrip. Not really worth it imo. You can get lucky but trading is the only way to get your dream gear and even then it is a high chance the item is one of the 10 000 copies of it.
---
Can you check why the normal SS under armor sometimes has camo elbow pads too please?
---
Hol up...
---
Mine won‚Äôt even target enemies attacking things. Never seen them get overly aggressive. That sucks.
---
How about the steel
---
Nope steel not discounted
---
I 100% agree! Just do a bundle for all black under armor and SS armor like they did for the camo
---
Bethesda in October üò¥üò¥üò¥
---
I wish turrets actually fucking worked/made a difference.
---
Here is is address for the TNT Domes for anyone who wants to visit... 1335 Potters Creek Rd, West Columbia, WV 25287
---
Amazing, absolutely fantastic!
---
I want the one  where you get zero new buffs and a star next to your name.
---
i just finished the whole enclave thing at level 120üòÇ I got distraced with exploring and shit lmao
---
This needs more up votes.
---
At lvl 50, you‚Äôll automatically have all standard weapons in the loot pool.  The only weapons that require plans are bullion items, sheepsquatch weapons, bows, fixers, bear arms and tenderizers.
---
Indeed a glitch, I though someone stole my gilded minigun when it was gone from my display stand :-)
---
Just cleared the REPCONN test site in new vegas. Niiice, multilayered dungeon/quest.
---
Reading this while in a portoshitter on a construction site with no wifi. Took seconds.
---
they're exactly the same unless you look at them
---
Yeah when I was that level I found it super frustrating because robots like that would absolutely annihilate me. Only thing I recommend is keep moving around objects and using stims!
---
Nope because the accepted rate is 15 a point
---
https://youtu.be/LMRQb-RRt5g
---
Omg I go crazy for frag grenades I'll take them all from you!
---
They're a vital component for making my precious nuka grenades , if i dont have frags it means fannying around looking for gears, fertilizers,,oil etc..
---
Normally if agree but they cant even get projection lamps to work right so I'm sure they'd break something if they tried
---
My turrets fucking HATES the traveling merchants. They might be communist.
---
Sneak and hit leg
---
Horrible. I thought I scrapped my Lil Ginger Snuggles when she went missing from her stand. :(
---
those things are bastards. it's normal
---
If your on ps4, this may be an opportunity lol
---
Yeah lmao, I love the lore in 76.
---
That‚Äôs fantastic.
---
We'd all love this feature, and we've been requesting it since Day 1.
---
Should have expected that
---
Shame on him for not setting you up with a decent weapon.  If I were I would drop that loser!  lol
---
Well now I've changed my mind!
---
Not sick of the negativity, but rather of seeing how bethesda is taking advantage of the people that try to be positive about the game, by delivering poor excuses of content that should've always been in the game to start with. In my view, the good things? Not many, the bad things? Way too many.
---
Running jumping through level without care in world... hears assaulting voice....
---
*crouch* can't.....move.....live...here...now...
---
Let's let them fix the bug fest that the game currently is in, that's way too ambitious an ask of Bethesda without them only breaking more things in the process lol.
---
Those get saved to your file system.  Imagine if they allowed pics from your hard drive to be displayed in game to others.
---
It sounds glitched. I ran into this the other day. I was doing Sophie's missions and a commander gutsy kept insta-healing it self. If you're talking about the assaultrons face laser then yes it's infinite kill it before its used or when she stops get the fuck out of the way. To kill it you'll need a weapon that does a fuck ton of damage or a friend that does a fuck ton of damage.
---
It's not you.  Those assaultrons are scarousing devils.
---
The decorations have been up, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the last 26 years.  In other words, you are behind and better get going :)
---
Same thing happened to me. Had to log out and change servers.
---
Game seems to have major problems with projected lights. 
---
The Mothman fog machine, and the nuka cola lamp rarely if ever project their light properly in my camp.
---
Cant tell if it has anything to do with the camps size, my massive inventory, or both. 
---
I have a set up with several nuka cola doors hiding my vending machines with regular machines mixed in.  I placed a nuka cola light in the correct doorway to ensure people not familiar with said doors would have a clue to look a bit closer. But the dam thing only ever lit up the first day I placed it down.
---
Moving it, resetting it, or scrapping and replacing have all failed to make it activate properly. And mind you it is powered and lit just isn't projecting. 
---
Meanwhile my smoke machine which is like 5 floors up sometimes casts the weirdest lighting effects to every floor beneath it.
---
I got the planetarium to work like twice then it never would after that. Looks great when it is.
---
Saw a nifty trick that would be really cool for that device too.
---
Where you place it in a carpet and use the merge technique to get the carpet to sit much higher than the device, then place the carpet on the ceiling allowing the light to better cast to the entirety of a space from above without it being in the way.
---
Give me a min, I‚Äôll go to target and buy a PS4. /s
---
Reduce it to 5-7 chems in a minute and you should be good to go \^\^
---
The more you suffer from withdrawal, the more your enemies suffer from your bullets.
---
Shit
---
I‚Äôve got a few photos I‚Äôd love to use on a frameless canvas
---
The biggest issue would be that it would need to sync your photos with your camp assets everytime it loads in. I could see something messing up with that, even if it isn‚Äôt that complex
---
Pls add more decorations and costumes this year! My trap base must look pretty.
---
I just started playing about 2+ weeks ago, I wish this was a feature for sure! I think being able to build a camp is the coolest feature in the game tbh
---
I changed servers and saw reduced prices for weapons and armor.  Not sure why price wasn't lower before.
---
Oh that‚Äôs very motivational I like that ahahaha
---
Ah nuts lol
---
Personally i prefer carnivore over herbivore as it stacks quite well with my good doggy perk and cannibal perk. Never have to lug food around if I'm out of dog food just drop a body and  (* BAM *) instant food lol
---
BAHAHHAWHA
---
Since you should have strength, get a heavy energy weapon for those assaultrons.  Can you make x01 PA yet?
---
The light melee and RW stuff moves.
---
I still can't decide whether or not to get Ammo Factory. It'll come down to trying out Daily Ops - if it's possible for me to go into an Op and effectively generate a lot of ammo for a weapon then I might give Ammo Factory a miss.
---
Appreciate your answers,  very helpful!
---
Keep it, there may be some people who will want it
---
1 piece of TShooters armor.. a good TShooters weapon and leg shots.. all you need
---
Lmao Granddaddy Paindaddy.
---
I‚Äôll be adjusting prices then. I have 46 more guns to after today. Praise be RNG!
---
Western bundle is the only new thing today and it‚Äôs kinda whack tbqh
---
Dog Food is meat? Well shit.
---
I can taste the Laser Pain tbh.  You aren't the only one.
---
Exactly!!
---
Content is updated on Tuesday. So, same stuff as yesterday and the day before.
---
Yeah I didn't expect the +40% damage to apply to yourself as well, so that's pretty much a guaranteed take for me. I guess it's like the empath mutation applying to yourself as well.
---
You‚Äôre fighting top-of-the-line military hardware, there‚Äôs no shame in getting fried.
---
Hey I could take that J handmade off your hands if you'd like ;)
---
I decree, for the sake of Halloween, that they will forever hence forth be known as ghosts.
---
I‚Äôm haven‚Äôt been playing though ü•∫
---
I would love a mothman event.  It would be nice to have some kind of limited activity to do every 4-6 weeks or so.  I guess that‚Äôs more or less the idea behind the mole miner treasure hunters, but the week long events are my favorite.
---
I‚Äôm planning on using it.  Sorry bud!
---
Well, go play, and then you can see what's in the shop for yourself.
---
You forgot the cigarettes and hidden stash of vodka in the back.
---
Be aware, according to some videos, that it has a 5min cooldown (the icon apparently still pops up but nothing happens), and the DR/HP regain really isn't much.
---
Yeah that place.
---
Didn't do great, in about 4000 on weapons I only got a few that might hold some value and a solid bloodied Explosive Agility Handmade. I kinda regret going for the 3 stars  now, probably stick to 2 star pool for the rest of the weekend. Not one Fixer in all the roles (yes they were unlocked on all).
---
I'm just gonna help you out. Mothmen are just big ass moths that can teleport. That's it. Sorry for the spoiler but finding that out yourself like I did is much worse.
---
i AGREE, like even if it makes you wait how long it would normally take to craft all of them, id be fine with that too. almost like waiting for a day to pass using the waiting slider in nv or 3. it also would allow for some people who mass produce ammo, to save their buttons from 1000 clicks when you could do 5 clicks, slide the slider up with the analogue stick and be done after a short wait.   
---
like id love to set up a crafting queue, and go do the dishes or something.   
---
another thing id like to add, make it so if youre in range of certain crafting stations you have an option to access the other ones from the one you are at. just double down on the whole ease of access and ease of crafting.
---
It's definitely not like Skyrim where half the content is underground. I guess the vaults were supposed to be end-game dungeon raids but were taken out performance reasons or something, which will hopefully be remedied in the future. There are a number of mines that are depressing hell holes, some fun building interiors like West-Tek, and a few good quest-related interiors mostly added by Wastelanders, but for the most part the content is out in the open. It's a big map with distinct regions like Subnautica's biomes. The forest that you start out in is level-capped to make it suitable for low level characters, but the swamps, cranberry bog, toxic valley and ash heap feel very different and are more varied and challenging. The enemy variety improves a little as you level up too - you'll see new variants that you'd otherwise miss unless you're around a high level player. That aspect is a little like Borderlands.
---
Ah, there's the fickle reddit I know and love!  
---
*^(And cry about at night)*
---
Haha of course you are. Nice roll bud, congrats!
---
You unlock slots as you level. First one at 50, then another 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300, until you have 6 slots total, IIRC.
---
All legendary perks are available to take if you have a slot. They start at level 1 for free and you upgrade them with perk coins you get from scrapping perk cards (2 coins per star on the scrapped card).
---
Slots are account-wide too (if you have one level 300 character, all your others will have all 6 slots), but the perk coins to upgrade them are character specific.
---
Edit - I believe the perk upgrade costs are 50 for L2, 100 for L3, and 150 for L4, so a total of 300 perk coins to max out a card.
---
I could see them doing this where only the camp owner sees the pictures (because the data is local to you), and anyone else would see the generic image. Otherwise that's too much data to try and push to anyone who wanders into your camps proximity.
---
I love when lower level players clean out my vendors. I keep things priced very low even for rare gear and plans. I even keep useful mutation serums on hand for peeps who need them.  Annoyingly they tend to get bought out by flippers tho.  .o  ,
---
Find PaladinCiel on xbox and check out my Silent Hill camp too.  ^  o^
---
It‚Äôs definitely worth it if you have all 6 slots unlocked. It gives you 6 perk cards and the Auto Unlock on the level 0 locks/computers at the initial level. Most people aren‚Äôt going to have more than a few levels worth of perk coins so it‚Äôs a very solid card to take and focus on your other legendary abilities.
---
Ohh, ok good to know. That makes sense now that I think about it
---
I'm pretty sure they're a part of the "advanced power connectors" plan that you can get from BoS vendors (there should be one in Whitesprings and another in Watoga, maybe more)
---
As a melee build myself, I will say there are times when you just have to have a ballistic weapon.  I keep a troubleshooters handy for occasions like you describe. :)
---
Troubleshooters weapons are also useful for taking down strategic cargobots, which at L48,  if you have not done yet, you will be required to do so - likely in the near future.
---
The fallout universe is perfect for halloween. Imagine an event where you have to fight waves of ghosts, only to find they come from an early prototype of the big MT holograms or something.
---
Yeah I would have died if this had rolled quad or bloodied. I'll prob stash it and keep my fingers crossed for someone out there looking for one.
---
Do a shotgun build and get the gauss shotgun at the Foundation (mod the hell out of it) robots, wendigos, supermutants will fear you üòÄ
---
I'm on xbox, next time I'm on I'll let you know how many I have. I rarely use them
---
Again, I know that and I don't. However getting skins is fun, they're not worth $5.
---
 I'd like to support content but not shitty business practices.
---
Oof if they could like merge it with a kitchen counter that'd be nice, currently I use the chem station as a counter but it's not tall enough
---
In Fo4 there was a rug that would change the spawn point of your settlement. The reason they probably haven‚Äôt implemented this is because you‚Äôd be able to send players tumbling off a cliff pretty easily, but that happens enough anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è maybe they should just make it so we don‚Äôt take fall damage for maybe 15 seconds after fast traveling
---
Be nice if they made the chainsaw an actual weapon that can be legendary and what not.
---
Sounds really likely
---
Lots of people frustrated that nukes don't work
---
If you put it up as a post you can probably get an offer, just don‚Äôt take a low cap amount it‚Äôs still E25 even if it‚Äôs noctournal
---
They're in the middle of the Wastelanders questline, they don't have access to Gold Bullion items.
---
Because time in the game passes at a far greater rate than the real world. One minute in the real world is 20 minutes in game. So that means that in about two and a half weeks, a full year would pass in game. 
---
Let me put this into perspective for you:
---
Around about May 2022, Roger Maxson will pass away. 
---
Around August 2023, the Vault Dweller emerges from Vault 13 to go find the water chip. (Fallout 1)
---
Around August 2027, the Chosen One sets out to find the GECK. (Fallout 2)
---
Around June 2029, the Lone Wanderer leaves Vault 101. (Fallout 3). Three months later, The Courier encounters Benny. (FO:NV). A few months later, The Sole Survivor merges from Vault 111. (Fallout 4)
---
And just like that, we‚Äôve run through the entirety of Fallout‚Äôs timeline in less than ten years. 
---
The theme of FO76 is ‚Äòwhat came before the original stories‚Äô. So trying to force an accelerated timeline would pretty much butcher that.
---
I'm waiting for legendary perks üéâüéâüéâthen I get back on
---
 "He looks at me with his stupid bear face"    That's funny.
---
I was very pleased, for sure.  I got a selection of godroll guns for a junkie rifleman in all of 20 minutes.  Too bad p22 is going live in a few days.  The handmade will still be fine, but it‚Äôs a shame the hunting rifle and gauss will turn into garbage.
---
Here have an award for asking about an award.
---
Full-on Assaultron blasts will wreck you pretty much regardless of build and level, so run away and duck behind cover until it's over. There's a long windup that lets you know when it's time to head for the hills. The beam is also way easier to avoid once the assaultron is stuck crawling, so sneak and lead with leg shots as people have mentioned. That cuts out her melee attack too.
---
Edit - Just noticed you're a melee build, it's tough to target limbs in melee. My melee guy is a commando hybrid so I usually lead with my fixer against those things.
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
Thought level 48 should be enough to get to that stage?üôÑ
---
Thank fucking god cause I missed it last time.
---
Is the trip wire you speak of the laser one? I thought you meant the wire trip at Camden park. Looks like fishing line and a reel in a small box.
---
This works in glassed caverns too. ;)
---
Did you read any part of their post??
---
Yeah just give immunity frames or something till everything is spawned in.  Or limit how close traps are allowed to be to them, and cliffs.
---
It's a good practice usually to not move an inch till your sure everything has finished loading. 
---
Really I'd be okay with being downed by some trap camps if it means people can more easily control their visitors experience for the better.  
---
Would save me a ton of space in camp budget too.
---
I need better self control. I have held off on all other quests but Morgantown I always do before 50.
---
Yes, it's a powered camp object. We can't build any other kind of tripwires.
---
Nukes are down, no dailys, everyone's just waiting in the next patch to bring some more content. I know my play time has fallen off a lot this week
---
Im taking a little  break, waiting for seasson 2.
---
Agreed here.
---
Since we're not being given the ability to change the sickly green light color of the Pip-Boy I have to wear one of the helmets. The Secret Service helmet is perfect for this in brightness and color in the way of points. Looks amazing.
---
Can we?

I see a few issues with this:
---
1 - The photos would need to be uploaded to some server to be downloaded by other players who visit your CAMP, and if a lot of people use this feature that's a lot of images being uploaded/downloaded to people's systems, on a regular basis (every time you visit a CAMP with such images).
---
2 - At least on PC, there's no way to be certain the image is actually a screenshot from Fallout 76. People could put other images (say, pornography) in their screenshot folder and then use this images in their CAMP.
---
I'm guessing #2 is most likely the biggest reason we won't ever see this feature.
---
I launched my first (and only nuke) at 306. Am now 386 haha
---
People will still miss it LOL
---
That‚Äôs a solid 50cal.  I wouldn‚Äôt be sad about that at all.  The LMG is decent, too.  
---
The best part about those is you can use them without a shred of doubt that they‚Äôre legit and you earned them fair and square by saving up scrip.
---
Same here. I've been playing a few hours here, a few hours there. I feel pretty lucky to miss out on all the frustration and being stuck in an Earl/Queen grind loop. At that point I'll move on to something else.
---
That didn‚Äôt happen to me. Mine was completely gone. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Nukes are down and there's no dailies.
---
Nope!
---
Nice videos, time stamps might help for those looking for your special build/mutations. subscribed..
---
That is a fantastic idea.
---
I see. I tried to connect the trap. You are correct easy to connect on mesh wire. But, it can't be placed where I want to use it. So finnicky. I do want to try that contraption of yours. See what fun things I can make. Thank you again! See you in the wasteland!
---
Are you sure you‚Äôre not Wanted?
---
We can definitely bring this up in our next meeting!
---
I rage-rebuilt my camp last night (after the nuke debacle). I still have some work to do...but definitely not hardcore playing right now.
---
I'm kind of in the same boat as you. Instead of focussing on one character I've decided to make a bunch of different ones but I'm kind of stuck because it takes too long to level any one of them and it's a bit boring to do so because I really like to wander around (and sometimes while over encumbered). I have a level 70 something that I wanted to be a sniper but tried respeccing about a year ago and messed all of his stats up, a level 46 unarmed wolverine type of character, a level 30-ish junkie mutant cannibal raider shotgunner (which is the most fun to play imo) and a mid level 20's power armored tank that focusses on explosives. (Honestly he's the most boring to play as because at that point in the game there's not that much explosive ammunition and all of my desired cards are locked behind level 40-50). I just can't find the time nor the endurance to try and level all of these characters up to 50 to get the right attributes and cards so I can mess around with various play styles. I wish the game had a more robust respeccing system in place, because quite honestly it's draining to try and level all of these characters at once. I haven't played recently because I'm waiting for One Wasteland to come out so I hope they made power leveling a bit more fun, otherwise I might just have to stick to my shotgunner going forward because leveling the others seems like a slog.

 &gt; We can definitely bring this up in our next meeting!
---
I don't know what's worse - That Halloween is cancelled for some people... or that Halloween is cancelled for *some* people.
---
I‚Äôm certain you can still get a very nice trade for a b/e lever gun, especially a legit, non duped one.  Just about anything short of a j/e/90 50 cal or b/25/25 fixer.
---
Honestly, the Fixer was duped so hard you could probably get one of those.
---
1) are you wearing veil. If no put it on. 
---
2) if yes, step back. Let it turn purple. Take off. Wait 5 seconds. Put back on. Approach lasers. 
---
3) if this doesn‚Äôt work, try turning it off and on again and submitting a ticket.
---
I have a chainsaw.
---
A headless horseman that terrorizes the woods around there during Halloween time would be cool.
---
I must have bought yours for 500 yesterday.  Thanks, I only that the suit.
---
The Classic Western Bundle came in today and wasn‚Äôt in there yesterday. It has but 21 hours left. Yesterday  was the Fly Boy Bundle. 
---
While the majority of the shop stays the same throughout the week, there are often additions throughout the week as well.
---
It‚Äôs all random dude. They aren‚Äôt upping the rate of anything.
---
What happens if your mules are all level 5s
---
No everyone‚Äôs celebrating Halloween this year. Everyone who decided we need to shut everything down and wear masks are the ones saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt cancel my Halloween‚Äù
---
Honestly I just open youtube in the background and listen to whatever it recommends me. I found some fantastic songs through it!
---
Thanks for the great write-up.  I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to try a new build and get out of my current comfort zone.  Looking forward to Junkie.
---
How dare people have different work schedules than me? They should simply quit their jobs and stop whining.
---
Great, you're one of the good ones. Cheers!
---
Anyone know of good videos to learn from on how to build camps like this???
---
My friend and I have had conversations about this!
---
The little caps I make are from selling guns. In charisma there's a bargain perk that gets you a little more. The uranium-fever event gives a bunch of weapons to sell as long as you get a hit on the mole miners. Grape mentats help a little too
---
Yeah mine too
---
Assaultrons are dicks, it's not just you !
---
I pissed off the ones at whitesprings earlier and even at my level, one of those laser beams to my ass can almost kill me.
---
A larger scrip number would affect server load a lot less than the 15 different legendaries in my stash
---
You‚Äôll have access to a very limited range of lvl 5 weapons.  Pipe guns, hunting rifle, pump shotgun, 44 and 10mm pistol is pretty much it for ranged weapons.  I think leather is the only armor type available at lvl 5.
---
Do Uranium Fever, loot all the weapons and sell them. Set up water purifiers and sell them to NPC vendors. Have Hard Bargain perk maxed out and equipped while you sell anything. 
---
Google where the cap stashes are. Make sure you have taken a caps bobblehead to increase the amount of the caps you get from said stashes.
---
I would love a group of bloated/glowing gouls chasing me in the monster mash event mask
---
How very dare you!
---
I always crouch (with light footed) because I'm afraid of traps üòÇ
---
Build as many large water purifiers as you can as soon as you can. Vendors buy purified water for 5 caps each. A single large purifier can generate 5 waters in about 30min or so.
---
PA is already strong and easy to get this shit will make it absolutely broken XD
---
Great idea!
---
What is considered a "secondary" account?
---
OMG yes.  If I see a legendary one, I swap to my backup shishkebab to minimize the odds that I‚Äôll VATS kill it as it tunnels into the ground.
---
I did a workshop defense at Hemlock Holes yesterday and got four legendary mole rats out of three waves.  It was impressive.
---
Turn Valley Galleria into a PVPfest for Black Friday.
---
An account that you own in addition to your primary account.
---
The most common reason would be a muling account for storage or transferring items among your primary account characters.
---
I have an account and my son has an account but I paid for both.. so..? We log in from the same IP address and sometimes at the same time..
---
This seems like a broad and baseless generalization.
---
Most people I know have cancelled Halloween plans, and I live in one of the more quarantined states. 
---
I don't think I've heard a single person who is social distancing/mask wearing say "You can't cancel my Halloween." - at best I've heard "Maybe we can still do trunk or treat?"
---
Level 100, unless they capped them to 50 in the latest PTS patch.
---
Lvl 100 rats should not exist.
---
I would expect that this would be unenforceable.
---
That worked, you're a hero of the people. Thank you. Even though the menu runs at 1300fps, its still good I guess? :D
---
Yep. I run PA heavy gunner with Vampire‚Äôs Gatling plasma. My health rarely ever drops below 75%. I don‚Äôt t see why bloodied build is so big. Sure you can one shot a lot of things but literally anything can one shot you
---
I have done the event over 50 times at least and have never failed it. Do you not get to complete it often?
---
I‚Äôm wondering if this is doable in mod form. 
---
ESO has an addon (a mod) that something very similar with their housing. A paper people can sign that floats on the floor. The need to have the mod too, but at least it opens up an option where the devs fall short.
---
I would imagine so
---
I'd buy that instantly!
---
I did a Wendigo Colossus event this afternoon, so somebody must have dropped a nuke. Maybe they fixed the bug.
---
Troubleshooter, anti armor, and or instigating weapons are your friend here.  Also, if you have any magazines thatbreduce damage dealt by robots is a plus. Try to get a sneak crit if possible. Crouch and cut its freaking legs off.   If your a one handed melee and you've donebthe order of mysteries questline, the Blade of Bastet is definitely your friend in this scenario.    But as previously stated, assaultrons are devilish beasts and that face laser melts most players/builds.
---
We're you up at the sunny top monument by chance? (or what ever its called I think in close though haha)
---
It‚Äôs made of dog
---
Well said, couldn't agree more.
---
Subscribed.
---
If it‚Äôs any consolation, the weapon could only have been lvl 20 at best.  Glowing mole rats are lvl 21.  Enemy level dictates item level.
---
It‚Äôs still 40 scrip, so it‚Äôs sad in that regard.
---
Omg you really need that black Easter egg!

This needs attention. Great ideas in here.

I have signs in my camp that are pro trump and anti-BLM (I‚Äôm not against the movement I‚Äôm against the organization) and will that be bannable as I‚Äôve seen many anti trump and pro China (not jokes like actually being against the Hong Kong protests) and I‚Äôm curious as to if I will be banned over the signs in my camp under the new ToS, and if I should remove them so as to prevent a ban.
---
Um yea? I've found them all the other day
---
I logged on for the first time in a month yesterday. I saw this and was like oh man what‚Äôs going on now.
---
mashed tatos? you do realize that tatos are basically tomatoes right? in that sense what you be effectively making by mashing them is tato soup or IRL tomato soup. Now if they added a radioactive potato into the game them we can have mashed WhatevertheFlup
---
Weird 
---
I'll have to try again.
---
While you're at it, give us the option to rate posters and picture frames on the walls.  Why does everything have to be perfectly straight?
---
They could let us use the personal terminal to leave messages.
---
YES! and I'm gonna try to merge it with something to look like it's hatching üòÅ
---
Yes!  That would be so fun!
---
I was thinking you could put a bunch in your camp. Creepy!
---
Yeah they're absolute shit. I've only received generalized automated responses for every support ticket I've ever submitted. 
---
At the bottom of the email they send you it says if they don't hear back within 4 days they'll assume it was resolved. Even if you reply to that email there's no personalized response.
---
I can only assume it's like that because of the MASSIVE number of people that experience game-breaking issues. "If you cant help everyone, why help one person?"
---
Get large water purifier plan.  Find a nice camp spot with water source.  Put down some purifiers.  Sale to train vendors. Profit.
---
I sell ammo for 1 or 2 caps max, though maybe I should raise my plasma core prices...
---
That is true. I‚Äôve heard some strange information with how the scaling works, so I lowballed it to be safe.
---
collect everything. sell everything you don't need. sell unused ammo in your vendor. nearly all ammo sells for 1 cap each. don't bother with nukes or missiles. too heavy. 
---
sell excess junk. people LOVE junk in vendors. i buy nearly every bit of junk i see in vendors unless it is **really** overpriced. You'll learn what is popular the more you play. 
---
Also. the more you play the easier it is to make caps. You can only hold a max of 30000 caps and i am constantly hitting that or getting very closer.
---
They have the skin and stem of tomatoes but the flesh is like a potato.
---
&gt;Sure you can one shot a lot of things but literally anything can one shot you
---
no if you know what you are doing
---
The other day I killed a scorchbeast as it was swooping into a crop dust.  That thing probably landed in Canada.  It ricocheted off the ground so hard and bounced into lower orbit.
---
Only when you run into someone using broken weapons. Most PvP I've done I have not had that issue but if they do break out a broken gun I just move on.
---
I've played since the beta and I didn't even like PvP then and I never saw it as an issue in the game. PvP adds an element of the wasteland being a scary place that you are trying to survive because the PvE is just so easy. I remember taking the time to hide my camp so it was protected, navigating the map to avoid players and the tension of running up on another player. That stare that both players would do waiting to see if they would leave or shoot was great.
---
One time, my buddies gf had her base attacked and she was killed by these 2 dudes so we quickly stashed our junk and joined up with her to fight them off. We chased them back to their base, killed them then leveled their camp until they left the sever then joined her in rebuilding. It was by far one of the greatest stories I have in the game and that was during a time we wanting nothing to do with PvP.
---
Another story, back in the day player raiders were bad enough that a new group was formed by players and they were pretty much the minute men of 76. If you were faced with a player raider and wanted help all you needed to do was message them. Soon an army of players would come and guard your camp and fight them off. It was amazing to see this just naturally happen within the game with zero scrip.
---
PvP brought out the worst AND the best in players and just added to the roleplaying and atmosphere of the wasteland.
---
Now the game is way to safe. I walk the wasteland like a god even soloing imposter sheepsquatch with ease with power armor and a vamp mini gun. The wasteland does not feel scary, its a playground for me to murder everything.
---
Because of all the PvP nerfs, that's when I'll admit, I started building trap bases and killing anyone at workshops because I'm still so bitter that people could not let 76 be something different with the license. So many just had to push to make it just like the other fallouts as much as possible when 76 was never meant to be like the other fallouts. It was originally a survival light type game, hence why ever since the PvP nerfs the game seems confused and lost, most notably the workshops and wanted system which was a great system to prevent griefers and allow players to self police.
---
PvP was never that bad, was easy to avoid if you treated it as a threat and created some of the best memories I have in this game.
---
Sadly, players used to playing single players games just could not accept it and practically removed an entire play style from the game. If they removed most of the PvE content and replaced it with all PvP how would you feel? That is how the PvP crew feels. Once a way of playing just slowly takin away all because other players didn't like it even though it was never forced and easily avoidable.
---
As for Nuclear Winter, while it is PvP its not the same. You don't get to use the equipment you have fought hard for, the build, the fluidness of going from PvE to PvP in a moments notice, the added fear and atmosphere and most importantly the amazing stories it helped create that actually made it feel like a hostile wasteland.
---
So hopefully that helps explain why PvP was / is / should be in 76, not just nuclear winter at least and of course my opinion. I mean I just had my based destroyed twice in one night with explosive bait, so what did I do? Shot them in the face and fixed my camp which has a maxed out budget, traps that are expensive to fix and my rad shower. Didn't get mad just got even and I've mostly been a PvE player my whole life. Its a game about a post nuclear wasteland, its supposed to be rough out there.
---
This will be 100x worse in 1 wasteland
---
i mean i can understand being short staffed or technical issues or if they cant resolve the problem but the least you can do is fucking respond to me... even a simple 'hey were working on a fix but dont have one yet' would make me feel better than total silence and ignoring me for a week
---
That would be perfect.
---
What happened with the nukes?
---
Hi gamer karen. I'm glad you're content not allowing people to have fun events because your personal life might prohibit you from playing. "if i miss out, then you all should too"
---
What a selfish attitude.
---
Grab all the ammo you see.  Ammo is something you see early, and people are always using it.  I always pick up all the ballistic ammo and shells I see and toss them on my vendor.  The rest of them can get heavy otherwise.  I basically look at each ammo as 0.9 caps instead of just ammo since I sell it for 1 cap per round. 
---
Another good one is that Super Mutants and Ghouls are a regular source of caps.  Not always, but often enough.  
---
Quests and events aren't going to be a lot, but it's consistent.  Research rewards because some events have rewards at any level that people will spend top dollar on.  I recently got my hands on an outfit from a Mire event that I turned around and sold for 20k that same day.
---
At a low level it's just a matter of slogging along.  Selling for 1400 per day will be your biggest source of income unless you find something really sweet to sell.
---
Wait I missed the Flyboy bundle?  Dang.
---
is that Fallout 1st stuff? I was on the Atom Shop last night and didn't see a Fly Boy bundle.
---
I ran into some at the Flooded Train Yard.  It was the worst encounter I‚Äôve ever had in two years of playing the game, hands down.
---
I need some money, ‚Äúloan wonderer‚Äù
---
I've had that event trigger for me..very interesting trying to get a quick shot in on everything before they are wiped out..its a big mess in the end animal remains everywhere
---
I'm level 200+ and I get shredded by them in power armor still, so it's not just you.
---
It's the worst being hit by them while trying to reload a weapon. They hit so hard and fast that it stuns you out of the reload animation. Then you're just stuck in a loop of taking damage without being able to shoot back.
---
Usually when I go on a griefing spree I can clear a server in 20 minutes.
---
SERIOUSLY THOUGH!
---
First time, understandable. Second time you're just SoL lol
---
all I imagine is how much shit it would break...
---
If you see a camp selling a bunch of mutation serums for under 500 each, buy all you can. You can flip them at NPC vendors for up to 500 with high Charisma. This is why they're selling them so low, they get a quick cap infusion and you get an easy profit.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this is really about having multiple accounts under different identities. Which is what a lot of dupers and exploiters tend to do.
---
POWEEERRRRRR!
---
This is my first Purveyor sale, and I've been saving up to make sure I have all 1k to spend on it.  I even spent 9k to buy a fixer pattern to make sure it's in my pool.
---
Yea like Halloween decorations are everywhere in FO4, and there‚Äôs the pumpkin house in 76. 
---
They can add a whole big event around the pumpkin house for Halloween. Tons of pumpkin related food recipes, pumpkin armor sets and outfits, costumes, camp decorations. 
---
So much can be done with Halloween(my favorite holiday), and it would makes sense for the lore.
---
29th. "Hey guys here is some pumpkins"
---
31st. Annnnnd its gone.
---
They get easier as you refine your build..assualtrons and Sargent gutys use to be very o.p to me but easy work now.its all in the build.spec to be good at 1 weapon only.commando , rifleman  or heavy the rest falls in place
---
Lol no. Not everyone can get on Sundays. Just raise the limit and have it apply every single day. It‚Äôs so restricting it actually discourages people from playing the game.
---
It was on the last tab of the store.  Not sure if it only shows up for 1st subscribers.  Do you see the Western Bundle today?
---
You can still fix it. Just move around the camp machine until you like where the spawn point is.
---
I wonder if it's just a bunch of spawn points wigging out and throwing everything together
---
I completely agree. It would be nice to have some peace of mind knowing you were heard. I've had more luck coming on this sub and getting help from the community. 
---
It seems to me that the fo76 community cares for one another far more the the dev team cares about their player base.
---
would love something like this
---
that beeing said, it took the devs around a year to come up with a handfull of legendary perks, (a good chunk of them beeing essentialy the same thing for different weapons)
---
i cant imagine them creating a perk for every weapon as nice as it would be
---
Well, it just works.
---
*shrug*
---
Will have to check once I get home.
---
How do you do that "circular" build? I ran into something a month or so ago that looked very similar to this and was trying to figure out what sort of exploit was used (I assumed exploit since the graphics were all screwed up around the base with textures jittering all over the place).
---
I've been playing since launch and I play every day and every server is as busy as any day.
---
I believe Bethesda disabled nukes for that reason so that we can all take a moment and relax, BOS is done, Legendary run is done they are telling us to sit the fuck down lol
---
Like my cats anus, for those not sure what he is getting at.
---
Subscribed, I like this approach
---
But if you can make it to the bulletin board....you're not stuck in the foundation....
---
At some point, not sure if it's level or caps related, fast travel becomes a lot more expensive. You can run the travel agent perk to help with that, or consider playing without fast travel for a while, though that slows down how quickly you can complete quests by a lot and they're a good source of income. It's a little tedious with the extra load screen but if traveling to your camp or Vault 76 for free gets you closer to where you want to go it can save a fair amount. Joining a public team turns your teammate's camps into additional free fast travel locations.
---
Keep an eye out for plastic that you can use to bulk up your excess junk. Most junk can't be sold to vendors unless it's in bulk form. I haven't really gotten into crafting other things from my excess materials but I know some plans let you craft expensive armor pieces from common materials that can then be sold to vendors.
---
I usually scrap all the weapons and armor I loot for steel, plastic, and learning mods, but they can be sold instead.
---
Sell your excess chems. They tend to build up to ludicrous amounts in your inventory over time, just weighing you down when they are worth a fair amount. I've heard Pharma Farmer is pretty lucrative if you've got room for it in your build. You can swap it out for bloody mess when you're about to enter a more difficult combat situation.
---
Glowing meat is worth a decent amount once you cook it, so be sure to loot that and roast it up, preferably with the Super Duper perk equipped.
---
If your camp is near water you can build a ton of water purifiers and sell that to vendors.
---
As a low level you won't have many things that other people will want to buy, except for chems and ammo, so be sure to stock your excess. The ammo converter has something like a 1:4 ratio of sell to buy cost for everything so you are better off selling your unused (but useful, no one wants to buy missiles or mini nukes) ammos to other players, then buying what you need from them if they're listing it for a good price (1 cap each for most ammos). I always stock up on shotgun shells if they're at 1 cap each, haven't had to do a Lucky Hole Mine run yet with that character.
---
Yes and it should be delivered by Kevin Costner!
---
I have a mental image of a Morlock , demanding some sort of offering . Can‚Äôt wait ! Think i‚Äôll have a look at New Vegas as well now thanks.
---
I see Infiltrator as a bit of a waste, when you consider the combat value of other perks.  Outside of v94, which is irrelevant now, or maybe a silo speed run, there‚Äôs no pressing need to open or hack anything.
---
For me, food buffs are way, way too valuable to consider Survival Shortcut.  If I‚Äôm going to be perpetually maintaining cranberry relish and brain bombs during a season, I‚Äôm going to stay well fed the whole time.  After doing a session‚Äôs worth of events and dailies, I‚Äôm usually throwing away 40-50 purified water.
---
Both are very casual and QoL, which is fine, but I personally see no logical reason to opt for them when you only have six slots to utilize.
---
2nd one seems easily fixable if Bethesda just ran it through their own system/program rather than drop them in a accessible folder. Rockstar does this with their emblem editor and it‚Äôs been a well-liked feature for casual artists too.
---
I know they won‚Äôt, but it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard thing.
---
For it to unlock and drop for you you must learn the plans
---
I could add a light in a helmet with an emitter and 2 lines of code in well under 5 minutes.
---
Especially since the code exists in other meshes, you could even cut and paste it.
---
I thought ammo factory was a no brainer, but I‚Äôve changed my mind. I think I‚Äôll use it on an alternate character and use my main for maxed out specials and damage perks. Even shying away from funky duds at this point, which I was really looking forward to.  I like killing more than I dislike dying.
---
I wouldn't doubt it but if it was a random encounter it was definitely one of the more memorable ones.
---
Or a Halloween Eyebot, who wants to go for trick or treat with you, causing havoc around the Whitespring. And on top of it - a boss fight against a legendary sentry bot
---
You need the plan learned on a character to have a chance for Fixer drops...not just finishing the quests. It is a bummer. Good luck in your hunt.
---
Useless junk....
---
Thanks I‚Äôll do that right now!
---
Gotta learn the plan 1st.i never got it to spawn for me after doing encrypted about 10 times so I caved and bought one for 8k caps months ago
---
After all, Halloween is meant to have bugs. Play to your strength.
---
Thanks will try it right now!
---
How would you eliminate supporting structures? Every time I try to do that with just basic square rooms and stairs, it blocks me. LOL
---
Thanks man
---
Floor foundation plus door way wall
---
Move foundation wall stays
---
I use a floating dome each time as a reference point even if I'm not using the dome *great template*
---
Pc
---
After i got my hands on armor piercing plasma flamer i laugh at those things. Fear no more!
---
Honestly, just more silly hats in general!
---
It‚Äôs free.
---
Well - if they would allow cross save then I wouldn't have a secondary account to begin with...
---
Or how about a gang of glowing undead murder clowns chasing you in the Whitesprings nuke zone
---
How long did that take you?I was so happy when I finished my 1st nuke ...probably took me over 2 hours...i had to work for that 1st nuke wasn't prepared at all i used all my .45 and 5.56 in the end i got through with a damn assultron blade!
---
Too low of a chance for me to care when I already never go below half HP anyway.
---
What? I never said that. The sentiment was that things shouldn't be time gated or set on certain times so everyone can have access. You're the one that is content with people missing out because of the uncontrollable circumstances of their day to day lives.
---
thanks a lot i appreciate it üëçüèº
---
with halloween most likely canceled due to covid-19, i honestly hope bethesda goes all out this year
---
This is laughable and will not hold up in any court, for older accounts.
---
Only if your camp is in the middle of a lake.
---
Yea i have had happen often in that spot biggest group i saw was like 20 rag stags and a few yao guai this is where i farmed leather for atlas so im pretty sure its a bunch of spawn points
---
Damn. It was hard enough completing it yesterday. Oh well gotta farm the event. Thanks for the reply :)
---
while naked?
---
That sucks. Thanks for the answer lol.
---
Switch server next time.  I start with 2 items.  If they start with a nocturnal or some other really useless affix I swap servers and try again.   
---
Or I‚Äôll go a legendary farm real quick and see what type of drops I‚Äôm getting first.  
---
I know it‚Äôs all RNG but this seems to help somewhat.
---
Good luck!
---
People may frown on this but flip other peoples vendor items for more to earn a profit.  But you have to be smart about what you flip.  Magazines can sell from anywhere between 50 to 100 caps each.  If you find someone selling them for 10 caps buy them and resell.  Same with bobbleheads.  Ive seen them sell for 50 caps before but they will fly out of your vendors for 100 caps.  If you get really lucky you can find rare items that people either dont know what they have or just dont care.  I found a BOS jumpsuit for 10 caps at a vendor one time, and flipped it for 20k caps a week later.  Faschnaut masks sell god too. If you can find them for under 50 caps you can flip them for 100 to 150 easily.  Bloodied and Junkie weapons sell better than most other weapons and you can get anywhere from 2500 to 4000 depending on the type of weapon and its effects.  Personally I love to collect and sell the rare outfits so I am always vendor hopping looking for a score.
---
Yes, I've had this happen yesterday and today.  It's a real thing.  I'm running on PC/Steam.  As Fallout 1st is only on one platform or another, I can't resort to using my Bethesda client to work around this.
---
I got one to drop for me from completing the quest so I thought that would make it so I could get it but oh well. Thanks for the reply :)
---
I kind of thought the same thing. However I used to run with Mysterious Savior and I definitely miss it sometimes. And seeing as power sprinter and electrical absorption aren‚Äôt very important, at all, I might as well go for it and die even less than I already do, ya know?
---
That would be dope af! Wish everything didn‚Äôt break in 76
---
Good to know it works somewhere,lol, thanks!
---
Nobody has ever said they hated chewing gum or placing the door to get atoms we love easy ways to get out of them's I don't know what you're talking about
---
So with the +5 SPECIAL legendary perks (used to be +4?) you can have up to 30 additional SPECIAL. That's useful because you can then max out five of the stats rather than the previous three without any legendary perks.
---
I would have assumed that the dirt tiles were specifically for crops only.
---
I recommend moving a few more points into Luck to run Ricochet. It's not great because it doesn't have a huge chance of proccing, but when you're running thru a wall of bullets it's amazing how many things just bounce right off you. Try it out in a nuke silo, it's hilarious when multiple laser turrets and Assaultrons are spamming at you and can't do anything.
---
Legendary perks are going to be a gamechanger, coming Tuesday!
---
Can you?   I‚Äôve heard this asked before and never saw an answer.    Do u have a source for this?
---
I usually wear power armor when fast traveling to peoples camps for this reason. The camp also takes a while to load in, and depending on how its set up the fast travel spawn point might be high above the ground, so you start falling as soon as you spawn in.
---
JES2R? I love seeing him at Freddy's House of Fear, reminds me of Mischief Night everytime.
---
In my opinion, best event ever! Looking forward to it again this year. üëªüéÉ
---
Yeah, my budget is pretty much spent...I‚Äôll try getting rid of somethings or just wait for the shelters...thanks for the input!
---
just spent 5000 scrip and probably got 4 or 5 guns i could sell. Might make aboot 40k
---
Really is...
---
Daddy?!
---
That's something I noticed, too: nobody seems to join events at the moment. Often I am alone and even if some are doable, it's often not too much fun. I am still collecting treasury notes and haven't achieved full settlers reputation ... So I get the stolen hardware every day and take a picture of Meg at Crater ;)
---
Pick and sell all the crops from every camp you come across. Use the green thumb perk to get 2x the yield when picking them. Also sell all the water you can get from camps you visit. Between crops and water it will more than make up for what you spend traveling around while vendor hopping.
---
Well in this one you spawn in on the ground but they put their vendors up high on catwalks.  Thought it strange so I didn‚Äôt go up there.  It disappeared and I thought they put the camp elsewhere but maybe not.  Was just strange placement and circumstances I guess
---
Wow!
---
The only thing good about turrets is the camp budget you save not using them.
---
This is the sole reason I hang on to plasma grenades. The Colonel Kelly Monument is great for it.
---
Could you people stop trying to kill the engine?
---
Me too...
---
The entire Midwest is like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt cancel my Halloween‚Äù and that‚Äôs where I live
---
I bought a one X because of that event. Well, that wasn‚Äôt the only reason, but it pushed me over the edge.
---
I kinda assumed that was the case but that still doesnt mean there can't be a questline devoted to them or the cultists for that matter.
---
My wife and I were in the same boat, but eventually we caved now we are having a great time with the game. Still not prefect but it is fun.
---
Yeah, it's definitely the better of the three, at least at face value. Angry Turtle tested the Electrical Absorption perk and it will heal you when it procs, but this might be a bug which could get fixed. Could be useful against the Impostor Sheepsquatch.
---
Fast traveled to a camp to shop and found turrets spraying graham, which caused him to get angry and tenderize a mineral extractor, the turrets and a wall. When I wall said and done I thought I might be able to get a mirror ball plan but I couldn't interact with him. He was stuck in a voice line loop.
---
God fuckin damnit, the only reason 8 was saving up scrip
---
We totally need a white old-school hockey mask. I want to summon the spirit of Jason Voorhees (Or at least his mom)
---
Me and you both friend
---
I am a sort cheap vendor and i know people like YOU are the reason I always have caps and inventory room. I consider myself a wholesaler. No time to distinguish in rarity. I have what i want and need and love searching for wjat i want in spawn. Sincerely thank you.
---
OP: what system are you on? Ill hook you up with some starter caps if you're down on some
---
Awesome Chest Ahead
---
Try Both Hands
---
Time For Crab
---
They should also make it permanently dark for the whole of Halloween to add to the spookiness
---
Is there a way to find out which plans you know and which ones you still need? I'm *pretty sure* I got the Fixer plans from a player vendor surprisingly cheaply, but I can't remember for certain...
---
So, Bethesda support is useless. Anything new?
---
You wanna try to put a clown costume on a feral? Be my guest... Sounds like a good way to get your nuts bit off if you ask me.
---
(I actually love this idea. Lol)
---
I give stuff away frequently plans are free and everything 1/2 off the estimated price. On Xbox Palms 234 feel free to drop by. I'm mostly selling scrap and meds right now as thats mostly of what I have. I think I got alot of ammo too.
---
As a carnivore I make lots of tasty squirrel stew . I'll trade ya intestines for Squirrel bits. Just kiddin- I make Fasnacht sausage also. Its awesome!
---
I visited an interesting one that's built over the tracks near Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast. It wasn't particularly high up, but that spot seems to be guaranteed to spawn a pair of high level yao guais. I've died there enough times that I carefully killed them before entering the camp, but sure enough, it disappeared while I was shopping dropping me into what would have been a valley of death.
---
They haven‚Äôt been in previous discount sales either
---
And you're really going to go to court over a Fallout 76 account?
---
Shouldve donated some explosive bait to the camp
---
Lucky you then, happens to everyone else that does it though.
---
They gave the atoms to me.  Will see what happens this month.
---
Well, that's why I excluded The Forest from the list. I figure the Poseidon power plant is far enough from most of the low level areas it wouldn't be to hard to avoid, and it doesn't have to be a normal sized nuke zone either.
---
The other areas are SUPPOSED to be dangerous. I was thinking level buffs and stuff for the enemies affected.
---
OK...this is actually impressive.
---
You rock, thank you!
---
We also need more radstorms, and longer ones too
---
Bethesda Please.

Sweet! My tag is Legit Rando. HMU.
---
Happened to me today, logged on for the first time in a couple of days and there was nobody else in my session for a good half hour or so. Even when I logged off there were only two others. I think it's because nukes are broken currently.
---
 That means once I level up one more time I‚Äôll have two slots cool
---
yes you can get both.
---
They are real, Scully... they are real!!!
---
Alcohol, Daddy-O, Daytripper, Mentats &amp; Psycho for a rifle/commando.
---
Instigating explosive lever action with +1 E and armor piercing vats plasma pistol with 10% damage increase while aiming. Going to turn plasma into flamer and bust some robot asses :D
---
Some gear the level maxes at 45 some at 50. So for example you‚Äôll never get a level 50 handmade as they go up on the 5‚Äôs and you‚Äôll never get a level 45 fixer as they go up on the even 10‚Äôs
---
I‚Äôm still hoping nuclear proliferation is fixed and re-activated. They said in a patch notes that they pulled it to fix a bug and it still isn‚Äôt back.
---
Its been kinda empty last week or two it seems for me.  I‚Äôm assuming most people finished the SCOrE and are now waiting for something new.  
---
Nukes being down also playing role most likely.
---
Based on what Bethesda has said and people playing on the PTS have said and shown. As for Season 1, it's over, if you did not claim the rewards, you can't anymore.
---
I reached the enclave for the first time while being level 120 and at the same time just met the raiders and settlers leaders. Hahahahaha. Now I'm 135 and still need to launch a nuke and deliver my nuka cola my blood's in it.
---
How do you have 5k scrip?
---
And no stimpack cost.

---
Maybe if you showed her more respect, she would give you better items.
---
I have a chainsaw
---
What I would love to see but I doubt is feasible, is seasonal changes to terrain. Like during the winter the map is covered in snow in some places, during autumn trees in the forest have their leaves change color or lose leaves, etc.
---
/picardfacepalm
---
I mean, at least they didn't quit. There have been a multidue of different events, added lore, countless aesthetics added already. If you're disgruntled your prolly part of the broken down bandwagon already
---
I would unironically want this, a bayoneted bash missile launcher is the kind of stupid meme build I'd dedicate a character to
---
Were they wearing the bunny mask?
---
There is definitely some weird shit that is possible. I was in a camp once and as soon as I walked into the room with the vendors, all of the walls disappeared and turned into A maze of concrete tires.
---
It's nice but I didn't see any Enclave markings on it either :-/
---
Be careful with the new TOS they updated recently
---
I would 100% value non-duped items over duped ones, but would be pretty hard to prove in a trade. Only way to value them truly is to only use items you dropped that you know aren't duped
---
Maybe if I showed her a blistering hot death I might feel better after shoveling tens of thousands of scrip into her bloated gob only to recieve utter rubbish. 
---
I only want revenge now.
---
I wore the blue baseball helmet, a gas mask, and a full set of heavy BOS combat armor
---
Thx üëΩüíö
---
Just in time for Christmas funerals
---
They have already tried their hand at banning mules during the """ban""" wave a few months ago, but needless to say, pretty pointless since they unbanned most of them anyway. This is probably an effort to justify it for the 10% of them who actually stay banned during the next wave, if there even is one
---
Thank you very much! This is cool.
---
Possibly. I‚Äôll check to see if it‚Äôs tagged that way. But you‚Äôre probably right.
---
Edit: Nope, it‚Äôs standard from what I can see. The FO1st exclusive is the Red Ranger Power Armor bundle returning for 20% off. 
---
Today is Classic Western. Tomorrow is Down Hope Dweller (Sep 11). Then it‚Äôs Starlet Sniper (Sep 12), Mothman Cultist (Sep 13), and Survival Camouflage (Sep 14). 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6B24sQjpl8X7fWxQS6PjyF/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-8-15
---
Hard to say who had the bigger overreaction here.
---
I too would really like that. There are fallout 4 mods that change the trees every now and then but snow would be really nice. Would be cool to know what the Top of the world looks like seeing as it was a ski resort
---
Or you know, an in game chat
---
You will also, again IIRC, get 50 perk coins for free after the update if you're over level 50, so you can upgrade 1 perk to level 2 for free!
---
I will alter what I said before: based on how support tends to treat people and how pathetic the "ban" wave a few months ago was, their TOS holds *LESS* value than used toilet paper
---
oh my god
---
It would be a perfect time to put Mothman stuff in the Atom Store, at least.
---
I love it, Yes!
---
There will still have hunger and thirst bars they are just removing negative effects of starving and dehydrated but adding extra buffs to well fed and well hydrated
---
I claimed mine before the season was over. I was trying to determine if i should be salty about not saving the scrip for the sale lol. That's why I wanted to know if you were speaking from first hand experience or not. Thanks though.
---
"Sharon's Angry Letter", "Your the Dumbass", "Disgruntled Note", and "Not Sorry" are personal favourites of mine.
---
I thought that was what the personal computer would be perfect for! Its pretty much a useless item as is. Why not add a feature that promotes social interaction? I think that would be awesome!
---
I enjoyed reading both of those. As far as instruments go though, you forgot about the theremin. :)
---
‚ÄúEviction Notice‚Äù from Bog Town are good.
---
D-d-dad? I thought you got killed in the Great War!
---
I had this problem every single time I tried to join the event. Didnt get to turn in any of the prime meat i collected or get any of the cookout even rewards because by the time I was able to "fast travel" to the event, it was already over.
---
Wait were you in a public team with a level 216 and asked them for help with getting caps and they did the no emote?
---
They‚Äôre already useless
---
If only I was a heavy gunner lol. Yeah I could probably at least get a few caps a piece for them
---
Buy another plan and if it says (Known) then you already learnt it üòÇüëç
---
Honest answer is no, either find it in a vendor or get a copy from an event. If you are on PC add me IGN: bigsiege I have a plan and you can see if you know it
---
Gotcha! Welcome :)
---
I see what you did there and I fucking applaud you for it.
---
Five toons maxed out.
---
I dont care personally, it's just funny how much this community brag about how good it is,  and then I see things like this. I couldn't care less if people took my crops. How much food do you need really? Idk maybe I'm missing something about farming crops in this game, but I can't understand why people need all this food.
---
1k scrip each 5 characters per account
---
All of these are good ideas!
---
Another one to include would be an ash storm in the heap, which causes mole miners to be out in force and severely limits visibility.
---
The bog could also have a pollen fog from overactive sundew groves, which could force you to wear a gas mask.
---
Also - the mire one should be accompanied by radioactive fog. There‚Äôs some lore to that I won‚Äôt spoil (Vault 94), but it fits.
---
If more than 4 were used it did break the bonus, but that was supposedly fixed. This would be different than the original bug I guessüëç
---
No, that's just cruel
---
It's unfortunate that the comments here do not reflect your words, your article, or your meaning. I get what you are saying about the game, there truly is some beauty behind this game, it's just not always in the forefront. 
---
CAMP designers are great, building your own camp can be great, the community in game can be a lot of fun, I love helping low level players, and I love seeing others do it too. Working together without having to worry about someone with hacked weapons is great, and that is just as much on the player as it is Bethesda.
---
There is a lot of beauty in this game that the players make, but that wouldn't be possible without the content that Bethesda has made. It pretty much feels like a meme to me at this point that so many people hate Bethesda for this game, when more than half the time, it's unwarranted imo. 
---
Good article, thank you for sharing it!
---
Go to a weapon crafting bench and see if "fixer" shows up in the machined guns category.  If it's listed there then you know the plan already.
---
The e on the front
---
Thanks, I seen video where you can get 1k gold but lose a full faction level. Do you know if this is true?
---
Thanks, I'm PS4 but that's nice of you.
---
I got called a Karen because this dude got all salty when I told him his ammo prices (4-8 caps for *ballistic* ammo) will get his camp nuked. That *did* get his camp nuked. But I hit Earle first to ensure destruction due to the distraction and Mothman danced in the wreckage.
---
You on Xbox. I bought plan a while ago for 5k caps and now I‚Äôve had about ten plans drop for me. After learning plan I got a mutants fixer them zealots and one amazing night a month ago she gave me a bloodied fixer that I love even if prefixes aren‚Äôt the best
---
Thats actually coming out soon? I thought th5wt was lost its been unueed for a year
---
great work!
---
Unused
---
I was not playing last year for Mischief Night so I am excited to get plans from that. Wish Bethesda would release it for a weekend early October and then a full week through Halloween.
---
ü§£üòÇü§£ I'm level 265.
---
...Christ I'm an idiot. Obvious solution. Thanks man.
---
Just noticed my screw up and fixed it.
---
Oh haha no..... I myself wouldn‚Äôt setup a trap camp.... they don‚Äôt think interest me.  Just trying to figure out what I just witnessed.  It was odd
---
I went in there thinking that maybe I'd have some decent luck dropping a Shiskiebab, preferrably a Vampires or Bloodied, but after a few minutes of pulling 2* items, I was reminded how many utterly terrible melee weapons there really are.
---
Let‚Äôs just ignore the fact that we paid ¬£60+ for this game *and* some of us pay a costly premium subscription. - Bethesda
---
As a German, we have insurances that will cover things like this.
---
If Beth decides to ban one of our family's account, because of a changed TOS, then yes.
---
Our accounts are grandfathered in.
---
All this sale did was remind me of how fucking bad the stuff Grandma gives us is. Not a single usable item after 1150 scrip spent. I wish she wasn't rigged to give us a fucking missile launcher or pipe weapon every other time.
---
as a joke I used to jump up on the purveyor's counter and drop a bag of food. seemed like sheepsquatch meat worked best...haha
---
It‚Äôs standard from what I can see. The FO1st exclusive is the Red Ranger Power Armor bundle returning for 20% off. 
---
...you have insurance that covers video game accounts?
---
Maybe if you stopped putting crap in the machine she would have better items to give out. Where do you think she gets all those items to crate up and dole out?
---
Nice! Those use pretty common materials to build (Bone 4, Cloth 5, Plastic 5), and I think they sell pretty well (mid-30s caps apiece).  Could be nice to top off your daily cap sales.  Marine Tactical Helmet might be cheaper to build (1 Cloth, 1 Plastic, 3 Rubber) for around the same cost, but rubber is harder to come by.
---
You‚Äôre right. It will lighten server load because I can finally fuck the 250lbs worth of scrip off outta my stash box.
---
Alternatively, get a turbo-fertlizer machine and if you need that carrot right now, throw one of those grenades.
---
Which technically affects server load.
---
I honestly have no fucking clue about code, I was making a joke. 
---
But alright I'll fish for knowledge. What if the helmet light isn't coded and it's just a visual texture. Wouldn't you have to be a bit more specific than "Add light to helmet"
---
I'm curious where the light would actually be emitted from if there was not already a "Light" coded into the model of said helmet? And if the placement of the light was already coded to work as a light, why doesn't it already work? Is it possible they simply didn't add this "helper" you speak of, or is it possible the helmet was never coded to have a light placement making it that much harder to add it?
---
Ah no worries, maybe another good sort will offer for PS4, good luck
---
i'm cashing in 12k scrip tonight...fingers crossed. last sale first three weapons were bloody combat rifle, hunter's fatman, bloody handmade. also picked up a vampires, faster fire, faster reload, radium rifle. most of my good stuff comes from ms. mumbles so i'm hopeful.
---
My Junkie's Power Armor Heavy Gunner is 210: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f254b8b&amp;d=sq2s22s32sr2sx2eh2c72s12ip2id2a72l71lt2lu2ls2a04pe1e40e90ic1&amp;m=cf3&amp;ad=03478
---
That's the build I started from but I can't remember what I currently have slotted because I've been on my main more lately.
---
Edited to include Power Armor.
---
Looks to me like you have a perfect opportunity to make a bloody heavy alt!
---
Misunderstood your post sorry ;D
---
If you have someone else help you, Glassed Caverns works well. There's an ultracite deposit by the front and if you collect it, and then leave and come back while a party member stands by it, it will appear uncollected, but not give you any more ore or dissappear. Each time you press it 5ish scorched will appear lvl 48-62 and it can be done endlessly.
---
A lot of people compare max-level legendary perks, when they're not THAT expensive to swap out.  Unless you're level 600+ and can max out all your legendary perk cards with your extra cards right away, you'll probably have a slot or three sitting at level 1 while you upgrade your priority cards.  Consider the value of Master Infiltrator as your *last* legendary perk card, while you concentrate on leveling up your pimary/secondary/tertiary/etc.  You'll probably unlock them as fast/faster than you can level them all up, so you're only going to be focusing on that last perk card slot at somewhere north of level 500, probably.
---
Until then, compare Master Infiltrator level 1 against level 1 of anything else; basically +1 to a SPECIAL stat.  Where the 6 perk cards would cost 6 SPECIAL to equip, normally, you get that benefit for *effectively* 1 SPECIAL.
---
When you DO have everything getting maxxed out, of course, do whatever fills your boots, I'm not the boss of you.  I just think it's a lot more valuable in that middle range which I imagine most players are.
---
You have to burn certain pieces with the flamethrower trap. It  breaks a lot of those rules. It's hard to say which ones specifically as it's really really finicky and different for every project
---
I imagine that this project took a lot of trial and error
---
Europe in general just has better consumer protections than most places. Australia has pretty good ones too.
---
Edit: that to than
---
I'm looking for people of that level to give them a gun.
---
There's consumer protection and there's going to court *over a video game account*
---
Find a fixer collector. They will buy it just to have a completed set of E25 fixers.
---
Bit off topic, any idea if you can attach lights to those trees? ü§î
---
This event is limited to 8 players. When the event triggers, the first 8 players are in one instance. Another instance opens up for subsequent players, and it can mean that event instance has less players - even just one if 9 players do this event.
---
The pistol simply suffers from being a pistol: it doesn't have the raw damage potential of the shotgun, and can't punch as hard or as far as the rifle. So, just... why?
---
I survived because the fire inside burned brighter than the fire around me. But, yeah this needs to be a thing.
---
We are on a break now as season 1 has ended and season 2 hasn't started, will begin again next week
---
I live in Illinois. You must just live in the stupid parts.
---
Oh boy this is heartbreaking.  I found a spot that I really like, but I get a lot of patrol spawns near my base.  On the plus side I've had three high level 3\* legendary spawn in the last week nearby.
---
Something similar happened to me the other day.  I killed the big doofus solo and the multiple other people were waiting outside when i exited the mine.  I'm wondering if you can stay outside and get rewards without contributing to the fight
---
Where do you think crap is supposed to go? And who do you think this crap is coming from? LOL. I get better drops from AWOL than from the wench.
---
Ark Survival Evolved is a great reason why turkeys are not a good idea. The horror...oh god!
---
Do we have a link to this, or at least the verbage involed?
---
I did not fathom they could pull off Legendary Perks or Daily Ops. I would not be so quick to dismiss what they could do.
---
They need to add a two person outfit.  Maybe you can use one of your allies.  Make a headless horseman outfit that takes one in the front and one on the back of the horse.  Then your Ally could make random comments about being the butt while galloping around.
---
Maybe, sure. I still play the game, you know? It is but a suggestion after all.
---
Yeah, good luck proving that the accounts running on separate PCs are owned by one person bitch
---
Did you pay money for that account? Well then it should be protected like any other purchase. I don't see it being a videogame making it hold less value. Especially if you equate time to money and that account has significant time invested that Beth decides to take away from the customer for something that on the surface seems pretty dumb.
---
No idea how that would work.
---
Most likely not as the heavy gunner cards drop later in ur ranking.
---
I am new so this may sound odd. You can have 5 character in all?
---
So then it means everyone joined instantly before me? Because I clicked on it as soon as it came up and I have this game on an ssd. You could be right though.
---
Well shit.
---
Going to court over a purchase so small is a waste of time and money.
---
There are no daily or weekly quests right now. Not a bug.
---
I‚Äôve spent more than 2000 and best one I got is an auto grenade launcher, lots of ghoul slayers, bashing and black powders. Murmur is not in the mood.
---
Brother I am pinned here!
---
Yeah no joke, I got into FO76 midway through the season(ing). without even trying and just screwing around, I was 5 spots away from the end
---
its not that i think they couldnt do it, i just think they wont
---
anyways im completely with you i want to see something like that happen.
---
After all doing more damage with shotguns doesnt make me feel like a shotgunner, enforcer however does...
---
its those perks that really make a gameplay difference wich make certain weapon classes enjoyable and having more of these would definitely be welcome
---
Am I the only one excited about What Rads? Such a qol perk but so nice to not worry about rads from eating people and swimming.
---
I love this idea. I'll be the first Wasteland Mail Man in your honor!
---
So frustrating. Grabbed 10 modules and then used the rest for ranged. Got one okayish Fixer and four bloodied and junkies weapons (I‚Äôm not bloodied or junkies) that I can sell. That‚Äôs fine. But not as good as 40+ modules would have been.
---
What‚Äôs that? You want more Brotherhood of Retcons shit? HERE YA GO
---
dunno why are you getting downvoted, most people that have the christmas presents have literally thousands of them, so I am sure you will find someone
---
When I tried to rejoin it booted me outside and said I was exiting the event. But either way I wouldn‚Äôt want to get rewards for an event I didn‚Äôt contribute to regardless of whether or not I got bugged out
---
Asking the real questions here.
---
No joke, if you are not in a team, you are missing OUT on alot of bonuses. You dont have to talk or even be near them, just get those bonds up.
---
You have to have the plan unlocked. But even then, the drop rate is appallingly low. I've known the plan for months, but never had a legendary Fixer drop from anywhere.
---
I've had plenty of legendary Handmades drop though, and I use one of those as my main.
---
Don't know how the game decides who is in a particular instance, but im guessing many people also join as soon as they see it, so could just be sheer luck of the draw.
---
Haha
---
Its not tho
---
Cool, time to cash out my scrip on regular priced modules and ignore this fucking "sale" of theirs.
---
That's why they normally lump them into class actions. But either way you should be protected. Letting companies rip you off pennies at a time leads them to start ripping you off for dollars. Slap their wrists every time and watch that behavior change.
---
I wish people would stop saying things are "bugs", when 9 times out of 10 it's that they don't understand how the game works.
---
Yep, we could open legit art galleries. It‚Äôd be wonderful.
---
I‚Äôd enjoy a rpg skin that is called pumpkin smasher and shoots pumpkin colored rounds or maybe put on the m79 non auto
---
Oh hell i spent 650 scrip and got some decent stuff that i can sell, one i could get a fair bit for, but nothing of use, onto my lvl 200 tommorow to see if i have any better luck.
---
they can go for alot but just wait till next dupe comes out, the trade sites will be flooded with ones for $5 or less if you want to go that route
---
But wouldn't the code for each helmet be somewhat unique seeing as they all have different placements and textures? 
---
What if the helmet you're adding a light to was never coded to include a light in its digital model, where would the light come from?
---
 I feel like you're making it seem a tad simpler than it really is. Take the power armor light for example. The helmet light is broken in 3rd person and is pointed to your side, even though you're looking forward and the light is on your head facing the same way. I've filed a ticket about it, if it was such an easy fix why hasn't it been done?
---
I really know nothing about coding, but have heard from close friends that do it for a living that "a simple task in coding can still takes days to complete and implement"
---
Not disagreeing at all. The artificial, arbitrary limits in this product and the "let's throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks" design mentality are beyond ridiculous.
---
Not hard to say actually... you used brick walls, destroyed them, then deleted the wall... it's currently the only method left for floating roofs. I have a few floating camps like this if anyone is looking for a building contractor on PS4. These camps are the most fun.
---
Good job with this one mate.
---
Alas, as with many suggestions I have seen, I hope they do but they may easily not. 
---
I figure that weapon specialization would open the door, no matter how slow or fast, to do something about the stale state of our current game play. The incentive is there, I just hope they grab it, or, something similar.
---
TL;DR,  if the game gives you free crap, dont report it, cause they will screw you over.
---
Sounds like your build sucks. Even on the rare occasion I run bloodied I can facetank assaultrons while having about 20 hitpoints
---
I saw someone left a paperbag at the entrance, i took a look inside and it was like ‚Äòwow how can someone get so many medics and nocturnals black powders in one trip‚Äô üòÇ
---
Rip I‚Äôm on PS4 lol. Thanks though.
---
Not odd at all! That's correct, one account can have up to 5 characters max.
---
I REALLY want to win the lottery, so I can start trying to change the way the dev teams does this game. Was thinking I would buy up every Superman64 game and ship them to Todd. You know, just really confuse him...or maybe 500 fridge sized boxes of bottlecaps.
---
Those aesthetics also tend to be horribly broken at the level of sometimes having flat out busted UV mapping.
---
I think you randomly encountered a player who was acting like an ass, and you have blown the situation way out of proportion.
---
Wrong thread?
---
Groovy.
---
Damn knowing my luck I‚Äôll go through the same then lol. How do you get the plan for the handmade to drop?
---
If I think they'll sell quickly I put them in the vending machine. Otherwise I just leave them in a bag on the floor. I've usually blown through the 1400/day vendor caps already, I don't have the stash space, and I can get more, so let someone else deal with 'em.
---
This - always radstag and bears.  Sometimes honey monsters in the mix too.
---
It depends on who wins. If I win, I or my insurance does not pay any monies.
---
If a private person comes to steal from me, he'll get trashed. If a company tries to, it'll go to court.
---
The US has a similar thing "stand your ground", but it does not apply when going against companies. Ever wondered why that is?
---
Why not just play with them all?  I have 5 toons and I use all 5. 
---
Different play styles keeps it somewhat fresh.
---
I‚Äôll be on in a hour or so, I‚Äôll send you a message on Xbox when I get on. GT MITCHELL 655
---
nope. but it is definitely applicable to several others.
---
true! i was very excited about the balance overhaul but when i saw what that overhaul actually looks like i was kind of devastated
---
i allways assumed they would try to improve weapons that where lackluster so far like laserrifles, broadsiders, missile launchers ...
---
but nope
---
and here we are having ideas from the community that would bring so much more variety to the game
---
well anyways lets hope that they come up with something üëçüèº
---
Are you on steam? Wondering if something weird could be happening with steam vs the Bethesda launcher.
---
Now.
---
Once you are not new you will realize how quickly you run out of room in your stash.  Other character make great alternatives for both stash and more caps as 30k can fill up quickly.
---
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at.  It feels more pure and satisfying to mow things down with weapons I ground out on my own.  I‚Äôm not knocking the trading community, it‚Äôs a wonderful thing, but you never know the provenance of an item you‚Äôre after.  I wish BGS was more proactive about punishing dupers and discouraging that behavior.
---
Re start system and game
---
If it‚Äôs proven not to be a bug then I‚Äôll gladly remove this post. I‚Äôm not trying to be that guy that says everything is bugged and what not
---
We can dream.  Until then I guess I just keep dropping scrip for noobs or for free in vendor.
---
I have to say, i have a full adhesive farm and everything is open to all. No carrots though, sadly.
---
Try to create a fallout 76  game profile in amd adrenaline.
---
It‚Äôs more a ‚Äúthrow enough shit at the wall, and some of it will stick‚Äù thing. They‚Äôre not even trying to satisfy the player base.
---
That's what makes the world go round.  Whole sellers are great for those looking for decent and sometimes great finds for cheap.  I have everything I want that can be easily found in a vendor now I am on to the more rare items that I do sometimes come across but are set for a high price.  I cant add that to my collection if I dont have the caps to do so.  But like you said as a whole seller you probably sell tons items which is good.  The buying and selling is my favorite part of the game other can building CAMPS.
---
A saw a guy do that to becket with a tower camp.  Funniest thing ever
---
Had this issue yesterday on PS4. I noticed the atom shop wasn't loaded in and the Fallout 1st icon was greyed but didn't think much of it until I got into a world and tried to put my junk in a scrap box. When it popped up saying I didn't have fallout 1st to access it, I just closed application and started the game up again and everything worked fine after that.
---
Nothing from your description sounds like a bug.
---
This is a fantastic comment.
---
We have insurances that help us getting our right.
---
In this case we bought the accounts BEFORE they changed the TOS, (which is anyways invalid in Europe).
---
Here it needs to say that on the back of the cover, before we buy it. Not after. While there is a difference between TOS and License, it doesn't matter much in this case. Because changing either one unilaterally to the detriment of a customer after they took the money, is a big no-go.
---
What they said
---
But thats not my point. These things you suggested pose risk for reward for lower level players. Which is good. Dont want everything super easy. But to high level players is all reward with little risk. Im saying some should pose mostly risk with a little extra reward. Just to add some challenge back into the game.
---
good luck!!
---
Wow, it's nothing.
---
Mr.big I just started a alt if your up to it I would love to buy one of your fixer plans.if possible..pm me. T.Y
---
Or maybe just make it darker in certain areas, or certain towns when you enter it.  And have the area decorated with Halloween stuff!
---
If you do the dailies every day for each faction (Ward for Foundation, and Rocksy/Wren in foundation) it will take you about a month to reach ally with who you sided with.  It will take another 2-3 weeks after that to max the other one.
---
I trust them to dress themselves.  They've earned it.

Todays daily event in the Toxic Valley was a hunting challenge from Black Bear Lodge. This involves hunting down 3 animals. Each animal has a spawn somewhere in toxic Valley. When the required animal spawns, it is usually among several other types of animal all of whom are fighting it out. And often there are many of them.
---
This is what you came across. It can happen any time since players may be doing this quest for the first time (this event is part of the bureau of tourism quest, which is basically an intro to the toxic valley dailies). Or a player triggered it on the day it was on but only getting round to completing it another day.
---
Tried to open a ticket like 3-4 months ago, and got the same error for whatever reason (was trying to attach an MP4). Looks like this still around lol
---
Tell us more
---
Ok cool. Thanks!
---
and if they gang up on you like in new vegas? and whats this? you only have a 10mm pistol and 4 stimpacks and forgot your broadsider? what would you do then?
---
Lol.  We all have moments from time to time.  Good luck!
---
They could be classified as griefing, and griefing is now completely against the TOS I recommend giving it a complete read through. Or just watch a YouTube video where somebody explains it to you. IMO it's kind of a confusing mess.
---
I've got bloodied explosive 15% faster vats assault rifle on my first script, guess im not gonna beat for a long time.
---
I want to say the handmade is already in the drop pool..but with luck you will get a few pipe pistols and western revolvers before getting a single handmade..the plan is usually at the bot in the middle of harpers ferry..I think it's a Phoenix bot
---
This.  Same thing happened on ps4 yesterday.  Quick restart fixed it
---
I'm a PS4 junkie... What's the other effects?

&gt;to run 2 instances of the game at once at the same PC you will need the original exe/ini files along with the renamed ones for the 2nd account. It isn't that much work anyway - copy/rename the exe and the 4 mentioned ini files and you are done. Whenever a patch is released, make a new copy of the .exe file.
---
The OP asked about mulling on a second account.  If you wanted to play both or play one and vend on one then the different INI files are worth it, for simply moving stuff to a mule who cares about having different screen and sound configurations?  I run mine in a bordered window and drag the second instance to another monitor for trading mostly it is just dropping off stuff into a container and picking it back up with the mule, easy peasy lemon squeezie.
---
People don't understand how instanced events work.
---
I don't even think looting crops affects another person's ability to loot the same crop, I'm pretty sure they're independent
---
Really? I guess it‚Äôs a sporadic bug that triggers randomly for people. Lmao Not even Bethesda‚Äôs support website is safe from bugs.
---
Bug awareness +1
---
Hunt them.
---
Seriously?  We had an entire Halloween event last year.
---
Please friend me so I can come by and see it (XBox gt: Psilenser)
---
Happening on Xbone too.
---
No sir, you will *not* get anything worth using for another 12 years. 56 before it actually suits your build.
---
Do you have to remove starched genes to do this? I took herbivore on a carnivore character and nothing happened.
---
I am pretty sure that the game prioritizes parties in the initial distribution. I almost always end up in the same instance as others in my party. I think it also attempts to fill a lobby before opening a second which is why you can end up all alone.
---
Is that PC thing because my server just dropped 3 on PS4?
---
I can log on for 10 mins and clear 400 lbs of stash and get well over 10k. I just know which things i shouldnt put in there. 
---
Instance: ill put a bloodied spear 3* for 333 no matter the stars. However, if i get a fixer plan that gets given to someone of my friends. That sort of thing.
---
Also: i got the travelling leather coat legitimately. Feels gooooood.
---
I think thats why I wholesale is i love watching that RNG roll :D
---
Gl this weekend friend!
---
A few days ago I got a bloodied, faster swing speed, +1 strength super sledge. An explosive 2525 fixer. And a bloodied explosive handmade. Oh and a bloodied 90 reduced weight war drum. Wish I took pictures of them but I was giving them away to random players who wanted them
---
I mean they got the bootleg Jason outfit so that‚Äôs something
---
Apparently my mutation might‚Äôve gave me -5
---
It‚Äôs a ~1/55000 chance of getting a specific gun anyway. And that‚Äôs assuming it‚Äôs not weighted against you and you haven‚Äôt learnt any bullion plans.
---
You are the first person to call it a bug itt
---
Yes, which is honestly nice tbh
---
But my headset is noise canceling
---
Lol, why not?
---
My turrets hate my vending machines and walls. And prioritize them as the threat over the scorched or anyone else that comes to my camp.
---
Yes'ish? Some of the wall mount and string lights sort of work, but it's really, really picky as to where and when.
---
Secondary accounts are mentioned in the context of cheating, exploits etc. Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to care if you have multiple accounts that you don‚Äôt do anything nefarious with‚Äîthat‚Äôs more money for them. Mentioning it in this context, as broadly as it is, allows them to expand bans and disciplinary actions to those alternate accounts. 
---
For example: Let‚Äôs say someone has a main account that they keep squeaky clean, but also has 5 other accounts used to dupe and sell items on eBay. 
---
With this language, all they have to do is prove that that person owns all of those accounts in order to take action against all of them. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that they will do that, but that they can.
---
Sadly, otherwise I would
---
Ok now your second person who said this, is it just  PC? Because we definitely just dropped three on my PS4 server.
---
Yeah when i started playing this game 1 year ago i felt the same,
---
I even made good friends in this game
---
BOS had 0 retcons. Wiki editors thought Fallout Bible was canon (it's not) *and* grossly misinterpreted BOS info from it.
---
That's actually a cool idea. I'm on Xbox &amp; I wouldn't mind collecting 1 or 2 of the variants myself. I have Nuka Cola Vaccinated.
---
GT MagnumForce357
---
I do that with my commie bot. Just gave his machine over the edge of a cliff each time he spawns he‚Äôs falls seven stories and wanders around crippled out of earshot. But his stuff is still easy to gather
---
:O
---
I‚Äôve gotten 5 reclaimed gas masks in 10 ACPs, even got two back to back.
---
I heard about that but all my friends are Lv 10-30 Bc I‚Äôm tryin to get them into the game
---
I just prefer not to
---
The thread title and label both say BUG
---
Hey you don‚Äôt need to pay me but I‚Äôm happy to walk off a cliff for you? My ign is shoooops, what‚Äôs yours?
---
I'm on PC and I can make Nuka Cola Vaccinated, which I'm more than willing to trade for some "My Blood". I won't be on until later, due to work however
---
+33% Vats chance and 25% less Vats action point cost.
---
Not really. This is the guy that freaked out a bit when ‚Äòsomeone stole his camp spot‚Äô and when he decided to build in a new spot ‚Äònothing was where it should have been in his bunker‚Äô. 
---
Instead of just, you know, server hopping or not rebuilding the camp that session.
---
I wish my ally would teleport. I place my camp above the "river" behind the Wayward. Placed her computer (and a bed) in cabin on the nothern bank. Made a hospital with a garden on the southern bank. All she does now is run from the cabin far away from my camp to cross the river to the door of the hospital and back. 24/7. Mid conversation she runs off again.  
---
You would think she would use the bridge I made, but no.....
---
Awesome, thanks! My name is BaconatorFries, are you available now? and I'm happy to donate the caps to you but your call
---
Thankyou, id like a decent lever action, but im sure i'll get everything besides lol.
---
Why has it been so nuke-quiet the last couple of days?
---
Yeah my game just crashed but I‚Äôm just loading it back up so I‚Äôll be like 5mins!
---
True! ESO has one. We need one too! Oh and it needs to utilize an optional headless model. I've seen multiple players having it already. I want one of those üòÅ

* Unlock your purifiers you swine.
---
* Your turrets are randomly shooting at a traveling vendor.
---
* Your Jester Faschnaut mask is not worth 5000 caps.
---
* I dislike your floating foundations.
---
* I broke my legs twice trying to get here.
---
* Just, why?
---
* I left you some plans at your front door. P.S. they're all mounted heads.
---
* Are you willing to sell items in your display cases?
---
* Bruh why is your base way up on this god forsaken mountain.
---
* Why do you have 4 vending machines but only selling 5 items?
---
* I stole all your crops.
---
* I stole all your collectron's stash items.
---
* I came here because you had a lot of plans but they are all santa crashes.
---
* Your base is really nice looking, is what I would say to your face if you were here.
---
* Why are all your doors locked?  What are you hiding in there?
---
* If I had a cap for every base Ive seen as ugly as yours, I could buy all your stuff.
---
* You built your camp in my spot... just came here to say MOVE!
---
* I found your camp and it didnt have a vendor sign.  Judging by your set up you would'nt have anything good to sell anyway.
---
* I killed your brahmin.
---
* Why is your junk extractor locked?  How much junk do you actually need?
---
* Seriously where are your vendors even at?

Is the icon still there?
---
Idk i had a bug where one of my friends was two times on the map(one real, the other was just standing) but i could ask the fake for trade and when i done that, my friend said that he got the message that i wanted to trade with him, maybe its the same bug
---
Cool, I'll jump on now!
---
I couldn‚Äôt access the game for 3 straight weeks without being automatically disconnected. I tried EVERYTHING to get this rectified on my own, Bethesda‚Äôs only ‚Äúhelp‚Äù was telling me to try turning my console on &amp; off. It was incredibly frustrating and annoying on top of insulting to my intelligence. Eventually the game randomly just began working again. Support tickets are an absolute joke, seemingly you just have to bank on the ~hope~ things will work again.
---
It's probably not easy to do, but they could add a "photo lab" where you have to go get your picture printed, then bring it to your camp and attach it to a blank frame like you do an outfit for your follower.
---
Lots of picky things in general camp building really... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks, appreciate it.
---
Awesome.
---
September 15 I read
---
You're reporting bugs... what the fuck are you expecting beyond an automated response exactly?
---
This is how support tickets work.  If there's actually something they can do to help you or they need more information from you then  they'll contact you.  You're reporting a bug... a well known bug... a  bug they can neither walk you through fixing nor need more input on.
---
the Offspring got a tank skin in World of Tanks, now if the Smashing Pumpkins would get a PA skin in Fallout 76, the 90s would thank Bethesda.
---
you definitely missed the date.
---
Season 1 ended on the 8th. Season 2 starts on the 15th.
---
15th
---
It‚Äôs all RNG. Her RNG is identical to dropped loot RNG, except for the limitation of dropped loot not dropping DLC based gear (although I think that might have changed?)
---
You're making it sound as if everyone wasn't running marsupial and bird bones
---
You thought wrong. I walked uphill both ways in the nuclear winter just so i could mow the lawn.
---
Right you are, didnt read the TITLE
---
They don‚Äôt really listen to anything like this when I post it so don‚Äôt get your hopes up please :(
---
You can build your camp by Morgantown station. Then farm the scorched at the airport for xp and their weapons. Rinse and repeat!! üëçüëç
---
Yep that‚Äôs all
---
Just use the linked website for the codes
---
That sounds like something my dad would say
---
Yeah, if you're at the endgame grind you're probably going for SS. 
---
Nobody is going to waste 1000script on a roughly 6% chance of getting SS armor. And at this point, endgame weapons are easier to find from players than pure RNG.
---
Lol I don‚Äôt run bird bones
---
I'd just rather they fix the game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
What are your rates? The only good build I've made is a church, but they're a dime a dozen.
---
Is that a conspiracy theory I hear? BANNED!
---
This is why I destroy decon arches with explosive bait.
---
I'm one of those high level players. Helping new peeps progress is my end game! It's been more difficult since public teams launched, everyone comes and goes and doesn't communicate üò•
---
You or anyone, feel free to HMU for any kind of help! XxQuarantinaxX
---
It‚Äôs basically there so if someone is pushing it too far the player in question has no defense. A simple trap base probably won‚Äôt count. 
---
But following someone around and shooting them continuously when it‚Äôs clear that they have Pacifist on (because they shot back once to prove it) would cross the line, perhaps.  And then the player that was doing the harassing has no plausible deniability. 
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs not abused, but just as hopefully it is actually used when needed.
---
Way better carry weight than the other models. Useful for going on junk runs.
---
Oh yeah. Collecting ore since with a full set the ore you mine has double the yield. But other than that not really.
---
You can increase your carry weight with the modded legs and it mines double ore if you have both arms attached.  I‚Äôd recommend keeping it.
---
This is the one I am maxing out.  Along with the ghoulish perk I can finally be the ghoul I always wanted to be in the game!
---
Lucky Hole Mine. When you're wearing it, you collect 2x the lead. VERY handy in ammo crafting.
---
Have you looked around the mothman museum?
---
Increased carry weight and increased yield from mining make it pretty useful IMHO. I generally suit up with it just before a lead mining trip around Lucky Hole.
---
They should add like a skin walker or something very scary......big foot ü¶∂
---
I figured with the One Wasteland update it would still be pretty dangerous even for high level players. But I wanted it to be nasty regardless of level.
---
Clown outfit Ghouls = me shitting myself at the speed of light
---
My locked up base and a wandering trader freaking teleports in and starts using my workbench.
---
Collecting ore. Better carry weight.  Some cool exclusive skins like the Bone Raider. 
---
If your current set isn‚Äôt max level, then I‚Äôd drop it and craft a new one at max level, add in Calibrated Shocks and keep that available for when you want to go mining or need some extra carry weight to get home.
---
Is there a good all around build???
---
Yeah fallout still to full of bugs to real me back in stopped played over a year ago waiting to see more posts about how it's all fixed and every time I look it's another glitch or post about how you have such a hard time getting gear and then you realize if you ever wanted anything good should have been playing sense beta cause now everything is going for Ludacris amounts of money or in-game currency caps 1millon for a b3325 handmade fixer or one piece of armor sorry bro games died for the most part their ( make me offline version I'll play again let me mod again so I can have fun )
---
Sounds good, what time will you be able to play? Also what time zone are you in? I'm in BST
---
I thought so too?...
---
That's may be too good to get what it's worth from a vending machine.  I'm not sure how PS4 prices go, but FED76 suggests that's worth 20k at a minimum on PC, probably more.
---

---
I like to have a challenge so I don‚Äôt need something crazy good 
---
I like a struggle
---
They were going to until you called it "script."  Now they're not gonna.
---
gives you more carry weight than other PA's. I think a full suit is like +100.  I use it when I'm resource collecting. If you get calibrated shocks for it, it gives you even more carry weight.
---
Scrip.  The word is scrip.
---
Explosive 2525 is not a possible combination
---
Not really. Especially seeing as it‚Äôs a free reward and atom shop shit usually stays up for a week.
---
Yup;  cashed out that 950 script for 19 legendary modules, when I was hoping for 38.
---
Such a useless event.
---
I'd gladly take some of that weight from your stash. As a favor, of course
---
Track them down and repay the favor, 178 years before the Courier does the same.
---
Not just you. I submitted a ticket for this last night and received that same support document answer (which is silly because I found that article on my own before I sent the ticket). I also have an enormous friends list and it has been nonfunctional for at least two weeks, but august 23rd also sounds correct. 
---
I imagine its not an issue that support staff can see or manipulate in any way and just like with most of this games problems, the dev team broke it and will prioritize and fix it when they can. Its a little crazy to me that a core feature like the friends list has been completely nonfunctional for this long with no official acknowledgement and still no text chat. Thankfully the text chat mod on pc has kept the game from feeling cold and barren while my friends list continues to not work.
---
I am going to ask for some atoms in my ticket once they hit me back with the next garbage response. 
---
Also just a suggestion but the customer service staff cant do anything which is why I have waited this long to send my own ticket and why their support seems so inept. All they can do is send you canned answer and move your ticket into a big queue they already have called "Social features failed to initialize" and throwing them attitude only hurts your chances of getting some free atoms when this inevitably gets fixed.
---
How about let us take more than 50 photos first, I've been playing since day 1, taken a lot of photos. I hate that I have to delete photos when I want to take another
---
When wearing full set, excavator increases carry weight by 100lbs (you can further increase it by additional 100lbs with calibrated shocks mods)
---
and
---
Torso has 4x ore mining bonus (you can use other PA pieces with the torso if you so choose, just for the mining bonus).
---
It only weights 10lbs in chassis so you don't really need to lose it. Save it for lead mining.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator\_power\_armor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator_power_armor)
---
Yep. Nazi flags. Dick pics. Even worse porn images. Other games made mistakes and allowed content from users in-game before (that is shared with all users on the server). It is a terrible idea for more than just these reasons.
---
4x ore mining bonus, not 2. And you forgot 100lbs carry weight bonus.
---
I can see that by the sheer number of rads you have there! Is there a reason for that? *snorts barrel of psycho*
---
I'm not actually the OP, but I do very similar stuff with my own camps. 
---
You are right that it is pretty easy, but it can get a little tricky when it comes to stuff like concentric circles, walls on roofs, wanting to only take out the middle of the wall, ect. 
---
You don't specifically need brick walls in a lot of the cases though (only when you have a double side or have to make the wall turn around for some reason). 
---
The real MVP is the door wall. Doesn't really matter the material type in most cases
---
Well on behalf of all new players thank you.
---
 4x ore mining bonus, not 2.
---
I really wanted to thumbs up your comment but I had to leave it on 69. üòàüòàüòà
---
I need this
---
Yeah i saw that price on there and i sadly have no idea what ps4 prices are.  Might just sit on it for a little while and try and find out more, thanks for the advice.
---
Damn it, I thought it was but then the doubt set in. Many thanks.
---
Nuke Codes are glitched
---
A comon error i often read is the fact it doubles the ore and the fact the arms does so, it's the torso givin the x4 ore per click, not the arms
---
Woops üòÖ been a little while since i used that armor. I was just going off the top of my head.
---
I login today, full server, Queen on the move - good way to start session ;-) 
---
But true - sometimes I see less players - Xbox
---
Bethesda's track record of abandoning new features disagrees 
---
Let's hope they change
---
Really now?  Huh, I always thought it was double.
---
Okay my reddit is bugged i cant see any comments, i got a message that you wrote one in my pop up list but not on reddit itself and now every comment is vanished
---
Wow i cant even see my own post i created a couple seconds ago
---
HORROR. THEMED. WEAPON. MODS.
---
Np! Save those cards.
---
I‚Äôve never had a legendary fixer drop for me yet and I learned the plans awhile ago and I‚Äôve never had a legendary bear arm drop either I also know those plans and I haven‚Äôt had a legendary tenderizer drop but i just recently learned those from meat week no luck here and I play every day üò®
---
But look at the fun you're having.
---
These options exactly.
---
Yeap! I got a fixer quad,explosive,15% faster reload üòç
---
Easy to forget :)
---
np :)
---
Yup :) https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator_power_armor
---
I'll add now!
---
I‚Äôm on Pc and I‚Äôm not seeing any, and I‚Äôve heard Xbox is affected as well.
---
Or if they want to do Scorched, give them all Rippers and Chainsaws.
---
Well overall taking into account the carry weight and the mining bonus it is the best PA there is unless you are a fusion core junky needing a jetpack.    
---
I mean there is a video the difference is 3-4 damage per hit difference between the best and the worst. Not sure about you but but 3 damage per hit is nothing compared to the 100 carry weight. (200 if you run calibrated)
---
I would be happy if it is fixed in Patch 22.
---
Sorry to hear that PS4 seams just fine. Good luck with a quick fix.
---
Because they are loud and annoying af. I‚Äôd rather have 5 sirens in my CAMP than hear an ASAM firing.
---
And fog.  Make it Silent Hill like in towns and make Scorched have Rippers and Chainsaws so we just hear the BrrrBrrrBRRRRR and can‚Äôt see where it‚Äôs going to strike from.
---
So, not sure if anyone is still having this problem, but this worked for me:
---
When you get down to the room and insert the fuse, *BEFORE* you walk away, make sure the option to Replace Fuse actually disappears. 
---
The quest updated when I first clicked it, but the option to Replace Fuse was still there, so I clicked it again, walked over to the terminal and it worked.
---
I said a while ago that the personal terminal would be perfect for this. Even kinda looks like a mailbox.
---
I could not concur more. I am level 153, and the majority of the players I've met were generous, kind, and encouraging. There are a few who try to ruin the experience for the newer players by constructing trap camps to steal the resources others have gathered. Please do not let these few spoil your enjoyment of the game when you stumble upon those camps despicable while shopping. 
---
This game can be frustrating with all the glitches, but it is well worth it when you find a group of supportive players üòÅ
---
A lot of people here seem to be quoting the multiplier wrong. It gives 4x yield.
---
If you need lead, one trip to Lucky Hole Mine will net you about 1.4k lead on average, depending on super duper procs, if you use this power armor.
---
I did the 1st of September.
---
Added.
---
Oh shoot you gonna still be doing this in a few hours? I won't get home from work for two more hours
---
It‚Äôs literally part of the ToS, I‚Äôm pretty sure you can find that hilarious joke of a document somewhere.
---
Nice, might have to hit up some aluminum deposits.
---
Then let's give appropriate feedback to have them revert to an acceptable 30 seconds. They're clearly listening with these perks.
---
I think should made a message broad or world message like other game, ark, rust etc but mail box are awesome. Send gift to your friends with funny message .
---
Last mission in the vault. Depends on what side you are choosing. Settle or Raid. Or keep it for yourself. Give some gold to Settle, you get less gold. But more rep with them. Same with Raid. Keep it for yourself, you don't get rep,  but more gold.
---
I have a tower type of build too, the lead/acid node.  NPCs have vertical pathfinding issues if they cant get to where they want, they use the magic.
---
I've not encounted any bad apples so far thank goodness. Everyone I've met seems friendly.
---
Thank you all, didn't even realize the carry weight buff. Goes up about 45 lbs. but I really only use my power armor for nuke zones, the jetpack and crazy high falls. And my camp is on a lead deposit so that's not an issue
---
Also a tip box!
---
I took 10 purified water, a bunch of vegetables, used your workbench, slept in the bed and shot your ally in the face because she wouldn't shut the hell up, I feel like I should leave you a few pieces of scrap at least
---
Right there with u.. even bought all 2 stars to maximize it. Nothing. Soooo deflating
---
Any bloodied heavies?
---
Then you wouldn‚Äôt have to build one.
---
Aside from the noise, is there a practical reason why?
---
I'd rather they just fix the damn thing!
---
Nope
---
Got 2 godrolls on my first character from her today.
---
So I should keep the legs at least?

ALL YEAR ROUND BABY üíÄüéÉüçÅ

Not only that, but the section it was mentioned in was talking about *competitive* gameplay, which puts a rather different spin on it.
---
Context is key here people.
---
Bloody, dripping machete a la Michael Meyers. 
---
Miner Gauntlet to look like Freddy Krueger‚Äôs hand. 
---
Lead Pipe to look like Hell Raiser‚Äôs hooks. 
---
Combat Knife to look like Trick R‚Äô Treat sucker. 
---
Possibilities are endless.
---
No, keep the whole suit.  If you have the full suit you get +100 carry weight too.  It‚Äôs only 10 pounds.
---
It gets bugged sometimes. I don't think others can see it when this happens, just you (maybe teammates, it has been a while since this has happened to me). It should go away on its on either upon changing servers or just after a period of time.
---
Best not ask for too much
---
I would have just left the event.
---
You need to use the computer terminal in the office and print a new card.  It‚Äôs at the top.  Just need 12 luck I believe to pass the check.
---
It differs from engine to engine, and Morrowind was the first game I ever modded, but it really is quite a simple process.
---
3D Model + Attached Items + Animations = Entity
---
The entity is the compilation of all assets that make up the game object. A light is usually attached to the entity in the game editor, but is referenced by a joint (bone) that's located in the meshes skeleton (even a helmet has a skeleton if it consists of one attachment bone).
---
The reason it probably doesn't already work is because the artist/designer who set it up didn't attach a light emitter to the helmet for whatever reason. Unless it needs to swap to a "lit" texture when the light is activated (dark bulb replaced by white bulb texture; requiring art support to assign a new material to the polygon), the lighting system should already be set up (as referenced by every other helmet/light-emitting object in the game) so when pressing the appropriate toggle, the light turns on.
---
In the engine I use, I'd go into the model source file, add a single node "helmet_light", export the asset so the skeleton updates, go into editor or what have you, and link the light emitter to the bone. Everything else already exists in game for it to work.
---
Generally, this could all be done by one dude in an afternoon before  his lunch break.
---
Bethesda Software Bug Fixer (the only one): Finally fixed that weird headless power armor bug!
---
Software Development (same guy, different hat): ‚ÄúImplement a headless mode...‚Äù Shit.
---
And beyond level 20. Level 50 furious chainsaw anyone?
---
Better yet, I waited for them to die before delivering the final blow to Earle
---
You can like the game and still be highly critical of the games shortcomings and how bad Bethesda has been with this game.
---
Ok first of all, Teslas do slightly more than zero damage. Secondly, this is fixed on the PTS and should be rolled out with patch 22.
---
It's actually pronounced "renAYsaunce!"
---
If you keep it all, you will lose some rep, but its not a whole level. On my main, I kept it all and still got both to full rep in about the same amount of time (maybe 1 week different).
---
All those people desperate to cash in their scrip &amp; greedy af to score more, nah. Server spike in inevitable

I'm honestly not sure - I don't know how you'd go about generalising like that. I suppose you'd be OK at everything, but ultimately not good enough at any one thing to do any real damage.
---
Early game, I'd probably recommend picking your favourite two weapons and try and build towards those. It'll change as you pick up good stuff, but that'd be a good start. I started out putting points into pistols and shotguns because I was finding plenty of both, and as the game went on, I found legendary versions of both, so it worked out. If I'd found a really good minigun, for example, I might have moved towards heavy guns instead. Just depends what you find and what you like using. Try everything though!
---
Worth mentioning that I'm only level 66, there'll be plenty of people on here with more experience who'll give you better advice.
---
Hopefully you never do, but they are out there. Just have fun and enjoy the game. The FO/Reddit community is a great place to stay informed üôÇ
---
 Back to the legendary Machine for more scrips.
---
I was thinking of fiberglass spools üòÖ
---
Corona already had me hiding inside and playing Fallout, ah well. üòÖ
---
Shoving it back in the machine and trying again. Assuming you started with 1000 scrip you can get 120 back a day for the remaining three days of the sale. That‚Äôs 7 more goes per toon. Plus anything extra you can daily, or smaller pieces. 
---
After that I‚Äôm investing in legendary modules.
---
Thank you 
---
Appreciate it 
---
Might do a rifle build and shotgun
---
I ran out of scripts and have a ton of stuff I dont want
---
Literally how last year felt
---
lol - that‚Äôs a great idea!
---
Cheers.
---
There is also a PA station to accompany it.
---
turn it in tomorrow.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get spammed by the Insult Bot
---
Anti Armor explosive .50
---
Reduced vats cost
---
%50 limb damage
---
From what I understand about the upcoming patch that should be a good one
---
Or... Bethesda could actually fix their shit so tesla fps issues become non-issues.
---
Can we stop blaming players for just playing the game and push the people who have the power to actually fix the problem for good?
---
Yea it makes perfect sense anywhere as long as the LVPD is changed for whatever town/ state its found (eg: MSP for Massachusetts State Police. Or LPD for Lexington or BPD for Boston. Or camo for military) as long as the police is changed for certain towns or military divisions.

---
This is about competitive games, tournaments, etc.  I can see this being an issue in NW, particularly if they start tournaments there, but there is nothing about the main FO76 game that is competitive by definition.
---
100 percent!
---
Does the alt share the same camp ?
---
Dupe garage sale! Yay!...
---
3-4 damage difference if you are taking very low damage from low level enemies. When you take normal high damage from higher level enemies the difference in damage taken also grows. It is FAR from best PA. The difference in tankiness is very noticeable if you compare excavator and lets say T-65 (which is the actual best PA). Excavator is for utility and is only good for mining (and carry weight if you happen to need it).
---
Yeah if they had rare drops on certain ghouls that would be great. Sort of like fasnacht
---
If I want to make chems and force them down the throats of every fellow dweller out there, I want to do it in a clean band safe environment
---
It was some sort of 2525 fixer. Its about a week or so since that one dropped.
---
Picture this.
---
You see a 3 star lvl 100 Mumbles out in the open.
---
You have a magic gauss mini.
---
All that is left to say is ....
---
Brr≈ïrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr....
---
Exactly
---
Indeed. Spread the word before the Bethesda nutsack cowboys downvote this into the shadows üßê
---
No, they share nothing to our collective dismay. But you can dump stuff on them, hence the name "mule".
---
It never hurts to try them as long as you hang onto the other gear, armor and perks.   You'll know pretty quickly whether you like it or not.   Or at least I did.   About a week.
---
Nice r u on ps4?
---
Selling for caps to robots since I already have 90,000 scrip worth of cursed weapons that weigh less. Already bought a bunch of X-01 plans and just keep selling the junk Grandma gave me.
---
I barely got jack out of my close to 600 scrip. Like I don‚Äôt really know whats good on here but for my the way i play i got nothing but a revolver with 90% reduced weight which i always keep anything with that perk.
---
Lol. Zed here wrecking my possible buy.. I only broke 10k caps this week.. much less 20k..
---
Scripted them and when I ran out of script, I just sold them to a vendor.  I don't have room in my stash for thing that won't sell well and/or quickly.
---
drops a 1\* nocturnal bat
---
Ooof. I'm CST and today is my late shift, so I'm not going to be home until 10pm my time. Which is like 4am your time.
---
UN is NikolasHawke by the way
---
How do you know this WOULDN'T fix the game?
---
Yeah same, logged in daily including with the double score and xp. I even quit playing for 2 weeks and completed somewhere at the start of August.
---
I figured since day one tho that you'll always be able to complete the scoreboard if you remain ahead of the icon
---
Yea if the police symbol is either covered, changed, or fully faded it makes sense. Should exist.
---
sheeeooot... my lvl 20 chainsaw has not left my inventory since i got it lvl 21... still rips everything a new one... and a few more on top of that. it's my go-to 'SBQ has landed!' weapon.
---
Because bethesda can't release content without it breaking the game even more than it already is üòÇ
---
I just tried it. That didn‚Äôt work.
---
Tho the ranger helmet looks bad in this game
---
They do shit damage anyways
---
Everyone thinks so but i have my doubts about One Wasteland really being an issue. Imo
---
Thanks, I think I will do that
---
Yeah I looked, thus why I am asking
---
I might still be up, reply when your available and if I don't reply then I'll probably be asleep.
---
Youtube helps
---
I turn my stovetop to a low-med heat and throw some butter and oil in it with some garlic. I bring it to a simmer and then add my shitty purveyor rolls, letting them brown on one side before flipping them and letting the other side brown. Add in a little broth and herbs to season and flavor and let it simmer more before pouring it into a blender. Blend til its a puree and return to the stove in a pot with more broth to reheat and add the final chopped bits of shitty rolls for added flavor. Let it cool and serve with Lure Weed.
---
I swear I spent like a week researching online, looking up YT vids, everything just trying to find out how to start the Mothman quest line...died a little when I realized there was none
---
For sure man. If you are asleep, we could swap a different day, unless you get it from someone else first
---
Well, I can add an emitter to a cowboy hat in about exactly 3 seconds. Then when i drag it into the game world you would have just that. A cowboy hat with a spotlight. The trick is to turn it on and off, but since i already have the code from existing hats, I can drag the code to turn it on and off. That's another 30 seconds. Compile and now I have a  working flashlight cowboy hat. 
---
If you have a light that is pointed the wrong direction, its a 5 second fix to turn the emitter to the proper axis, as long as its repeatable and not just your helmet. 
---
But there's the old saying that you can't turn a cruise ship on a dime. If the programmer has 300 items on a list to do before 25 days are out, someone needs to make a priority to bump something else and a cosmetic non gamebreaking bug probably isn't going to do it.
---
Nice...
---
possibly
---
Landed one from ACP the other day, without any damage perks it still packs a wallop! ü§ô
---
1000 scrip gives 20 three star weapons, hopefully you get 2 interesting items. This leaves you with 18 three star weapons to scrip at 3 per day, sale goes for a few days allowing you to buy 9 more three stars while also scripping 12 of the crap ones. Leaving 12-15 crappy three stars to scrip over the next 4-5 days. So in conclusion two saturdays from now all the three stars should be gone from your inventory.
---
Should split 1 of them with 2 2 rolls, that way you can get the full 150 back each day. Honestly I kinda wish I had done most if not all with 2 * rolls. Doubles your chances of getting something good and the third * rarely makes a huge difference.
---
Reminds me a lot about the storm events in No Mans Sky and Mad Max spawning in special loot
---
I support this 100%
---
I dont want atoms though... I want to be able to play the game... they can give me all the atoms in the world but if I cant play they mean nothing
---
Yea a texture update is in order or different paints like a legacy matte black or a military paint with a roundel/ star on the side. And whatever there is for combat and power armor.
---
Google "unlimited collectrons"
---
Any proof?
---
The helmet is to glossy its black and the visor looks all balck
---
I‚Äôve seen them wipe the floor with small groups of high level scorched. At the least, they‚Äôre better than the majority of the turrets we have available, and certainly have more health.
---
i hate how you can only scrip 3 three star weapons
---
I havent heard anything of this before... When was this added? Also what do they expect me to do? I bought a second copy of the game over a year ago... Legitimately paid full price and everything... nothing malicious or anything involved with the second account.
---
There is actually is some kind of hockey mask that comes with Fallout 1st. Not exactly the same as a classic Jason white hockey mask but it could work.
---
this was thought of before. mods that add hot women (without underwear ü§Æ) prevent bethesda from creating that feature
---
It sounds like it was on pts, so untradeable
---
Hell, id probably be happy taking all of your caps tbf, i believe trying to get 20k would be dreaming a bit, not impossible, but might involve time wasters and people wanting to trade for it.
---
Otw
---
Pc economy is very different from consoles. The only thing that accomplishes is getting hacked stuff on ps4 and Xbox

---
I have no idea if this will let you see it or not. Regardless, this is from a datamine awhile back.
---
Idk I needed help yesterday and got all my stuff resolved and was very happy. 
---
I‚Äôve seen so many people saying Bethesda support is horrible so I didn‚Äôt want to ask them for help at all but it was my bfs idea to just try it and they actually helped me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Chocolate?
---
It is though
---
Ok then make it so you can only transfer to pc from console and console to console make it so pc cannot transfer over
---
Well I checked on the assumption that I had bought all the plans for PA and came up even shorter than yourself. I assume the 4/6 and 10/12 are arms and torso, however I also found I'm only 5/7 on helmet and 5/7 on legs. After going back to vendorbot, I have no plans unlearned for T60 so where are the other plans ? Also if possible could you confirm the plans you have so I can checked against them and see what you have I don't (helm and legs) and see if I have any you don't (torso/arms) that may help figure this out
---
Honestly you‚Äôve probably done better than some üòÇ. That B2525 LMG is a very good gun.
---
Day 37- you locked me in!
---
All my turrets just disappeared one by one in a span of few months
---
A shiny helmet makes no sense essentially removes the point of armor. The exact reason nets were put on helmets during war was to reduce shine. Yea they gotta make the visor red and the helmet matte.
---
Also the green is to yellow on it basically i want a nv version without the ncr marks
---
Cooking with wastlanders
---
no thanks
---
or sharing perks without having teammates
---
Sounds good.
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs funny.
---
You can probably find someone who will trade something more fitting for your build for it as well.  Damn good weapon but you need to love crafting ultracite ammo to get a lot of use from it.  Plenty of people who would want it though.
---
I was playing around with this legendary perk, and even maxed out, you may still need rad away in a nuked zone. I was using some of the best secret service armor pieces I had (mostly vanguard) with a combined total of 612 RR and was still taking +12 rads/sec. Did not try hazmat suit or stealth armor. Now in power armor (Excavator or T-65, it didn't seem to matter), What Rads and Ghoulish kept me at full health.
---
Im sure its very case by case but in my case... its a joke... over a week and no response... not even an automated something

Thank you, not sure why I didn't do that in the first place. Thank you all. Will it likely happen everytime I play?
---
The 76 version just looks terrible. If there are any Marking on the helmet it would be a military star or a glanced bullet or laser burn
---
That'd be great - also so love for the SS armour which is in dire need of skins.
---
I wanna see a Chinese one that's matte gray with a red star that would look amazing imo
---
No I play on xbox, a restart fixed it, glad I didn't have to buy again. I'm hoping it won't happen every time I play.
---
Appreciate it, but there's a ton of oblivious players who will miss this and still ask. Hopefully it helps one or two though.
---
Near perfect for a bloodied two-hander, and on one of the best weapons to boot.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to use cleave when the time comes for maximum carnage and to make Grahm proud that his weapon is being put to good use!
---
I‚Äôd kill to see them add an update where you have full control of power armour customization like Color
---
Thanks. Ok so I have exactly the same list of mods for each piece, yet I'm short on helm and legs? Do you have lamp mods for helm?
---
It wasn't listed as a prize, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Yes sadly otherwise I would be up for trading
---
Youll need a revive in water too, for the swimming badge
---
What annoys me more than the fps drop is the goo and ash piles, they cover the meat piles and make them unlootable. Those noobs wielding gat plasma basically force me to compete with them or I can‚Äôt even loot the ghouls i killed. Thanks to the slow spin up time they don‚Äôt get to make many goo piles.
---
I feel you and agree. But that is not a realistic expectation unfortunately as frustrating as that is. The devs have a nasty habit of releasing new patches and content that breaks other content and systems and have done it consistently for every patch since the middle of last year. Support cant fix it, we cant fix it, modders cant fix it directly so all you can do is personally profit off of their profiteering. I'm not trying to police your behavior just saying nothing you do can fix it so why not walk away with more than feeling 2% better because you let some minimum wage customer support person in Nebraska bear the brunt of your frustration? Get some atoms and use them to buy levels in the new season or pick up a bundle you might never have purchased on your own.
---
LMG is damn nice. Ammo consumption sucks but it's a joy to use.
---
It will not
---
If they change their ToS and you have to accept it, then it will. It happens, the amount of times your phone does it for example, you are agreeing to all these new things.
---
Not saying it is morally justified.
---
I love it when I rock up to Line and the geezers are all corralled into the middle.
---
I simply pick up one of their shitty M79's off the last pack, and every pack that ports in I fire a fat 40mm into the group doing fuck all damage, but tagging everyone. If Tesla's and explosive builds are gonna wipe everything I may as well very cheaply tag the packs first.
---
Legit question, I wonder why Bethesda is so stubborn about discounting modules?  I don't really get it.  You would still be limited in how many you could get.
---
They didn't even put the ghouls in Vault 94 in vaultsuits.. Why would they do this for a weekish?
---
So secondary account for muling is fine.
---
But quitting after you start a NW because you are bored - is now not allowed as it's intentionally losing? :)
---
IIRC I think it will be purchasable.
---
Ok thx guys
---
That's what I did. Bought modules for rolling my SS (I already have full Unyielding set among others like Vanguards, just need better rolls), then I vendor hopped. Seen some good shit on sale for caps.
---
Yea that'd be cool.
---
‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºÅÂêåÂøóÔºÅÁæéÂ∏ùÂøÖË¥•ÔºÅ
---
I assume you'll just plan to swap ammo factory though, right?
---
I mean - that's the ultimate in ease of swapping.  Make ammo once a week and store it.
---
PM'd
---
Someone downvoted you. But, I'm sure it was an accident. I balanced it.
---
I dont have the lamps for the helmet, I dont know if it's just max out and it's like a bug?
---
Very interesting concept!
---
I have but not as much as like. I am easily distracted lol. I assume there is something talking about them being mutated moths.
---
Good point.  I guess it doesn't hurt to try.
---
Yeah really want the to rework some of em the best one is the desert one
---
At level 465, It is still my favorite.  I put the jetpack on an extra torso and doubt I'll ever switch to anything else.
---
I already finished my badges but didn't do the swimming one
---
Shoops helped me out though and happy to say I now have my backpack!
---
I mean... use it at the base level regardless, no?  And just swap it out when not using it?
---
I would say the laser rifle, purely for the weight. Most people who get these weapons end up leaving them in there stash after the first few times of repairing it.
---
I did that in the last 50 sale and yes.... but your toon isn‚Äôt moving again for a few days. That said, not a terrible idea for the remaining rolls
---
I didn't now what BGS was until Fallout 3. Despite the issues from 3 and onward, the issues aren't horrible for the most part. I'm on PC in Fallout games and luckily don't have many issues unlike other people. Any game can have problems and BGS is lacking.    
---
There's a lot they need to do and more for their reputation than anything.    
---
I hate how this Scorched can be 100ft away and then suddenly FLASH run and leap toward you in less than a second. WTF. Where is that ability for ME?    
---
I'm not talking about VATS and Gun Fu(I think). They leap right at me, hit, and then 99.99% of time are behind me.    
---
I really like the CAMP system and for the first time have almost maxed my budget. Nothing flashy.    
---
Pistols and laser weapons are VERY underpowered and ignored. There should be perk cards for laser weapons.    
---
Paying for FT is stupid. Not being able to b/c of combat or over-encumbered is fine.    
---
Making that statement about 76 having only cosmetic items in a shop and no 'pay-to-win' is a good thing but also a chain.    
---
I'm sure many have coming up with new ideas frequently to keep the Shop interesting.    
---
I think there should be more holiday themed skin items with benefits like the Fridge.    
---
Imagine a black cauldron with a wood fire at the bottom. It would have its own unique gloo glow from the contents. It has a small holder for the large spoon that is often with it. You can put 20 (water, food, chems) inside. After a half hour of cooking like the fermentor, you would get temporary benefits but also some temporary efffect on your character.    
---
Vampire fangs, elf ears, tails, cosmetic wings, etc. People around the world would react accordingly. New Halloween themed recipes and skins for armor and weapons.
---
I‚Äôd go with the plasma....
---
We should be able to plant ALL vegetation in the game, outside of Situational stuff like Corpse Flowers and Strangler Blooms.
---
A lot of the plants out there grow like Weeds, and Fungus in general is a a super easy thing to take care of. It's kind of silly that we can't grow that stuff.
---
Just because we can stabilize nuked flora doesn't mean we're smart enough to make soap.
---
That is what I was thinking. A headless PA with a tattered cape.  Would look awesome when you hit Your jet pack.
---
It's the ONLY PA you will ever need. I have all of them and the only set I use is the excavator witj a raider skin and the vault boy head skin.
---
Extra carry weight and more ore per run is more important to me and with emergency protocols i can face tank Earle or SBQ no problem. 
---
But with all PA poison is the real enemy.
---
*my character building nuclear reactor* "What was that mate?"
---
This is essentially why I don't already have it. Lol
---
Though I'm a day 1 player that doesn't often bitch.
---
I haven't been on the PTS, but in my private world last night I had a run like I've never had before.  Got several really nice 3\* Bloodied/Unyielding pieces, a couple nice 2\* ones, a Bolstering Sentinel's, a Vanguard's Cavalier and a ton of scrip weapons.  Game crashed, and the next server was not generous at all.  Not sure what caused the fluke, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.
---
What time do you usually play?  I could private server and we could do the power plant
---
Have Grahm deliver the mail
---
fukka sale.. who needs it really? I mean the way scrip backs up a sale is all but useless
---
I'd say plasma only because I've been dying to have one but that's my biased opinion haha
---
Just dm them.its that simple.
---
Not next season, buy it is Bethesda so they will no doubt reuse it as a prize for some other event like they have done with damn near every other event.
---
Elite riot gear that's my favorite.
---
Looks the most badass.
---
No
---
I will continu to use my tesla for this type of event, not the player fault if it's bug af, and it will be fix in the patch 22
---
I've had runs like that where I get God tier weapons but its been awhile on on the main game
---
Is realism really the topic you want to encroach when talking about the Fallout franchise?
---
Since the HD releases, it's basically been a wasteland themepark RPG for casuals. IF you wanted for some reason to transform this marshmellow funland into some gritty post apocolyptic survival game, you'd need to remove basically everything that has made this franchise popular in the first place.
---
At that point, you would be much better off playing a game designed with that sort of play in mind from the beginning, rather than a game with a half-baked implementation of a mechanic that has been tacked on to what was functionally designed to be a single player experience from the beginning.
---
I'm not against a wasteland survival game, I totally dig that. I just don't think that Fallout is the title for that. The people that were going to love Fallout 76 were supposed to be the people that loved the previous fallouts, not people looking for a hardcore online PVP experience. It was just never going to be.
---
I haven't found this to be necessary - I just hotkey the one I want to get addicted to and pop it every few seconds until I'm addicted. It takes around 5. I read somewhere you need to at least exit your pipboy between each ingestion if you're taking it by clicking in your inventory, though I dunno, that might only be true of the singleplayer fallouts where entering the pipboy stopped time.
---
Actually let me rephrase that the helmet is my favorite you can see the visor
---
1300 fps sounds a bit much, heh. Glad you found the file and it worked in the end. The menu does not matter, but if you ever experience movement problems - usually indoors while in PA, sometimes you can only move in one direction, sometimes not at all - you should limit the max framerate for FO76.exe as I mentioned above.
---
Oh crap. Ok tks. Just got home from work and have max script and was ready to get lots of the modules. I don't need them...but for some reason, the crafting surprise legendaries is more exciting than just getting them from monurgahhhhhhb.....*msp Ha
---
Lol.i am also an army of one.üëçüòé
---
&gt; The most common reason would be a muling account for storage or transferring items among your primary account characters.
---
Well that's pretty damn stupid considering how limited the stash space is lol
---
I plant myself next to one of the workers and have a good old time with a SS ghoul slayers switchblade.    Boatload of meat piles, around me, but so far, the goo-makers leave me and that pile alone :)
---
But is that lazy reactor going to get on it's hands and knees and clean under the fridge?
---
This is good news.  I have a quad faster fire faster reload that I use for tagging, but I stopped using it a while ago because my frame rates dropped to single digits.
---
Its my main mission when i log in.finding ammo or go buy the rescources to make a ton.
---
i took like 25 drugs/alcohol in about 7 seconds and got addicted fine.
---
I don't but ammo that is over 1 cap.i make all my own ammo but sometimes i like to help out by buying it.
---
I got Beckett as my minion to deal with that kind of stuff tho
---
Nah, If you make the limit high enough that it basically never gets hit, then it's fine. I'm not frustrated there is a limit, I'm frustrated because I hit it literally very day, and my stash is full of crap. if the limit was 2500 a day, I would be fine, no way am I hitting that unless I hoard useless legionaries for no reason.
---
Yea I like the helmet too. The insight to the yangtze battle. The green in the visor (forgive me if I got that wrong haven used it in a while).
---
I'd never leave my base.
---
If you're not doing this already, when you log in, first thing you should do is hit the Social tab and join a team. You don't have to play with them at all if you don't want to, but you'll get stat increases while you're playing. You can also fast travel to their CAMPs for free, which will both help you move around the map more easily, and give you a chance to check out their vendors - look for low level legendary weapons and armour, you'll sometimes find them cheap and it's a good way to pick up some interesting stuff.
---
Most other games would just add the shit into your inventory. But I forgot Bethesda is just a *small, indie company* that can't do that :D
---
The worst part is,that you cannot even see the damn monicle when i put it on.lol.completely useless.maybe if it gave you +1 perception.
---
&gt; they cover the meat piles and make them unlootable
---
That's the worst part.
---
Had some jerk at a glitched Line in the Sand use a Tesla on the group each time they spawned in. The whole area was covered in ash piles by the end of it, so nothing was lootable. And the asshole disappeared as soon as the event was over, so they knew exactly what they were doing (ie: griefing).
---
\+100 carry weight out of the box, +200 carry weight when modded with calibrated shocks on both legs.
---
I cant complain about it at all - although I have all the other PA sets, at L241, when I need PA, I‚Äôm in Excavator.
---
Someone had a really cool idea that the helmet had its own night vision thought that be cool
---
man when I suggested this last month the thread was taken down in about an hour when it morphed into requests for dick pics mods for PCs.
---
Damn thanks never thought of that 
---
Anything major I should also be on the lookout for??
---
This. Rolled god tier weapon and haven't even pull an item I can sell for caps since 
---
On the other hand god tier weapon

It does make sense as the gear was used by primarily by spec-ops and marines.

One time I fast traveled into someone‚Äôs foundation while they were in the room. I could turn circles and look around, but couldn‚Äôt walk. I know it was a male player, because he immediately dropped what he was doing and proceeded to tea-bag me repeatedly. He then gave a thumbs up and went back to what he was doing. I was in tears laughing so hard. This is the joy of online gaming.
---
Yeah I think it be cool
---
Who wants some nocturnal gear? Gonna be so meta after Patch 22? /s
---
I killed a 3* Scorchbeast to be greeted with a 1* lead pipe. I kill a 3* commie bot (DIRTY LITTLE BASTARDS) and get a 3* BE50 handmade. This is where you‚Äôll think I‚Äôm cheating - not long after, I rolled a BEFMSWA handmade from another 3* Scorchbeast.
---
Probably is just a bug, but weird that we have different numbers for helm and leg though.
---
I paid my way through Vault-Tec U with purified water proceeds.
---
No melee ones for my main.    
---
As a Stealth Sniper, Follow Through would be my first, INT second, and END last as my main is only 117.
---
Yup other that T45 my favorite armor is ranger armor  looks wise.
---
No, it sounds like you got a good server and RNGesus smiled at you
---
Now he shall ignore you for the rest of your life /s (lol)
---
Got same roll, but on a handmade. Next 4k scrip were just rocks. So I am in the same boat as you.
---
They put hats on scorched for Christmas, why not just Halloween masks on all the bots? That would make white spring awesome..
---
Ultrasight is my favorite power armor
---
If I could buy things from players without the time it took to hop everywhere, wow.
---
You can, but unless Bethesda have changed things it costs a perk coin to swap out a legendary perk, so it's something I don't want to be doing too often.
---
its called using a glitch. just because its one you like doesn't mean its not abusing a glitch
---
Emeril Lega-cy
---
See me when you get home ill give you stuff
---
No. The other option can be problematic with the modding system.
---
What are they gonna do? *Stop me?*
---
I'd enjoy wall mounted turrets tho, those pack quite a punch and are small, best of both.
---
Oh, damn.  That's news to me.  All of the reading/watching I did (steam, so can't PTS)  - I never came across that bit.
---
Don't put them anywhere except for the ground. I've learned that the hard way.
---
Sweet! I was planning on sending a request just in case but awesome. I'll see you soon then, thank you
---
No citable source, just a friend who accidentally forgot his starched genes off and contracted herbivore. Ended up fixing it by just taking a carnivore serum.
---
Ran an Earle event with 2 people spamming teslas we started the event with 8 there were about 4 left in the end. I ran into the drill and sat up top as the lag in the mine was getting to bad but i didn't crash, there were a few minutes left and wouldn't you believe it, his health just plummeted. Saved my ammo and got my rewards I do the same for line in the sand. Stay far away and just take my notes.
---
I just ignore it and use it as usual. Drops are so rare anyways its better to have some scrip if I need it.
---
I get one small burst of good luck in a game. I‚Äôm gonna suffer for that dearly in real life for the next 20 years.
---
I think it's in relation of griefing autofill teammates - they seem to have focused on griefing a lot in these CoC changes
---
The experimental series (X series) looks cool too
---
Friend accidentally contracted herbivore so he took carnivore and it gave him that and removed herbivore. Not sure exactly what he did, but I assume he had taken off starched genes!
---
No, you might get lucky. Might only be 19 years
---
You'll burn through repair kits like a motherfucker with that BE laser rifle.
---
Looks like a bug to me lol
---
I mean, I would be fine if they just didn't encourage it. But with the massive unban wave of all those mule accounts, they're actively sending out the message that cheating is acceptable behavior and won't lead to punishment. Would have been better if they did nothing at all because then at least some people would still be dissuaded by the illusion of a potential punishment
---
we really do
---
I used a different method focuses more on the roofs no flamethrower needed. Some things are semi-blocked.
---
All of mine are working, but the horizontal projection is extremely dim and I can almost never see it even in the darkest nights. What I find works well is building it on top of a placed power armor, the downward projection seems strongest and that makes it more visible for me. You could probably do that to make a UFO invasion with season 2's train set, too.
---
Knowing my luck it‚Äôll be more like 40.
---
BOOM.
---
Xbox users who make free smurfs sweat nervously
---
you should blow up all those cars
---
It doesn't hurt to try them out for a bit. Hella good rolls.
---
Ok so how do you have 12k scrip at once? 5k for 5 characters. Do you have 3 accounts or something?
---
X-02 is the best of the series
---
After a partal playthrough of fallout 4 with only X-01 I've lost the bug look.
---
Lol that‚Äôs one way of seeing this. Thank you for the peek -vault tech overseer 097
---
I was thinking something like that or the rockstar editor where you have to place the objects into a 3rd party system run by the developer. Seems like there needs to be something Bethesda has made to differentiate what we took photos of in-game vs what we put into our camera roll. Just seems way too simple when they had to attach it to load screens, a complicated photography mechanic, etc.
---
I thought the enclave hell fire armor was the best I think thats what its called
---
Thanks for the info.  Appreciate it.
---
I want this built for me i have the pieces and plenty of ideas im on xbox and will pay glady 15000 caps for you to build this for me i am a avid builder but round has eluded me for so long and im not about to try round floating intersecting insanity also those fighter ships 100% im amazed
---
EDIT: PLZ upvote so this person see's this plee
---
I get it, but on the other hand I wanted to get it over quick and get to the next thing, legendary run fever
---
PS4? ill sell you mine.  Shoot I put another one in my vendor for 2500 and the first guy bought it.
---
Sounds great. And you should be able to paint some graffitis
---
It's been a day one bug/gift for my main character and then happened about half way through the rep grind on my secondary character.
---
It's not the player fault it's buggy af.
---
Agreed, since the new update, had my own problems with the social menu (mine is: can't join others in the social menu as opposed to it not showing up). Tried solving it my own ways or waiting to see if it fixes itself eventually, it didn't. So i decided to use support, long story short: They gave me a bunch of solutions that involved my network (obviously a few automated responses).
---
The problem started during the last update and many others have the same problem, so I'm not 100% sure but while it COULD be a network issue, I'm thinking the likelihood of it being something on their end is much higher.
---
Regardless, couldn't find a fix and got a message basically stating to wait until the next update.  At least there was an attempt, but they definitely need to improve.
---
Best looking. X-03 is the strongest.
---
Some things have a special trick to them like the concrete stairs need a foundation to put them down (clip to)
---
BUT if you attach the concrete stairs to the second foundation connecting to the original foundation you can delete the foundation connecting to the stairs and the anchored foundation
---
Leaving the concrete stairs by themselves.
---
How I found this out I have not a clue even to this day üòÖ
---
Have faith. I picked up 2 this past week for 1k each in player vendors. They're out there.
---
That's all I can think of for now mate - pretty much just explore, get a feel for what weapons you like, find a good spot for your CAMP and build it up, and check out any events you see on the map with a few people already joined, it's a good way to get XP, pick up loot, and learn how the events work. Daily and weekly challenges should come back next week so get involved with those as well.
---
Those would work as well, though I don‚Äôt think the firing angles would be great.
---
Just imagine how bad it is on PC then, on top of that there are hacked beam splitter .50 cals and nuke miniguns. Or beam splitter explosive tesla shotguns
---
Hah. I did that today! Based on some of the other comments, I added Ricochet (and a bunch of other good stuff), then ran a nuke silo with my friend this afternoon. Was crazy how much it went off in there! And overall I felt a lot stronger. Might have to post up the changes I made. Really happy with it!
---
I hope they fuckinf execute those fucntz they fucking ruined the game I'm so fucking angry at all the backing that happened and my wife hit person ally scammed of her very good weapons and then they were PROVABLY sold on the internet proBAbly EBSY or something like that and I've never been so angry at these hackers who ate ptofiijng off of the misery of other waadtelanders
---
TL:zr FUCK THEM
---
PC, unfortunately, but I really appreciate the offer!!!
---
The same time score resets the day ends.
---
Still have no clue when vendors reset, it's not the same time.
---
I got a junkies 25/25 fixer but don‚Äôt run that build or trade. Not quite sure what to do with it, I might just try out junkies
---
They don‚Äôt have loot worth having. Ever. So I make it into a game. How far can I make the Scorchbeast fly off after death? Best results have been mag dumping it with a BE laser and making it die during a crop dust.
---
sell your weapons and buy a junkies heavy
---
Yeah? I'll keep an eye out. Part of me wants to earn it out of spite, seen as I've put so much effort into this fucking event hahaha
---
Oh just cus you don't know how you salty üòè its a base that the game let him build not even like he buget glitched or anything maybe call it a bug cus the floating walls but full on glitch im laughing
---
Damn, that junkies handmade is my dream.  All I got so far is a Q/FFR/1Agility railway rifle... which sounds like pure concentrated death, so I'm not complaining.
---
Though the previous model can be made as strong as the next model when F or MK VI. I do see how that mistake could be made due to my wording.
---
I started the game yesterday and first thing I see is working showers in the vault. Haven‚Äôt played long enough to see if that‚Äôs normal, but come on Bethesda, it‚Äôs not that hard, if people can mod that into fo4.
---
The hell is a toon?
---
As far as support goes, theirs isn't the worst in the industry, but it's hit or miss. I submitted an issue when I was stuck in a PA frame a few months after launch, I got a semi-automated response telling me they can not restore lost items and the ticket was closed. It was obvious that a human didn't even read the post because my only request was to find a way of getting me out of the frame. I had to come here and find out that dropping all your fusion cores and emptying your current one let you get ejected. I asked for refunds in the past year for two atom shop items that were horrendously broken, and although it took 10 and 7 days respectively to get a reply, those went fine
---
Awesome! Thank you :)
---
Just saw this on PC
---
They would actually have to search first.  No one does.
---
After tracking down the stuff for Tadpole Cooking Badge, I can't see why most if not all harvestsable plants aren't in CAMPS.
---
Could you imagine the glowing mushrooms as a source of illumination?
---
Not to mention Cranberry on hand would help with the XP boosts.
---
So You good sir are the reason I need to find a different world.
---
I dump some at the vendor, anything half way decent goes in mine, save a couple for the rest of the week (but I also get legendaries as it goes)
---
Don‚Äôt worry about saving too many for scrip, it‚Äôs available cheap this week if you‚Äôre short
---
Sorry I don't build for others.
---
Literally would take days with a guest/friend build of placing/storing or deleting.
---
Basically it would come down to me having to borrow your account build it and then give it back to you and I'm not about to do something like that sorry üòÖü§∑
---
I appreciate the offer though and thanks for checking out my camp you're more than welcome to stop by gamer tag is in some of the photos at the bottom üëç
---
No problem! Hopefully it helps. Also possible this is bugged and doesn‚Äôt always work or something. You never know what will be wrong in 76 lol
---
Same reason tbey won‚Äôt budge on these script/cap/bullion limits.   To keeps us logging in everyday.
---
Relaunched and it cleared.
---
I have been shopping a lot for the past week and no dice.  I see everything else but Junkies heavies in peoples vendors. Maybe people are hoarding for patch 22.
---
I know the feeling and tried as well. Then I learned the drop rate was, like, 2%. That's when I started building my caps back up..lol.
---
It's a permanent event so you will get it eventually. It just boils down to how long are you willing to wait?
---
Best of luck, no matter which route you go.
---
Honestly, iirc, each cursed weapon has a 12 percent chance to drop, this 36 percent of the time you'll get a cursed weapon vs 5 percent on the mask.
---
I've received everything from the event multiple times except the mask.  I bought 2 of them cheaply enough, one for a char to use, another for display.
---
You KILLED HIM HOW DARE YOU
---
Hail modus :|
---
I spread scrip across two of my characters, otherwise, I stash em and sell or drop the rest at the Rusty Pick.
---
They need to drop the scrip limit on deal days , I‚Äôd like to sell all my trash too
---
I‚Äôm with the stop blaming people part, but some people are trolling events on purpose with Tesla‚Äôs.
---
Lol...3 PS4s, 2 mains, 13 mules.... You can't stop this train Zenimax, I'll agree to your silly CoC only because this train never stops...choo choo mofos!! I do what I want!!
---
I'm gonna do a hard reset. Hopefully it'll fix.
---
I get it i need some pointers on intersecting roofs if you got time ill deffinetly check it out
---
Don't make me more upset then I already am, I wanted him alive
---
What lvl are you and what are your goals? Do you want high traffic to sell and easy access to vendors but have to hop around to find a server?
---
Do you want a place near what you‚Äôre working on for cheap fast travel?
---
Do you want resources? Which ones?
---
That is going to depend on what you are looking for and what you like.
---
Your character. Or characters, up to five per account.
---
I just started playing it yesterday. And I think I‚Äôm level 5
---
2k scrip and a whole bucket of sadness.  I am right there with ya.
---
Worst timing ever. Some of us could do with the scrip to make the most of the sale
---
I could prob trade you scorched
---
Gt Bandos Exile
---
I got a junkies gatling and a junkies 50 cal in my vendor on Xbox. Gatling ain‚Äôt cheap but the 50 is reasonable. Both 3 star, I‚Äôm not on so I don‚Äôt have the specs for the other stars
---
Friends list showing up for me is like flipping a coin: half the time it happens and half the time it doesn‚Äôt lmao
---
The best one I got for resale is a bloodied Bow.  Who the heck uses a bow?  fed76 says like 5000 caps so yippie!
---
Lol but srsly I accidentally bought something and got it refunded, just submit a refund ticket with the option ‚Äúitem is missing‚Äù and you should get a faster response
---
Haven't had any trouble with 1st on Xbox.
---
crap.  I am on PS4.  Thanks though.  I would love either or.
---
Dingo, my day job - when I do it well - is exposing myself to others (not like that, you fiends). 
---
I know it can be hard to open yourself up like this (again, fiends, stop), but well done for writing and sharing.
---
Do you have the original one or just the BOS?
---
Don‚Äôt stress your camp too much, I‚Äôd recommend the lake basin near Charleston. It‚Äôs a good place for your level to exist, just pick a little patch of water, you will need 2 low level turrets ideally 
---
After that move the camp to where it makes sense for where you are leveling, eventually you get a lay of the land and can put it wherever you want
---
I hope so, it hurt me inside, Beckett got emotional when trying to get his brother back, now he's telling me he's dead
---
Ign? I'll give you one for free.  Have at least 5 in my stash right now.
---
Edit: logging off.  hopefully you track one down.
---
I got one good roll from 4000 scrip, an Instigating SS Agility Powerfist. So 2 is better than that.... and those are tasty.
---
If it‚Äôs worth 5k, someone uses it.
---
I already have the plasma, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm getting 2 offers (each with one of the weapons I mentioned) and am just wondering which is more valuable for trading. I‚Äôm a bloodied heavy build and so I probably won‚Äôt keep either around, def not the plasma since I already got one lmao
---
Last night I rolled 9 SS pieces and 6 of them were 1 stars, and out of those 6 I got 3 bolstering 1 star pieces. What are the odds of getting 3 of the same 1 star pieces back to back. Infuriating.
---
When I was heavy on the legendary hunt and always had leftovers after filling my scrip limits, I'd throw them in my vendor for like 10-15 caps per scrip and sold them to peeps too lazy to farm or could find some halfway decent starter gear. Whatever didn't sell the day before became the next days starting scrip. And the cycle continued.
---
I think this was how they fixed his repeating quest, because i saved him too, and after they did that patch to fix his repeating quest he acts like he‚Äôs dead.
---
So far: Furious Tesla FFR 90% - not bad
---
Awesome this is great news, I enjoy it but the waiting time killed it for me. Appreciate the heads up. üëç
---
And here you admitted to breaking the new TOS.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre in the wrong. I‚Äôm saying the new TOS is stupid.
---
That sucks. I‚Äôm planned to unlock the gauss shotgun today
---
If I didn't suck big floppy donkey dick at C.A.M.P.s I'd try it as the only thing I like more than Fallout is Trek.
---
Seriously though
---
No, it's not. Bloodied build in PA is hard to kill. The only problem is DoT effects, fire and poison, but physical damage is not a problem at all.
---
To add to the previous points there is no need to go big early on a simple 3x3 cross pattern building can hold all of your work benches and a bed. That will save you those early resources for later when you find that perfect spot for you.
---
I got a 10mm sub BERW. That was my best roll. 3k spent.
---
Besides increased carry weight and double mining bonus?
---
That's just upsetting, makes me feel like there's no point in being able to choose
---
Hail Kovac
---
Then I'd argue don't put SCORE challenges on a mode people aren't willing to play.
---
I generally try to finish the match. But seriously you can't tell me the 'place a CAMP' isn't followed by a rash of immediate quitting.
---
How much for flux?
---
Yes... I would like to be drunk and playing FO76 on my birthday... at least a few hours.
---
11 characters plus the scrip i can turn in today...12k scrip. 3 accounts. been saving for a while.
---
It‚Äôs not what? Lmao
---
Lost count how many times I've ended up inside someones foundation. Scrapped 3 of my own bases and started again because of it.
---
It‚Äôs been broken since the big Christmas vendor fiasco.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anything in recent patchnotes but it‚Äôd be better to post it on the BSG Community Board
---
The B25/BE LMG has the highest DPS of any non-legacy gun in the game. Hell, it‚Äôs even better than some legacies. But the ammo.... don‚Äôt even get me started. Bethesda really needs to add a 5.56 receiver mod, even if it means nerfing the damage of the weapon.
---
Then you wouldn't be able to give them to people, considering you get 6 per craft with chemist just post your platform and ask somebody to craft you them.
---
Don worry about getting the sample back.  you need to either complete it on a private server or server hop to get it down.  Its a known bug.  You are looking for a server that someone has not completed the quest recently.  It may take a few or several hops but it can be done.
---
You just play
---
Before?
---
A lot of post-quest stuff feels that way in this game.  I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs broken or nobody bothered to close things out properly.  Most of foundation underground doesn‚Äôt acknowledge what we did or the bonds we forged.  It is a huge bummer and sadly par for the course in how a lot of things are treated in the game (i.e. half assed)
---
Yup you sure can! You can't really fast travel to a teammate's workshop, BUT unlike their camp, you can freely build whatever at a workshop with a team. So it's the closest thing to free-form building with randoms in the game you can do right now haha.
---
Bethesda can‚Äôt even figure out why my in game photos disappear with each big update let alone figure out how to successfully do this. So many photos gone that I can‚Äôt remake.
---
On bosses it's pretty much useless, but that's an excellent tool for clearing rooms you've got there.
---
What do you play on? I could possibly help you find a place and get set up
---
if you're on xbone i can hook you up. same for anyone else who needs 3
---
Load the game.  Test the controls to remind yourself which buttons do what.  Pick a quest or challenge to work towards, or just run around shooting creatures and gathering loot.
---
I would rather project paradise be triggerable. It has great rewards but so hard to coordinate a good team.
---
I‚Äôve spent a while vendor hopping and everyone always sells the extremely common plans for at least 50 caps each. Anyone who‚Äôs mid to high level already knows these and asking 50 caps from a low level is really pushing it. I‚Äôm glad you found one man. And us high levels help low levels out a lot. It may be rare in other games but here in 76 it‚Äôs a fact of life.
---
Or put the score challenges in such a way that has an outcome from trying to win.
---
I like the survive time one for example.
---
What console? Most times if you make a post in an LFG thread you‚Äôll get bites.
---
The game has changed a lot, but the mechanics are the same.
---
I‚Äôd say just wing it and go for it. It‚Äôs a pretty vast map and they‚Äôve added lots of new content including NPCs and more.
---
Typically do 100 each
---
Imagine headless, unkillable mobs being present from day 1 and never fixed. Oh wait. You play FO76. You don't need to imagine that.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering about this for awhile I assumed it was just a glitch on my end.
---
That happened to me yesterday. So I logged out and logged back in later and it was there.
---
I‚Äôd appreciate that as well
---
And that they also have no plan of fixing, like most major bugs in this game.
---
That 3-4 is from level 68 mobs. Maybe T-65 provides 4-5 but with the diminishing returns on DR/ER it is negligible thus having a flat 100 carry weight bonus is better. 
---
Also personal testing T-51b vs Excavator being a bloodied build with EP on both and using blocker and dodgy I do not even notice a difference. 
---
So in that case utility outclasses bigger but shitter numbers for how Bethesda rounds damage numbers.
---
"but literally anything can one shot you" &lt;- it's not THAT
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty shitty, you spend all that script to try and get Good weapon Nd then they don‚Äôt even carry enough script to sell it back to them and get rid of it.
---
I think turrets have something to do with turrets, just like how they shoot shit.
---
I took all mine away and my raider punk hasn't done it in awhile.
---
Plus my turrets didn't do shit.
---
Awesome, let me know if you want me to hop on in a little while
---
I went to mod an old set of excavator earlier and could attach the communist jetpack to the excavator torso. Don't know if it's a bug or not.
---
Yeah I tried that several times before but eso just abducts next back , like I want to play the game frequently
---
I miss the settlements, but not the announcement that another one needed my help.
---
If I'm capped out for the day, I will often leave all the stuff I can't sell at someone's camp.
---
If Bethesda would just get it right (dlc, cosmetics, etc) the first time the negativity would go away..  Instead of doing this they have inferior designers/programmers that fuck up at every turn...
---
one of the best matches I was in only had 18 people at start. circle was smaller and it was a mad dash to find stuff. of course the level 200 guy won the whole thing, but who doesn't like a top 20 finish?
---
Took me forever to find some. Almost impossible to finish project paradise with all three alive
---
Oh man.  Isn‚Äôt that the truth.
---
How long after this is added till PC users add non in game photos. Maybe some photos of Todd Howard half clothed in a manly photo or him in a teletubby costume with a shotgun?
---
God, I would love some death stranding crossover
---
Since half of Appalachia is already decorated for Halloween anyway, I'd say any time is fair game üéÉ
---
Is there any goals to do so ? Like , do you play to get to a certain goal that keeps changing with time ?
---
Nice.
---
2 shots behemoth, nice roll I only gonna say trail fireworks
---
It's returning this year for xmas.
---
I just hope they do something different than presents due to them being so duped that's there's millions of them.
---
Abuse is 100% the reason why they don't let this happen, sadly.
---
Stack exp buffs and do it all again.
---
The value is kinda misleading. 5k is just how much it‚Äôs worth comparably to other items. There are 2-3 other cap values listed that tell you quick vendor price(which is much less), how much you can get for selling directly to a specific player, and what the most you could get would be in a niche market. 
---
That 5 will probably only be a 1-2k turnaround in a vending machine
---
I‚Äôve returned with wastelanders , played a little and left again , I‚Äôm quite shy with strangers so I‚Äôll need some getting used to before I play + I‚Äôm not an advanced player, is there a discord server or something for pc players ?
---
A flashlight mod for weapons would be awesome too!
---
Christ if they made it 160 a day I'd be happy haha
---
That really is the biggest bummer about all this.
---
76 is an MMO at its core.    
---
Random rolls are normal for them. I've had less than 5 good ones for one character. My second is a shotgun build so good luck getting one of those. I did get 2 good pieces of armor for it.    
---
The SS armor rolls aren't that much better in results. My first two chest pieces got a 3 star Unyeilding(1st) and a Nocturnal 3 star. IMO, it's designed as a risk vs reward or lottery. You get one or two 'wins' and keep playing just to be disappointed 999% of the time.    
---
What's the point of a Troubleshooter's Boxing Glove?
---
full building team, sleep, cranberry pie, etc.....higher your INT the more xp you get. egg head mutation, low health and unyielding armor. run and gun buddy and you'll get your levels!
---
I would love this!
---
This game is a steaming pile of broken, time gated almost mobile like shit. But it‚Äôs my steaming pile of broken, time gated almost mobile like shit.
---
Definitely a bug, but that's not to say I didnt put the red scare on my suit.  It's too good to pass up, and it's funny watching that one person that catches it and looks at me and gets that look like "huh....that ain't right..."
---
One wasteland the enemies level in theory you should be leveling faster if you can wait til Tuesday
---
No, check other posts. It‚Äôs out Tuesday at your refresh time.
---
Will have to hit you up later then. In your vendor?
---
gt: rammadeus. if you can send me an xbone message in 20 mins i'll be on then
---
Watching The Last Boy Scout right meow.
---
I sent a friend request lmk when I can see this masterpiece
---
I honestly like them, but then again every time I‚Äôve messaged them they could help me. Screwed up and bought an item while rushing through daily quests and they credited me back the atoms.
---
and if you see the surface to air event right next to general's steakhouse, watch south and don't let the scorchbeasts get off the ground. our team record is 15 at that event. easy level up.
---
Yeah I agree. In fact this has been suggested so many times. I‚Äôd love for this to be included in the game.
---
Will the legendary perks potentially get you there faster?
---
can do it through trade
---
Private server works. Fuse first.
---
Oh yeah? My CAMP is a 2x2 box. 
---
Fine. This is amazing!!!!
---
"red scare" that's the name, I couldn't think of it. When I went in too mod my t-65 it said SS jetpack mod for the arms. Defo something screwed up with PA armour then. Hopefully get to keep the jetpack when they patch it.
---
Lmg is a cursed weapon
---
Jet pack 65 arms!!!!!
---
Hold up while I go check and see.  Thatd be the bomb for me.
---
Prefer vendor, no offense, just lost 5k in caps back in the day due to a player trade.
---
Frames will start at 1500 atoms
---
Of course they weren‚Äôt. They‚Äôve never been on sale.
---
You have to hit the share button and then hit save video and it will save the last 15 minutes of game play
---
I do. I went back and started a new run. This time I gave sim settlements a try. I‚Äôd always assumed that mod was for people who didn‚Äôt enjoy settlement building (it can be), but as a hardcore settlement builder, I‚Äôm having a blast with it!
---
Also, my 1st yearly membership is coming close to an end. Bethesda, if you don‚Äôt get the workshop permanence figured out for private worlds, I‚Äôm out. I haven‚Äôt purchased any camp items in about 6 months. Don‚Äôt need the stuff if I can‚Äôt use it (permanently) elsewhere.
---
This title is misleading. It has nothing to do with mules. 5.2 specifically states it is in regrades to competitive gaming. It bans ‚Äúunsportsmanlike conduct such as use of secondary accounts.‚Äù  
---
No one cares about your mules. Just don‚Äôt throw NW matches by using dummy accounts.
---
Well shit I‚Äôm fucked then. I just logged out right away. Fuck sakes.
---
Halloween Fallout first tent, more decors and in game items to earn!
---
None taken mate ill put it in when your on then so people wont take it before you get here
---
If it happened within the last 15 you can still save it
---
Quite likely closer to 750-1000caps, but yeah.
---
Cool idea, some kind of description would be really welcome.  No description? No visit! LOL
---
Oh I love how these creatures fuck up my stealth
---
Daily and weekly challenges.
---
You can also change the duration of time it saves, up to I believe 2 hours of gameplay.
---
If you spawn into a camp and immediately fall or get stuck, just fast travel to the camp again and it will plant you some place better. I always fall at my camp but the second fast travel never repeats it, it'll just let me hover on air and I can just jump onto my camp from there.
---
I only see a save screenshot option and SHARE video
---
Fallout 76 is awesome until. . . You end up selling legendaries to npc vendors just for more inventory space to move shit out of your already full stash into your inventory when the 150 daily script cap becomes too real. . . . . . . .
---
There's always going to be those players. I've been playing since launch and have never had anyone grief my camp, and have only been grief killed 3 times in all this time. 
---
Don't let it discourage you.
---
Do you have passive mode on by chance?
---
Don't think I got it but I'm on now if you want to check it out still working on it at the moment
---
No. Section 5.2 is in regards to using multiple accounts for unsportsmanlike conduct in competitive gaming. OP is misrepresenting facts in order to get more internet points.
---
Line in the sand with an explosive automatic? If its dropping the scorched right on the center due to a player tent, i was getting 1500+ xp per wave by tagging most of the mob with explosive guns.
---
In the 90s level wise i gained 3-4 levels with just part of the event.
---
Press share then square to save videos to the capture gallery. From there you can edit it and upload it.
---
Yes and for those of us with miss matched armor sets screw you says bethesda. Not all of us are decked out in full sets of matching armor ffs.
---
Yes I do. And this was unprovoked. Apparently it‚Äôs yet ANOTHER BUG
---
I can give you a Nuka-Cola Scorched if you still need it.
---
Didn‚Äôt they have mailboxes in the datamine a while back? Whatever happened to them?
---
Where is this word wall?
---
Never have i ever completed teh legendary run
---
Im referring to the type of courier you where in New Vegas. Death Stranding has you carrying what might was well be school supplies and monster energy drinks.
---
You have a chainsaw
---
ITV will be posted tomorrow afternoon
---
Once patch 22 comes out, buy lunchboxes for 100 gold bullion. Chances are high that if you open one at a public event you'll at least get 1/2 others to do the same, then you just need to pop some more for 100% xp boost and run whatever the densest spot for xp will be post patch.
---
5.2 bans unsportsmanlike conduct in competitive multiplayer ‚Äúsuch as using secondary accounts.‚Äù  Secondary accounts aren‚Äôt banned. Using them for cheats, exploits, or gaming the competitive system is banned.
---
Do the people firing the teslas also not get bad FPS, why torture yourself?
---
They said so?
---
I don't know wym by Recreating WV but I know somebody would make a comment to Bethesda or something idk but they did it with The Captial Wastes next door into Appalachia perhaps there's a reason why Bethesda chose Appalachia
---
Dun you find that even for here. They reply selective?
---
I managed to snag a vampires vats 33% lightweight gatling plasma. And that's the only good thing I've managed to get. Let's me face tank Earle and SBQ.
---
Really?! There is hope then... üôÉ
---
Whsts you heavy gunner look like in terms of perks/points?
---
I bought 10 guns tonight and not one of them I kept I‚Äôve put them up for sale or exchanged them again or script it‚Äôs shocking what we actually get
---
ya because i dont have youtube lol its not exactly hard to do from what i have seen not saying the camp doesn't look great 
---
but its still a glitch and its hypocritical to chastise some ppl for abusing a bug or a glitch and applaud others for abusing a bug or glitch 
---
its not up to us to decide what bugs can be used and what glitches are ok to use
---
As long as you have an armor piece with reduced damage while blocking
---
Yeah, time for a junkies commando build with that gun I reckon
---
To crash their game or server. Just spam use laser or tesla or plasma stuff. Yesterday, theres a few that does that n everyone got booted out.
---
Its unplayable
---
I have a bloodied ffr and it freakin shreds. Barely use it tho
---
Bethedsa said so in a previous post:

---
Yea this is the answer. I was level 215 when the legendary run started and EVERYONE bitched about the level up challenge. Every day I played I leveled up at least once. I played 1-3 hours and used building teams and various foods and such. I‚Äôm 270 something now. Really the only pain in the ass is gathering what‚Äôs needed for some food items.
---
Do tell, I was "on a break" to quote Ross. What happened at xmas?
---
Awesome! Thank you very much!
---
About to log in soon. Also I don't have a mic. My in-game name is the same as my Reddit one.
---
The game is designed so if you rush through all the quests you'll end up around level 30-35. Then it forces you to grind events &amp; mobs for exp when you hit the wall of repeated death.
---
My first character ended up being level 34 when I was struggling to launch a nuke, and ending the main quest-line.
---
This has been suggested a bunch. Issue is: game photos are stored locally, not on the server. What does this mean? You can download the photos you take and use them for something else! Like wallpapers. Also, you can put other pictures into your pictures folder and they will appear in your loading screen (or in this case, hanged in your CAMP). So there is nothing to prevent you from puting NSFW content on your CAMP where anyone can see it, including minors.
---
This is god tier. SBQ gets shredded quickly
---
Ah, so they realized they are killing the player base with that in-between-seasons void?
---
He destroyed your camp with a gun while pacifist mode was on?  I didn‚Äôt think this was possible
---
I‚Äôll try doing that daily
---
I would be more excited to read about an unarmed non-PA build.  Thrilling!
---
sounds good
---
Sleep w/follower in camp, eat canned meat stew, open a lunchbox if you got it, I think there's a food or two (cranberry relish? I forget)... and the all important Builders team, get on one as soon as you log in, the fuller the better. Also. Hopefull you got a lot of INT, which further boosts XP (I'm bloodied, so my INT is maxed, plus a few INT gear pieces on top).
---
Best XP farming for me is Line in the Sand w/tent glitch and something explosive. I still get 1 - 1.5 levels per event even at lvl280 from this event alone.
---
Radiation Rumble, just stand in the front/back area and shoot anything that moves the entire event. Massive XP.
---
Uranium Fever is good too, though to be fair to others, just bring a weaker exploding weapon in (I use a 10mm explosive). It tags everything, and the 3 legendaries too, so everyone else has a chance to hit things and farm stuff as well.
---
SBQ/ACP events, shoot everything that moves, don't focus on the boss.
---
Also good to do between events while fully maxed on XP boosts... all the dinky daily events. I got 1300 XP for eating hotdogs, or turning in water data. Stuff that takes less than a minute to do for high XP gains. Do as many of those as you can each day that aren't the long drawn out dumb ones.
---
Join all fast events, Manhunt, Swarm of Suiters, Leader of the Pack, BotStop stuff, Fly Swatter, etc. All excellent XP gains for hardly any work and very little time invested.
---
Hope that helps.
---
I gained about 130 levels in the past few months from doing all of this stuff ad nauseam, especially during the legendary run.
---
Not supposed to be. It‚Äôs apparently a new bug. YouTube InnovSurvivalist and camp grief. It‚Äôs her newest video. Shows everything
---
Yup just log out and log back in.
---
if you‚Äôre on XB1 would you trade that JE handmade?
---
At least with line in the sand you can place your survival tent such that it blocks others from placing theirs to mess with the spawns. I don't even bother with rumble anymore I'm usually the only runner and cunts with teslas lag out the main area so badly I can't deposit the ore anyway.
---
A couple times now I've done line in the sand where there's around 5-10 ppl there, the scorched all spawn in a cluster in the center where everyone shoots at it. At 130 I can level up completely
---
Never a good thing from her since she has been around. Then a couple weeks ago she gives me a B/50/25 Fixer and a V/E/Ms Gatling Gun in one day! I guess I'll have to wait another couple of years to get something nice from her haha
---
3 - There exists nude mods and porn mods for FO76. So a in game picture can easily be taken showing these mods in action. So implementing this feature would require that they disable all mods (including the nonporn ones).
---
I know whining about the event is kind of a double standard as we are "exploiting" the glitch but I don't think everyone wants to grief as some come down and see easy free XP in the thousands and then bounce. They aren't there for loot.
---
Here‚Äôs the [Official FO76 Discord Network](https://discord.com/invite/falloutreddit) for ya!
---
Already run a mutants full health commando, so it‚Äôs not a big adjustment, but that ss armor grind....
---
Instigating is terrible with explosive because you do the double damage to the first guy but all its buddies that take the splash damage are now not affected by the instigating
---
Thanks a lot üòä
---
Well dang... I‚Äôll have to check that out.... not cool üòï
---
I mean... yea... it's bullshit... it's also not something you need to scream bloody murder over since fixing everything is just a run for some scrap and a button push away.
---
If you watched the same video about it that I did then you should know this isn't just "normal" griefing and explicitly requires hacked weapons.  You should also know that the issue already got a response directly from Pete Hines that they know about it and are already looking into it.
---
This isn't game breaking... it's incredibly annoying... but not game breaking.
---
No. Dun fix it. We need to have something that enables us to crash the servers in a legit way. Pun intended.
---
Gild? No. Geld? Maybe.
---
Funny part a couple items marked utility are in the game files that are mailbox. They are marked in same category as daily planner computer and fridges. Added last year in Q1.
---
Yep, that's the one.  Looks like they are indeed back in stock!
---
You'll probably want to run fireproof and/or a dense chest piece mod to keep from blowing yourself up. Also max out scattershot in strength for faster reloads.
---
I use a quad double barrel on my most active character right now and like it, I'm sure the instigating is a beast for stuff it can one-shot. The quad actually has decent sustained dps for bosses if you can find one. I think an instigating pump shotgun or combat shotgun with faster fire rate is a little better than an equivalent double barrel - less time reloading and you can put a silencer on it. I know instigating sometimes applies to multiple shots on high ROF weapons though, any idea if you're getting the bonus on both shots if you fire quick enough?
---
Its a good daily run around scrap finding weapon.. kill things quickly as you look for whatever you're looking for or exploring or questing, etc.
---
You'll need more power for boss fights... but that's such a small portion of gameplay.
---
My Fixer 1-shots nearly everything, but is totally useless against SBQ or Earle... but that's OK. I use it for support in those events, and shoot everything that moves to let the big weapon players do all the heavy lifting while I keep stuff off them.
---
I know the game is set in a post-apocalyptic world but I‚Äôd really love my CAMP to have every item in it as a ‚Äòclean‚Äô item. I just keep thinking of the pristine vaults in Fallout 4 &amp; I want that in my CAMP. Pleeeeasse Bethesda.
---
I wish all builds were viable. If so I‚Äôd have 100% nocturnal armor and weapons.
---
Bloodied/FFR/RW .50 cal. I‚Äôll keep it for display purposes and if I ever decide to run a Bloodied Heavy Gunner.
---
FYI, you can create your own account and use his Gold Live account to access your FO76 account game. If you have 2 Xboxes, you can play together.
---
Oh my sweet summer child, take a seat and listen.
---
There was a MASSIVE and I mean like nearly broke the game fiasco that occurred around Christmas or soon after that nearly destroyed the economy.
---
Player Vendors were shutdown (NO SALES AT ALL) for like almost 2-3 weeks (it was horrible) due to a massive exploit/dupe problem.
---
They brought them back online for I think like not even three days and suddenly they took it away from us again. It was awful.
---
Then when they ‚Äúofficially‚Äù got a fix for it, the visual bug happened and to this day hasn‚Äôt been fixed.
---
Then followed the glitches of people ‚Äúdrinking‚Äù weapons from punchbowls and Nuka-Cola Machines (example: someone one time ‚Äúconsumed‚Äù a Tesla rifle).
---
They‚Äôve all been fixed and no issues happen thankfully.
---
This comment is dumb I‚Äôm sorry. I spend many days building ONE camp. Lots of time and effort. And to have someone destroy my work, only for me to have to use my OWN resources to fix it is fucking stupid. Thanks for the info, but you didn‚Äôt need to make it sound like some peoples issues with this game are inferior.
---
Didn‚Äôt know that thanks for your input there!
---
I found one off a player vendor once. and bought a few. Used one for myself, then sold the other ones cheap so other players would have a chance to get this item too.
---
There's plenty out there willing to help. It's a long-time annoying thing in the game.
---
I dont hate anybody for any glitches hate me for it idc
---
I want a costume/paint job to turn my power armor into a sheepsquatch.
---
I don't know if you're exclusively looking for melee tips, but if you're open to other suggestions I'd recommend a shotgun and the Enforcer perk, and cripple the legs. They're pretty pathetic once they're crawling
---
So going to the museum doesn't trigger a specific Mothman quest? Jeez, I've been stumbling across a lot of of Mothman cultist encampments and thought they must be part of some questline. Really disappointed to hear this :(
---
Oh, really?? We may have to try that when he gets done with work lol It would be nice to be on there as my game moniker instead of his. üòÇ
---
All amateurs. The true exp greedy gits like me know the real king is the auto grenade launcher with grenadier perk ;)
---
The only good weapon I got out of 2000 scrip was a BE Combat shotgun
---
I think i fixed my issue with this a while back. I stopped dying right around level 70 and havent had a problem since. 
---
/s in case it was needed.
---
This is the first time it's happened to me, I haven't had any problems anywhere else an I'm enjoying the game, just upset me with the effort and emotion that came with the end, I found out it came with them fixing a glitch which had Beckett's quest repeat so it's just a glitch that came with fixing another glitch so I'm ok with it
---
damm.  Ate you even bloodied?
---
Set it up where there's no aggro mobs that spawn.
---
Then you don't need any turrets.
---
Then you have more camp budget and don't have to constantly listen to it shoot things and repair your camp.
---
While exploring, look for a place that is pleasing to be in, since you may be there a lot.
---
Now, over the next few days, keep coming back multiple times per gaming session. Keep checking to see what spawns there. Friendly stuff? Aggro stuff? Settlers?
---
Then make your decision based on that.
---
There's some really prime spots or pretty views, but nasty stuff spawns there and it's just not worth it IMO.
---
For now, just throw down an ugly little wood shed camp and save your scrap for a few days until you find that perfect spot.
---
Though, being level 5 and just starting the game for the first time, you have weeks worth of hours of heavy play to explore the entire map. Your first camp won't be the last. I've moved multiple times since I started playing, building a whole new camp from scratch each time (I enjoy camp building) so don't think that where you place your camp is where you're stuck for eternity. You can move any time you want.
---
Perhaps, but this happened after the Legendary Run was already over. So unless they're preemptively farming for perk coins (doubtful), I'm not buying that excuse.
---
It‚Äôs literally a cosmetic of the Collectron. It even collects the same junk/scrap, just less variety than the base model does.
---
Could use the Fasnacht man mask for now
---
Everyone would just say prices too high or something negative.
---
Cool!
---
I‚Äôm still just trying to figure out if I need to ditch my ammo factories that I don‚Äôt in any way have and never have and never would have. Does anyone have reliable intel on this?
---
you miss my point. its a mis understanding im sry.
---
im not hating on anyone but the bigots that hate on ppl for using a bug then clap at camps like this or complain that the web site doesn't have the right nuke codes, or glitch there way through a nuke silo . or ;launch a nuke on earl and then the queen because they can kill the queen fast and it causes a glitch so they can do earl again for free 
---
those are all abusing bugs or glitches but they are accepted ones because they like them .
---
You're cranking up the drama as if your camp has been forever erased off the map and all of your time and effort was utterly wasted.
---
I'm sorry you have such a sensitive ego but I wasn't trying to make your issue seem "inferior".  I was pointing out that game breaking bugs LITERALLY break the game.  If you cannot progress through a story mission or even log into the game those are examples of game breaking bugs.  Someone destroying your camp is not game breaking.
---
The 150 scrip limit is to keep you logging in every day, and expised to the atom shop every day, because more exposure means more chances that you'll buy something. It's sales.
---
Mine was quadruple the disappointment.
---
Decided to go for all 2 star ranged this time instead of 3 star. Got dozens of junk.
---
A couple worth a 1000 caps or two, and also got an awesome Quad tesla w/25 FFR worth max caps (according to FED76) that I kept, not sure what to do with that one yet.
---
I scripted/sold the rest in my vendor...All ready to scrip for tomorrow's batch too LOL
---
ÁªôÂ∑•‰∫∫Ê≠£‰πâÔºÅ
---
Yeah I got a bloodied build. Idk I would rather get it on a heavy weapon but a shotgun is still really good
---
Sounds like fun for 5 minutes, but I feel u. I put in a bunch of levels to max out shotgunner and so far am kinda disappointed, just cuz vats has proven more reliable with 50 cal and gatling than shotgun vats. Still, fun to play shotgun for a bit just for the sake of variation. Now you have unarmed specced and can also have it for... without pa
---
In other words BoS hasn't even arrived in Appalachia but already scamming people with "legendary" discount if we donate leather. Can wait for them to arrive!
---
Amazing work Bethesda, wouldn't expect nothing less from you.
---
Yeah wow. GL!
---
This^
---
Same here. One chance viewing on XB (never worked on PS); now an e-paperweight. However, the sole viewing was underwhelming as the game never gets dark enough to really experience the effect. Yes, even inside a windowless, doorless, cube.
---
to boost damage try incisor, bloody mess, glow sight, adrenaline. to boost defense try blocker, dodgy, ricochet.
---
I would argue that if they removed the cap for the weekend it would actually increase game traffic. I totally agree that that is why the caps are in place in general though.
---
I agree that it is a convenient perk, just not a must get right away. I‚Äôll definitely get it later down the line once my combat build is complete.
---
They can teleport around your camp while in a convention with them as well!
---
I got a B2525 plasma gun, I don't know how much to sell it for since I won't use it.
---
*Cries in level 300 bloody build*
---
No it‚Äôs not literally a cosmetic. It may have some or even most of the same items as the junk Collectron, but the table of items and drop rate are different.
---
This right here NEEDS to happen
---
Haunted house event would be cool with multiple chances of different Rare drops but for a limited time. Would be cool if it was like line in the sand but instead it‚Äôs heaps more ghouls than that.. then maybe a super strong boss who needs 10+ people or so doing dps on it (higher HP than Earle but deals no dps and uses minions instead) players could fight waves before dealing dps to the boss until it reaches a certain percentage where they then get scared off by the boss and then have another wave of enemies etc? Just a personal idea I‚Äôd love to go into more details but eh probably no point
---
Thank you very much for your work on the site! I really appreciate it.
---
Yes please, and I‚Äôm not just saying that cuz I got a berserkers fire rate fixer today.
---
that sounds fine. it cant all be platinum chips now can it
---
That would be a nice change. I stopped listening to any holotapes I didn't have to because it was just so damn depressing. No matter how happy the tale, in the end, everyone was dead. The only real closure I ever felt was putting down the Overseer's former fiancee.
---
Turkey is more of a Christmas thing for Europe.
---
Lmao, im almost pevel 200 full health using vampires with pa. I die rarely, and almost only at encryptid. Bloody is the equivilent of high risk high reward for this game, and that is dropping to high risk low rewardin next patch.
---
The gauss shotgun because i'm like 'are you gonna kill this ant with 1 or 4 shots?' and it's all 'lol idk'
---
Built a camp surrounded with foundation at Flatwood region, no one can destroy my camp because I tried, I hired some guys who claim they can destroy anything, after 2 hours and tons of bullets wasted, they failed. 
---
Btw even nuke launch won't make it, because you can't nuke the Flatwood.
---
Hell, pumpkins aren't just halloween but most all of fall, they could keep another event running at the pumpkin house until Thanksgiving with just fall themed rewards. Really, the game needs new events, why in excited for the new Ops.
---
Laughable is your taking this "news" at face value with absolutely zero context.  It's not a fucking ban on mules, it's about people using alt accounts in competitive games and specifically in tournaments to boost or smurf and shit like that.
---
These are the zenimax terms of service applying to ALL of their games, this shit doesn't even really apply to this game.
---
I tried it once, but you need to food stack with chems and have mutations. Then it becomes slightly viable and keeps the fun to me. Not saying your way is worse, but I found it to trying.   
---
I will say ricochet is a must for it though damn thing feels like it goes off more than 18% and it is build/lore friendly without deviating too much since you are in a metal can that should be able to deflect small arms fire with ease.     
---
Also more strength the better each point of strength is 5% more damage. So if you are ballsy and run a low health build tossing in emergency protocols on the torso for the speed and flat reduction you take radicool and gain 5 str which is huge.   
---
Just my two cents from someone that has tried something similar
---
You know what? I'd happily take Preston in exchange for ever hearing Grafton's mayor again. At least I felt like I was having an impact with his "another settlement" quests.
---
Spend 800 today got nothing except a TE 25 combat rifle
---
I've found a single prefab, with the bare essentials, and no vendor in a remote part of Appalachia is made for true peace. I ain't seen shit in weeks. I trade through Discord when the need arises and the risk of a camp-to-camp griefer is minimal.
---
Stories like this are exactly why I do it.
---
If you have nothing nice to say, dont say anything at all.
---
I am in flat wood. Just down the road from the wayward.
---
Happened to me on PS4 last night.
---
Happily scrapping junk to the scrap box all night then after one run it tells me I need Fallout 1st to add items to the scrap box.
---
Visiting the store all the Fallout 1st items I previously owned were marked as ‚Äúfree‚Äù but I was unable to purchase them.
---
After a quick panic and relaunch, everything returned to normal.
---
I mean, when you god roll a bloody FFR RW Gauss mini you ain‚Äôt not gonna use it so here I am being a bloody build. Still ain‚Äôt cool that the glitch exists though.
---
I believe an employee mentioned it caused insane lag - and people could put up decapitations and shit
---
That's crazy. With around 400 rr in my ultracite pa I am fine in nike zones.
---
Explosive flamer, fairly accurate and very high damage
---
Probably one of many, seems a popular spot with the overhang and such, alot of people don't even use the acid.
---
The part that makes this a hard sell, is that in 76, unarmed isn't necessarily unarmed. Dcg, bear claws, power fists, are all 'unarmed' weapons, and happen to be some of the most devastatingly powerful weapons. That being said, there's only one set of iron fist perks, whereas other weapons have 3. The hardest sell, is that none of these can be equipped in power armor. You would think that pet seen punching should get a somewhat equivalent boost, but it doesn't. I mean, if the fallout equivalent of a car punching you in the face isn't devastating, I don't know what is.
---
I know, and it sucks. I havent experienced it yet myself, but im sure it will be more common after one wasteland hits and im strollingthrough the forest facing level 100 ghouls and scorched.
---
They should include pipboy lights as an ingame mod, you can use armor workbenches to change the skin on them already.
---
You on pc?
---
My vampires explosive Gatling gun and vamp ffr Gatling Laser. Don't hit like my bloodied heavies but it's Just a riot to stand there and spray and tank while never losing an ounce of health.
---
I just want the overseers projector projecting my in game photos on the wall
---
Yes. My IGN is PhaserRave, same as on here. What's yours?
---
Oh, hmm, maybe I'll check ill check that
---
I wouldn't be surprised to find out that an unlimited script limit, or expanded limit, gets attached to FO 1st at some point.
---
I need this wth. My camp is just a rectangle made of wood lmao
---
At least you're still getting emails. I haven't been able to access my private world since Wastelanders dropped. 
---
I sent them an email about it and was given PC troubleshooting tips which was great and all but I'm on console. 
---
They sent me the same console troubleshooting tips 3 times and nothing worked. They then told me that the problem was with my internet and console. 
---
I did some of my own troubleshooting, logging into a different console with a different internet source and still couldn't access my private world. Had a friend log into my console and my internet source and she could access her private world just fine. Even tried my console on a different internet source and still no dice. I sent this information back to customer service and they told me they were going to escalate it and get back to me...I'm still waiting. 
---
I'm no technical expert and will openly admit it but common sense would suggest that the error would be on their end based on the above findings. 
---
I'm the only one in my team with FOF so now I'm paying two lots of FOF, one on my main account and another on my second account just so I can access a private server that I'm already freaking paying for. 
---
I do get an automated email from them every patch and hot fix requesting me to try and access my world because apparently "after a patch, some issues can resolve themselves".
---
Nocturnal is almost as strong as bloodied at night in the patch.

Same as my Reddit name tjd3211 (no caps if that makes a difference)
---
Wait what, on PS4 !? 
---
I thought we were safe from those type of shits...holy smokes !
---
üò®
---
Okay...so this is how it feels playing this game on PC !?
---
I use a bloodied Heavy (mutated of course). The only time I EVER use a stim is when a Mirelurk King sneaks up on me and poisons me haha. Killing the queen in less than 80 seconds and never sneaking, never stiming and never dieing is a wonderful thing.
---
I've been in like 18 different servers with Nukes dropping today....not denying that there is a problem, but maybe it's platform exclusive?
---
What do you want in exchange?
---
Or forever.
---
Yeah those are pretty cool, problem is is that it's fairly common. I haven't seen any power armor builds so I recently decided to try it
---
Baseball bat. Fo4 got me addicted. I have a decent legendary golf club too. 
---
Outside of melee, combat shotgun and a 10mm
---
Both.
---
Rifle for ordinary stuff, plasma for queen and Earl.
---
Maybe. My post was more reflective of yesterday so maybe it's fixed?
---
Too bad, there's almost all flat ground, to built a camp like mine you need to find a big rock or cliff.
---
The feeling buying all of the Strangler Heart Power Armor pieces just to find out you have to farm Vault Steel 5 at a time for a month is sadness.
---
ok
---
It‚Äôs a new type of bug apparently
---
If you decide you need a change up from bloodied after the new patch, i have a lot of vamps and antiarmor weapons.
---
Even worse is that there IS A FIX FOR THIS, THEY KNOW THE FIX FOR THIS! 
---
Ask them to de-link your Bethesda account from the service you play it on. Doing that and reconnecting it fixes the broken social menu,
---
I spent 4500 on 2 star melee and didn‚Äôt get a single usable item. Brutal
---
DAAAAAADDDDDDYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!
---
I sell chems to the vendors. Can easily churn out 1400 caps worth of them in a play session. Obviously if you're running junkie's, then be selective with what you sell. But, really, how many rad-x do you need?
---
Yes. Updated codes on NukaCrypt
---
I can still hear that baseball guy in diamond city telling me about swatters.
---
I hate dying i'll take vamp over bloody too.
---
In fact if this power armor thing fails I can easily transfer to unarmed without power armor cus the perks required are similar
---
Kill the sentry bots in the white spring resort area, there are 4 sentry bots: 3 at the resort &amp; 1 at the entrance, each should give you at least 1k to 2k of EXP depending on how high your INT is. Server jump n repeat again.
---
Enjoy.
---
I‚Äôm pretty excited to hear the results of this. I dig the idea of alternative/less popular/odd builds. A power armor build just punching everything... dope! My newest build is strictly explosives. Grenades, mines, missiles and mininukes. After looking at all the perks I‚Äôd need for it, there‚Äôs enough points left over for a full one handed melee build... alternatively enough points left over to make the build ridiculously tanky.
---
For assistance, that's what we're all expecting!
---
I think I used what little luck I had for the purveyor two days ago, got a bloodied FSS shepherds crook and a bloodied PA super sledge. :(
---
I‚Äôve submitted a ticket last year, no response yet.
---
The problem is that it would make junkie weapons useless. Bethesda balances the game so the more you sacrifice the most dps you'll have.
---
[Edit:] oh shit sorry your right, this effect definitely needs a buff
---
This right here. I have 11 in my stash and my friend has 4 in a display if we ever get the urge to go explore
---
Yeah I agree, good luck on that explosive build btw
---
This is the way
---
I think it's more directed at potential dupers and burner accounts than just owning multiple accounts. 
---
Until Bethesda start a bank or seriously increase cap limit then I'm going to keep creating cap mule accounts. Plus most people I know run two Xbox's. If they removed second accounts then my friends list would probably drop by half.
---
Junkies short assault rifle because it absolutely rips with a 70 round mag and the junkies combat shotgun for close quarters.
---
I‚Äôm gonna need it. Not goin full tilt on it til the patch comes. Lawd knows it‚Äôs gonna be a lot harder!
---
Not for Earl or SBQ, but plenty effective for everything else.
---
Guess I'll be skipping the 'sale' portion then.
---
I'm still xp farming as I need to reach 300 on my main, and level up my last alt to 50 before patch 15 nerfs everything and makes the early game a nerf ridden bulletspongey slog.
---
I spent 6000 scrip. Got a couple of ok ones to sell, but mostly trash.
---
mine is hit or miss, mostly misses though.
---
how many does it take to make?
---
Switch to a junkies for those moments.
---
SWATTAS!
---
Eta:  never appreciated til just know how Boston Moe is
---
If you think about it they have to rebalance A LOT. Not just Berserkers. So ya, if it was just that effect then it would make Junkies obsolete but a lot of stuff has to be changed.
---
Something like this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f37398b&amp;d=st1s22sy0sq2s32sr2p02ee2ek1e00c62s12id2ip2a04a72l71ls2lt2lu2
---
I was originally going to add the tesla coils mod but  since I'm not planning on adding tank perks cus I need other perks for quality of life changes so I might get the emergency protocol mod, thanks for the suggestions btw
---
I've yet to see any lag caused by tesla or plasma weapons, I play on PS4.
---
I thought you was talking about "Furious", my bad.
---
I just got a 3 star furious handmade a suppressors fixer and a junkies 50 cal. Today was a good day!
---
damn.  I feel you.
---
I love the visceral power of a hunting rifle headshot. Too bad it‚Äôs not so great for DPS so I need to switch to Commando lol :( rip my beautiful rifle
---
I‚Äôve never used an assault rifle, this seems like a good argument to try one.
---
I agree. I‚Äôm trying to find low level legendaries while being addicted to medx and psycho to get the minus to dr so I can at least have an autostim piece. And use under armor. I can‚Äôt do the broken armor thing as I want to use a hazmat suit sometimes and change out pieces.
---
Nah after going bloodied from junkies when I swore I never would there's no going back for me. It's infinitely better with all your specials in the 20's and I'm tankier with dodgy, blocker, serendipity, and emergency protocols in PA is ridiculously powerful.
---
I run a Silent Hill experience all year round!
---
No you wouldn‚Äôt. You‚Äôd cap out immediately on scrip and then never be able to spend it. Same problem in a different direction.
---
They could get around this by making only photos taken with the Prosnap camera be allowed.
---
I keep hearing about this kind of stuff and I'm sitting here playing the game around these kinds of events and wondering "Where's the lag everyone's bitching about?" and I'm on a first generation PS4.
---
not really, double barrel is useless
---
Minigun go brrr
---
Meat week meat week week of meat! 
---
Easy challenge that gives scrip, some camp plans, treasury bills and regular (if buggy last time) chances to get lots of xp.
---
I believe You can pull the serendipity card out of that. It doesn‚Äôt trigger in PA or when dodgy is equipped.
---
In which case, I eagerly await it hahaha
---
Joe, if we go any faster we're gonna go back in time.
---
It takes 5 pure violets and 5 pure cobalts. 
---
I only need 2 cobalts and I currently have no violets.
---
Yeahp.
---
As a lot of people said, it's been requested a ton (for good reason; it's cool), but the technical hurdles to get it going just would not be worth the payout.
---
What would be nice, though, is if we could get some new art objects of major locales in the game, or characters. Creepy cat pictures are all good and well, but...  
---
It'd also be nice to get some standing photo options, rather than just the hanging big-boys.
---
(truth: turret-kun took out a Scorched approaching and flipped him up onto the grill)
---
Couldn‚Äôt you match that visceral power with a lever action? And then still be able to mow down mobs?
---
If you get your hands on a 2 or 3 star assault rifle with explosive you‚Äôll love it!
---
I like the lever action for its raw power style and overall badassness and the Gatling plasmas for massive dps with unmatched ammo efficiency compared to other heavy weapons
---
You're in luck: One of the 'rewards' from the 'Daily Ops' will be Wall Mounted Turrets.
---
I know about PA. Only use it for Earl and I swap one gun army in. I know it works with dodgy cause the noise serendipity makes when triggered is annoying AF.
---
To be fair, neither will any terms of service that you have to accept after you've already paid them for the product.
---
I was thinking of something similar like a ‚Äútip box‚Äù where you could safely drop caps, food, ammo, junk, etc as a ‚Äú thank you‚Äù. When I see a good camp or someone is selling at good prices or I use there equipment I‚Äôd like to leave something for them. Those camps cost to build. üòÉ
---
Heck yah :/ picture on wall good
---
Can't up vote enough. I run a beserkers junkies vats critical hybrid build on an alt and use a beserkers explosive handmade and a junkies explosive handmade and my base damage is 30 higher on the junkies weapon than on my beserkers weapon. 
---
We are even more fragile than bloodied and should be doing the same damage as junkies if not higher due to the sheer risk involved. 
---
The coming nerf is going to kill my beserkers build so much that I'm tempted to just turn my character into full junkies.
---
yes, they are. 
---
very rare.
---
Instigating black powder rifle. It is super situational but hilarious when paired with bloody mess. I call it the murder cannon. I got rid of all the chameleon gear on my stealth rifleman just so that I could aim with it when sneaking.
---
Even worse! Lol
---
Easiest way to fix this issue. Just bump up the amount of .308 you can craft to the same levels as 50 cal. and 5 mm. I love my lmg's but having to prime them out for efficient ammo crafting isn't ideal.
---
I could hook you up with 20 on ps4
---
I thought I had a good mobile defense/assault base... I had turrets set up all on around it on the outside shell and linked to my generator with all the essentials crammed inside   it worked and when I went to place it in another location that showed green ... it just fucking makes a blip sound and gives me no errors to try to fix.... fucking besethda... they want us to pay extra money for shitty atoms and nothing works right
---
Thanks :)
---
We need more stuff like this and fewer 'Beth, are you listening?' posts.  Hint: They're really not listening.
---
Be cryo unspeced for big guns and its still soo good., no bloody mess necessary holds sneak well. And watching the freeze animation pretty slick.
---
I have discovered the shotgun is the perfect weapon for ACP, because you can keep Earl crippled and oneshoot all wendigos, collecting a massive surplus of screws, shells, acid, fiberglass and experience. 
---
I reach the vendors cap limit in a single event and collect maybe 400 shotgun shells.
---
Gg. You don't have to play anymore. You've won.
---
i never noticed his daughter is watching lethal weapon on the tv. Which of course was also written by shane black.
---
Well luckily you need to be level 20 or above!
---
You do need to be inoculated though and meet rose, which are both parts of the base game story.
---
i can sort you out. GT? 
---
mine is rammadeus and my camp is near top of the world. And i'll invite you in a min
---
Nah, I meant just have youtube running in the background of your computer. Or if you're on console Spotify also works. (Or put your music on a flash drive and use the media player)
---
Because level 11+ people don‚Äôt need help?
---
That would be cool! And stuff wouldn‚Äôt de-spawn that way.
---
you are right, I just double checked and was mistaken.
---
Stalkers +15 VATS Soup Ladle!
---
???? There is like 20+ wallpapers, we need more toys and rides!  
---
Edit looks like there has been 49 wallpapers.
---
Sorry its being nerfed into the ground like everything else!
---
I was able to get my hands on an IE dragon, its super funny to use.
---
It‚Äôs a fun grind for scrip and treasury notes
---
What was ‚Äònot nice‚Äô about this post?
---
Honestly if they limited the info as described, they could automate it to appear and the player could choose if they would like it to be displayed or not.
---
Welcome to 2019.
---
It wasnt the post, lol. They had nothing nice to say so they didnt post an ITV.
---
makes me feel like she is trying unload all her duped junk weapons onto us.
---
assassins, assassins, nocturnal, assassins, ghoul slayers, mutants
---
u/cooldood420 all you need at this point is to head to the overseer's home.
---
It‚Äôs honestly too soon for me, but I didn‚Äôt get my tenderizer plan the first 50 times, so here‚Äôs to 50 more!
---
It's literally impossible as you can't use an unarmed weapon in pa.
---
May as well get rid of them, with One Wasteland turrets get destroyed soo much faster!
---
Sure. Jrod521
---
No, WoW had competent management and didn't release a beta for ¬£50, which they then basically ignored for months before starting to fix it.
---
Duuude this made my inner child so happy. I want this now more than ever
---
Lately I've been playing a stealthy build, and have been using a Zealots Lever Action. It's not the best it in the world, but I can drop a SB in four or five shots with the stealth bonus damage, and it's powerful enough on it's own to one shot most other mobs. I struggle during SBQ, or ACP, but I have a Fixer for those situations so that I can contribute to the overall damage more.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it helps. But I was fighting glowing wendigos in whitespring. I had the level 3 unarmed per on. Strength was 15 (since unyielding obviously doesn‚Äôt work in PA)
---
I had glow sight equipped as well. My left arm did bleeding damage, while my right arm did Tesla damage.  And I had to punch the ghouls twice to kill them.  
---
That was without drugs or food buffs.
---
Edit- I meant ghouls not wendigos.
---
I know, but I have fists and lots of perks
---
This is why I think gold bullion is useless. 
---
Worse than legendary scrip.
---
What's the bomb drop event?
---
If they're placed on something and this happens, you can just store the thing and get them back, if they vanish on the ground, they're gone until you move your camp!
---
So just punching?
---
Also, that vendor has some rare plans (mirror ball, radium emitter, starburst clock amongst others) and he‚Äôs somewhat difficult to find. I actually sever hop before each event to refresh the plans and if I get duplicates sell them in my shop at cost for those trying to get them the same way. 
---
You will have them all within 5-6 cooks
---
My Collectron is Communist, and the turrets never turn on him.  It's the random wandering vendor they really hate.  Every time he comes they spit unceasing metallic death until I fast travel away.  And he loves taking a load off at my garden table while they do it.
---
Athena typically gets left alone. It's hilarious when she doesn't, though, as she stops talking about flowers, slowly turns around, and proceeds to MELT the turrets with her eye ray, one by one.
---
Haha hahahahaha I‚Äôm fuckin dead. If I had gold it would be yours. üéñüèÖü•á
---
That's the point of the build, I kinda just decided I will do this cus why not and it's surprisingly fun
---
However, the inoculation quest is fucked for some people still, so keep that in mind
---
Congrats dude. The bear arm is a ton of fun to use, I just wish it didn't cover up a third of my screen.
---
It on there roadmap
---
Don‚Äôt tease me.
---
Berserker would be awesome if more people used it.  People running around in undies is great.
---
Ghoul-hordes-with-rad-storms! 
---
Ghoul-hordes-with-rad-storms!
---
Lots of people just wanted to be cool and talk shit about the game. Truth is, the game has always been fun. Bugs? Sure.
---
That would take a little more work, but it would certainly be nice.
---
All the cosmetic items in the legendary run will not be coming back. However, some of the camp items like the ammo converter and chicken coop will eventually be added to the bullion shop.
---
