I would rather they focus purely on the main game. I doubt the main player base wants this game to become a halfassed Fortnite because "reasons".
---
---
---
Let‚Äôs just be clear it isn‚Äôt. Aside from the helmet looking vaguely similar that‚Äôs where it ends.
---
Its clear Bethesda is more interested in keeping their atom store well stocked and regularly updated. I have been playing since beta as well and after the first round of updates, it just feels so stale now. Im not impressed anymore. It just kind of feels like they did the minimum required, took it and ran.
---
I play on PC and have only been disconnected once in the last 2 months.
---
Selling legendaries, I made 37k the other day
---
No, Ultracite is usually more unless I have an abundance of it. Which isn't often. Lol 2 caps, maybe 3 per Ultracite anmo. You may wanna get another opinion to be sure though.
---
I'm referring to damage without temporary boosts. Your screenshot is definitely still possible with chems and such. Please point out where they stated they were nerfed.
---

---
I literally also said that Buzz Blades aren't the best for the SBQ... I've said that from the beginning. You're arguing something I agree with.
---
I guarantee that without sneak and temporary buffs, you can't 1 hit a Sheepsquatch. It's impossible to get over like 2.5k base damage with a melee before buffs. So therefore, in the time that it takes to swing twice, a Buzz Blade will have already killed.
---
Literally everything dies in just a couple hits, genius. I'm not just talking about weak enemies. I said that literally everything but the SBQ is practically instantly killed.
---
Also, my name isn't Daniel. Danny Tanner is a Full House character, dumbass üòÇ
---
Sadly all Bethesda sees is üí∏ over quality content
---
Lol, Flat Earth. 
---
Thanks, YouTube
---
I sent you a message also. Hopefully that can help you with prices a little more.
---
And for all our sakes I wish that every item in the store was actually obtainable in game without bullshit microtransactions. But Bethesda will never fucking do it now, they only care about getting paid.
---
I mean. Fair enough. But it is misinformation whether you intended to spread it or not.
---
Things like Doxxing aren't really a console specific issue, modified controllers...I mean things like those are more of a thing of the past when literally simple code can prevent them, and obviously exploits and glitches are just that. 
---
I'm just gonna say, like, assuming without the facts is kinda pointless, no? It only incites people like me with far too little sleep and not enough vodka to argue that you're wrong.....So whatever man, you keep doing you. Have a good one.
---
It's vastly improved since launch but is now just at the point it should've been then. It still needs lots of work but in it's state can be fun (most of the time)
---
Damn, thank you so much! I seriously appreciate this guide.
---
I got the blue screen (PS4) crash 3 times today. Yesterday I had PC style lockups where I had to force restart. And I've noticed I've been getting stuck in terrain and objects a lot lately forcing me to restart. 
---
Other than that, all good üòÑ
---
Thanks to everyone!
---
They're different servers
---
I think i‚Äôll pass, thanks though

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Yeah its crazy i tamed a lvl 91 deathclaw and then he reverts to lvl 21 and cant handle himself when 2 lvl 68 super mutants show up. Kinda pointless to tame anything if it completely changes from when you tamed it
---
Last time I was attacked they told me to ‚Äúlearn some fucking manners‚Äù  and then I got 2 of my other friends and hunted them down.
---
Press the sneak button. Get a silencer.  Problem solved.
---
Hey I'm no expert, but I'll help however I can. If any advice I can offer works for at least one person then I'm glad,
---
That's the real issue, everything in the shop should be obtainable through normal gameplay without visiting the shop. But they want to force us back to the shop again and again in the hopes we'll spend real money on fake objects with fabricated exclusivity and utility. The writing's been on the wall for years now, Bethesda only cares about our money and it's fucking sad.
---
I have had about 2 crashes in two hours since Tuesday. If I eat too much too fast in the pip boy, my game locks up.
---
It is not the whole Fallout 76 community, but it is still a community... I took a look at your profile and your comments are mostly contradictions so I won't even bother.
---
Dude, dogmeat was my life in FO4. Before I knew he couldn‚Äôt die, I would make him stay away from all the actionÔøº and fighting in attempt to keep him safe.  I loved getting him new armor and helmets and building cool doggy hangouts for him. 
---
This should totally be a thingÔøº in fo76
---
RIP in peace Rattsworth
---
Obviously Grahm is the strongest, considering he is immortal.
---
Considering he didn't come back, and if you look through through his posted comments that's all he is. He whines and trolls.
---
I did couple of defenses on other places like airport and cabins and both counted towards the challenge.
---
I killed by a guys trap on his base. I thought it was cool as fuck. Quality raiding imo.
---
But stealing shit from shit like this is pretty shitty.
---
Am online now look me up, do u use a microphone... name as above
---
I was never asking for bethesda's hosting of private servers to be a free service though? I only wanted that we had the ability to host our own private servers as a free* option.
---
*sure, there's still *technically* power/time/internet you have to pay for, but the *ability/software* to do so is almost always free.
---
A player by the name of Ukraine SZN did exactly that. At my camp. In front of my rocket turrets. Then he shit talked me through direct messages on xbox and reported my retorts after he died like five times.
---
I' forgot all about that perk. I run automatic Handmades but I just out two in it and worked it into my loadout. Going to see how it is.
---
Well I can see that reaction if you were being unnecessarily rude for no reason, but if it was just their excuse it's a pretty petty one, up there with attacking someone for refusing to trade or party up
---
I wouldn't mind paying for the convenience of having something cosmetic if obtaining it was difficult yet still an option. But I protest being made to pay for something utilitarian simply because no other way of obtaining it is offered, even though it easily could have been.
---
The point is that Bethesda used to make these kinds of decisions with the player in mind, if Bethesda had to do both, they would make it so both ways of playing the game could offer the same experience. But now their decisions are focused on earning the most money, so they don't care about robbing some players of the full experience to hide objects and features behind paywalls, especially ones that offer an advantage to the player.
---
Which again, this whole thing started with them saying there would only ever be cosmetic items for sale, and we knew it was a lie, and we told people it was a lie, but here we are. Because enough people don't give a shit that they could get away with it time and time again. Lying to us, walking back promises, and withholding content unless we're willing to keep on paying for more and more that used to come standard.
---
[removed]
---
The6 have already kind pf admitted to pulling a fast one om us by saying theres never going to be a sub then giving players that pay for private servers 'extras'
---
I have luckily not experienced this. Every time I‚Äôm in a White Springs nuke zone and a higher level comes along, they either kill a few enemies to help out or just plain ignore meÔøº.
---
This. \^ If you kill it, eat it.  Never carry food again.  Plus its a great surprise at parties when people fall over, and you eat them instead of stim them.
---
On the list of best and worst inventions simultaneously. There's so many educational channels on YouTube, and then we get the bottom of the barrel flat earthers trying to show dissonance to impressionable people through a world wide media platform. It's disgusting to me the sheer ignorance of some people
---
Well more likely than not the modding community will add the ability to pause the game sooner or later. Most likely sooner.
---
Man GTA V is getting crazy
---
Noobies are lucky to encounter people like you instead of what vault dwellers encountered in fallout 2 [https://m.blog.hu/ms/mscdex/image/fallout1.PNG](https://m.blog.hu/ms/mscdex/image/fallout1.PNG)
---
When player vendor hopping on PC some people will start attacking and swearing at you if you take more than a few seconds browsing. I've started taking pacifist mode off so I can get a few extra caps.
---
don't craft it, submit a ticket to Bethesda support. I've heard people doing in the past and it working out for them, so just be cool about it and you should be alright.
---
Killed someone in Nuclear Winter and used his gear to launch a game winning Nuke. He then proceeded to harass me for days in Adventure Mode. 
---
I found the whole thing enjoyable
---
Ammo reduction armor baby üòÖ‚úå
---
Hahaha
---
Ok thx, where do i submit a ticket? Btw what happens if i build it, wont i get atoms back, Just curious
---
Yes.
---
I mean, I totally get it and there is zero reason to involve politics in gaming. 
---
But I‚Äôm also curious, why didn‚Äôt you just say that the earth is round? Seems like you made it more difficult for yourself trying to avoid it.
---
Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not siding with them or anything‚Äîbut just a few simple words could‚Äôve saved you the griefÔøº
---
Another point is that the United States, Britain, and many other countries in the world are getting fucked by conservative conspiracy theories and this is probably why this person felt so passionately about thisÔøº. Again, not defending them but you really could just answer the question.
---
This is off topic, but wow that model is spot on. I have a Rottie and he sits exactly like that, with the one leg cocked out to the side. üíôüíô
---
Why not both? I care enough about the franchise that I would like to see it stay true to its aesthetics in an official capacity. The single player games are fully moddable for the people that want to make the wasteland their own.
---
My only complaint is that everything is constantly delayed.
---
This is just a blatant lie. During the very first reveal of fallout 76 Todd himself said the game would also be playable as a solo offline game, like fallout 4.
---
On pc I've been great for months... Except when NW was launched there was a week of weirdness and 2times recentlyI have found the purveyor covered in mines. Then shit got real laggy. But i often take a break and log out around every two hrs. Old habit from dayz.
---
This is at least a thanks I can get behind
---
Time for a few more meat weeks with 0 feedback taken :D
---
Hey level 3 lock pick.  Check pleasant hills cemetary every day.  I found the plasma gatling plan there and the gauze ruffle plan and im stutter many others.  There are 3 safes to find there.  Other recommendation I have is the safe behind the counter at the pharmacy near Berkley.  And check the three story building at Berkeley springs it usually spawns marine armor plans.  Good luck
---
So you agree we should be seeing packs in the Atomic store for the older, more fallout-centric factions?
---
No, don't use a mic for Fallout.
---
Bloodied. You can have a Bloodied pillow and it can clear West Tek in record time.
---
Sorry for asking, but:
---
Why still play this game if you are constantly fed up with it like that?
---
I mean, if it's fun to you that's fine, but don't people reach the point where they say: ‚ÄúAlright, I'm done with this same **** over and over‚Äú?
---
Should be placement xp. Not team shared xp.
---
Getting to 3rd or 4th should be rewarded... Dying at the start of match should not net you anything if your team manages to pull thru since this would quickly spiral out of contole with afk players grinding out the rewards for adventure.
---
I use the small grey one. Someone else asked for some screenshots that I posted a little while ago in this thread. You can see the rugs in the pictures.
---
Drives me insane and makes me miss easy kills.
---
Just ended a six hour long play session with 0 disconnects or crashes. My last crash was 3 weeks ago and last disconnect earlier this week.
---
Yup. For like 5 months.
---
Wut?
---
Private servers! Depending on how it works im going to look into this. Prob wont have tools at first but i will be keeping an eye on it.
---
This would be so fun.
---
I mean if you can give me a solid source where they confirm that, I‚Äôll believe it, but I‚Äôve never read anything but speculation that the Tactics armor was the inspiration for the Fallout 3 model(and I‚Äôll grant you it‚Äôs a solid theory, that‚Äôs exactly why I suggested making it a prototype of the X-02). And even if it was, my idea still works, because it allows them to reuse/redesign the old version into a cool new suit that still manages to be unique while calling back to an older game.
---
Your first thought should be on your build. What type of player you want to be, melee, stealth, etc..
---
Use the following link to help with your desire setup if you want a look into your future.

---
Figure this out early will save you a lot of headache. Or go at it freely and see where the road takes you.
---
If you know your build then it‚Äôs easier to go after armour and weapons with perks to compliment your setup. 
---
I‚Äôd say work/grind through your levels till you‚Äôre over fifty. Then use saved scrip (max carry is 1000) on the purveyor to test your luck in rolls. The market on reddit will also help you acquire these items.
---
Meantime focus on quest and events to earn higher exp üëçüèº
---
Personally, i don‚Äôt forget to scrap it, i would just rather someone get the scrap instead of it sitting there.
---
Gypsy-fitz is helpful too , that dude drops all sorts of goodies for new dwellers
---
Personally I‚Äôm not partial to that idea.
---
I can help with getting the paint-my usual team won‚Äôt be getting together tonight.
---
I leave lvl 1 repair on hit chance. It procs often enough but is low reapir. So it's slowing down the times needed. When you do repair slap on lvl 3 weapon artisan then take it off and put back whatever you want.
---
I take lvl 1 luck of the draw cause i think lvl 3 is set to proc much less tho it does a great deal more repairs.
---
Im the end it's still a roll of the dice and lowering your chances could mean it seems to never proc
---
Iguana meat. How many iguanas do you see wandering around? You want iguana meat.

Send you a friend request
---
You don't need to be sorry. You make a good point. I am playing it from time to time because I am interested in the changes developers make. But I am constantly informed about what is happening with the game. I still have hope that something good will come out of it. I will wait for the wastelanders and if that doesn't make a change for good, like you said "I will be done with this shit".
---
What platform are you on?
---
Look under Display in camp menu. But it's still impossible to fill your bathtub with pre-war money.
---
Some people don‚Äôt know this but if you stay in match and work as a spotter for your friends it‚Äôs extremely beneficial, the dead viewer can actually see enemies way before they pop up for the actual player. My crew has been using the dead as spotters for awhile and it‚Äôs definitely helpful
---
I just store the vending machines in my storage until I'm under my cap limit.
---
The glowing sights on a gun? Because you made it sound like locations with the spelling ‚Äúsite‚Äù
---
Rewatch. No he didn't. He said solo but not offline.
---
If you are on xbox I can build you one, I need to build so many items in my or others camps.
---
If im translating this properly, I think we're talking about the gun sights attachment.
---
Yes glowing sights on guns I  Was using speech to text
---
It‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôre part of the brotherhood
---
I was looking forward to the Wastelanders update and could understand the delay, but this is the last straw. Never buying a Bethesda game again. If I would ever want to play one, I'm pirating it.
---
That would be outstanding.  It is a shame outfit are not more pieces in general.
---
I got a legendary hunter‚Äôs bone hammer off some random ghoul in the mire
---
Yeah. I hope I caught you before you got it. I mean it's still a cool outfit but it doesn't have that feature.
---
PS4 unfortunately thanks though
---
I know some folks that play on ps4 I'll check and see of they have the plans to build it for you.
---
I can't speak for anyone else, but I now have 7 after god knows how many campfire tales.
---
A buncha muncha cruncha... human!
---
Glagnar's Human Rinds!
---
Super mutants and brotherhood if it has a justification in history, anyone who has passed the game would know.
---
Run around and pick up EVERYTHING. Make as much bulk items as possible and sell to vendors along with anything you kill and cook. 1400 caps a day easy.
---
That‚Äôs neat, I usually don‚Äôt get them often. However I am looking for a regular, non legendary version. Thank you though for your response, at least I know for certain that I can still get legendary types.
---
You think we're paying them for what they want? No! It's for what 'we' want, hey wait a minute...
---
So, what‚Äôs your actual answer?
---
Oh right cheers, mate, in that case would you be interested in joining r/PKOA ? As what we do in a nutshell is help everyone and we are fairly active on all 3 platforms
---
Don't go by the set price.  It is sort of trial and error and look at what others are charging.  It is too complex a thing for me to describe in a short post.
---
travel the world, you'll stumble over them everywhere
---
also: [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
Fyi. I just got a kill.... and not a single shot registered. Like i conoletely missed, but i in fact diddnt.
---
I don‚Äôt want them to just focus on one aspect of the game. They could add these modes for people that like competitive gameplay. I can understand why you wouldn‚Äôt want the to use resources of something you don‚Äôt enjoy but Adding good PvP into the game will just extend it‚Äôs life imo.
---
Back when I had hair and my teeth no one was out of my reach. We will never be friends!
---
This, using sites is so annoying in cham.
---
They aren't working for free. They literally never have.  
---
Stop being a part of the problem that is ruining this franchise. I've never cared too much about how other people enjoy their games, but people defending this bullshit like you are is literally impacting future titles, which means there's less for me to enjoy. r/Hail_Corporate is around the corner.
---
I have self blew  Myself up for fun.  So its possible they pulling a kamakazi move
---
Thanks tommorow I'll do some exploring.
---
NOTE: I forgot to put it on the post, and I apologize for my mistake. I am also looking for it to be a standard, non-legendary version. Sorry to seem picky. It‚Äôs due to the fact that I am putting them in a weapon collection, and all of them must be fully upgraded for true comparison and full damage potential. (I am aware that they don‚Äôt have any mods.)
---
Well shit, seems like you're right. That damn Mandela-effect got me again. I must have switched timelines again...
---
But it's still there. You can spend hours of time grinding points or just buy some points. Honestly its in line with most of the other open world games on the market. But yeah its definitely a little costly.
---
This made me throw up
---
Personally I want pets to act like companions in Fallout 4 where they auto revive once combat has ended or at least let us repair them using a recipe from Project Paradise.
---
Well I'm like 90% sure it was a Game informer that I read when I was deployed to Iraq in 2007.
---
That's interesting. Everyone in my group was showing all 0's when hitting the same target. Do you know if this is another bug?
---
So then take some time away from that like you would to do anything else in the damn game and get the fridge from the quest, then go back to being an NPC bartender.  
---
Point is: YOUR way of playing is directly affecting everyone else's way of playing, and it's making US have to pay MORE because you're lazy. "Not everyone who plays this game plays the same way" get over yourself.
---
Wouldnt be suprised, i love the game. But its a damn bugs life movie.
---
I once came across 2 vault dwellers who seemed like they were out on a date at Wavy Willards, doing the slides etc. I guess I must have disturbed them cause the guy started shooting mini-nukes at me.
---
Its a bummer if you buy it and invest 60+$'s but since its on game pass you possibly only lose 10$'s? I'm more than willing to have 25 hours of game play for what I'm paying already.
---
Seems rather unlikely to best honest. The howls of protest from all corners of the internet would be rather deafening since that would be interpreted as p2w (so to speak).
---
You can use the bunker terminal to find the pieces. It gives you the option of which bunker to use and will then give you a search area for the piece.
---
lol Didn't work.
---
That sounds great I also know a few people playing on PC. Pretty cool subreddit.
---
Chill queerbone like I said i doubt they made any good money off of fallout 76 they were literally handing their game out for free at this one store and the game being always on sale for 20$ or less god damn we get free DLC quit being a broke boi support Bethesda they have done very good work before and are starting to better them selfs with FREE FUCKING DLC actually play the game and earn atoms rookie I‚Äôve bought tons of shit by just playing the game support Bethesda
---
Yes it sucks but if you really want to play it then I recommend on Xbox One or PS as those are currently free as I fear current dev team so poorly equipped to fight hacker it won‚Äôt be getting fixed like lack of in game chat still.
---
People are really still playing this game? Smh
---
Might be the issue or not but some people have had to completely delete their game and redownload to stop issues like this , no idea how or why it works but definitely ends disconnecting issues like magic. Not messing with you either it actually really does work for some crazy reason I don‚Äôt even pretend to understand
---
[deleted]
---
They created what mess ? I highly doubt they meant to make the game with bugs glitches and crashes but no game not one mmorpg was perfect on it's way out eso when it dropped unplayable for example literally labeled unplayable you can find the videos on youtube with that said this game is up to par I think on where it is now but they dont owe you or have to cater to you because of how the game launched to be clear it is optional to play you dont have if u stuck it out and made to this point you do not deserve a pat on the back or new utility I'm a beta player and I do not have the right to say hey I stuck it out this far let's get some new shit we dont pay a subscription you paid for the game it is playable you have what you paid for saying oh I want more well you sound 6yo son.
---
Finished encrypted for the first time, got fixer plans first time. Luck was in my favor
---
Yeah, I know, I made a video for PKOA as well and it turned out pretty good if I say so myself not to toot my own horn lol 
---
Feel free to join and introduce yourself, always space for more :D
---
It's also 2am and I'm tired so ima sleep lol
---
I have a BFSs and strength one 
---
My dream weapon atm is a BFFr less vats cost fixer
---
Personally I still like to preorder if there‚Äôs a beta(mostly cause I can cancel it before release on Xbox) but didn‚Äôt cancel this game after paying $90 because I thought they would remove cap limit on stash and fix the game, boy was I wrong and now stopped buying Bethesda games.
---
Having played lots of different styles since beta, I enjoy the super squishy danger of bloodied. I can‚Äôt roll in like my power armor wearing, heavy weapon alt. I can‚Äôt rely on my vanguard armor wearing, instigating death claw gauntlet character‚Äôs tactics. I have to really plan assaults out and not be afraid to run away. All styles have their own quirks and enjoyment, I‚Äôve just been stuck on bloodied for a looong time!
---
\&gt; monthly subscription fee  
---
the game would have to be more enjoyable first. It's a worse fallout 4 as it is now.  
---
\&gt; 20-60 for each expansion  
---
if the expansions were actually good, then yeah. Not asking anyone to work for free.  
---
\&gt; would you pay atoms for stuff i've seen everyone complain about being useless  
---
Yes, if they actually looked decent. I spent well over 100 bucks on skins in fuckin league of legends, where i can barely even see the details of the skin in-game. Maybe if Bethesda wasn't just trying to milk people for money and set a new standard for how the gaming industry can fuck its consumers over and instead actually made decent fuckin cosmetics, then i'd be closer to one of those whales they want so many of. But they don't, so fuck this announcement about utility items in the atom shop.
---
Some days I can play for hours, do SBQ fights, quests, dailies, and the game is completely rock solid.  Other days, like yesterday, in an hour's span I CTD'd several times.  Though after those several crashes I was again solid the remainder of my session.  
---
This is an improvement, as I used to disconnect from the servers a lot and crash more regularly and consistently. SBQ fights were a joke because I crashed out literally every single time.  It was so consistent I excitedly made a post here on the sub when I managed to actually get all the way through it for the first without a crash.  Sad, really.  I have friends on console that say they don't have nearly as many issues as I seem to, so perhaps it's more PC related?
---
How about if you make it to last 10 players, you‚Äôre in the share of team xp at the end no matter what?
---
Wrong! Bethesda ‚ÄúWe heard you want more micro transactions so open wide!‚Äù
---
Also, we should get a LOT more xp for downing and killing players.
---
Nice, overencumbered stash! I say work with it my friend, you may have just discovered a new infinite stash glitch!
---
I‚Äôve played Instigating and Bloodied sniper builds.  Instigating is 95% as strong, without the Bloodied downsides.  So I agree that Bloodied is arguably not worth it  Bloodied is incrementally stronger and I continue that build at the moment, but I‚Äôll never sell my IE Lever.
---
Depends.  Why do 90% of PvP'ers assume everyone else wants to play their sad little game? üòã
---
Screw double scrip, they need to rework legendary loot system entirely. Every legendary gun I use have been bought from players who had multiples and I still find nothing but trash since playing at start of beta.
---
The post was literally saying "How dare they charge me for something I wanted" like they legit think that selling a game once and supporting it without  revenue stream for years is a solid business plan. Microtransactions are optional. And if you think a developer is abusing it...move on. Simple.
---
Would prefer double exp till wastelanders instead.
---
I did Morgantown airport a long while ago and got the cache but don‚Äôt have a backpack?
---
Why do they hit back if they don't want to play?
---
good looking out.
---
That or lose a bunch of shit glitch
---
Bethesda ‚ÄúGreat idea now they expire after 1hr of play even if not online and enjoy the new legendary recharge kits of atomic shop!‚Äù
---
Give them vintage nukashine
---
Actually, it's not +1 AGL; it's 25% less VATS cost, which is maybe less exciting. But if it's really that good maybe I'll mess with my build to see how well it works. 
---
I guess it would be nice if at least one item turns out well after burning through all that scrip.
---
Could be that.
---
Np sleep well bud
---
Okay see you paid for the game you can play the game the atomic shop is optional it's not apart of the game they dont owe you anything when it comes to the atomic shop it's like saying well damn I live in x state I'm getting f'd up that walmarts shit isnt free. Everyone has the motion to think because they paid for the game they paid for everything in it including the atom shop every game does this fortnite r u going to complain about vcoins and getting new skins too because let's face it what's really in the atomic shop grow up get a job and not only will you not be f'd with the atomic shop you might actually get a few things too
---
It would be awesome if they showed more details to how Wastelanders would function, though I guess delaying it with 4 screensshots and additional play to win content will suffice.
---
I'm not
---
Yea I found 8 hrs of play today was me mostly server hoping for events.
---
Big ole F in the chat, boys, for Rattsworth.
---
This is genius.
---
I don't get a whole bunch of crashes or bugs. I play on PC. However last night, more then made up for what I don't usually get. Beth didn't recognize me, Beth kicked me out, Beth lost my legendary kill, Beth finally at the end gave me a black screen last night. Yesterday, Beth basicallly said, listen... I love you, but some days Im gonna be a real bitch to you. Your not special. Go sleep on the couch, maybe I'll love you again tomorrow. I got up this morning (free day for me) played all day today. No crashes, no bugs, my loot was there. Sometimes Beth doesnt want you to take them for granted, Beth must have caught me cheating on them with ESO. I love you Beth... never again. Promise... \*shit, I can get my free Instant Blacksmithing Paper now\*.
---
Always been good, even better now

You most certainly have that option

Instigating AA +vats to hit Lever Action Rifle
---
Instigating Explosive +vats to hit Lever Action Rifle
---
(not sure if these combos are possible tho)
---
Ok
---
K just wondering if the game will be too difficult tho im below lvl50
---
To be fair though, Unyielding doesn't just give you extra carry weight.  It also drastically increases every SPECIAL except END, so you get more Agility (more AP for sprinting and Dodgy), more Intelligence (you can easily hack anything and your XP gain is higher), more Luck (things drop at max condition and Perfectly Preserved Pies are trivial to acquire), etc.  The truth is, if you do it right, you'll be just as tanky at 25% HP as some builds are at 95%.
---
But yes, the build shines against the SBQ.  You almost have to treat Queen-killing like its own distinct thing, because it's so unlike anything else in the game.  It doesn't take much for a build to one-shot random mobs.
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
Lol yeah...
---
Ita not. Play wow classic instead.
---
Instigating +50% crit damage +15% crit meter Hunting Rifle
---
The stealth issue blows.  The VATS issue blows.  I'm constantly in VATS and this drives me insane.  Occasionally it'll tell me I did sneak damage but it registers as regular damage, completely borking the use of my instigating lever action. Lately when I load into the world for the first time, I have to swap my current weapon, then swap back to it, then reload it, just to get it to fire.  If I don't do this then either it fires and doesn't register any damage at all or literally just refuses to fire and complains about no ammo.
---
J/FFR/RW fixer is what im hunting
---
Funny but not a weird reason for being attacked. More of a you kicked their asses so they griefed you for days
---
i might use psychobuff but that's it for that screenshot. wouldn't be a huge amount less; i just used it for the radiation bug that still isn't fixed.
---
it's also possible to break 2.5k and go far beyond that without sneaking and temp buffs
---
 i almost never sneak with melee, but you could go even higher if you wanted.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
you're arguing the dumbest shit, acting like i give a single shit about a tv show, and making some hefty assumptions. Hang on to your buzz blade, it's fun, but the damage is pathetic to what it used to do
---
What game pass?
---
Nah, nvr been a wow person
---
Thats nothing, last night someone had done collision course a couple of times. I was trying to kill scorched for atoms. Ran up to the drops. Each box stacked on top of each other. Ok, its weird right... I fast travel to another scorch location. 10 sec later. Two boxes drop from the sky. Ok... weird. I move to Camden Park. I almost get smashed by two boxes falling from the sky. Fast travel to Distant Thunder. Two boxes drop. Say screw this and head back to C.A.M.P., I hear the bang. Fast travel to Overseer's Cache. Start racing to the event spot by the truck. Boom. Two stupid boxes and a scorchbeast. And then I got kicked. lol
---
There is some truth to this.
---
I've been working on a stealth gunslinger build and I didn't manage to run an ammo surplus until I finally got Sneak and Covert Operative into place, because they will drastically increase your per-shot damage.  Now, I've got the full Shrouded Wood Armor and Escape Artist too, so I can basically hide-in-plain-sight.
---
For the times when I get caught, though, I fall back onto either unarmed melee or shotguns.  Shotguns + Enforcer will cripple pretty much everything in a few blasts and are an ideal way to deal with things like Deathclaws at low-levels.  I happened to get 3 Iron Fist cards just from the random decks, so that was a no-brainer.
---
i have a bunch of shop items in my camp.   i've spent only $10 on atoms since game launch.
---
everything else was bought with free atoms.
---
please no I'm not farming for stars
---
....ooooooooooo
---
90% of people don't want to pvp, maybe.
---
 An Instigating melee weapon is a bit wasted. Its really for snipers. Now with appropriate perks etc one can make very good use of Furious, Executioner and of course Nocturnal.
---
What do you mean by the t60 in fallout 4? I‚Äôve never played it.
---
And you think he wouldn't have attacked me if I gave him my answer? Yeah you're victim blaming here. " I'm  not siding with them" is a pedantic statement if you're just going to defend them. My original answer is the answer I give on any type of politics inside a game where those politics aren't even relevant. Ergo I did answer the question. 
---
Reread my statement as many times as you need to figure out that my first answer is my real answer in a video game environment.
---
AA, FFR,  +10%dmg while aiming laser rifle
---
If you don't find it fun, don't do it?
---
They were in god mode
---
They should be in pacifist then. We move on much quicker when feeling certain a player is not gonna come out of pacifist.
---
Yesterday in Helvetia I was killing scorched and kept wondering why I was being attacked. There was nothing there. Then I noticed movement on the ground. What would have been feet (damn thing was upside down with the rest of its body in the earth) kept attacking me. Kept trying to shoot them, I kept getting the health bar, nothing. Then the game crashed. Poor scorched, I wonder if he ever got out. lol
---
I'm definitely not a science denier by any means. I believe our planet is an oblait spheroid as the scientific evidence shows
---
Bethesda probably isn't making a profit on the honestly rushed game and needs to find other avenues of revenue. A new player base is only coming if they fix with Wastelanders which is why they're putting tons of effort into (hopefully).
---
The p2w stuff will alienate the dedicated fans though.
---
Pretty sure I found a club at the skii resort top of the world, it was on a table inside one of the buildings.
---
As for a bone hammer, never heard of or seen it, I don't think they exist
---
Weird and cute. I can't give you two upvotes though
---
Play for 5 hours and the server might just disconnect you.  It's random.  I can play for hours without it happening or it could happen after less than 1.  And even if the server doesn't disconnect me I could be dealing with other things like quests not updating or taking too long to update or areas taking forever to load or enemies taking forever to load.  Or I can play and not have these issues at all.  It's random.  But the issue is they still happen.
---
This, have played with both instigating hunting / gauss / lever rifles they are all great. Just sniper build is too slow since most the time enemies come in groups. Now playing a Bloodied faster fire vats crit Handmade an never lookin back. Destroy packs of creatures no issues.
---
Instigating double vats fixer
---
Some times I get ‚Äúwrong ammo type‚Äù ?!? So I just have to equip a different weapon then re equip main
---
It does and they took away the "free states" graffiti on the chest, so it actually looks the way it's supposed to.
---
I like instigating for farming nuke runs , I can basically one hit everything being a monster melee build. I don‚Äôt use firearms in 76 at all so it just works for me when I have to put on PA. I‚Äôm a unarmed unarmorored melee build the other 98% of my play time
---
It's a recent addition to the game. You'll have to stop by there again to get it. I had to stop back as well, since I'd cleared through Morgantown long before they added the small backpack.
---
Good boy
---
tried that but didnt work ........been going on for about 3 or 4 days now, getting annoyed
---
The issue is skins cost too much.  There are those 2 survivalist outfits for 800 atoms in the shop right now.  If I buy 1100 atoms for $10 then 800 atoms would cost me over $7.  That's way too fucking much for one outfit.  The outfits are cool.  I actually do like them.  But I don't like them enough to justify a price tag that's over $7.
---
Or just placement xp. There is zero need for team xp. You get the place you die in.
---
Game has been zoned a bit for smoother progressions but if you run into super mutants your SoL, if I get caught without my main hand equipped and I choke like I do In must cases I get roughed up good
---
I know that unyielding boosts every stat minus END, but the totality of that didn't seem to matter much for me.   
---
Admittedly I was entirely focused on it's performance in pure PVE combat.  I don't hack terminals enough to appreciate the benefits and I have more than enough levels to not care much about XP at this point.  If Luck affected specific legendary perks and outcomes I'd completely 180.  
---
It was mostly an exercise in trying to improve my combat experience, have more fun, etc.  And I just didn't.  I definitely see the merits though.  Seeing the damage numbers for the first time had me laughing pretty hard, and as a play style it's definitely challenging and interesting.  Just not as fun or consistent for my own expectations.
---
last i played was 2 weeks ago.  frog legs did not use AP.  I tested it several times.
---
i've got both for 349 each
---
I was somewhere I had no business being doing an event I had no business doing, and the big boys babysat me make sure I got my headset in and actually helped me jump two levels. It was amazing
---
PS4? What‚Äôs ur username ?
---
For SQB look into a priming a Zealots handmade, I run a bloodied commando, but for SQB fight I take a rad shower and use my Z2515.  I got sick of dying and losing my flux, does a nice amount of damage vs all the scorched and the Queen.
---
Why weird?  This is what fun is.  Someone was trying to have a bit of fun with you.  I love having interactions like these in whatever game I play.  Stuff like this makes the game fun.
---
I would always cook it. With super duper equipped, you have a chance at doubling your yield, and it only costs 1 wood to cook it, not only slowing the meat's spoil rate, but also nearly doubling it's value at the robot vendor.
---
There's a "returning players" thing on the main page.
---
Instigating and AA would be amazingly strong lol. Not possible.
---
If I have plenty of wood and care, sure. Sometimes I just want to sell off what I have and go farm more. I don‚Äôt have any issues maxing daily caps so it‚Äôs not really necessary to cook it all.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve been playing more NW than ADV lately. It‚Äôs good fun
---
You obviously haven't been paying attention. I do happen to know the difference between a troll, and someone who actually believes the earth is flat. Trolls gish-gallop and sealion the subject and throw ad hominem attacks in along side citing already debunked YouTube flat earthers. This man-baby was literally so angry you could hear the spit flying from his mouth in a viscerally spluttering manner the likes I have only seen when a man in a stained white sleeveless shirt screams at his wife for over cooking the cheetos.
---
I usually wait until the SBQ is almost dead, and then I start using radaway to get to full health.  I then switch to a vampires weapon. They‚Äôve definitely made it so creatures attack low health/bloodied builds first and foremost.  The post SBQ chaos is crazy (but fun) to me...even if I lose my flux from time to time.
---
I think you missing the point friend..... free stuff is not the issue at hand here no one said shut down the atom shop no one said they didn‚Äôt want to pay for anything they are becoming less and less cosmetics like it was said from jump there would ONLY be cosmetics and now the their some in community that fears it will become out of control ‚Äúutilities‚Äù in the store ammo conversions the thoughts and ideas people have given are being sold to us... behind a pay wall... non obtainable unless you pull out your wallet that is the issue at hand. Atoms have been nerfed you cannot get them on the same scale you could at release so in game farming is damn near impossible. They have flat out lied before my guy you can‚Äôt get disgruntled because someone voiced there fears for the state of the game.
---
Sorry for instilling hope
---
Cheers! Will do
---
I also like how you're defending the trash. But then again without you the rest of the rotten food would get lonely in the dumpster
---
I started back up a week ago and am loving it. I went from 62 to 82 no sweat at all. I find most of the changes and whatever else they did made the game better. I am quite clueless to the changes that they made and I missed a lot of stuff. However I am way less frustrated and enjoying the new stuff.
---
Full damage potential? Like you are trying to figure out which is best?
---
I have seen one on the cliffs east of Harper's ferry.  I was very surprised to find him chilling up there, because I did find two skeletons and a dog leash and bowl first that made me think I was only going to find bones.  I thought, oh man of only I could find this doggo...  I kept climbing and there he was!  Still alive sitting down staring at me!
---
To get there, fast travel to Harper's ferry then turn around and jump down into the water under the tracks.  Run back to the cliff beneath the bridge and look for a way to start climbing up.  Make sure you can take some radiation damage.  Keep climbing and follow the ladders and boards as far as you can.  Eventually near the top, you should see the skeletons picnic and the doggy

Yes they haven‚Äôt removed any quests but you did miss some seasonal stuff.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èR2+R2+ start and select at the sametime. That's how u enable God mode. Prove me wrong.

Mayhaps you are chosen by the game to play on so that others may leave and find greener pastures

ps4 same as here.

 they are in my vending machine

Check your audio settings or your sound system. No problems on my end.

Thanks

My username is TheOutrider88
---
I think thoughts and fears and completely irrelevant have they put any amo conversations in the store is their any pay wall that stops you from playing or making it unplayable NOW??
---
&gt; They‚Äôre either missing the point or spinning data to serve their narrative‚Äîor a bit of both. No rational human being is buying scrap/repair kits. I don‚Äôt see a ton of fridges out there, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs been that popular either.
---
Or they're not and Reddit is being conspiratorial again and presenting their minority opinion as fact from a few bad faithers who should probably go back to NMA
---
I see tons of CAMPs with fridges on PS4.  Numerous posts here talked about things they would buy if they were put in the Atom Shop.
---
You sound like the NMA fanboys who refuse to accept 4 is the best selling game in the franchise by a long mile because you dont like it so everyone else must not like it
---
I can get behind that.  I like the stealth sniper because it's dangerous in its own way.   If I'm discovered my guns turn into pea shooters and I have the the vitality of a piece of toast.  I can maybe take a hit or two, but I better be doing it while I'm running away and coming up with a new plan.    
---
Being caught out in PVP means I'm dead outright but there's such a massive payoff getting the drop before they even have time to react.  It's funny every time.
---
Wow I mean how is that possible? I don't know why they ask us questions that don't make sense.
---
While I agree with your sentiment, I just don't believe they have been delivering a standard of "what most players want" in the atomic shop. And it could be unrelated, but I don't remember seeing anything from New Vegas in Fallout Shelter. I would love to be wrong though. I just feel like we have been getting a lot of Raider representation in the Atom shop, and no Brotherhood, Enclave, Communist, or Mistress of Mystery stuff yet.
---
My dream weapon Is an instigating, faster swing +1 strength knuckles. 
---
I had a previous one, which I found: instigating faster fire low Vats consumption western revolver.
---
Also found one of my favourites: multipurpose axe, instigating and faster swing. Looks meh, hits like a beast.
---
So close... Yet so far away
---
Don't forget about increasing the maximum build count
---
Quad explosive gamma gun...
---
seconded
---
I myself never stick to 19% HP, like, ever.
---
I try to have at least 111 - mostly to mitigate oneshots that can be 110 per hit tops in PvP.
---
This makes it so that the process of managing the rads is easy, and as long as you keep yourself under 50% you get the vast majority of the buffs without having to worry so much to maintain the playstyle. The sweetspot is 39%, enough to let serendipity kick in, using a significant chunk of maximum damage boosts while having half more HP than regular bloodbuilds do.
---
I focus mostly on PvP, but this makes life easier in PvE too. High agility and luck makes it so that my sneaking is superb, my critical hit frequency is amazing, and my PvE opponents are unaware of the fact they're dying.
---
Is the strangler armour that good?
---
I have a similar thing but only upon joining a server - have 35 bullets in the chamber of my lever action, instead of 5. Or if I log in holding a handmade it has 0 bullets upon joining. Good thing it goes away upon switching around weapons
---
how would that work if used in combination with the mutations?  
---
That said, if there was a way to offer branching ways to reach the same effect - mutation vs gadget, it would be a great addition. Raiders could make use of mutations, caring little for side effects.  
---
The Enclave and the BOS would probably take a more purity oriented route and come down hard on mutations within their ranks. But facing the obvious benefits of mutations, they might tinker something together for similar effects. Maybe the tech side would have little or no side effects, but be prone to breaking and require careful maintenance and parts.
---
For some reason or for a reason you don't want to admit my man?
---
The reason I'd use a bloodied build is that I don't want to be a lich in boss fights and get carried.
---
Go junkies. The stat debuffs arent bad if you pick the right ones for your build. Tied with beserkers for second place damage output except much better pve cause chameleon is only so good aginst AI.
---
Keep an instigating for your main opener and if it get ugly you still got 50% junkie build to back you up. Also vanguard and bolstering mix can help you survive for extended fights. It's very strong.
---
You must be a literal 5 year old on here
---
Well did this once, they even let me keep the ownership of the item
---
I mean mods which add new monsters or factions, dynamic weather other things that really change and improve the game. Not like the mods out now
---
I was at the power plant picking up some free unlocked cores. I (level 140) snagged  the core milliseconds before some level 7 scrub. He shot me with pistol... I irradiated his ass so fast with my quad gamma, ALMOST felt bad for him. Thanks for the gears and adhesive, peck.
---
Two shot explosive reduced weight Gatling gun
---
If FFR is faster fire rate than I'm interested.  The question is how much?  Those guns are rare regardless and I'm low on caps after picking up random gear to test a bloodied build.  I may have something worth trading though that's usually a crap shoot.
---
They don't conflict, just use weapon artisan whenever you repair weapons tho.
---
I have to say the luck perk isn't worth it tho, repairing is cheap and easy.
---
I've never heard of that radiation glitch in all my time playing. Can you provide a link or something so I can read about it? Or can you explain it?
---
How is that 2.5k+ possible? I'm talking raw damage in pipboy outside of combat. I guarantee it isn't but I'd love to see it on a damage calculator or something.
---
The TTK is of my Buzz Blade vs. Sheepsquatch is definitely noticeably faster than it is to get off the second swing of a Meat Hook, but okay buddy. How can you say that when I have used a Meat Hook and I have seen my Buzz Blade against a Sheepsquatch?
---
Looks like some good nerdy kid from high school
---
Oh boy we have an intellectual in our fo76 subreddit; perfect place to correct lads about reasoning and choice of words!
---
I love it when I‚Äôm attacked while browsing. MOFO, give me an excuse to pull out my quad gamma...
---
And a lot of them are just reused assets from fallout 4
---
Because you guys are obnoxious as all hell and we get pissed off.
---
Would take some more work on the display items. They could come up with some pretty cool ideas but you will never be able to just place items on shelfs.
---
Still i would love some open cupboards that could be filled or tables that you need to place certian objects to clutter up.
---
Be pretty cool to see an event that changes depending which side you join. Like, maybe the event is you have to help defend a settlement from attackers, but the settlement/faction changes depending on who you side with. Also, not an event but I would love to see more of the 5 raider groups in Appalachia, be pretty cool if Rose is able to get treasure hunters to re-establish the groups.
---
Also! The game barely works. Why would I buy cosmetics?
---
Speaking of fast travel problems: does anyone else have it happen where they try to fast travel, usually back to CAMP, and end up in the middle of nowhere instead? It's only happened to me two or three times now, and it was never a huge issue, but it was weird finding myself on nearly the opposite side of the map from where I'd intended.
---
Don't you see that as a misinterpretation, however?
---
The vehement outcry is that most people don't want them there at all.
---
The sales numbers are evidence that an advantage exists, and that if present, people will pay for it: forcing others to feel like they must also do so to play the game on even footing.
---
High sales on p2w items are generally evidence of people liking winning, not necessarily evidence of people liking paying.
---
"I'm not going to sit here and expect BGS to listen to a vocal minority when sales numbers speak much louder than words."
---
The vast majority of threads on the topic in this subreddit have been popular, vocal and yes, vehemently against the idea. The minority in these cases have generally been the people who desire more p2w, or at least see it as a given. I've seen a few threads voicing such ideas, of course. They are vastly less frequent, less upvoted, and most of the time just voicing mild displeasure at the topic still being an issue, when they'd just like to see gameplay stuff in the subreddit.
---
Outside of 76, there's also been a very strong backlash against the encroachment of selling AAA games at full price, and then asking for more money in small but ever-increasing increments. Look at the EA "surprise mechanics" hearing, the NBA2K backlash, and the general reception of popular F2P/full price games gradually ramping up the monetization schemes after becoming popular, but not also ramping up content releases to match.
---
There is very strong evidence that this is an exceedingly unpopular course of action in gaming in general. It's not at all disingenuous to paint this as a "vocal, industry-wide phenomenon", not a "vocal minority" as you put it.
---
used to it here. the most benign shit gets downvoted. imagine being so bad at a game you insist you have to use optional hand holding for babies repair kits to play.
---
How would you rate these effects for a knife? I'm building a one handed melee character with high health/endurance. Only level 30 now and not too interested in pvp. Not sure how important stealth is either.
---
 From best to worse: Vampire, Furious, Anti Armor, Instigating, Nocturnal (other top effects I missed?)
---
The brotherhood could create a vaccine to prevent mutations all together. That would force a serious commitment though.
---
Seriously, and I'm not joking, just ask a level 250+ person if they could spare any. Tell them it's your first character and you're only looking for heal items.
---
Currently, I have over 1500 stimpaks and 600 radaways I carry around. I just loot them all randomly. If some newbie asked me for a few, I'd probably end up giving him too many to carry.
---
Be aware you will probably get the occasion screw off or backlash, but the PC community I know would just drop a ton.  They are too useful to drop but so many add up
---
I agree. Skins are one thing, but more is crossing a line they said they wouldn't cross. While it can be argued that these things don't give a player any huge advantage, they could in the future. It always starts small like that, then before we know it, another year will pass and the Atomic Shop is full of items that give players who pay an overwhelming advantage. Not a good look, especially with the whole Blizzard debacle. Now is the time they should be trying to make it look like they care, not showing themselves to be greedy. 
---
If they really want to work on something, they should take all that energy they are using to come up with Non-Cosmetics in the Atomic Shop, and put it onto fixing parts of the game. Such as the 4th Floor of Fort Defiance. I just started a new character and took forever to complete that stupid DMV Quest which they should just get rid of because they moved shit, and every guide I found was outdated. After going through that, I go to the 4th floor of Fort Defiance and get attacked by Ghouls. You know, the creatures that Bethesda describes as "MINDLESS". By making us do all that work to get into what is supposed to be a secure location just for "MINDLESS" creature to be able to just walk on in is more than a slap in the face. That's a spit in the face to every player followed by them taking a dump right in front of us. They are pretty much saying we are all less than "MINDLESS". not to mention the fact that it doesn't even make sense from a lore standpoint. NONE of those Ghouls are Military or Brotherhood. Any Brotherhood who transformed did so into Scorched, not Ghouls. Those Ghouls are just patients and medical personnel. 
---
I sympathize with many of the programmers because they only have so much say, but thos is one of many issues that should have been addressed already. Not the most serious issue as far as game play, but definitely ranks up there as far insulting their customers is concerned when you think about it. Lol.
---
Yup did this for Flatwoods. Found 1 note that the wiki said doesn't exist, and found 3 I would have never found without the wiki; 2 tickets in the kitchen, and one hidden inside a tree trunk.
---
i wish i had a berserkers vats fixer :3
---
Im good for them hosting.   Im good with me playjng.  I am hoping with only 5-7 people in my server everything runs smooth
---
Will do
---
It's like they have pinto bean that they are trying to make into a van.
---
I just become conduit regardless and hope others. Do as well. Half the asshats that show up won‚Äôt do it then we fail because they are ignorant bastards.
---
This is a good task to set up for when Wastelanders releases. Camp near Vault 76 + Punch bowls filled with Nukashine
---
Kept everyone playing, thinking there was something new "just around the corner", though, right?
---
suckers...
---
I miss the days when you little d bags used to shoot at me with your TSE Shotguns at the train station. I would fast travel away remove pacifist double back take some chems (fury) and maybe a stealth boy and kill you with my instigating swing speed mole miner gauntlet  ( when your back was turned you guys deserved the sneak attack) then I would server hop.
---
The best was when you guys used a low level as bait  I would have to figure out who was your teammate kill them then kill you before they could load back in.
---
Thanks for the memories
---
They're all Fallout factions. Calling one "more fallout-centric" or another is dumb, and as I stated already, per the lore they don't exist in this part of the world at this point in time. The ones that do, already have had packs in the shop. I'm not sure why this is difficult for you to understand.
---
I'm not OP, so I'm not sure how you reached the conclusion I was whining.
---
I loved Far Harbor's Marine helmet, and it looked in an image when they announced the Vault Raids, I hope it will be added soon.
---
I‚Äôd love a high level server with a lot of mobs, and a much greater density of enemies overall. Like a horde mode server. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd probs crash too much. Oh well.
---
That‚Äôs gotta be a mule - people make characters to hold onto all their legendary gear and be overencumbered, so their mains are playable and not always weighed down.
---
Find the Union Uniform or Marine Tactical Helmet plans - super cheap to craft en masse. With lvl 3 hard bargain or a grape mentats, union sells for 16c each from 5 cloth/1 gold and MTH sells for 31 out of a couple glass, rubber, aluminum I think. For materials to weight to Ellington price I think the MTH is best. 
---
Churn out a bunch, sell excess looted guns like assault rifles or combat shotguns and whatever extra bulk junk or crafted food‚Äîcan get to 1400c a day easily.
---
Yeah, a players mule.  I hate that this shit occurs, but nothing you can do about it
---
Some people have a second copy of the game and have a mule character selling loot. Let's you get more scrip per day and caps from merchants effectively
---
So you okay with begin lied to is what you basically saying and I‚Äôm not but it‚Äôs America? You release trump is president right don‚Äôt get me started on America... anyway I said what I said dude nothings changing that until Bethesda proves me wrong and trust me I want them to

The Riot Gear was used by the USMC and LAPD pre-war:

---
This weeks news has been the worst thing to happen since ~February when the patches were reverting previous patches and no content had dropped yet. After the beta and launch debacle, a lot of people left so servers were decent and most of us who stuck around to play through the base content were pretty happy for a while. 
---
The other DLCs have been good additions to the game, but they were all buggy at launch and unfixed previously fixed issues with the base game as well. The game was running smoother the past few weeks, likely because of less players once again with oldies like me just running out of things to do. Raids weren‚Äôt quite what we hoped they would be, otherwise we‚Äôd still be content just strictly raiding over and over again. 
---
Having a REAL content add on happening really soon was about the only thing keeping me logging in every day or so. I can only see myself hopping on more infrequently over the next few months, but of course I‚Äôll give wastelanders a chance whenever it does drop.
---
I don't want to put you on the defensive with this question, why does it bother you?

We have 4 accounts in our household and that equates to a lot of stuff. We have 1 mule to hold stuff. Really good stuff that is too good to get rid of but doesn't fit any current builds. Gear for leveling new characters. 
---
We don't currently bother with player vending, in fact I'm not much of a fan of it. If we ever did though, it would likely be setup on the mule.
---
Nope. If you use it at all it's yours. Just like at a real store
---
I hope they officially add it too.  It's been pretty well spread on PC for a while, since people took it from the Dev Room and Bethesda let it stay, plus when you scrap it you get the plan for it and can sell even more.  Sadly consoles didn't get that.
---
At level 25 stay within the forest and toxic valley. At this point the ash heap would be the biggest stretch. A friend of mine was level 25 going into the Mire and Bog and got his ass handed to him
---
As an FYI I‚Äôve got the plan from census violence before
---
I like you and would give you props. Not like I haven't hopper servers after taking someone out.
---
Why you hate that someone has a mule?
---
Just wait until you come across a triangle earther
---
You might have to served hop a couple times, good luck!
---
The quad gamma is brutal in this meta
---
20 for piercing and 40% perferating. Yes diminishing returns
---
Dang, that‚Äôs a ton of problems üò¨
---
Not on a defensive, dont worry.  Its just that all i see on reddit is people complaining about server instability or p2w from the atom shop and  they complain about this while they have their 5 accounts and mules full of junk(extra legendaries, flux, you know, in-game play to win shit) hogging up a server.  So i know a lot of people do this(have their mules on a server securing their hoard)which definitely hurts a servers quality.  Its just kindo of contradictive i guess
---
Umm no im 38 actualy.
---
Players usually run for cover from it too, it‚Äôs a handy little thing.
---
Thanks for a reply! I appreciate it :) I thought I could get the mod from scrapping Super sledges but lol...
---
Combat zone in Fo76, sounds good
---
Well I mean there's most likely shame threads on reddit for the jerkoffs that go around exploiting trade bugs and ripping off items
---
People say it has diminishing returns but that is only true if you are eating through almost all of their armor, if you do the math, the damage increase is the same whether or not you are stacking it with other armor pen
---
Quantum.. Don't you waste a good nuka nade on that!
---
I few but that‚Äôs the risk we were willing to take for the experiment
---
As someone who stopped playing long ago but stays subbed, this still hurts me.
---
It unlocks for the whole account not just one character
---
Use mic. I tank all the time with junkies vanguard. I'll grab 2 but here the thing... I wont start my thing until someohas the other and more importantly the imposter is following me. God damn bloodied builds wipe it out too fast. Once i get my hits i can hide and get knocked. The timer still counts for the time knocked and nothing trys to kill you.
---
Have a 99% with that including survival. Me and one other guy got it in survival by using mic. Was good times.
---
Oh my bad.
---
And as far as believing I was lied to I dont feel I have see everyone's talking about the fridge well what about the backpack mod who actually says hey guys gotta go back to camp its dinner time I'll let you know when I'm done...said by no one. And as far as the scavenger bot please watched the video I sent him earlier https://youtu.be/PK6A9kIVAGI
---
And this one sums it up as my two references 
---
https://youtu.be/P5bKr7sF_iA in this one just beginning with the bot 
---
I don't own these
---
You good just an fyi
---
aww poor pupper!! he's beautiful!! last pet I takes ran away from a mob and got stuck legit past the boundary fence. I moved camps over 5 times attempting to get it to unstuck and come to camp with no results. on top of that I cannot even tame a new animal, no option available.
---
please Bethesda, please, one of the coolest and most fun features in the game is full of bugs and inconsistencies and would be so enjoyable if fixed.
---
Fair response and hard to argue against.
---
Well the experiment failed and it in fact does not affect the ghouls in vault 94. The hope was that it would turn them all into glowing ones and we‚Äôd triple the xp gained but alas it did nothing more than piss people off and cause trouble
---
With no death, how would you know who won?
---
I can never figure out what to price them at so they either don‚Äôt sell or I end up just scripting them
---
Ammo stops being a problem when you invest in some perks and that. My commando used to struggle until I started using .38 or 10mm for everything except the Sbq and encryptid. 
---
I would prefer to be able to have a common ammo stash among all my characters, really.
---
No death penalty, as in no caps/aid loss on death.
---
I believe you have to complete the quest mayor for a day. it's a side quest given to you by the mayor's assistant in watoga if you go to one of the buildings.
---
They are all fallout factions. That is a fact. It is also a fact that the Enclave and the BoS have been far more established in lore and around 20 years longer than the Free States or Responders. 
---
The Brotherhood and Enclave had not had packs in the shop. I fully understand what you are saying, but I don't think you understand what I am saying at all.
---
We have had Raider and Free State packs. We have absolutely not had BoS or Enclave (the two factions that preexist all of the other factions in the game at current) in the shop as faction packs. 
---
The BoS and the Enclave are in the lore at current in Appalachia. The BoS has been in every fallout game, the enclave very near every fallout game. To drive it home, neither one has had a faction pack in the atomic shop as of right now....
---
Same here. First disconnect was BETA, second was September. Beyond that the only glitches I experience are visuals for other players.
---
Ok I'm just wanting to go there without being killed while shoping
---
Maybe the option to subscribe to get this stuff into the game instead of put in a cash shop?
---
I understand that armor pen is less useful or not useless at all on low resistance enemies if that's what your telling me.
---
But, either there's diminishing returns or not, right? I'd like to know specifically how much less penetration you get from combining multiple types of armor pen
---
Thanks for opening that door!
---
Way to miss my point and simultaneously prove it.
---
I am Liberty Prime! I am America!
---
Money has to come from us the consumers, but it absolutely doesn't have to come from us like this.
---
I do bloody stealth and I love it.
---
Do the mayor for a day quest and the bots will leave you alone
---
Kill them all to flex on them.
---
Please don't be one of those "if I didn't crash, no one else ever crashed, or they are faking it" kind of person. Since you said you don't understand, allow me to explain.
---
People play in different time zones where the in-game population differs, have different setups like Xbox 1 or PC, or live in different environments where connection delays can affect the game adversely. Just because you are lucky doesn't mean that everyone else is also similarly lucky, given those differences as mentioned.
---
Also just because you saw a few people complaining about crashing hourly does not mean that the majority crashes frequently. There are many players like you who enjoy the game without crashes, but simply do not voice it out on this platform, because having a game that doesn't crash often is a normal expectation.
---
I am on PC. We have bought the game a total of 4 times (my wife and I). When we want to trade we have to get two instances of the game running on one computer and do exactly what you said, trade with ourselves. Prior to picking up the second accounts we would use our primaries, logoff, switch characters etc to get stuff where we wanted it. 
---
I don't know that it is any less complicated now, but we have more room and more importantly more characters to play.
---
"Creators don't owe their audience anything "  
---
Creators that create things they are not charging for don't owe their audience anything. The second you start charging people for a product you owe the product that was advertised.
---
Dont get me wrong, i want all the endgame and rare stuff too but im tired of seeing the same guy with 2 mules on each server.  Imagine a already faulty bugthesda server trying to deal with all these abnormalities and then all the normal players hopping on.
---
Collect different flowers and plants - had to use an alt character to get the last one ticked off altho my main had collected said plant about 100 times. Visit X location - again had to use 3 alts to get those ones marked off (being a level 2 running around the bog was a hair raising experience üòÖ). Catch different diseases - my main and alts have had sluge lung numerous times and it still hasn't ticked off.
---
There was only one cheater I didn‚Äôt mind, he just started raining down nukes across the map. On one hand ya he killed almost every player, on another, it was hella entertaining to just watch it rain (with a bit of lag lol) Everyone else... you know where you can stick it :)
---
That‚Äôs completely a possibility, but like you said, there will always be people who cheat purely because they think it‚Äôs unfair that you have to practice to be good at something. Artificialaiming makes a fortune off stroking that side of their ego.
---
To make mutations requires a type of flux and a few base ingredients. Not much really. 
---
They are a good money ( cap ) earner because you can sell one mutation to the robot venders for approx 450 caps each - depending on your perks.
---
90% disease resist, + DR, + Rad
---
Slower armor wear and tear
---
Less Resources to repair heavy weapons and armor
---
... these were some ideas that popped out of my head as potential rewards for doing something like that.
---
You can make 5 characters... if you got 2 xbox live accounts you can make 10 characters....its right on the home page. You pass over gear thru a freind or leave it on a server, back out, switch characters, re join the same server and grab it. Everybody on this game usually has a few characters, more often then not your looking at an alternative character when you come across someone.
---
Does it start by a misc quest of reaching the mayor's office
---
Yes
---
* Eventually you get them all and you do not have to seek out somebody selling what you want.
---
* Serums can sell to train station vendors for 500 caps (depending on your charisma)
---
* They each take 1 flux (type varies) and some other misc ingredients like oil, nuclear materiel, bone, antiseptic
---
how about 2? one for peasants and one with placed bets?
---
Ah, a fellow robot lover of culture, I see. I'd get that assaultron in an instant.
---
roflmao too funny
---
yes
---
OMG your name üòç I LOVE Farkas (Or Fuck-ass, his nickname)
---
I thought that might be the case.
---
Wait, what kind of foot?
---
Tank killer + pen capacitor give 61,60% armor pen, tank killer + pen capacitor + anti armor give a max of 80,80% armor pen
---
I'll buy two copies of Starfield if the game is great in order to make up for your lost sale then.
---
i don't know your exact build, but the common sentiment is that you could do more with the meat hook because it got the 1h cards too. thing is, i tried using all 9 + iron fist and still did less than with my unstoppable monster.
---
about the rad thing, take a buffout or HP altering product and walk into an area with high radiation and see what doesn't happen. i use it for the queen fight. should be obvious why for any bloodied player. doesn't  affect my damage number, though, just optimizing the queen fight
---
Right on.  I'll def take you up on the offer sometime.
---
Before Fallout 4, T-60 power armor never existed, rather, the most advanced power armor devised by the pre-Great war military was the T-51b (3rd favorite power armor in the fallout series.) but Fallout 4 decided to add it as if nobody would notice, effectively making t-51b a redundant version of power armor, as T-60 was a superior power armor. In fallout 76 however, making Excavator power armor never even leave west Virginia was a great idea which didn't burn a hole through the games lore.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
I think healing factor + stealth would work wonders.
---
I built my camp just above Welsh Station. A static spawn for a cat named Murgle. Every time I enter a new world, she's there. A permanent pet! And she only roams in a small vicinity so she's never lost.
---
yo do you not know how to actually reply to a comment of reddit? Go back down to Blue Badger's comment and click reply, people know what you are talking about (basically just reply to him normally to give some context to any 3rd party please lol)
---
Dont know if those numbers are right but I like u
---
i don't think bethesda's the one blame, i mean, we are getting free DLC, and i'd rather people buy random small utility items in the atomic then pay for a "Season Pass"
---
The plan drops from queen of the hunt pretty frequently for me.
---
IIRC armor rating is a summation of all the parts and applied to the whole character, which is why most hats and such don't have a DR/ER. Any that currently do are accidentally left in from FO4 since they have been removing those values from items since release.
---
As much as I hated seeing raiders stuff in the atomic shop many weeks in a row I really miss the nuka-world raider outfits. Though I can't find a lore reason to add those.
---
I'm not sure why they are so reluctant to add the marine helmet to the mire or bog lists so they can be obtained legitimately. Same with the trapper lobster cage helmet...
---
There needs to be some kind of drastic differences like this between the upcoming factions.
---
Tagging for notice. u/Ladydevann u/Valseek
---
Using the fallout 76 damage calculator latest version, there is a post on reddit but I've find it time ago thx to a friend, not everything is correct but the stacked armor pen is for sure.
---
Wow this is such a good idea it is almost like bethesda is too fucking stupid to implement it, it's been a long day
---
I don't have to imagine I see it plenty every day. People with the Empath mules annoy me the most.
---
Thank you
---
Sometimes I am proud of the 76 community. Sometimes I am sad at it.
---
thanks friend!
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Would be a really really good way to earn back some fan points.
---
I'd have more issue with the atomic shop if cash was the only way to get atoms. I do think they need to tweak atom rewards for challenges and add more daily and weekly challenges. These reoccurring tasks could be a lot more entertaining with a little more thought. They already expanded it somewhat with wild Appalachia, but they need to go a lot further when Wastelanders comes out. As long as I can have fun grinding for atoms, adding some utility items doesn't seem pay to win to me.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Probably based on your comment. Not sure what not being op has to do with anything
---
Yeah, I know that. You can literally check for yourself and see that it isn't possible on the damage calculator. Just Google it.
---
I am coming to the conclusion that part of the problem is server lag.  The messages don‚Äôt always seem to line up with what is actually going on, and sometimes the pylon won‚Äôt connect even when I am spamming ‚ÄòE.‚Äô  Without 3 pylons able to synchronize, it keeps failing and frustrating everyone who is legitimately trying, but slightly out of phase.
---
Bad bot
---
Idk most dog food was corn based until a while back when everyone was told their animal will live a terrible life if meat isn't #1 on the ingredient list.
---
Dogs still live the same amount of time lmao
---
Except like, wastelanders.
---
Same. Very wary of accepting team request. Was hoping to get some unwanted junk or ammo. Oh well. Lived to tell.
---
... you want consumers to have choice, don't you.
---
They can't, because there's no right answer that won't infuriate the people in this subreddit
---
This is the answer I was looking for. What is pen capacitor btw?
---
What system are you on?  I am sure if you put the word out someone will be happy to supply a non-legendary.  Many hands make light work!  ;)
---
Well done. Hope you write their names down for future slaughter. I was fortunate enough to run into somebody already on my shitlist today and was able to intervene in their attempt to contest a workshop owned by somebody else. The poor guy with the workshop must not have known what to think.
---
I was using a gauss as an example so it use perforating capacitor that's it's the same as perforating mag
---
\&gt; "barely made any good money off of fallout 76"
---
the game probably cost them barely anything to make it compared to other titles they own because it expanded next to nothing from fallout 4, and is a glorified asset flip.
---
\&gt; for free at this one store
---
because one store represents the entire market. great justification there.
---
\&gt; always on sale for 20$ or less
---
That's a much more agreeable price considering the crap effort put into the game. They probably would have sold significantly better if they started off with that, or at least had fewer refunds.
---
\&gt; we get free DLC
---
That's what's expected of games as a service. If they were to charge for everything they add to the game, they wouldn't be able to use that to describe the game. Though, I suppose that's not a big deal to them. After all, the game's been nothing but lie after lie for a long time now. I guess this wouldn't be a very big one in the grand scheme of things.
---
\&gt; support bethesda
---
For what? for helping making leeching money off of us the industry standard? For skimping out on expenses left and right at the cost of a more stable game for multiple titles? For going back on literal promises used to market their game? Thanks, but no thanks. I'm fine with having a spine.
---
\&gt; they have done very good work before
---
And they've done nothing but tarnish their reputation with their actions in the past few years. That's how ruining their own reputation works. Gotta have done something to warrant having one first.
---
\&gt; are starting to better them selfs
---
LOL yeah right. Looking an awful lot like an ostrich, my dude.
---
\&gt; Free fucking dlc
---
You mean updates? in a live service game? gee, i wonder what obligates them to do that... Maybe that it's a live \*service\* game?
---
\&gt; Chill queerbone

Always nice to see someone resort to ad hominem attacks when their position gets threatened. I only accused you of being part of the problem that's ruining the franchise, because it's proven that the more spending is done in regard to a certain marketplace practice, the more that practice becomes the norm. So the more people buy these nonsense mtx and continue to play games riddled with flagrant bullshit, the more that flagrant bullshit becomes the standard for other games as well.
---
As someone who used chameleon armor I love this idea. Kinda sucks wasting materials on a sight that I can‚Äôt even use 75% of the time. Now if  only the 10mmSMG had a good pair of sights to put it on...
---
My man
---
You can always build your camp around the immortal dog that‚Äôs on top of the rocks next to its dead owners.
---
Not to discount your experience - but for some of us it seems they break at least 2x a session. 
---
Perhaps it‚Äôs various bugs or something on our end but that seems like the outlier experience from everyone I play with.
---
(Even with the repair perks)
---
I'd guess that most people (especially those griefing) find it easier to be a jerk when they know nothing about you. But seeing the wholesome in you brings out the wholesome in them maybe? Or maybe they're hoping to upset someone who maybe "deserves" to be upset but your dog makes them feel like you're nicer or more relatable? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Just another reason that dogs are great I suppose
---
I am on Xbox, I forgot to include it before.
---
D) All of the above
---
Disagree with many posts in this thread but you articulated that really well. I agree with you. Just you, though
---
I love the pure hilarity of excessive damage.  ;).  Totally weird wasteland, completely changes the game experience.  It‚Äôs nice to find a new way to enjoy the game.
---
I'd love a pvp zone and would even be okay with caps/aid/junk loss on death just like survival. What would annoy the hell out of me is sure enough some anti pvp people would go in the zone feeling entitled and cry when they got shot at.
---
I would be happy to help as well, I need it on one of my characters as well so if anyone else is looking..
---
psn: johannautumn
---
I agree, well said.
---
If they advertised no micro-transactions or free content forever, then yes this is a betrayal of trust. People would have bought it on that promise. Instead, Bethesda said "We are taking a big swing on an online Fallout game, and you can try what we came up with for $60" and a chunk of people paid. The problem is a vocal minority of those people believe they paid a service fee that entitles them to every change and free thing they want for now and eternal. They're so loud and constant these days that it drowns out everyone else.
---
I just dont play anymore. I was a 76 apologist for the longest time but i cant defend this malarkey theyve been pulling
---
It was supposed to be fun/engaging gameplay loop, huge amount of content and slick and issueless gameplay.
---
but yeah since we don't have those I'll take yours too I guess.
---
And no, there is nothing relevant in weapons for calculating armor pen, but ofc a 61,60% of a gauss is more than a 61,60% from an handmade or hunting rifle cuz logically the armor pen work directly with damage. In that case more damage is better for a maximum armor pen. Ps now the bed is calling me, the 7 minutes reddit repost "u are doing that too much" is killing me.
---
Yes, it was. If you were a part of it, thank you and you're awesome!
---
I like you.
---
Those are arguably the best rifles in the game. Furious/Faster Fire Rate is the only other one I‚Äôd even consider off the top of my head.
---
I'm an all animal lover. I have two siamese mix cats, Derpy and Sweetpea and a French Bulldog named Mabel. I had three budgies, Lucy, Baal and Mephistopheles. Pretty sure Mephisto killed off his flock mates. He's an evil little shit but I love him anyways
---
So, 20 bucks for 3 copies. Idk if you're agreeing or disagreeing
---
I do pretty well in vanguard gear with ap and using my TSE lever. I have about 500dr and 500er and can tank scorch beasts with ease. The only weakness of my build is rad resistance which of course is rough because I am not a PA user.
---
Only if you have more money than you know what to do with and have all the gear you want.
---
i have a legitimate question.
---
i have been a fan of fallout series, faithfully playing every fallout game up till fo76. i could not continue after 2 months (i tried really hard to like it)
---
even after bethesda continues to ignore player feedback and do their own thing, what drives you players to play still?
---
Man I still am hoping that Fallout 76 can be filled with content and the servers and bugs... I know what you mean but I have chosen to try ignore them since the "stuck when going out of armor" bug was arround I try not caring about them that much. Being angry at the server or glitches king of messes it up. Improvements have been made I guess we will be abble to QA the next releases in PTS as prommised.
---
I love PvP in basically every game - but it's pretty useless in fo76. No balance, exploits and a terrible engagement system if you ask me.
---
Had 3 people shooting at this asshole who just runs up and keeps hitting people. 0 0 0 damage everywhere. Super fun :)
---
If you're talking for rifleman (semi auto) build, your best bet is to grab a anti-armor explosive Guass rifle or railway if you're a vats guy for large enemies and a same roll handmade for large groups of enemies though even a non automatic. Anti armor tesla is pretty good for mobs of ghouls as well for close range mob clearing.
---
Archer, Athlete, and Medic can be done in about an hour if you have the fast travel points unlocked or a friend does.
---
Many of them use miniguns and other big guns but i have never seen any brotherhood knight wielding a non energy small arm.
---
Amen damn it.
---
This is what makes the game fun, silly and stupid interactions with other players.  This guy was trying to make his own bit of fun.  Yeah, he was yelling and swearing at you but over a ridiculous premise.  I doubt he was serious.  I can't imagine someone would seriously go into an online game to preach unironically about the flat earth.  If someone did this in my game then I'd have a really good laugh.
---
I have heard about this, it is some trick used to duplicate items.
---
A Mr. Handy who is actually a Handyman, nice.
---
I think a big problem is that a lot of times, it's not still there. The atom shop would be a great way to earn free atoms and get rare stuff, but they put everything on limited time. This forces people who reaaaally want that item to buy, or not get it. If the limited time went away, more people would get it for free. But less people would also spend really money to get it.
---
This would be an incredible update idea.  Have a raider thunderdome where players can duel without losing gear or caps.  Let it be an option to set wagers like caps or items before the duel that the winner gets.  Give a 3 2 1 countdown before a couple doors open and the players can enter the arena.  Really a 3 2 1 countdown on regular pvp should already be in the game.  That would make it a whole lot more fair.
---
They do use ballistic although rare.The AER9 laser rifle/pistol SEEMS to be standard issue, that said in fo4 they use miniguns as a ballistic weapon in fo3 they used ballistic assault rifles (both the r91 and Chinese assault rifle if memory serves correct) I don't remember what they used in New Vegas I think it was the old Gauss rifle and gattling laser/minigun. So while they do use ballistic weapons in Bethesda's canon its alot rarer than in FO1 where initiates and knights could be seen packing desert eagle's and assault rifles. I'm on my phone right now but if your looking for further specific info i recommend you do a wiki search on the npc/enemies as there could be more, these are just the ones i remember :)
---
Fallout 1 Intro, Right? RIGHT?
---
Thank you! I was mostly just looking for any precedent lol. I don‚Äôt want to respec my character for power armor and energy weapons when I already made them a sniper.
---
What keeps me in the game is my group of buddies who role play. Nothing better than blindsiding a regular player while we're in character and trying to get them roped in a weird scenario. For the most part we take our characters day by day and stick with the "story line" we make. (just whatever happens in our adventures)
---
Workshops.  They'll get attacked and whenever that happens you'll get a nice chunk of xp and loot which usually includes chems like stims or radaway.
---
Did you just assume my power armor has no gender?!?!
---
It's a mule.
---
No problem. While all the ARs I've seen them use we're full auto you could pass for using a handmade rifle being a designated marksman rifle. It's pretty close to the Chinese assault rifle and as you raise the point of power armor not all soldiers  wore power armor. Some wore "recon armor" while the Bos hood is in 76 as a helmet the armor itself is not. But scout armor would no doubt be a pretty believable alternative.
---
The thing I learned about this game, is to let go. Don't collect things. Don't cherish things. Scrap it. Use it. Move on and punch. Nothing is sacred and nothing in game lasts forever. I felt sad having to get rid of some guns that I held onto since level 5. Especially rewarded things. Every sacred reward you get will become an issue in weight management. Up until you have to learn to let go and not be a hoarder. You have to decide, what's more important, continuing to be unencumbered or the quest line/grind. Even bulk junk items need to be sold. Those clothes and uniforms take up space too. 
---
It's a shame you cant decorate your place with the things you owned in the drop and move fashion that you used to have in prior fallouts. There is very little private ownership in this game. Everything feels used. It kind of feels like a low key version of communism oddly enough. Your junk is distributed if you die. Your cap limits just means you must spend back. The workers take over work shops....ect. I'm not directly saying it, but kind of are. No private ownership besides the tools you need to continue to grind. Yeah sure people collect some things, but you're very limited to what that is. If you're not careful, it turns back to junk or scrip. Even the animals you make friends with eventually goes back to its natural habitat.
---
Out of curiosity, have you ever done roleplay in 76?
---
Cool. Have fun, bro üëç
---
There is no word. Anything you read that is not released by Bethesda is pure speculation, assumption, and opinion.
---
Wastelanders is meant to have companions, and Dogmeat was part of the companion system so, perhaps this is already in the works.
---
mules don't hurt server stability because they're not always online. I, and most other people, just play normally, and when we're close to being overencumbered we open another instance of the game and trade over. the process is usually done within 30 minutes, if you have a bunch of stuff to trade over. otherwise it's done in a few seconds.
---
How do you know if they are a tameable variant? I have the perks I think but can barely get a molerat to stop attacking me let alone tame anything.
---
It's getting both better and worse every day.
---
Yeah happened to me and another player. I kinda followed someone a bit and fast travelled to the farm near him but it spawned me right at him. And this was out of the way and not in the same area you would fast travel to normally.
---
You could've been the better man there... Just say in.
---
Dedicated hard RP? No. But tiny phrases I weave in here and there such as using phonetic alphabet and saying goodbye to the few people who have mics with "save travels - steel be with you/ad victorium" but that's about it.
---
Only if you stay in the match to the end. Otherwise, no.
---
The shovel is cosmetic :P
---
Not sure why but I was playing around in my CAMP setting up a display case and I could hear a player running around in my house.
---
I'm cool with that and love when people look at all my hard work to my camp.... I turn around and BOOM they shot me point blank with a fat man! They gave me a thumbs up and I gave them a thumbs down... The proceeded to limp out my front door. Still no clue why they went that route. 
---
Took a video of it (Xbox one)
---
I‚Äôd love to do a hard RP but honestly I‚Äôm just too shy lol.
---
i'm pretty sure they used the assault rifles in fallout 3.
---
Ditto.
---
Yes i server hop at watoga for 22hours and end up get all the dense but only scout armor that can't be found
---
Stopped browsing Reddit about 6 months ago, still get pulled in here for Google searches from time to time. 
---
Your post gave me some hope, that maybe I don't have to see the same 20 comments vomited across 1000 posts if I'm ever looking for news.
---
Thanks, sir
---
Go join a Xbox lfg.
---
Did the event where you gave to escort a brahmin herd with a friend. We were both low level and doing the event for the first time. Just had no idea. So we reach the end and right as the sheepsquatch spawns there fts a high level player to us. Me thinking I can help chugg a couple of nades over. And the worse luck, right before the dude killed it my nade did. I was hit with the most Russian rage I've ever encountered (and I play cs go) he was pretty mad he couldn't kill me so I kept talking to my friend in discord while he kept laying into me... 
---
Still don't get the fuzz... We all tagged it..?!
---
Thanks for the info. Didn't even know about that  bug
---
True forgot about that.
---
My guess is that he was prob. Filming tbh. He wanted to be a cool memer and you wouldn't let him. Gosh I hate how this pollutes gaming. I do RP most of the times but this is just bs, bunch of people that communicate through phrases they read online. And that's supposed to be funny.
---
...you have "almost" 100%'d the game? AND you're not even level 100?
---
Yeah..... I was 45 to be honest üòÖ I‚Äôm one achievement away from 100%‚Äôing the game and that‚Äôs the ‚Äúget to level 100‚Äù one
---
Nuke runs at whitespring  you can pull crazy xp
---
Thanks dude I‚Äôm going to try it out tonight
---
Putting my camp on a lead vien I think pisses people off who also have the same spot. Ive been nuked twice!üòü
---
Oh it's a game? Shit I had no fucking idea when I bought the game on my console, I figured it was a movie depicting morons like you itching to start arguments because they're lonely. Can't even talk about a weird encounter that concerned me more than humoured me without cantankerous little children running about trying to assert themselves into a scenario in which they were not involved, and therefore cannot pass a judgement call on their lack of first hand experience. But go on and tell me how you know more even though you weren't present.
---
I think it has more to do with the items that only show up once in a great while being limited to a week or so of availability. 
---
Sure, you can build free atoms at a decent rate, save for something you know is coming, and buy it when it finally hits. But there's no announcement when or if the hero of the wasteland statue (or in my wife's case, the nuka girl under armor) is coming back out, if ever
---
But, then they release some brand new item they've been implementing (instead of devoting those resources to fixing some really game breaking bugs, where I think a lot of the frustration comes from) for atoms only, for 7 days or 11 days or whatever. It happens regularly enough that you obviously can't keep up.
---
So you miss out on unique items you want, or buy atoms. Duh right? A solid business model
---
I think the complaint comes that there are no new quest items to make anyone feel like anything new they receive will come from playing. Just from spending money.
---
If you're logging on to a game just to spend cash and no new incentive, why bother?
---
If the people who love this game don't want to log on for new in game content, why bother?
---
If nobody else is playing an online game that is dying because nothing obtained through questing is being added, why bother having it take up space on your hard drive? And that's why people are getting upset. 
---
Personally I don't care. After 180 levels I just like finding desk fans and cans and blowing up super mutant heads. But I get it. I don't want the game to die either
---
No, more like I enjoy space related science. Nice try though just because you tried to justify someone's mental breakdown with assertions as if you were there, which you weren't.
---
Looks like you'll fit into that subreddit quite nicely Kevin
---
It's called the brotherhood recon rifle for a reason.
---
 I need Sturges Outfit!
---
We have more in common than you think. Have a wonderful night.
---
Would love to see this one.
---
You never heard of sarcasm? Maybe you guys are the salty ones? Did you ever stop to think of that? I‚Äôm just here enjoying my time on Reddit.
---
Yeah, and you've got blazarquazar over here in the comments trying to validate himself by saying I'm a candidate for the ironically named r/iamverysmart, even though space and our solar system intrigue me to the point where I do quite a bit of extensive research. The guy is trying to be sone sort of antihero madlad but he's just a straight up anthropomorphized jizz sock.
---
No i played in beta till december. then I played the following summer. I've been following the game ever since Beta. I've seen all the ups and downs. I'm in a 25K facebook member group for fallout games including separate groups like fallout 76. I am a huge fan of the series. I played contently away from all the drama during those times.
---
Here is the thing. You are not going to read my paragraph, but you'll realize we are talking and agreeing about the same stuff. Don't get hostile on reddit with me by saying things like, "why are you even here?"
---
Yes but then you can‚Äôt find the dust that was formerly a super mutant. Makes stealing from the dead difficult.
---
Super common , 3 star enemies hardly ever drop 3 star items. It‚Äôs a huge complaint in the various communities
---
Very good to hear., Thanx
---
Have you not ever looked at someone else‚Äôs profile?
---
Silly
---
 I don't need Vampire for anything. I survive well. ;)
---
 Furious buffs your knife over time well and is recommended. 
---
As a melee character you should have Incisor and 3 levels of that ignore 75% of armour. Anti Armour is not that useful for melee.
---
 Instigating is good once per full health char. Its OK but not great.
---
Nocturnal is great. A good buff at night for your starting point. Mine go out at 200+.
---
 Executioner is also a very good melee effect for knives.
---
 Fast swing with a Fast weapon is very useful. ;)
---
10 plastic give or take a few depending on your intelligence from a laser rifle with scrapper perk on.  Kill super mutants.  They give you plastic, steel, high level legendary items, and even caps and gunpowder.  Oh, and every super mutant place has workbenches to scrap you massive hauls.
---
Yeah it sucks i have several challenges bugged, It's not in their best interests to fix these bugs particularly i guess they already want to get rid of the atom rewards when wastelanders come, at least their support will help and give the reward if you show proof in the support tickets.
---
Nukes and dragons has a NW builder. Take a look at the cards and see if the ones you want will work with your current character. 
---
I.e. the ever popular and extremely abused frog legs requires 9 agility points. Can that work on your current character? Can you shuffle special points around to make your desired NW cards on you character without fundamentally ruining them? 
---
If the answer is no then start a new one.
---
Some people are just looking to pick a fight. They‚Äôll invent reasons if need be.
---
I had a guy follow me halfway around the map the other week, from the Whitespring Station to Berkeley Springs, just shooting me periodically with an explosive 50 cal. He was also trying to poach kills on my legendary farm route, but that‚Äôs hard to do when your target du jour is a bloodied rifleman. I figured he‚Äôd go away, but I just blocked him and server hopped after dropping stuff in the stash. The dude must have been really bored.
---
So if someone didn't like what you said, and proceeded to threaten your family in rage, you would be laughing instead of being concerned for their mental health?  Not a good character highlight
---
Sbq?
---
Swing speed - faster swinger/ reduced weight - fully modded 2h weapons weigh lots. Your prefix is up to you furious is fun - more damage per hit / executions - double damage when enemy  is lower than 40% health / instigating double damage if not in fight added with sneak this can one shot a lot of enemies if your spec'd right not great in mobs and vampire - health regen per hit. I can't think of anymore beyond that that work well In melee
---
I'm just doing vault raids and slowly assembling my Strangler Heart PA set.  By the time I finish it, Wastelanders will probably be out.
---
Source?
---
Are you rarted
---
Pretty sure he didn't. In fact during the first presentation he stressed it was going to be entirely online.
---
It‚Äôs not the same one were they randomly drop near you? I have had a couple of times this happen that they keep dropping all day long. I first thought that some one must have shot it down but like after the fifth I started opening my map and no one was even near me. I didn‚Äôt even fast travel for this to happen
---
Took me a few days to get from 18 to 50.  But I had help.  Friends gave me ammo and helped spawn higher level enemies so I could get more xp.  Had a level 10 bloodied pipe rifle and 3 peices of chameleon armor I got lucky and found.  Used the pipe rifle til 50 then rolled a fixer.  The secret is landing sneaky headshots all day and never being detected.
---
lol no not offended at all, I haven‚Äôt found a good low level instigating yet, I do have a level 1 instigating hunting rifle that I use when leveling up from 1. It one shots everything that‚Äôs scaled to my toon‚Äôs level (low). But if someone spawns a bunch of high levels, level 1 instigating isn‚Äôt that helpful any more so I have to switch to bloodied. Thank you for offering to help, I‚Äôm on PS4 too and I collected so much junk, one of my mules carry nothing but max weight of junks, and I still don‚Äôt leave anything behind when I kill anything. This game really brings out the hoarder in us lol üòÇ
---
or at least fix the ones that are stuck like kill the sbq 11/12 for 80 ap. or get desease 21/22 for 80. then find locations that dont count in once found thats another 80 points lost
---
Bloodied Swing Speed and 40% more power attack damage. Those are the ones you‚Äôre looking for
---
The game will always be a buggy mess unfortunately. There are still simple issues that have been around since launch that Bethesda never bothered fixing. At least it can still be fun even though it‚Äôs frustrating.
---
Are you a fuck wit
---
I've got healing factor, PC
---
My game used to crash and bug a hell lot, bought a new powerfull pc, solved it all...
---
This is my personal opinion.... as an unarmed melee build I look for anything with faster swing speed. Also anything with +1 strength. That would be a God roll for me. Junkies FSS +1 Strength. 
---
Reduced weight doesnt suck either, especially for the 2 handed weapons.
---
Anything for me that's troubleshooters or beserkers or Zealots is pretty much insta script. You might can sell them cheap if they're FSS but other than that those are script for me. Some might like ghoul slayers for whitesprings but I like a weapon I can use for everything.
---
You can probably find nice homes for anything bloodied or junkies or even instigating and furious. Actually if you find anything Junkies FSS hit me up lol.
---
I'm more likely to look for deathclaw gauntlets, mole miner gauntlets, sledges, grognak axes as opposed to anything else but one handed has never been my thing.
---
ma'am.
---
I look at it this way:  Don't buy their next games.  Not the next Fallout, not the next Oblivion.  Just stop giving Bethesda money.
---
IF you think you really want to buy one of their games again, AT LEAST wait for the reviews to come out.  AT LEAST wait for some real positive word of mouth about it.  
---
They need to see at least a hiccup in their reception in order to get them to take notice of their players.  Because at the moment, they already got your money, and they don't really care about your opinion.  They think it's something they can add as a punchline to a joke in one of their E3 presentations.
---
I not even gonna lie I was pretty stoked when they announced the fridge. I always perk up for queen fights so I have a lot of food on my character at any given time. So the thought that I could free up 1-2 perk card slots (the FDC  card) and possibly switch my port-a-fridge (Backpack Fridge) for an armored one or high capacity backpack got me excited.  Months later and I have an empty fridge at home and all my groceries still on my me....
---
I know its been 4 months since this happened, but letting you know that I nuked your base lol
---
Unyeilding is by far the best if you are looking to maximize melee damage.  But gun users have lots of options.  Chameleon and weightless make stealth easy, life saving peices allow you to self-proc revenant perk reliably, etc.
---
Also, it's important that you know about the mods for armors.  Marine can't have a shadowed mod, so it's inherently less stealthy.  Some arms can have up to 3 different mods to choose from that each augment your melee damage (even if it doesn't show in pip-boy, they work).  Legs mods like sleek and muffled are super useful for stealth builds. Lighter armor is better for stealth.
---
Deep pocketed isn't the end-all be-all, it actually sucks for most builds.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Yes! It's the best thing ever. And also the worst because it takes quite a bit of luck to even stumble across one that's tameable. Then, they have to make it back to your camp. So, if your camp is near Flatwoods and you tamed a Sloth in the Cranberry Bog, your Sloth may never make it to its new home. 
---
The rules of taming a pet are: A.) It must be a random, solo spawn. So, Deathclaw Island is a no-go. Even though it's a solo spawn, it's not random. The pack of mongrels that spawn outside of Flatwoods? Nope. They spawn in a group (and consistently). B.) It must be half of your level or less. If you're a level 50 it must be a 25 or lower. The higher your level, the better chance you have of coming across different animals you can tame. C.) You can only tame one animal at a time. If you have a cat at your camp and then come across a yao guai you want to tame, if you try, there will be a prompt that tells you that your current pet will leave your camp and you can choose to stay with the current or your can tame the new one.  D.) You need to have the Animal Friend perk fully maxed out at 3. E.) Your Charisma needs to be pretty high, as well. The higher your Charisma, the better! 
---
The "Animal Friend" perk unlocks at level 30. Once you equip that card, when you point your gun at an animal it'll give you the option to "pacify" it for a short time. (Just a minute or so.) Once you max out your Animal Friend perks to 3, when you point your gun at the animal you'll see the "tame" option instead of "pacify". 
---
Also, when you do a rank 3 of "Wasteland Whisperer" it gives you a wider variety of things to tame. (at least from what I understand! I'm working on that one. I'm a level 62 and have focused on some other things but am now working on W.W.). 
---
I hope this helps some! I'm still figuring the game out, myself, and trying to organize my perk cards for an optimal build for my character. I had the same reaction as you, though, the first time I saw that creatures could be pets at our camps and I immediately set out to make it a thing!
---
I COULD have, yes. Would you let some bush leaguer attack you?
---
Good luck. I'm level 160+ and dont have the level 100 achievement
---
I would let this level 7 have that fusion core. Yes.
---
This. Been around forever. Not even sure they've acknowledged it.
---
That's a reasonable request
---
Make no bones about it, this is a serious issue especially around this time of year!
---
Started playing reddead online instead
---
I have all of those except for speed demon, I‚Äôll look for that. Thanks. Any recommendations on better melee weapons?
---
Same dude. I played meat week the first time and said bleh.
---
Now I'm level 70 on red dead and having A BLAST.
---
Worry not for your family have been ground into a serum that I sold to a robot vendor for my daily caps across 6 characters.
---
Darn this is so old.  I wish I found this sooner.  I can still be amused by it I guess.
---
&gt; As I said, the fridge works for only half of the foods I have.
---
Ah, ok, that's a bummer, hadn't seen it reported before.
---
I agree with you fully. Like especially when the skin for the fridge is the same unit price as the fridge itself. That really chaps me. Lol so bad. I would've loved more quests for camp plans and such. Some of the coolest camp items I can think of come from specific quests and some aren't all the rng style.
---
Yer  reddead online is much better now played a lot of fallout just ran out of stuff to do
---
I didn't understand the problem, thank you very much for explaining me, obviously I know that not all people has no disconnect no bug sessions.
---
I just didn't know the problem.
---
I feel you, dude. Basically every online game had a problem with cheaters at some point. It was clear that Fallout 76 will have the same issues, but I expected some form of anti-cheat software to be added by now. The fact that it wasn‚Äôt, makes me wander if anyone at Bethesda knows what they are doing. They look like total amateurs and it makes me sad. Basically the best things they added to the game were Player Vending (advertised before release and expected to be in the vanilla game) and a poorly optimized Battle Royale mode, plagued with cheaters.
---
Well you can tell if someone is in a team.  Before you want to engage open the map and click on their name and see if you can invite them to a team.  If you cant they are in one already.  So just check before hand.
---
They're not invalidated, server problems are server problems, even if it doesn't happens to me or you.
---
I only open fallout 76 todo the challenges and sometimes I may even have a good time getting distracted and getting other things done.
---
Pardon me? I don't understand you.
---
A few k caps at best
---
I remember one day playing 6 hours, nothing bad happened.
---
Was he damaging your camp?
---
The servers appear to be more stable recently. I don‚Äôt know if it is related to the massive player drop or Bethesda actually making some improvements. And while disconnects are not as frequent as before, new bugs keep popping up every day.
---
From a Level 30 perspective:
---
Depends on your build. Melee could be unarmed, one handed, or two handed for weapons. Then there are variations like bloodied or high health. You can pick a build and then search for the best weapons for that build or (I guess) find a good weapon and then change your build to match that weapon. I'm using the first of those two options.
---
For my one handed, high health build I don't keep the unarmed or two handed weapons. I'm looking for effects like Vampire, Furious, Anti Armor, Nocturnal and secondary effects like swing speed and power attack. I'm just buying 2 star weapons this weekend.
---
Hope this helps some.
---
I always been like this since game launched.
---
you can hover over the event and press enter
---
Melee, L146.  
---
I prefer vampire weapons.  Combine those with healing factor mutation.
---
If you run PA, motion assist servos ( plus 2 STR) and optimized bracers (more STR)
---
I us a vampire switchblade.  Drug free, it hits 3x in the same time it takes a sledge to hit once,  this 3 hits do more damage than a singe sledge hit.  Although I thin with the plus 10 pct, thats a wash.
---
For flying things, I do switch to heavies - hard to take down a strategic cargobot with a blade.
---
Your special points affect drops. Charisma and luck
---
Ty
---
&gt;  I shot him sneaking with an instingating dragon using VATS and somehow I only deal 70 damage to him( even tho it should be 300 something x2.5 ),
---
PvP damage is capped now, right?
---
Maybe they focus on Wastelenders right now
---
&gt; The only thing your level determines is the level of the dropped weapon. You shouldn't ever get a weapon of a higher level than you own. 
---
Loot level is based on the level of the enemy dropping it, not your level.
---
Nice! Can you a screenshot from the map with a nice dot or circle to show the location?
---
Maybe wanted players should be bumped from teams... Or the whole team should go wanted...
---
Yup!
---
&gt; My concern is that Bethesda will give us option B alone and will be sold through their service.
---
That is what they promised from the start.
---
The server side of FO76 runs on AWS (Amazon).
---
Hey that's great! 
---
Good on you for not letting social convention prevent you from having relations with infirm senior citizens!
---
I think I‚Äôve gone through there a few times. Always end up battening a Scorchbeast, but usually some good loot and a legendary or two.
---
Trick or treat mofo
---
I'd much prefer people see just my awesome power armor and assume I'm badass, over a girl in power armor who they assume is just a pretender.
---
I keep my little water pump unlocked for thirsty wastelanders and I don't care if someone helps themselves to my crops, but they better not touch my junk!
---
if theres a cap , its enough to one shot people tho. Only cavalier or sentinel armor can save your ass
---
that would be a solution
---
If we are going that logic then games shouldn't cost 60 bucks they should be 120 dollars for the standard you all forget that living human beings work at Bethesda who need the job to pay for bills and food for there family and consider technology for games have you stop buying there games you get people fired and company shut down and when it gets shutdown y'all gonna be like "wow Bethesda fired people there so stupid for doing that" and y'all are the reason they get fired so don't forget you stop buying you get people fired without noticed so go ahead and stop buying watch what happens to family's just like how (can't think of the company that made tales of the boderlands) got shutdown
---
Yeah i read that too.
---
"We‚Äôd really love that but right now we can‚Äôt. Sony is not as helpful as everyone would like.‚Äù
---
Well now they are so get to it chaps!
---
Tse gauss is more powerful only drawback in vats where gauss is still not good at. Railway is a beast in automatic vats, the only one good in normal way is the instigating to put out the best of ur damage. The tesla non automatic ia just lame imo there is too much difference in terms of damage, i prefer a charged one for a rifleman
---
Sure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJt_i2_vsSw&amp;list=LLNy0sFeghkUn9fK-wgDo9sA&amp;index=39&amp;t=0s
---
That should not be happening Bethesda patch it that unless u were in a fight with someone they couldnt damage your base. You weren't wanted were u
---
Oops sorry that's right I'm level 236 everything is usually if 50
---
Bloodied melee all the way. Get unyielding armor and bloodied melee weapons. Perks for surviving= Serendipity, dodgy, lone wanderer. 
---
Most people are hesistant about going bloodied, but its quite rewarding. In my opinion a melee build that isnt bloodied is a waste, the unyielding armor with radicool perk gives you 40+ strength. You'll kill everything in one hit, except for tanky bosses. When you fight the queen you will be the only one putting in work, while all the others are hitting for 100 per shot, you could be doing 4k plus per swing.
---
I'm on XB1 and have plenty - shoot me a msg next time I'm on and I'll give you a set üëçüèΩ
---
There is an useless arena just aside of The Top of the World that could realy work for a PvP arena or also a good place to have your robot companions fight in wastelanders.
---
PvP's complain that you can't one-shot any more: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5v4ww/yup_the_new_damage_limit_broke_snipers_and_pvp/
---
Workarounds: use a shotgun, use an automatic weapon.
---
I have some friends that played FO76 exclusively for PvP. They bought a ton of repair kits because shooting other players was all they did. They quit the day after survival was removed though, so that revenue is gone anyway.
---
I know another person that pretty much does nothing but silos and queens. I think his favorite atom shop item was the scrap kits so he can just send his junk to stash at the end of a silo, get underweight, then head straight to v9.
---
People do use them, but I have a hard time believing either are the most popular shop item considering just how many I've played with that never buy a single one of them but buy plenty of camp decorations and paints.
---
Not in nuclear winter it doesn't. 
---
You are thinking of adventure mode. Nuclear winter Special stats mean nothing and all characters have a standard 60 ap. Jumps do not take AP. You can only run about 20 feet before being out of breath, and a power attack takes 38 ap with melee weapons. 
---
This is the second time I had to correct basic Nuclear Winter differences on here. This is why a Nuclear Winter subreddit is kinda needed.  Too many people comment on Nuclear Winter having no clue.
---
I dont think this applies yet. I agree with you except they haven't given us a full properly working product yet. So they can take all that initial purchase money we gave them for the game, and if they need a little more cash to "pay the devs" they can go to the bank. Some people act like bathesda is a new indie company. These clowns can afford to finance one frikkin dlc. And if wastelanders comes out amazing, then they can start honestly asking for money for further development. 
---
Main story quests, still broke. Weekly challenges, still broke. Compass quest markers, still broke. Server stability, still ridiculously unstable. Content past level 50, still non-existent. The fridge works as advertised though. And the robot. And how about $56 for 4 PA skins.
---
I didn't really entirely steal that candybar at the store, Johnny told me to do it!
---
It's police gear that was outfitted and re-purposed to be used by the rangers.
---
So realistically we should be able to find it in police armies and the like.
---
Junkies
---
Enjoy your monocle.
---
I think you met an extremely hardcore role player.
---
They have to be a random encounter spawn. That means they have to spawn alone in one of the many random encounter locations across Appalachia. The best place to farm is the length of highway south from Abbey's Bunker all the way to the Red Rocket Rest Stop. There are at least 5 random encounter spawns down it and it seems to have the highest chance of spawning decently high level creatures. You also have to be twice the level of the creature in order to tame it and have the perks equipped or else they won't spawn.
---
Goddammit
---
Boy, you sure preemptively pwned that nonexistent group! (Trust me, you sound great.)
---
Morgantown Airport has a ton of first aid and doctor's bags you can go through. Healing Salve is easy to get materials for and to make. Another decent healing item is blood packs. You can find these all over the place but they can be crafted with just tick blood and antiseptic.
---
Either that or hold off the fridge, scrapbot, and some other utilities for a paid DLC like wasteland workshop in Fallout4
---
I got damn lucky and was able to tame a Legendary Deathclaw. Since my CAMP is in The Forest, Rex can handle anything that comes our way, and if he gets stuck in a wall he'll be able to get a free heal if I don't get home quick enough. Now I just gotta be careful he doesn't get that death-on-spawn glitch that I have no control over whatsoever like my Megasloth Jerry had before they removed Megasloths from the list of tameables.
---
Thanks. Aren't Incisor and Executioner mostly for pvp? I was thinking of 3 ranks each of Gladiator, Expert Gladiator, Master Gladiator, Martial Artist, and Barbarian for Strength perks.
---
Sure I'll gibe it a try just a second
---
Please keep promises.
---
I basically stopped playing NW aftert the first headshot from the infinite, like 2/3 weeks after release.
---
This is precisely the reason spectating competitive games have a game delay. Straight up by large in the gaming communities this is considered cheating or at the very least unethical. 
---
But this is fallout 76 so... whatever i guess. Can't really have a competitive scene on a barely held together with duck tape mess.
---
Yes, one with a big disk on it to choose a number and a corded mic/speaker device so I can talk to people over vast distances. Its a novelty in long distance comunication ..
---
Don't wait for it, not gonna happen, make an alt.
---
The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different utility items.
---
Helmets never gonna have real damage mitigation to not force the player to put a helmet on (until they make a simple check box to see/not see the helmet in the outfit).
---
They can make a fucking amazing crafting system just putting legendaries mods.

I guess we shouldn't give a flying fuck about new players learning the ropes before Wastelanders, because OP here wants to shut down the servers lol. Not everyone is level 3-digit, and some who are still enjoy the game. You can't control your F76 compulsiveness to play even though you are bored of it, is that it? We'll fuck everyone else. Get a grip.
---
Bethesa being Bethesda. You need to "collect", not buy.
---
RNG is RNG.
---
 Uh, do you mean the¬†*blood*¬†dome?
---
Or none since all the Queens from a time to now are empty for me.
---
Of course local servers would bring people back, including myself. But whats the point of servers running under Bethesdas supervision. They will suck all the fun out like they did in the base game.
---
Hahaha yeah it's God mode üòÇ
---
You're right, I should've added "if we're lucky"
---
Just A. So sad I play just for the nice view when it have so much potential.
---
Am I the only one who has little to no problem with the games performance? When I first got the game during E3 2019 my game would crash maybe once every 2 hours but lately I can play the entire day without experiencing a single crash or bug.
---
I'm on time werner (spectrum) 400mbps, wired in on my xbox1 and I have experienced plenty of crashed in the past. Althouht I still get those disconnections, it don't happen nearly as much now.
---
You need to understand that they get payed wages that a fixed unless sometimes bonus cheque‚Äôs this won‚Äôt make a difference for the employee only the investors and the ceos top heads of Bethesda
---
Sorry but I think xp should be rewarded solely on your own merits and accomplishments. Not riding on the coat tails of others. That's not even being mean. That is the pinnacle of fair. Not to mention people just staying afk in games till the end en masse will DRAMATICALLY effect lobby times.
---
There's many reasons this is a bad idea. It's not constructive to personal development. Facilitates ego and entitlement. And finally would hurt match making. 
---
Xp should be personal achievement. All about actions YOU take. Emphasis on survival, wins, items looted, items shared with teammates would be a cool way to award xp, and kills. It's only fair you get xp for what YOU did.
---
I added a link not the best image I guess. My first time linking an image. Hopefully you can make it out.ill try again if not
---
Correct. I have an instigating combat knife, instigating machete and instigating meat hook. Absolutely devastating. I bust out the furious stuff only on queens.
---
You said it's time we do something ... what exactly can "we" do about it?
---
The most important issue here is do you think the Earth is flat?
---
I‚Äôd love to do this but the main thing holding me back is gonna be the lack of carry weight without my power armor. Any tips for this??
---
Exploring other people's CAMPs and finding great deals on legendaries.
---
I don't like how much sense you're making.
---
Get a bigger family.
---
It‚Äôs not just PC, PS4 is having it as well. Seen a player getting shot by 2 50.cals on both sides of then and didn‚Äôt take any damage will getting filled with lead. Then one shot each of the guys with 50‚Äôs and dropped them! We‚Äôve seen other examples as well. If you hack and cheat, how fun is it really. Pisses me off that their game play is so weak they have to do that crap.
---
Imagine newbie come out of the vault. Everyone wave and suddenly scattered off. It will leave the newbie wonder what happened?
---
Ok and? You stop buying people get fired every time a game company does a huge Lay's off people get upset and Treat it like a tragedy and people get mad at the game company even tho it's the people fault for not buying the stuff and on top of that the CEO etc. Aren't the ones who add the utilities everyone always forget that the people working are usually the one who tries to get things added like utility's the CEOs already got there money when you bought the game the people working on it currently are trying to keep there job and by you not buying future products you're just gonna get people fired the CEOs want more money even tho they don't need it if the company gets shut down oh well they don't care bc they have money to last until they die but as for the others devs they gotta get a new job so go ahead and ruin those people lives
---
Propably some vendor skins that cost 8 bucks
---
Mosstown can also spawn a crap ton of ticks which is nice for the crafting healing items atom challenges
---
Wouldn't even be surprised if they would do something like that at this point. They did it before without any notice.
---
Worth it if you have the flux and some extra caps saved up. It takes a little while but you can build up a good business and source of caps. Serums are far and away the best selling items in my vending machines.
---
I sell 12 different serums at 300 caps a piece. People often buy in bulk or buy one of each just because of the low price point. The hardest part is keeping stocked on the flux.
---
I was coming here to make the same exact post, been getting nothing but 1\* off the the queens actual body for the past few days. Even the armor for completing the event has been 1\* quite often but the legendary off her body has literally always been 1\* for days. If this keeps up then it's genuinely not worth the ammo I spend on the fight. Will be interesting to see if I start getting 2-3\* again after the sale ends.
---
Like adventure mode 99% of the time?
---
Would also be neat if they buffed the difficulty I.e dmg from enemies is increased but so are the rewards, such as an increased legendary spawn rate. Lot of potential here
---
Oh it happened to me. I haven‚Äôt touched the game in about a year but it was god awful when I played and the vast, vast, vast majority agrees. Not even an opinion. Is it possible someone wasted all of their luck in life to not d/c in a bad game? Sure. Is it possible I‚Äôll walk outside and have a meteorite hit me? Definitely. 
---
So why make the post at all? You have the most measly piece of anecdotal sample size that only includes yourself and in a comment you even said you haven‚Äôt had a disconnect in a year as if it‚Äôs some delusional badge of honor. 
---
If your point is to brag that you don‚Äôt disconnect from fucking Fallout 76, then that‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. If your point is that everyone is lying or exaggerating about the problems with the game then you must be on some really good drugs. If you are just simply stating that you haven‚Äôt had issues, the question is why? No one really cares.
---
For the record, I don‚Äôt like 76. Even if you never d/c‚Äôd and all the bugs were gone, it‚Äôs still a shallow and bare bones sandbox that has been done better by countless other games. I only even saw this abomination because it was on my front page as I was scrolling. I just don‚Äôt fathom the logic.
---
I think that Bethesda should have made it so that at the end of the "clean appalachia", that a permanent change to an area happened.  Would have made it interesting and not basically pointless for day1 supporters....
---
Ooh, how much was he selling it for? üòÇ
---
Natural selection at work
---
Does it have 250 drwr?
---
I'm guessing you have excavator?
---
Unyielding gives you 15 more strength on top of the 15 you should already have, if you make your armor deep pocketed, and get a backpack you would be able to carry way more than with power armor. Most high level people can carry more without power armor, its annoying with my heavy guns character who needs to be in power armor for combat.
---
If you do it right your strength should be at 40, thats 200 more carry weight, which is the same as excavator with calibrated shocks. If you add a backpack and deep pockets thats another 110. My character with the backpack mod can carry 500+ without power armor, and 350 in power armor.
---
It will take you a while to get to that point because you will need 5 pieces of unyielding, radicool perk, and you will need to do pioneer scout challenges to get the backpack.
---
If it is rigged on the server side, no client side datamining would be able to tell it. Otherwise, you'd be able to hack the client and make it drop exactly what you wanted. So far, nobody ever flooded a market with highly sought items but only with relatively slowly duped items.
---
I remember that quest! Definitely very sobering.
---
15 points in strength already puts you at a big carry weight advantage. I use a high capacity backpack when I need it (eg on a junk run). I also use armour pieces with weight reduction perks, some of which I mod with deep pockets. Marsupial. I temporarily swap in weight reduction perk cards like Pack Rat, Thru Hiker and Pharma Farmer if ever need to.I try to manage my weight so I don't need to rely on those cards all the time but sometimes it's necessary.
---
I can't see the third star on that gun but I'd bet it is 250 damage resistance while reloading. That perk breaks the prefix when you reload, making your gun not bloodied anymore.
---
The way to fix it is exactly what you did, equip and unequip it.
---
Good drops are subjective. For example, I've been trying to get Troubleshooter's armor set but since most Youtubers say those are scrip, nobody even sells it ingame. Same is for versus drops. I'd be wanting a Ghoul Slayer's Gatling Gun; guess what, versus is generally considered scrip. I've been stuck rolling at the Purveyor but it only gives me one Gatling Gun every 50 rolls on average.
---
They love fallout 76 because it has a nice rectangular map with clearly defined edges and a handy guide that stops you walking off and falling into the void of space
---
Those are just small, barely-countable, and they never promised it's cosmetic only.  The fans took what they said their own way.
---
So if I were your teammate, and I shot a guy that was about to kill you... saved your life... then I died later but you went on to become Overseer, that‚Äôs solely YOUR accomplishment? Remind me never to join your squad in the real world.
---
"I know Bethesda is a company and trying to make money"
---
"I really do want the game to be successful"
---
"I honestly think maybe Bethesda just didn't think of some of this"
---
**No hate here**, but if you read these 3 quotes to yourself out loud OP, you'll realize that the reason they're not giving us the game that it could be, it's because they just don't want to. Taking ideas from their remaining player base and sell them back to us was not a good move. 
---
On your remaining notes:
---
Repair and scrap kits are useless to this game and should not be in it. They serve no purpose. If you loot plenty enough you'll have more junk than you need and you'll be selling bulks of scrap to vendors in no time. That's currently my primary source of income. Repair kits were introduced basically to be sold at the atom shop. I'm actually GLAD that i don't need repair kits and hopefully it STAYS that way. I see a potential for nerfing loot in order to motivate a purchase for convenience.
---
Fridge is also pointless. The abundance of food in the world is enough to maintain you well fed throughout your playthrough. Just throw some points into Endurance and Luck. Slow Metabolizer, Dromedary and Good With Salt are all you need. Again, if they keep on nerfing perks and make you go thirsty and hungrier faster with each new patch, you'll start to see the Fridge as a convenience.
---
Why would someone get a Collector Bot? Looting has always been a part of Fallout universe. Why do you want a bot doing that for you? I see no point for this. It's in part a survival game. Maintaining your stuff should be a part of it. Why do you need conveniences and utilities to do basic tasks for you? Looting, hunting, cooking, repairing should normal activities rewarded by the game. By selling conveniences they're just out right saying that the most basic elements of the game are boring!
---
Sure, you can have these items placed in the game but at least make them obtainable through quests! Not blocked behind premium currency.
---
All this seems very simple to me. You want players engaged with your game? You need good challenges, incentive and rewards. Currently what's the motivation to be in the game besides collecting atoms to unlock atom shop items? Leveling up ad aeternum? Doing the Possum Badges chores? Killing +1000 bots with a melee weapon? Doing game breaking raids?
---
The last announcement from Bethesda gave us a hint of what we can expect: they're basically interested in monetizing the Atom Shop. Take it as you will. I've been in your shoes, hoping they would progressively make the game better (look at No Man's Sky!), but after 1 year, sadly, i see very little achieved.
---
Yeah will try -- after experiencing this I thought we should be able to dismantle an effect from a legendary we don't want for a small amount of scrips
---
You don't pvp much, do you. That dragon is pretty much useless. 
---
Also, if you wanna go after wanted players, be prepared to die.
---
Atom rewards as I know got smaller over time because this wasn't bringing any money. I doubt they will tweak them back. But they could add a reward for daily login after Wastelanders update to get people to try playing again.
---
Yeah their logic is mindblowing.
---
So you travel in group and grief almost certainly non-pvpers into pvp? At least grow a pair and claim high lvl workshop, solo. You'll have your pvp.
---
I‚Äôve just started playing Red Dead Online again but I‚Äôm off on a 3 week holiday next week, so I‚Äôll be game-less for a bit.
---
When I get back I‚Äôll probably split my time between 76 and RDR.
---
Agreed. The 10+ legendary heavy weapons I got are weighing me down
---
I'm making a list of candidates too
---
That's not how software development works, you don't have updates just sitting around in case another update is late. You release the updates as you finish them.
---
agreed, some arena location would be good
---
in fallout: new vegas there was an underground arena place where you could fight captured monsters
---
I've wanted this for ages. Wasted so much time looking through long grass for corpses
---
If they let us pay that would be the ultimate slap in the face...
---
When I‚Äôm doubt eat a super mutant
---
I dont care if it's P2W, it's not what this is about. It's the CONSTANT lies, and the reasoning behind their decision. They say it's the PLAYERS that demand it, again just more and more lies. It never ends.
---
And more than anything, it's how they have treated their community for years and continue to treat them, with games being released that are still carrying bugs that were fixed several years ago by mod-creators. It's fucking ridiculous.
---
Well, private servers are coming soon. Hopefully this can be made into a reality just the way you want it.
---
I didn't mean you in particular you had alot of other points, people are moaning about that in particular
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve been killed on the AWOL event, making sure I get the loot before it explodes is unreal.
---
I'd be nice if they do fix it but do you honestly thing we'll see anything being done with NW BR between now and Wastelanders?
---
Who knows, they could surprise us but there articles of late seem to suggest otherwise.
---
I mean yeah sure. But in the end it's an advantage over others, especially in the PvP mode.
---
An advantage is an advantage... doesn't matter how you put it. Now I personally think it's redundant but yeah, if people feel that way... well I can't blame them.
---
to be honest I'd be down for a wow/wowtoken kind of payment at this point my man if every single piece of content would be free, you pay lets say 10 usd every month to play it but monthly membership could also cost 1500 Atoms, which with today's standards can be achieved if you play the game daily for 25-30 days; thus if you play everyday for a month your next month is free (just like wow tokens)
---
A company can lay off people for many reasons we can‚Äôt just accept terrible business practices to save people‚Äôs jobs when we do it gives these mega companies more reason to push the line further into monetization greed it‚Äôs been proven microtransactions  are extremely predatory by nature
---
Bravo, my good man, bravo :)
---
Jesus, why so triggered? Your experience is clearly different from mine; let's keep it that way. This game caters to both 5.56ers and fluxers.
---
To think we've come to saying what should be such a mundanely normal thing to the point of being boring statement about how the game works and it's pretty stable and it's something noteworthy to not only post but also upvote.
---
Sad times but sincerely happy for you OP.
---
Thinking about?! I‚Äôm deffo getting both
---
Isn't this the same comment that essentially started the mtx business with horse armor back in Oblivion ? Yeah it's nothing new
---
I dont think anything changed in these last few months lol
---
theres a patch coming up in 3 days and a new event in 9?
---
Why thank you!
---
I hav been buying them for a few weeks hav got about 6 so far,  I no longer go vendor shopping for that perfect  weapon, as i hav realised I already have them and also no longer have that max caps problem. lol .. life is good
---
Just blow all the cars and trucks before it starts if you know this. Duh!
---
&gt;Repair and scrap kits are useless to this game and should not be in it. They serve no purpose. If you loot plenty enough you'll have more junk than you need and you'll be selling bulks of scrap to vendors in no time. That's currently my primary source of income. Repair kits were introduced basically to be sold at the atom shop. I'm actually GLAD that i don't need repair kits and hopefully it STAYS that way. I see a potential for nerfing loot in order to motivate a purchase for convenience.
---
That's just categorically false on the face of it. Look at all the conditions you throw in. It's like reading the small print of a contract.
---
If you loot plenty? So it's already a benefit for those that don't care to spend the time to look for enough junk.
---
Beyond that, you break your primary weapon during an instanced event like the vault raid, or during an SBQ fight, you either can't continue or you have to spend time away from the fight. Less time killing and looting, means less xp and caps/loot/legendaries.
---
The person that uses repair and scrap kits have an advantage over you in terms of time saved which means more XP/caps/legendaries per unit of time. It's a small advantage that has no real relevance right now but bring in a solid PvP and prestige character/level system and you watch people who exploit that time advantage pass by you.
---
All that time you spent looting that extra junk, going back to base or to a workbench/stash in the field is time yo're not grinding that people that spent money on kits can. It absolutely serves a purpose with a clear (if modest) advantage.
---
spike in purchases is a community feedback. actions usually speak louder than words.
---
I sent in a ticket with the hole story, and they restored my 700 atoms and let me keep the item as a gift üòÅüëç
---
well its arguably better but you have those who still shitpost on every update however for me personally, 
---
i play on ps4 i crash very little 
---
some days i have 1 or two server disconnects but most of the time i dont have any at all
---
since the last update i have a lot of lag but i heard that a big friends list is the cause wich im trying to clear out for that purpose
---
as for gamebreaking bugs and such you can read about them every here and there but i havent encountered any myself
---
the game is a lot of fun for me and i would even call it a great game
---
but its up to personal preference
---
if you didnt line the gameplay at launch you wont like the game today
---
if you are fine with exploring, looting, grinding and slowly building your character than its fun
---
So why make it do anything that impacts game play at all if it is so insignificant? Why was it worth breaking their promise for 25% of what a free item can do?
---
This guy freaking nailed it!
---
That's what I'm doing, or at least waiting for settlers.
---
I mean I *want* to play the game...  it's just that there's really nothing to do.  I have zero interest in P2P when I have games like Battlefield 1 to shoot other people in.  And once you complete the main quest line, all the other bits and pieces like Halloween activities feel pointless.
---
I've taken down the Scorchbeast Queen enough times to be on first-name basis with her.
---
Coming to Atom shop soon scrip limit instant reset ticket only for 1k atoms.
---
It's really that short?  Did they say why?
---
Slightly weird, because i don't know what he was thinking. Was at Morgantown Station teamed with a friend(I-lvl 80,friend-lvl 40). Ran into this really low level guy at the vendor. We waited till he was finished, waved to him and, like good Responders we were, proceeded to drop some stuff for him. He whips out a pipe pistol and begins plinking away at us, and coming up to melee. We say "WTF?" but basically ignored him. We went to go and he kept following us doing the same thing. Right up until suddenly he went too far, and got a Wanted Level. He jumps into a Power Armour CHASSIS! Just the chassis, no plates, and comes over acting tough. Enough is enough. My friend jumps into his full 35lvl Excavator PA, and brings out the .50 cal. I climb into my 50lvl T60 with targeting HUD and jetpack and blow the dust off a 3* Resolute Veteran gatling. The guy takes one look, soils his frame, and sprints into the rail yard to lose us. We got him after he tried to dodge around a box car and was too busy concentrating on seeing my friend follow him around the same corner to notice me as i jetted onto the roof from the opposite side and nailed him from above. We ended up shaking our heads for the rest of our session about why he was doing that, especially since we were trying to help him in the first place.
---
Lol. You even deleted your reply.
---
"No need to continue crying of spilt milk". Or, you can learn to think before you speak instead.
---
And "I never said anything about Doxxing" you didn't, I did. Because by Doxxing you can get information about an individuals location or network which would allow you to DDoS them, causing network instability on their part and thus what one would call "network manipulation" or some call a lag switch.
---
That's gonna stay expensive for a long, long time.
---
I won't be purchasing a single thing from bethesda ever again. They traded in my loyalty and faith in them for a handful of dollars and I won't be giving them a chance to do it again.
---
U need escorts. R u on PC or?
---
Check this moron's post history. This clown doesn't even play the game! Bet he watched some Yongyea's youtube video and came here to farm karma or something
---
Duh, I‚Äôm not no rookie. I get too excited at the possibility of a 3 star and just rush in. And a lot of times the countdown has almost ended so need to start it ASAP.
---
It now has cars and luigi.
---
There's this new raid but it's next to impossible because lag
---
Ohh that disease one is doable tho. did some google search and finally got it done
---
Bit confused what you're complaining about here. I play it solo all the time. 
---
By playing solo do you mean on a private server just for yourself? Is that the price they're charging -- $12.99 a month? Didn't realize they'd announced that.
---
Happy cake day! (In camel from Geico commercial voice)
---
cant seem to get lung sludge to account for
---
I would like 5000 atoms
---
And ponies!
---
Really? never had that problem with my character. Well that sucks
---
Let's hope so, Dogmeat was my main dog going as far back as Fallout 3
---
That'll show me. You should go spend a couple hundred dollars on the atom shop too, that will really teach me a lesson.
---
yes! Pink ones!
---
I accidentally bought the flamer skin on the menu, sent them a ticket and they haven‚Äôt even replied, tell me your secrets
---
The fact that Im very picky when it comes to video games and FO76 is the only thing that even remotely peaks my interest.
---
What conditions????? Loot plenty??? Hell yes it's part of the game, isn't it??
---
Loot has always been a part of Fallout (specially in Fallout 4 and 76), and you're dismissing it in favor of convenience.
---
You're also out right dismissing strategy in favor of convenience. Your gun breaks during a raid? Too bad! It's part of the game. During FNV it happened a lot and no one complained about it. Take good care of your stuff. Plan ahead. But no. You want rEpAiR kITs that allow you to bypass strategy. You basically want to kill and loot legendaries and you wonder why the game updates turned out so poor.
---
"Small advantage" is an advantage nonetheless.
---
"All that time you spent looting that extra junk, going back to base or to a workbench/stash in the field", you say this as they're inconveniences. No, they're not. It's preparing for exploration, quests, raids and events. It's building a strategy before you go out. It's doing maintenance to your weapons, armor and CAMP. All this is a huge chunk of what this game is about. 
---
If you're happy with a basic looter shooter than yes, buy all the "time savers" they put in front of you. But then you should ask why did they even bother with adding so many scrap, repairs and building mechanics if they were to be bypassed with convenience items.
---
Lol ya i had a simular experiance a few days ago on xb1.. i had went to my camp in toxic valley near the train station.. heard a super mutant somewere around my camp. After checking all 3 floors i didnt see anything. So went back down to foundation level were i seen a super mutant's head popping out of my foundation in the center of the floor. It kept moving its head around. So just laughed then ended its low lvl suffering with a head shot from my 3* combat rifle.
---
Great idea.
---
3 if you want the backpack.
---
More if you want backpack mods.
---
What resolution are you trying to play at?
---
Same as yours,  keep karma farming kid
---
All and all a good idea, +1
---
This is the exact thing all the people "whining" about p2w were concerned would happen.
---
Unfortunately, speaking with your wallet doesn't work when everyone else buys the fridge and scraptron :(
---
This was somewhat implied a months ago, but they never delivered. Surprise. Also prestige levels but hey, we can wait for 3 years.
---
Im using a full set of troubleshooter armour (nothing special) and a vampires mini gun wich makes it easy to solo the event. And it's harder to finish if people show up because it's getting chaotic.
---
Thanks mate.
---
Cheers.
---
The writing on her is just trying way too hard. It reminds me of Jared Leto's Joker. Just like tone it down for God's sake!
---
No. I sell the grape mentats for 25 caps in my vendor üòÑ 
---
I always forget to equip the perk anyway. I'd rather sell to other players. They are buying, so obviously need the items. It's more fun that way!
---
I personaly stick to Pve on FO76  but im PVP on ESO.. time and place matters and PVP dont belong on any Fallout game.
---
I think you can't get "part 2" of each series from trades/buying.  
---
If you find it spawned, you receive part 1 and 2
---
I mean thats the thing isnt it, people hate buying gameplay mechanics, but most dont mind paying for a skin or two they like.
---
Personally i think the skin prices are way too high to spend real money on it, but if others are happy with it, i dont care as long as i can still get them from playing a while.
---
I will 100% drop this game if they start selling real gameplay mechanics like it sounds.
---
Awesome sauce!
---
Not gonna lie, re mods giving ability to pause an online game with server side control..... if a BGS dev reads it they are going to be LOL WTF and SMH, and probably side convos like ‚Äúhey, check this shit out‚Äù. 
---
Lmao
---
Agreed. This event really points out how screwed up the system is. Especially with the fact that they left effects in the legendary loot table like bashing damage guns, nocturnal anything, and limb damage melee. Also the fact that you now get those more often than desirable effects is just a slap in the face. 
---
This purveyor sale has made me want to uninstall, it's like bethesda purposely took the fun out of the game
---
I‚Äôm sitting on reddit writing angry posts and arguing with people lulz ;) jokes
---
Yeah, sucks.  I gave up on doing the daily challenges most of the time once I remembered they are optional and stupid.
---
You all keep asking for new things it will just make wastelanders delay even longer.
---
depends on your preferences
---
you can get max damage with a bloodied build but you will run around with 20% healt
---
do you want to have a lot of damage but full health go junkies
---
do you want to be in/out of power armor
---
do you want to play pve/pvp?
---
Same
---
Great, thanks for the tip!
---
I guess it's hard for me to imagine people actually buying junk items. My game is a daily struggle between my stash limit and my bulk items. Sometimes I have to stop playing a character for 3 days or I'll just keep looting myself into 1000 lbs overencumbrance.
---
Hah! True, I suppose. She is supposed to be fairly young, around 20-24.
---
The fuzz is about them salami'ing their way through their promise. The collectron is an obvious sign of their true intentions. That's why.
---
Assuming the corpse hasn't gone into orbit you can use the ProSnap camera to look for them. Anything in the viewfinder should be listed onscreen.
---
**To the OP:** This latest pile of message from Bethesda was also the last drop for me. I have finally been cured. And I'm a little less dumb when it comes to "pre-ordering"...anything!
---
"Your hands are obviously covered in blood by now and there's no hiding it".
---
That statement seems a bit extreme. Has anyone died? Is Bethesda murdering people and hiding the bodies? Committing human rights violations?
---
If your upset about the Atom shop, Bethesda's previous vs current statements, fine. But try to keep your reaction proportional to what's happening. 
---
I think a lot of this is stemming from Beth saying, "players aren't playing the game how we expected them to". They probably had a  loose roadmap, ideas and direction to take the game. Then players came along and changed everything. Now they are pivoting to giving the playerbase what it wants. That's apparently scrap &amp; repair kits. I don't know why, I find neither useful. Nothing's happened yet. Except them saying the things that were most popular in the Atom shop. 
---
If you like the game at least be happy they are continuing development and support for the game and you can continue playing.
---
1920x1080 is my usual go to

Perks r in strength

1920 x1080 is my usual go to
---
FYI, workshops are a terrible way to get lead.
---
Probably will finish the titanfall2 story and maybe get back into rdr2 story or give online another shot. Also some elite dangerous with my friends
---
She's ok. I wish there were more men. FO4 had some great male characters, even Paladin Danse despite how that turned out. Strong men are really missing in 76 and it's kind of a bummer.
---
Idk if the forest started a new legendary event. But i was in flatwoods this morning killing cows for there meat when i got a random event down were we got to kill all thoes robots. But this event had to do with a 3* mole rat. I killed it witch ended the event in under 3 seconds but it gave me a 2* axe witch ill end up tossing in the mechine for scrip.
---
We gonna get The Outer Worlds in 5 days, so I can live without Wastelanders for at least 3 more months...
---
I'm sorry but I Can't tell you....
---
First rule says we dont talk about it
---
I already preordered OW. Waiting for reviews on CoDMW before committing.
---
Agrees tottaly i weigh over 3k atm. Stash is full and scrip mechine hasent reset yet.its bull being forced to wait.
---
Agreed 100%
---
Maybe dupe trading? I don't know. Do scorchbeast come in legendary? Only time I see more than one person at a place is SBQ or Encrypted. Get up there! See what's going on.
---
Scorch beast queen
---
I'd rather not do bloodied,I don't like my health being down,but I don't know how to set up most of these builds with what perks i need on,I do have all the heavy damage and adrenaline on but I'm at most pushing around 150 damage in the gat, and around 65 on my ultracite gat
---
These are the settings I use. [https://imgur.com/DQ1LwlL](https://imgur.com/DQ1LwlL) That gives me 1440p 60hz 99 percent of the time, on a system very similar to yours.
---
Or care
---
Gasp! Not, go outside!
---
THE HORROR! Outside is where people are!
---
It‚Äôs a private server. You are also paying for the ability to mod at some point.
---
There was a nuke
---
Bethesda will listen and put an extra stash in the Atomic Shop for just 1000 Atoms. /s
---
Oh cheers man! Thank you so much, also 1 little thing, had a incident where game kept CTD when i got near the top of the world building it kept happening for like hours until i manage to fast travel before it crashed again. is that a software issue or hardware issue you reckon?
---
There really not as useful as you think they are.
---
I haven't seen it either,I was looking for it for a while and finally said it was starting but it never showed on the map and nothing was on the location
---
Doesn't Fortnite and similar games have an option to pay some pennies and instantly get to max level to unlock all the cosmetics in the battle royale? I'd be totally down for such a system here for players who don't want to actually play the BR..
---
You are trolling, go away and comment on something YOU like and leave the rest of us to play Fallout 76.
---
You are a LOL :/
---
I have run it 3 times the last 2 days on PCa without issue even got a badge.
---
that is where it shows people on the map when they are loading into the world
---
Yeah, with new content being pushed back by months and the new public event system a mess, I really think they should consider removing gameplay limiters.
---
well the good thing about junkies is you dont need any specific build to make it work you just get your 5 addictions and get hands on junkies weapons :D
---
Another 'look at me' post.
---
this would help so much, or atleast if they get a marker like from a recon scope or something
---
also everyone should start only putting one shot into then and calling other ppl over, just one shot then emote
---
I don't know, but I would blame Bethesda before I blame my hardware.
---
Lol fair enough, thanks again for the help man :)
---
I like it all apart from your closing comment.
---
We don't need any DLC waves. All content should be added via free updates as it was originally advertised.
---
You got to get the 7600 hour challenge to 100% the game.
---
I didnt do anything out of the ordinary, bought it by mistake, asked reddit for help, then i sent in a ticket with all details and a picture of the underarmor in the shop then a few hours later they had fixed it and let me keep it for free üòÅ
---
Wow, almost bought this today. Thanks for the heads-up.
---
My guess is the next free week is going to come when Wastelanders drops.
---
Double XP could come around Christmas, or Thanksgiving. Unlikely it'll come any sooner since we already had two recently really near to each other.
---
Right well I guess I‚Äôll send another ticket then
---
Gladiator dlc yeahhhh boi
---
I think if you have equipped it they may not refund it
---
Nothing and we'll like it?
---
My pleasure :-)
---
They may have turned to the dark side and became money grubbing d-bags but they still make my 2 favorite franchises. 
---
No other games excite me to play like Fallout and Elder Scrolls.
---
On top of that they have a space franchise coming! Thats like a dream come true for me.
---
I will continue to support BGS because nobody makes games on the same level as these guys in my opinion.
---
 anyone who actualy plays FO76 can tell you. 1. You can keep your food longer then the fridge via good with salt perk. 2. You can quickly collect way more scrap exploring then that collectron can do in a full day. 3. Repair kits can be gotten free from the SBQ. So i really dont see any Pay2Win in the game.
---
The game saves where enemies die, and produces the goo/meat/scrap pile where were killed. As long as you think you know where they died, you could leave and come back and they should produce the pile. I use plasma a lot which makes things much easier.
---
Works with Imposter Sheepsquatch
---
But the glow _should_ persist, that's a good idea.
---
You got me in the first half not gonna lie
---
I'd pay it. I think 40% of the player base would get it just from saving up atoms.  Shared stash is where its at though. Low capacity, say 200lb but shared between your 5 Characters
---
You had to think really hard about that response huh. No one wants to love this game more than me, but after about a year of commitment I've been given more promises than content. Still waiting on a lot of content "coming soon." And when they did release something it was limited in scale, and almost always broke the game so it wasn't worth it. Something just feels weird and off when I play now. Maybe I just hate fps games. Maybe I'm finally going blind. Maybe the game is a blurry, buggy mess even after a year.
---
100% yes. And it would be great if they didn't vanish once killed. This happens around 1/5 times for me
---
I try and do that but I do get disconnected a lot.
---
This^
---
The only worry about that I have is they said it was around 40 hours of gameplay.  I like to explore every inch so I'm sure it will be a much longer play through for me but still doesn't seem like a whole lot of game.
---
a pat in the back.
---
I would like an arena where u use nothing but revolutionary swords and black powder pistol in this arena as well
---
Wait till it happens to one of those who down-voted :)
---
And you know it WILL happen! They think I got nothing better to do than come here and make false statements? Kinda sad.
---
This. And use the luck perk that gives a chance to find more
---
I had a quick check of my emails and it turns out their reply was in my junk folder for some reason, I‚Äôve submitted tickets before and the reply‚Äôs have never gone into junk mail. My atoms have been returned :D
---
I am an idiot ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
At least wait until next update to keep posting this lol
---
Not triggered, I just know I'm right in this instance.
---
I run a troubleshooter and I'm able to kill a 91 deathclaw in two shots as well... A bloodied should kill the thing from three cells away.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what i meant but not like all of them that‚Äôs available 
---
Like +1 Strength or just the SPECIALS as mods
---
Yeah but later I initiated a launch on New Gad and found out it‚Äôs an exceptionally good spot to farm for flux. Plus you have the occasional set of ghouls roaming the area who have become glowing ones
---
Putting aside whether one finds the change acceptable, it is not exactly surprising after [this ITV article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019) from April, and knowing that all the items announced back then that have been implemented are sold on the atom shop. Repair kits added in April, scrap kits in July, refrigerators in September. The rest seemed only a matter of time. I guess it was planned to gradually introduce these utility items until the original launch date of Wastelanders in November.
---
every time
---
I just play something else. As much as i love fo76 it has become quite stale recently. I took my time with the main story and still find nothing much worthwhile to do. Its just sell stuff, refill vendor, find legendaries and then...? Other than roaming the map looking for skeletons in odd positions, i find it hard to stay interested for more than an hour or so. 
---
Ita still an awewsome game, but has lost some of its magic in recent months
---
This would be cool
---
Next Friday OW releases! I'm really hoping it's good. I'm waiting for reviews on CoDMW before committing.
---
So basically a recalibration station like in the Division.
---
Bear arms
---
Yeah I think that would be ace! 
---
As there‚Äôs loads of legendary weapons I‚Äôve got that have a few good specs on them but the weapon isn‚Äôt as good 
---
I think there should be a station where you scrap it and have the chance to unlock a mod or stat and apply to another legendary weapon but it will replace one existing one
---
You must have picked up the one the sheepsquach uses
---
Lol, your ideas are comepletely worthless. Stop trying to take any credit.
---
Ive seen the ones with the horns like the sheepsquatch...and this one is just regular..idk
---
Next update buy food in the atomic shop XD
---
I've got 900+ scrip I'm delaying turning in because that's my that character done for a couple of weeks (turning stuff back in each day).
---
If it would cost scrip then it might be balanced. Putting a modification on a three star should cost two-three times the amount of scrip you would get by scripping it. Being able to build your own weapon, tailored to your build should be far late game though.
---
Don't worry! You can rent a server and kick anyone who does this soon! Why fix the game when they can charge players to handle their own QoL?
---
So that's where the damn stuff has gone.
---
Tried using one but they're a pain to aim
---
Beth doesn‚Äôt care how long you play each day. The only important thing is that you log in each day and hopefully visit the Atomic shop. 
---
It was the entire plan behind the 50% off scheme. 
---
They launch a fake contest (we would have gotten the half off reward even if we didn‚Äôt kill one scorched) to keep us logging in each day. They know once we ‚Äúwin‚Äù the sale, everyone will blow their whole wad in one visit and become over encumbered, forcing us to log in each day till we can rid ourselves of the weight. 
---
Then they‚Äôll come up with some new bullshit event next week and we‚Äôll fall for it all over again
---
Yeah I think that‚Äôs fair like you have to be level 50 to even attempt to do so and yeah it should cost like 75-100 scrip to do so.
---
Here's a hint. They're mostly not looking at the community to see what is good for us, they're looking at our reaction figuring out why their numbers are the way they are.
---
Nope I recently got them the other day, just keep searching &amp; don‚Äôt give up!! c:
---
Contrary to the Advice of Many, your primary Stats are Str and Int. Intelligence gives u the Stabilized perk, that ignores most of your targets defenses. It also gives you power user, and batteries included for when you get the best weapon in the game, this being the Prime Ultracite Gatling Laser. Its so economic, you can go full queen fights without wasting more than 2 fusion cores, so long as you have power user equiped. For reference my build is the following:
---
1. STR 15
---
2. PER 3
---
3. END 6
---
4. CHAR 4
---
5. INT 11
---
6. AGI 9
---
7. LUCK 8
---
This specific build allows me to use all STR based weapons with relative easy, because going around witylh just heavy all the time, is costly on ammo, and somewhat boring. So when im just walking around collecting resources I go melee/shotgun. On high end events I go into my power armor and go heavy weapon.
---
Running off this idea and one below that said/suggested a "mob" ...it WOULD be very immersive if they were to do a Walking Dead kind of thing where Watoga, for example, was absolutely packed with ghouls and scorched. Think about it. If they nukes killed half the population and mutated the other half ...or even if the bombs killed 90% of the world that still be 900,000,000 "people" .
---
Ok, for accuracy I googled it and West Virginia has 1.806¬†million people (2018) even with 95% dead, that is STILL 90,300 people left alive on the surface, not in bunkers, ready to be mutated!
---
I wish Wastlanders will add few ex-scorched turned into shocked gouls who will tell things lile that. I mean, you can inoculate people, but without the Queen, maybe the outsiders dwellers can partially cure the virus.
---
Maybe a lot of the "free from the queen" scorched could turn into feral ghouls, because they were civilians/mad people and had no cause to fight for. And some ex BOS/Enclave Agents/Responders/Free States/Raiders could just be lost in their mind but not hostile, since some were fighting for the people/trying to not harm others while humans.
---
I also have a quad and dropped it to the mule stash thinking it was trash. Doeas it mean i have to use it? It could be fun for queen fights....
---
I'm so pissed at myself for not thinking of this on my own.
---
My friend the other day had no idea this occurred and wondered across 300+ in a bag and he got so hyped thinking he hit a good mineüòÇ bless him.. I had to put him down gently!
---
There's a quicker way than grinding scout quests, there's plans for a backpack in the airport at morgantown, you have to find some key cards off dead responders, but it's in a chest upstairs
---
I agree.  Collectron and the fridge could've been quests.  Or, you know, we can science together a complex nuclear device all Tony Stark like, but basic refrigeration is a science kin to the gods, unlesa we atom it lol. I AM glad we have one finally, but...
---
And this is one of the many reasons why I ignore every single person in the game.  I keep pacified on and am never bothered.
---
 Not like I could communicate with them anyway seeing there's no text chat.
---
The wanted system is awful, could be really fun and would be great in open pvp but with the handshake system a wanted player is 100%, 100% of the time.
---
Could probably be removed from adventure, and at the very least everyone on the same team should be flagged as wanted.
---
More variety.  more factions! Tattoos that don't suck worse than a hull breach on the wrong side of an event horizon!
---
Yeah, I get maybe 2 or 3 hours every couple of nights to the point 76 is currently the only game I'm playing.  I dont have time for the pioneer scouts, I got the small one at the airport
---
Yeah bow you‚Äôve said it I can see what you mean and I‚Äôm level 127 and my other character is 49 and i feel the game is a little easy now lol
---
I can never find people willing to do project paradise when I do manage to get on
---
None of them, fellow member.  Use your skills as a mistress (or master) of mysteries to get to the hidden truth. Its what she would've wanted.
---
I was perusing people's vending machines yesterday and one dude was selling a whole bunch of 3-star weapons for 333 caps each. Needless to say I bought all of them and now I can only operate in excavator armor while taking advantage of the extra hundred pound glitch. :-(
---
Maybe buy three copies of Starfield and think of me while entering your credit card information. I'll be thinking of you while I'm not playing it &lt;3
---
Same with ash piles, yet those aren't as noticeable. This is a problem you should be taking to Bethesda, not me.
---
Sometimes only takes a jog around the block
---
&gt;Yes, thats rediculous. How can one be so stupid. The same as saying we don't give a fuck about being extorted for money.
---
+karma
---
I feel your pain im on my 10th deathclaw sprinkles the 10th
---
I've had that happen a couple times. It sucked
---
I found hundreds of them littered around the Purveryor's train station. When I loaded in, I saw them spewing out of the ground like some sort of nuke mine geyser. There were other players there too and were probably the ones duping the mines. I picked up as many as I could carry and sold them to the vendor not in Harper's Ferry.
---
Hope he doesn't get flagged and banned in the next ban wave.
---
Wonderful idea, my stash is creaking with scrip junk.
---
I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt, he‚Äôs a newbie acc with barely anything, the few hundred mines he found are the best thing he‚Äôs ever come across, I don‚Äôt think his acc is getting flagged anytime soon üòÇ
---
He must have been chuffed, good for him :)
---
You always drop some garbage item first, wait for the bag to appear, and _then_ transfer your other items to the bag.
---
I think they match it to real time because the last promo for wastelanders said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a year since you left the vault‚Äù.
---
Naked in Whitespring no perk build, punch a robot :D
---
Been some bug fixes, but lots of known bugs are unfixed, there is about like 3-5 hours of new content on a couple quests they added, then a battle royal mode that is just hackers paradise. It‚Äôs overall pretty identical to the game it was a week after launch
---
Private servers are already confirmed as a paid service. Whether Bethesda follows suit with other games and lets a host pay and invite other players for free or charges everyone a monthly fee for simply accessing private servers is still up in the air.
---
Very nice roll, was my first bloodied weapon too. Respecced my build to utilise it and haven‚Äôt looked back.
---
Should still be free tbh, but aight
---
Isn't there a mod for that on the nexus?
---
look at your pipboy
---
the date doesnt change "lorewise" we are still at reclamation day
---
also 5 minutes a day and 5 minutes a night seems very fast i can play for more than an hour on the same server before it becomes night time as far as i can tell
---
 Yaoguai stun lock is murder, three of them is all about timing and hiding if not bloodied ranged.
---
Ha
---
The only drawback to this weapon is the horrendous time it takes to reload, so it's not very good against big mobs of enemies. If it was like the Fallout 4 assaultron head, it would reload as fast as you can push the button. It will take down a super mutant behemoth in one shot though.
---
Private servers have never been free. Cost $ to maintain.
---
And what are these private servers offering over the servers besides no other players? They could have easily just made private lobbies a thing, it's not like it's that hard to make, especially considering most other multiplayer games have them

---
No atom shop raider one. I tried another and it was also not working.
---
The Chainsaw is a day one weapon. Check Mountainside bed and breakfast and ranger station
---
What I'm wondering is that if the atoms we earned from challenges are equal to the same atoms we buy with money, then does Bethesda make actual money off free atom challenges? It sounds comparable to mining Bitcoin. Making money that we ourselves cant convert to real money, but Bethesda can
---
Was someone wearing Strangler Heart Power Armor?
---
With my answer and and comment thread, you should be able to figure that out
---
I‚Äôve found only public events seem to count...
---
Since our helmets can't have armor value, at least our eyewear such as gas masks and glasses (and maybe few other face covering masks) should have corpse recognition like in that Fallout 4 mod. Corpses glow few moments, and other cool ones, enemies glow red, allies glow blue, 25% more vats accuracy and recon censors. Why, just why Bethesda can't fucking listen their fanbase?! Or at least play their own game even one minute. And maybe take a look at most popular Fallout 4 mods
---
Woah no way!!! When will you be on? Thanks so much btw
---
Messenger doesn‚Äôt
---
I will continue to give them money for sure. That wont stop. But it won't be in the atom shop at least until they add a significant amount of items i want. Hair,  tattoos, outfits, paints... these things are like so scarce. I should have an abundance of options I feel and since I dont i dont worry about the atom shop until i bag about 1000 or 900 to play with. Lol and even then it's like not enough for a PA skin. Which tbh I'm not a big PA guy so it doesn't hurt my feelings, but i do like the armor styles of the game and my favorite mods for FO4 were the reskins and new paint colors. Also on that note, an option to toggle armor visability would be cool. Even if it's a toggle on an applicable outfit. I mean there are some outfits that provide leg armor or arm armor. Greaser jacket and Jean's has leg armor standard so they could use a similar system to determine clipping issues and not allow visability for the legs or chest ect. While being able to see the arms and legs or whatever inversely.  I mean. Thatd just be neat. Not seriously important. But there are a few things like that I feel could really broaden the options for char. customization and doesn't really affect anything but polygons. Idk. Lol
---
I post about making it at least craftable..... on the plus side, i have found and scraped so many that i can craft both of the blade mods.
---
Mine still works, what‚Äôs going on as of late?
---
I use it with the sack hood and miners' uniform
---
It's strange, isn't it?
---
The game knows where nuclear blasts are, because it won't let you fast travel into or out of them.  And yet, they can't be bothered to do a simple check on respawn, "Hey, is the respawn point inside a nuclear blast?"
---
Same thing with CAMPs near water.  Isn't it great to catch a disease waiting for the world to load because the game decided to spawn you in the water?  Again, no one bothers to check the spawn location.
---
Not sure if it is still the same in Fallout 76, but if I recall correctly, previous BGS games have a time scale of 20. That means one day of game time is 72 minutes of real time, and 20 years of game time would have passed by the anniversary of the launch.
---
We will have to discuss your comment at the next meeting :/
---
Awesome idea!
---
*Gasps horrified* You broke the third rule!
---
They are gonna be coming for you now!
---
With the delay of wastlanders this is the only end game content. SO LETS MAKE THE SCRIP LIMIT REALLY LOW SO PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO GRIND THE ONLY END GAME CONTENT
---
But I am the 'they' I'll just take myself to one side and have a quiet talking too O.o
---
I was at white springs station, the game started lagging and there was hundreds of mines everywhere
---
I dunno. Silly straw's and iced tea is a good combo...
---
PC, sorry. Have put it in vendor, cba to start a whole new build right now :)
---
Nuclear Winter was/is a failure too.
---
But they won‚Äôt admit it.
---
True, will have a look actually.. will report back shortly :)
---
Have fun!
---
Omg, I know right? I was going a little mad thinking I was doing something wrong, but you just confirmed it's happened to others as well. It sucks \*\*\* and on another note, I was online all day waiting for the Swarm of Suitors event to pop and didn't see it once! I am missing out on so many simple challenges! Boooo!!
---
To be honest, any fully repaired weapon with plenty of ammo would do. You must choose stealth over firepower. Like, my easiest Time doing that mission (8 times already) was my unarmed shadowed ultralight sneaky ninja. And His weapons were throwing knives and an instigating boxing Glove. 
---
My commando carried His regular fixer and a TSE Assault rifle fully modded, but didn't use the second one.
---
Maybe something else that doesn't directly mess with the legendary system could work, like more types of shielded underarmor plans? Or underarmor that gives 1* select legendary effects (something not too OP).
---
Honestly I don't get this argument. How is it any different than the backpack? Except you know, being immediately available for those who don't want to waste time on the tedious challenges? The backpack challenges were a pain to complete and some even force you to take perks you may not want. Atoms are not different than tadpole badges, you don't want to pay, go earn atoms with challenges. I like to have the options to play the game as a post apocalyptic world survivor a d not a freaking cub scout.
---
That said, I'm currently trying to finish all the tadpole and possum badges.
---
Following
---
Will check them out thanks üôè
---
...something hot
---
...something steamy
---
A literal foot.  I think it was a scorched.
---
I cri. I miss a pc
---
I have The Fixer, so maybe that‚Äôs a better route to go. I like stealth over firepower whenever I can make that choice! Thanks very much!!
---
We run entire maps, even solo.
---
Props on your response to that douche-bag! It's like it is some peoples mission to go out in the world and make it an ugly place, I'm happy he made himself look like a fool!
---
I dont like it either, but if bethesda wont fix it what can you do?
---
It will be, on their own time. It will be years before this is the game they sold us on. Eso is impressive now, but look how long it took. They're just repeating the process but with even less effort this time. They know people will just white knight them and whales will spend their entire social security checks on the cosmetic store. They have absolutely no reason to change from a business standpoint. I dont blame the dev's at all, I blame share holders and consumers who auto buy everything.
---
You make sense. 72 minutes feels like it.
---
Why do you have a raider tag? Go rob somebody. I haven't grinded for supplies in weeks.
---
Sometimes we just start fighting with each other at that point.
---
Also, food builds restock me.
---
My gunslinger carried one for a while. I would Vats with a 10mm until filling the bar, then switch to the assaultrons head and unload the 20 shots as a sure critical hit. Really effective, really tedious.
---
I did this event aswell and it completely broke  my game. The final legendary was inside the truck when i killed it, the explosion killed me before i could grab the item then the truck closed and my game got stuck in the death screen
---
Did you know if you spam the sprint and reload button over an over, it'll reload the 20 shots at least twice as fast?
---
I might have to hire someone for the backpack I guess. lol
---
Once you swing for 300-500, everything except bosses seems to die. I nerfed my unarmed ninja because I was too strong and quality of life perks are nice.
---
That actually pays off? I've seen some bloodied heavy weapons on vendors lately, but I dunno. Low health+Heavy looks like bad luck.
---
üòÇ But you might just win you the legendary of your dreams! Good luck at the Purveyor.
---
Fallowyourvalues you seem to be missing the huge picture. After the bombs dropped everyone was at eachothers throats. So no matter the faction you choose in your eyes its pvp. And as for raders they were scroungers before the bombs dropped and werent alwase killing one another. You just choose to see one side of it.
---
Yeah, you have to find them in the wild. Same reason why it thinks I only have 1/5 Unstoppables and 3/10 Backwoodsmen despite having the full sets of both in my magazine rack.
---
Wow. At a first glance, it looked like something bad, but it really looks like a random encounter from Fallout 1-2. Gave me a dejavu.
---
In my earlier days I met four guys who proudly showed me the fully tricked out "Fighting Arena" (on PC) up in the North west quad so you are not alone in your thinking! They had bleachers for the spectators, prize boxes even a very serious set up to randomly assign prizes for the winners.
---
It was slow, it was either main quest or make your own adventure(which is hard for me).
---
Buy a used copy. On sale.
---
Exactly
---
Not really in the interview I read. I was really hoping that it's like fallout 4 where it's 27 hours for main story but 80 hours of side content. I doubt that though.
---
That'll be $20. You're welcome.
---
No, sell it people pay good caps for that.
---
Now that‚Äôs bad luck.
---
Remember to type the name in recent and not in friends...i made that mistake
---
Thanks.  So far since the sale has started I have bought 86 pieces of 3-star armor. A couple okay pieces but for the most part I'll be scripting 82 or 83 of them.
---
Here's the thing though... If the private servers are going to be moddable, and they are running on their servers then they can't just let people load mods to their server, that would be an insane security risk.

You can download mods for the game right now, but they are only cosmetic changes that only the user can see or some UI modifications. Making changes to the game world or adding new things to the game like weapons, CAMP items, NPCs or the like I don't think we will be able to do on our systems. Especially since servers aren't just private, you can invite other people to your server.
---
So I think the most likely option is that we will see only curated mods on private servers. Only ones that Bethesda has vetted as not going to harm their servers. Probably a list of mods that you can chose to play with. 
---
At least, that seems the most likely to me, but I could be wrong.
---
Fat chance of that
---
Dont watch yt before going in there yes the scorch beast will fly but instead of wasteing ammo wait for it to land. I did it and was able to kill it with just a super sledge.
---
Once 2FA is implemented, we'll cross it off.
---
Would be really useful for ones that jump back to their spawn location.
---
Shoot one of the mines :p
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Honestly, and I may be wrong; I don't believe I've ever seen them. I think these are one of those weapons you have to find already modded, from enclave events, or maybe very rarely from MODUS already modded. 
---
Like I said, I could be wrong, but that's my experience, as best as I can remember.
---
My star find has been an anti-armour handmade, but other than that I've had a lot of hulking great heavy weapons to cart around, which is more of a punishment than a prize!
---
Np.
---
According to the workshop bench, there's literally only *one* mod for the Enclave Plasma Gun, which is a Prime Capacitor (only from plans). You can rarely get one already modded from I don't even know where, but you can't learn anything else beyond the Prime Capacitor. 
---
It's kinda like the Heavy Concrete mod for the Super Sledge
---
My stash is currently almost full because of the cheap legendary weapons. I changed all of their names to #scrip to find them easily. I guess I wil stop collecting worthless legendary weapons/armor for a while.
---
Oh okay, I thought I might have been wrong with seeing them say it and could have been another game. Hopefully it'll be coming soon.
---
Hahahaha. 
---
You bought a game. The base game. What makes you entitled to future content all free?
---
Explain to me how that was part of your purchase agreement?
---
Welcome to fallout. These games are all about exploring.
---
LMAO!!!!!
---
I did the grafton event 5 times yesterday and got a recipe for pumkin pie was like umm kinda early for that. And b4 anyone asks witch event.. its the protesters event.
---
There's a backpack plan in the Overseers box in Morgantown airport. Only adds 30lbs but helps. It's the only backpack I'll ever have! I don't know where along the quest line it appears.
---
I hope there is no going back and forth either. Vendors will be filled with bobbleheads, ballistic fiber, everything really. Then those who have 4 "bank alts" will just charge 100k caps for a decent weapon.
---
Nope. Never again.
---
My days of supporting Bethesda are over.
---
Not to mention the SBQ event, Encryptid, challenges that involve other players, etc. I know people are begging for private servers, but I'm fairly certain that all they're going to do is charge us for the ability to limit who enters the server. They aren't going to give us more character slots to have for them. They aren't going to allow us to do anything that might cause them a PR backlash, as anything that MIGHT be perceived as unfair would be. It's all just. Silly. It's just going to be another cash grab, and a disappointing one at that. Anyone who expects it to be a fully customizable server is in for disappointment.
---
That's my opinion anyway. Source: the current state of Bethesda's affairs, and this game.
---
I will admit the tutorial is rather slow, Flatwoods to Morgantown. I think it picks up after that especially if you start the mistress of mystery‚Äôs quest. But honestly the best part of this game in my opinion is the exploration
---
Weird, I've gotten multiple copies just by picking them up. Maybe something change since I last picked one up.
---
You're a bigger idiot than I expected. I guess that's expected of people who don't know how to wait for reviews and splurge their cash for disappointment and want others to do the same to share their "pain".
---
Just two copies and afterwards I'll forget you even existed.
---
It's insane that this exploit is still in the game. I would have thought that they would hotfix it by now.
---
I meant from scrapping
---
Yeah its not something id use regularly. Its a novelty
---
Personaly with the delay of our expantion we should stop asking for anything period. Instead of us being forced to wait till 2022 for wastelanders to drop.
---
I don't  think it will be that fancy like restarting your server. I think like survival mode it will be a choice at log in. Choose private and no one else will be on it, but it's still persistent. 
---
Hopefully they won't allow back and forth from private to public. The back and forth from adventure to survival wasn't good. Survival might have made it if not for that. All Beth is doing is spreading the cheating across all modes they make.
---
Hmm, the DMG doesnt seemt to change as my HP goes down.. am I missing something?
---
Drop a few perk cards then u will have a challenge.
---
&gt;There's a backpack plan in the Overseers box in Morgantown airport.
---
i know.. thats why i said Standard backpack
---
A good way is to learn to craft a mutation serum, then sell them to vendors, since they are worth a ton.  You can also just buy them from players and resell to vendors.  Depending on how high your charisma is, that can be a very high profit / low effort way to make some cash.
---
First, we have to make it where:
---
1) they all sparkle and
---
2) the don‚Äôt disappear and respawn frozen.
---
Had three low levels (lower than 20) try to attack me while I was at my camp. I just nonchalantly went about my business picking crops, making alcohol, making them a patch of lemonade which I left out for them, and also some pie.
---
For me its the scorched queen, sludge lung and grognak mags are all checked off but still says 9/10
---
I always try to butt-smash, then put my back to them and gun-fu headshot the mobs around after emoting. sometimes I feel like an ass clearing the room of adds in uranium, because when I was lower level I was trying to level and get all the guns for caps. but sometimes there's a lot of mmmmrghmrrrrs shooting me in the face.
---
I havent had any good armor rolls so still in mostly 1-3 star mix mach crap but going for a mutation build.
---
It's fallout.... Online.
---
This can be very helpful when trying to find the (sometimes) invisible Imposter Sheepsquatch corpse.
---
No. Lode baring has always been that way. If you dont get out you die and lose your bag, it's the result of you not leaving. Next time dont take a bag of junk with you down there, or leave when you're suppose to.
---
Just file for the refund now to get your atoms back and also keep the paint for free as a bonus.
---
AFAIK, you cannot get any mods for it except the prime receiver, modus sells them kitted out randomly pretty much, and whatever he sells, thats what you get. I got about 5 different ones, some with automatic, some with single, short barrel, some with pistol grip, some with rifle grip, etc.
---
As long as you‚Äôve learned the plan then you have a chance of getting one from the Purveyor. However, it‚Äôs all RNG. I‚Äôve run through thousands of scrip on two toons and only gotten one.
---
You can't apply it to armor anymore
---
Yes, I gave a plan to my alt, who has never done encryptid and she got an amazing assassin bash damage fixer from mama.   The loot table is just large/rng so it could take a while to get one.
---
Yeah my bloodied build can do the same. This thing was doinv that damage right out of the box, on a character not designed for it. Just thought it was cool
---
No, he didn't leave the mine when he should have. That's a scripted death, not a death by a creature or player, and would still result in the loss of junk, as a punishment for not listening to the AMPLE WARNINGS given to leave the mine before the cave in.
---
Wasn't aware another one of those was back.
---
They give you almost 2 full minutes to vacate. I was caught one time because I didn't leave as soon as the message popped up, but never again. It's OPs own fault. I'm all about calling out BGS when they drop the ball, but that's not he case this time.
---
Your "logic" is skewed. _Everything_ the player does is designed for future convenience. You start with a crappy weapon, but you look for something better. Why? So you live longer and can progress further, earning better gear as you go.
---
And what about camps? Surely you have your own camp, and it's equipped with work benches, right? But why, when you could just drag yourself to the nearest community work bench located 10-15 minutes away, instead? And don't _ever_ even think of fast-traveling to your camp either, as that's a convenience you don't believe we need, right? The very idea of the camp is to further convenience.
---
What level is your character, may I ask? I only do so because you sound like you're quite new, otherwise you'd understand that _everything_ is geared towards convenience. Scrap kits are more convenient, as has been previously discussed, because you no longer have the back-and-forth travel required to return to your camp.
---
_Everything_ you work toward in the game is for convenience. _Everything_ you work toward in real life is for convenience. Think about it. If you take pleasure in the struggle, then understand that we've already experienced it. But we don't have to live it every minute thereafter, not to have  appreciated it.
---
Bug fixes I hope.
---
vanguard sentinal armor and imo heavy weapons work perfectly
---
How much is it in your vendor for? I'd love to buy it! Also on PC
---
My god, spend more time looking for bodies that blew up then killing the enemies.
---
15k caps :) ign is the same as here
---
Ah, What 3rd star should i get for the armor? A full set of Vanguard's Sentinel? What heavy weapon and what 2nd and 3rd star for said weapon? What addictions should i get to which chems?
---
So by comparison to OPs suggestion, I have about 4 builds I'm working with, each with a set of ideal weapons
---
I've dropped 1300 scrip since this sale and basically gotten squat. Not so much as a 2\* upgrade. And I anticipate continuing to get squat through Friday. 
---
Make it costly, I don't care. Make it take a full 1000 scrip to transfer a single legendary effect. But leaving my end game progression up to a random system full to the brim with useless junk is as likely to burn people out as it is to keep them around. 
---
I understand people's hesitation to make this easier, especially if they've spent hundreds of hours hoarding and trading. But for everyone else, you don't have to make it quick, or easy, to make it less dumb. Leaving end game gear up to the winds of chance in an olympic pool full of wrenches and useless armor ain't fun or rewarding. We can do better.
---
It's actually 45 seconds, but you should always be paying attention to the time. I've died to it once, simply because I wasnt paying attention. And I died for my mistake.
---
I‚Äôd love a belt fed supersledge. Honestly let‚Äôs give all the weapons belt mods.
---
That was my main point. The death is entirely avoidable if you don't "stand in the fire"
---
Well all i can say is the day bethesda gets rid of dupers and stops them from having the abbility to do it in the game. Will be the day that there parrent company Zinamax gets rid of the Bot hackers on ESO.
---
Just something. Anything to show us.
---
well to be fair getting a full set of vanguard sentinal armor is already very hard to obtain 
---
powered is always good but you wont be needing a certain effect other than van/sent
---
for weapons JFFR or JE go really well and something like reduced weight or faster reload are very good
---
as for addictions i think i run mentats/daddyo/overdrive/fury/buffout. but its not optimized
---
there are lists online that show wich debuffs come woth wich addiction
---
try to choose those that debuff charisma,luck,intelligence/perception as you wont be needing these stats
---
5addictions are enough after that the effect doesnt stack anymore
---
well it was only the second time I'd done it, and the first time was with a large group so I had no probs getting out... this time I got team tackled by 4 or 5 mole miners who held me up from the door just that one second too long... 
---
I get it, its lost and it is cos I didnt get out.... I just didnt think that even if I failed, with it being a public event that failed INSIDE the venue Id lose it all :)
---
Nuke mines are actually super easy to craft, so are the numa grenades. I always use them over the others. There was never really a big market for then anyway, I don't understand why people are so keen to dupe them.
---
Man I really hope that's sarcasm lol
---
I'd be a little pissed if they changed that, since the end of lode baring wouldnt mean anything because  you of no consequence for dying
---
I so want this, hopefully its somewhat affordable or they just let us have some way of having solo or maybe invite only type servers where we can actually use mods or tweak settings (with fresh characters obv, shouldnt be able to just max out a char and then ruin the online game with it)
---
yes now that you said it i think i heard of that 20 scale so i was a bit of
---
anyways 5-10 minutes are definitely too low
---
I hear ya. Very annoying
---
Or just remove the damned scrip limit. It's incredibly arbitrary, and puts a minuscule cap on the endgame.
---
Lmao...just yanking your chain buddy
---
Update: day moved to Monday instead of Tuesday, same time and locations
---
Thanks for the clarification, it's hard to read sarcasm on a text based platform after all
---
wasnt two minutes mate... I had about 45 seconds, I was on my own and in the deepest part oif the pit..and gettng group tackled by bands of Mole Miners on the way out... . ( again,.. lack of familiarity with it having only done it once before, in a group.,..... )... Im not whining about dying cos i took 46 seconds to NOT get out,... Im complaining abvout the fact that A) it was a public event that I assumed wouldn;'t cause a lootbag drop if I died and B), as the mine closed after it finished I could not return to pick up my loot again anyway.... makling the drop even harder to bear... ( at least if I die after a SBQ event, the bag is on the ground with a cursor to "reclaim dropped loot" miscellaneous quest.)... and y9ou can generally get it back unless someone else picks it up.... . not this one though...The Mine was closed again.... no entry.
---
..stay woke!
---
I feel like they almost never hotfix they always wait til a tuesday if they address anything at all
---
 It's kinda ridiculous. Anyone know how many people work on 76 at a time?
---
Meat Week #3, and #4, #5, etc.
---
ample warnnings??? Dunno bout your system but I was getting a Responders audio message about the stupid church at Hornwright and its bells spouted at me as I was trying to get out...
---
Apparently it fixes it if you fast travel to an event and then back to the player
---
Lol always
---
So would this be like a more social Dayz then with quests? Dayz you walk around survive kill stuff and try to find better equipment to we‚Äôll survive longer and kill more stuff?
---
But everything I read says not to expect a fallout online
---
I like your style
---
No, they've repeatedly said it'll be free (like all updates), even as recently as the last ITV.
---
I‚Äôd still avoid it, for a fear of wasting precious ammo
---
As usual the problem is people are letting their imaginations run wild because Bethesda sucks at communication.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be the most tame thing you can imagine.  Just various customization switches, that don‚Äôt impact the game and allow you to take a character freely between the modes.  I sure as hell don‚Äôt want my character ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù to where I can‚Äôt play adventure mode with anyone else, just because I clicked the wrong box.
---
For me personally, I‚Äôd rent a custom server if I could make the whole map spawn max level, control the weather, and the daylight cycle (especially if I could make darkness dark as hell like that fallout 4 mod).  Small tweaks to make the game more interesting.
---
I've got a full set of Vanguard's Sentinel with one piece being chameleon sentinel. All 3 star but not all powered. Any specific armor types? Like Combat, Marine or Scout? Are addictions permanent? Do you also have recommendations for PvP? I'll go for JFFR because i despise the explosion sound effect and such. I'll be looking at the LMG if i go heavy.
---
Not really. This game is just far more linear than any installment before it. You have to stop in each area and actually do all the side quests and events to gain levels and equipment before moving forward.
---
scripted death is fine... in any other circumstance.  the point Im obviously badly making IS... I felt misled into a false sense of security that at a PUBLIC EVENT I wouldnt lose my junk if I died.  NOT the nature of my death... I could have stood there and naded myself.... I was INSIDE the venue at the time I died ( albeit right at the end), .. NOT after it finished... by some scorched or ghoul.. the EVENT killed me ( cos I was still inside... I accept the death!)... I am disappointed my junk and the time invested in collecting it is gone due to lack of clarity in the "rules", so to speak
---
For me, if I already have a game in my inventory and I pick up a new one, it will still only show one. If I drop the game and then pick up the new one and the old one, I'll have both. This might be the case for you as well.
---
My question is who would willingly roleplay as a flat earther with psychoses? I've never come across anyone that would do that, being that the flat earth community is one of the biggest running jokes for the last 5 years
---
Or get sucked in until I‚Äôm filled with utter disappointment like destiny and anthem? Lol
---
For the yao guai, take the enforcer perk for shotguns that let's you cripple, and take out one of their legs. They'll just sit down and you can headshot them to death. I leveled with a shotgun build just for this reason. Deathclaws? Sit tf down. Yao Guai? Sit tf down. Sheepsquatch? SIT TF DOWN.
---
Pick them up and sell them, they go for like seven or eight caps each.
---
If you already have the game in your inventory, you won't get another. So you need to drop the holotape before you pick the magazine up,  then pick up your dropped one and you have 2.
---
I'd say PAYDAY! CHA CHING!
---
Junkies 50 cal is strong without being OP. The joy of a junkie build is when you do get interesting junkie 3 star legendaries you can play around without a massive change to your perks.
---
Juts get a jE or jffr heavy weapon and a suit if power armor
---
Got a quad ffr gamma from the vendor yesterday. Glad to hear my instinct to keep it was right.
---
I mean. It's still on you. No one misled you. The event told you to leave, and you didn't. If you die to a nuke dropping to pop Scorched Earth event, you would still lose your junk.
---
Yup, that same group that never goes into monster mash to farm legendaries and cries when actual pvp takes place, and that same group that never came into survival begging not to be killed. You're right, I pulled it all right out of my ass.
---
Your name could not possibly fit the content of your post any better.
---
Garrentees most of us end game players are over weight i turned my daily crap in got more junk and will be at the pervayer till i loose over 3,000lbs so i can move more then 5 ft a min in pa.
---
&gt;All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, **all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free.** That's important. **And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff.** To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60," Hines said. "That you know, **when they put out new content or features or whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free.** That feels right.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\-Pete Hines
---
Edit: If you're gonna use that last line, at least tell the truth.
---
I get that once the SBQ is dead, the rewards given and the graphic pops up the event is over... so yeah.. fair game for a ghoul or whatever to kill me, and my junk drops... Im fine with that... there is always a way back to get that dropped junk.. ( unless someone picks it up)....
---
This time, the event itself killed me, cos I got into difficulty and didnt get out in time.. when I expected to keep my junk if I died during the event.  even up to the last second. :)  There was nothing killing me, but the event wasnt over, it was itself shutting down, if that makes sense...
---
only bulk to sell
---
There is that arena up near top of the world. It seems like a perfect spot to have some sort of tournament event.
---
If you say so...
---
Or just a Pooty Tang belt. You can just feed the belt to your enemies. Watataya.
---
Yeah. They need to remove that trap option to Disarm. It made sense back in the PvP days of early game, but not now that it‚Äôs just decorative. 
---
Plus bones are pretty much useless otherwise, so stop making us waste our useless bone junk.
---
You have to ignore your family and start banging strangers for drugs to get the full bonus.
---
Kinda, although more story focused and less punishing than dayz, in 76 there is no real pvp between players and you will keep everything, your guns, armour, meds‚Äô when you die (except your junk)
---
But yeah the game is basically survive quest loot kill, whilst searching for upgrades to your gear and rare stuff!
---
Ive seen a few but its trash no one will buy em.
---
Oh crap here we go with this again.....you guys still butt hurt about a robot that is next to worthless and fridge that is totally worthless.
---
I can pickup more random scrap in any random house in one minute compared to the robot.
---
The fridge only holds 15 items...
---
You act like Beth created something so vital to the game that if you don‚Äôt buy your whole game experience just goes down the toilet.
---
I wish they would charge for the expansion to really watch you entitled kids lose your minds.
---
If the earth is flat then why are all the other planets round?
---
That's what it felt like to me lol. Played with two of my friends non stop at launch, feels like fallout, but online.
---
There is a spread sheet with all the indigo somewhere out there. If I remember correctly there are only 2 things that actually save weight and I believe one is lead.
---
Every time I see kill a megasloth in the mire... fine that's 25 - 30 minutes hopping then.
---
Probably quicker to launch a nuke at the queen and just wait for the ones that spawn there. I don't know if it counts if you only tag it and don't get the final hit l.
---
I‚Äôm currently doing the same my suggestion if your currently leveling a new character is to wait until around level 40 before getting addicted as at lower levels you will need your special stat boosts
---
well for armor types you want to go combat armor or marine id say as you want to get as much dr/er as possible 
---
as for pvp well im not that advanced but sentinel doesnt work while crouched so as soon as the fight started you should not crouch anymore
---
the JFFR lmg melts through enemies but you will lack in tange a little
---
for this purpose i have a JE minigun to keep enemies at range
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if they were marked as ‚Äúx‚Äôs‚Äù on the hub like red dead?
---
The hard part is not hoarding... I usually only keep about 5 bulk of all common scrap. Thr rest i sell 65-85% under npc prices. 
---
Cloth, lead, copper, aluminum, steel, spring, fert, and acid all sell extremely well.
---
Yup same here. I‚Äôve gone thru 1500 at this sale and haven‚Äôt gotten one!!!
---
Think the event just hates you. I just did that event a hr ago. Poor low lvls didnt get squat. Only me and one other high lvl shot the end boss. Both of us packing 3* guns with exploding bullets..
---
Thanks I'll give that a try next time I find one
---
If they really wanted our money they would release a decent Fallout game. With these recent mtx this game is now dead to me.
---
The other is aluminum
---
The timer on screen
---
Plot twist : It‚Äôs Bethesda running all the cheat sites and selling items out of game to make more money.
---
Because there are no other planets..you're be8ng lied to by nasa dumb ass..
---
I never noticed they sparkled in the first place ... but yes glowing corpses _of all kinds_, please!  Very frustrating when you lose a body in the underbrush.
---
Have no idea how much labor they throw at this game, but it's either very few people or a great many uneducated people. They used to hotfix dupe methods within a couple days; the YTers that would tell everyone about the exploits would wait until close of business on Friday, because BGS wouldn't fix it until Monday.
---
I have an instigating, which combined with pistol perks, concentrated fire on the head, a crit shot, and sneaking is a pretty fun weapon.
---
The Quad is my holy grail though.
---
You might get 100 caps in your vendor, it's a cool display item as it looks different but other than that it's a bad weapon.
---
It's got 2 or 3 legendary effects. Assassins and weightless. But they're hidden, which is a shame cos it could be worth at least some scrip!
---
I've been in that exact situation. I didn't leave when I should have, and lost my bag as a result. That was MY fault. Not the games.
---
Do lots of drugs
---
Tuesday.
---
Yes it is, thank you.
---
Next weeks inside the vault most likely
---
It‚Äôs RNG I got three out of my 1000 scrip on the first night of discount.
---
It was months in before I saw them glowing and sparkling and I thought I‚Äôd seen something new. After that, as soon as I see some glowing green in a pack of enemies I will head for that enemy straight away.
---
Np
---
Same, but I just name mine $ so they're at the top
---
Thx.
---
they call us ungrateful when the things we DO buy don't even work right
---
It's worth switching to a junkies build just for that.  Heavy junkies just shred everything.
---
As others have said - you only save weight by bulking lead and aluminum. The other main purpose of bulking is to manage your inventory easier, in a way. Typically, you can bulk up to about 5 stacks, and sell anything over that threshold. (Maybe 10 stacks, if you want to be conservative.) If you need plastic for bulking purposes, there is a ton of it in Watoga High School's cafeteria. 
---
Also - Make sure you check out your junk section from time to time, even if you're bulking as much as you can. Several items, like gold, black titanium, ultracite, etc., you only need around 50 to 100 of, depending on your build. The rest can be sold for caps or to free up the weight in your stash.
---
Ballistic fiber and screws are the only ones that sell for me and those are the ones I charge more than the vendors will give me
---
Could be that the character swaps but the character has another inventory in each private server.
---
Nope x-01. Strangler heart is ugly and a pain to get ill stick with my x-01
---
What console? I probably should have mentioned I am on pc
---
Same reason everybody and their mother has their vendors loaded with steel at 1 cap each lately. Not fun when you are hopping to junk vendors looking for flux. The steel I can just simply not buy and have it not effect me. I can keep playing the game the way I play.
---
The mines are far more annoying because....well there they are in your face. I guess the lack of a fix just shows how deeply immersed they are in things they are currently working on.
---
I‚Äôve never really done that event, what‚Äôs the rewards like from it?
---
Im xb1
---
Up until this weeks freezing issue. iv only seen it once since the new event system. Oddly enough i have not seen uranium fever since camp fire tales started appearing more
---
Think they said Private servers would come on Thursday, so Inside the Vault would be a bit to late :)
---
Patch notes the day they go live
---
Naylor. From the event u can get plans and diffrent mods and lots of purified water. Ever so often a legendary pops in but the big plus is lots of super mutions.
---
this subreddit is *not* the community. Every single game subreddit think they are the majority. There are 206K subscribers here, somehow i don't think that's the majority.
---
Oh that‚Äôs no issue for. I got the perk points for it! :)
---
I thought that was the standard one. I know there are others but I can't get them. Just trying to be helpful.
---
I never met nasa I have a telescope.
---
Hahaha. That hit me so hard. Right now I switch between a f76 re-visit and a red dead online re-visit back and forth. Hmm, maybe I should also return to gta online once in a while.
---
Lead is lighter bulked, even lighter when it's turned into ammunition.
---
That‚Äôs exact expression lol. We can‚Äôt like this game.
---
Yeah thanks for downvoting me without reason lol
---
This wouldn‚Äôt shock me the slightest.
---
Oh I'll try that, thanks!
---
True that lol, all Betheadas open worlds ive been a hoarder lol...cant bring myself not to. But in 76 people always need stuff to fix their stuff so i put the hoarding to good use. My offer still stands if you ever need help tho, same psn as here. Happy travels!
---
The last 4 times I have run through it feels like the spawns have been nerfed beyond belief. It was underwhelming to say the least. My first two times through the story this was one of the most difficult parts and now it just seems like I walk right through it.
---
Look for a private server that would fit you better once they get established.
---
haha, must be tested, lol
---
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Where can I find details on this, for.... research
---
Nice one, might start giving it a go!
---

It‚Äôs on sale for $23 on psn, can‚Äôt really go wrong there.
---
Its the firmament you are looking at ffs nothing gets out nothing gets in not even light. Everything is in the dome.
---
This did happen to you in a videogame, right?  Like you're not confusing this with something that happened outside the grocery store?  Because you're acting like it did.
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs scrappable either.
---
I hope you can switch back and forth AS LONG AS U DIDNT ACTIVATE ANY MOD. So similar to Fallout 4 or Skyrim se where it deactivated achievements once a mod is activated. 
---
That‚Äôs the only way you could play alone or in coop when you wish, but you still can play Queen event etc.
---
Funnily enough i had switched off for a couple of months myself, i had got to the end game but its disconnecting me so much i didn't have the heart to go after the nukes. Two nights ago i switched back on after playing dying light and i died a little inside. I can no longer turn right on ps4 without major lag, left is cool but right..nah, so i was wondering around kind of just mooching and realised someone had broke into my home and become wanted..well here we are i thought some fun, some interaction..i fast travelled to my camp and chased him out of there, then pursued him into grafton both of us taking pot shots at each other, he hangs a left then a right and comes up on the old church, he stops and turns to face me..
---
Well i thought, looks like we have us an old fashioned shoot out, i switch to my lever arm rifle took aim...disconnected from server..
---
Unless cloaked right?
---
Yep!
---
No idea I don't really enjoy the BR genre but what I do like is Samurai related stuff so Sheppy wants that helmet. Just gets under my skin how badly tiered some of the rewards are I used an example earlier where someone who prefers Romans has to grind less for the centurion one 30 levels or so less. That's the part that irks me.
---
Maybe if i *also* tag them.  
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek  
---
I know they probably arent allowed to reply to things like this since its probably well above their pay grade, but maybe they can get some of the higher ups to either allow them to reply or we can here from the todd man himself
---
Thank you very much!
---
I understand that you can't learn any of the mods but I can't seem to find any solid information on getting the mods to attach them.  I haven't seen MODUS sell any mods but I've seen people say you can find the mods very rarely out in the world.  I'm not sure I've ever found any.  I can't find a definitive answer anywhere.
---
"when you die, can i have your bone's ?"   lol
---
Do you still have it now? I'll take it for that, but need to combine caps from two characters - I can give you 5k from the first and then buy it for 10k on the 2nd. I'm available all day.
---
Technically there is no consequence, cos the event award came up, giving me random "gifts" lol , AND I got to keep the tokens I'd collected... just my junk bag was gone :)
---
&gt;But, either there's diminishing returns or not, right?
---
Not exactly. There's a hard cutoff at around base damage = 6.5x armor, or equivalently, 0.99 x base damage = final damage. Otherwise armor penetration has the same percentage effect on damage, regardless of enemy armor or how much other armor penetration you're stacking it with. Examples:
---
100 base damage vs 100 DR =&gt; 50 hp damage
---
100 base damage vs 50 DR =&gt; 64.4 hp damage = 1.288 \* 50
---
100 base damage vs 25 DR =&gt; 82.9 hp damage = 1.288 \* 64.4
---
100 base damage vs 12.5 DR =&gt; 99 hp damage != 1.288 \* 82.9
---
I can't find any solid info on whether you can get the mods.  I was lead to believe that you can buy them but I'm not so sure that's the case as I've yet to see them in stock.  I'm also unsure if you can find them out in the world very rarely but like I said I can't find any solid info on them.  Though it does seem obvious you can't learn any, just the prime receiver.
---
Agrees mutex i solo it all the time.
---
F
---
Yeah, I understand you can only learn the prime receiver mod but I can't figure out if you can find the mods anywhere to attach them.  I can't get any solid info from searching on whether they can be bought or found very rarely out in the world.
---
So you think we all live in a snow globe that's just amazing.
---
As ive said, there are no mods. The way modus spawns them is how you get the gun take it or leave it
---
Sounds pretty fun to me how hard are the survival aspects? Are you constantly needing to sleep, eat drink and stuff? Also thank you for the replies
---
no when you are cloaked you cant be locked onto vats but the sentinel effect doesnt work
---
Yeah still got it, am online right now. If you‚Äôre happy to give me 5000 caps for a bobby pin or something and then come back that‚Äôs fine with me..
---
How about five, yes, five copies! Pre-order them and mail them to me, and I'll sign my name with a "you're so right and smart and a cool guy" so you can put them on the wall and when you feel down look at them and think about how right you are.
---
Yeah, that's fine by me! Ign kgrim, I'll add you and join your server
---
Hey if you haven't looked into it don't criticize. You only have to look at basic physics..you spin a wet tennis ball and water flies off. If the eath moves at 1000mph the water should fly off into space.
---
Have you found the raider base that's shaped like a coliseum down the cliff edge you can't build there but very interesting set up 4 Raiders
---
Np, I didn't know it worked that way until I actually used it so.
---
That can happen if you are at absolute max carry weight, or the weight of the item will put you over.
---
You should get a pop up in the upper left of your screen telling you so - I forget what the exact wording of the message happens to be.
---
Al least its not completely wasted - you can drink inert flux, and it weighs less than purified water.
---
I've experienced this many times like you describe, looks like you're crafting but nothing happens (don't think it's related to flux in particular, I've had it happen with every type of crafting)... But it's always worked for me if I just re-enter the crafting bench. I think it's an exploit fix to keep people from crafting more items than they have the mats for if the server is lagging. Guessing maybe it got stuck somehow for you? Does switching servers fix it?
---
Won‚Äôt let me accept friend invite.. thought they‚Äôd fixed this????
---
Nothing. It crashes too frequently for me.
---
Ah, alrighty.
---
is the third effect "250 damage resistance while reloading"?
---
And now you're telling me the Internet lied to me?
---
The comment stays. Period. I'm not changing it.
---
absolutly yes sir
---
They really should, we should be able to host servers from our own console similar to how Ark does it. But I guess everyone wants to pay monthly for something that should have been in a game that was 60$, has microtransactions, and released very unstable. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Bleh - try restarting the game. That usually fixes it.
---
that 3rd effect (250 DR while reloading) is bugged and disables the first effect, whatever it may be. in your case, vampire's.
---
you can "fix" it by switching weapons or by reloading crouched, but whenever you reload normally it's gonna bug again.
---
It does
---
I have a revolver that currently doesn't take durability damage, and I can't repair it. Pretty sure someone at Bethesda screwed up a line of code somewhere.
---
"It just works!"
---
A quest where we have to ‚Äúremove‚Äù potential threats to modus. Aka we have to assassinate someone
---
Does this mean we'll get a plan to craft a dog, a breathing organism?
---
How would the doggy sniff ammo? Because of the metal, the gunpowder?
---
Not hard, you can find yourself needing to eat and drink a lot, but there‚Äôs plenty of ways to find and get food/ water, aswell as many perks to help you with surviving as you level up.. You don‚Äôt need to sleep although it gives you a temporary buff to your xp if you do.
---
Your biggest issue with surviving will probably wondering too far from the lowlevel area initially, go too far and the enemies will slaughter you in the lower levels, but once your a high level with good weapons, there is no creature you can‚Äôt handle! 
---
And no worries hope I can help! This game is not for everyone and has its issues, but for me I haven‚Äôt been as addicted to a game since I discovered Runescape as a pre teen 2004ishüòÇ so there is defiantly something to cherish here! If you could pick it up on sale I would recommend! :)
---
If you follow the money it leads out of the country though
---
I have a bloodied version of what you're trying to do that if it's a none automatic build. I maxed out Agility for stealth, Perception for rifleman perks and more as well as have 14 luck for maximum vats usage among other bonuses
---
Since the suits didn't arrive at mama dolce's they should probably be somewhere else, some sort of shipping hub where they're secreted away in a shipping container.
---
Gun is definitely worth more than 15k. Shoulda hit the trade sub with that bad boy.
---
Except aimbot and duped bs is not ‚Äòfighting‚Äô üòÇ
---
In this particular circumstance, I'm pretty far under my carry weight (a rare occurrence, to be sure lol). I did not realize that about inert flux, though. Thank you!
---
nope. Just more rational than a lot of other places
---
Not necessarily you.  Anyone who has it runs the risk of causing a crash when the particle effects go absolutely crazy, typically in a setting with numerous enemy NPCs.
---
I used the crevasse dam spawn point, with a twist.  When you spawn in, turn around and go to the intersection.  Turn left and take a few steps.  There is a pickup truck on a side road.  Go up that side road.   A bit further, you‚Äôl pass another truck with glowing fungus around it.  Keep going.  
---
You‚Äôll find a pair of trucks.  The small space between those trucks is a random spawn.  After about 8 server hops, the witch was there, along with both the hat plan and the costume plan.
---
ok thx sir , bethesda  want to repair that ? or i can throw this wearpon 
---
and its a older bug or only with last MAJ ?
---
Plan: Dogmeat
---
Requirements:
---
50x lead
---
5x gunpowder
---
10x fiberglass
---
Ah, gotcha. Yeah, I've tried re-entering the bench and that didn't do it. I'll try switching servers and see what happens. Thanks for the input!
---
They're too busy working on ways to make more money off of us, I doubt they care about exploits and hackers anymore. Look at Nuclear Winter, there are hackers that have been reported dozens of times and they're still there level 100+ still ruining the experience for others. But let's sell private servers and more utility items. üò¥
---
Bloodied Heavy works very well.
---
Seems like a fair price to me :)
---
People were trading legacy lasers for a be or a bffr 50 cal.
---
I‚Äôve been checking that place too! All that ever seems to like spawning there for me is the feral gouls and the dead body but I‚Äôll keep trying! It‚Äôs good to know someone‚Äôs find it there though so thank you!
---
Ok, but I‚Äôm not bothered. It‚Äôs a game, I don‚Äôt take it too seriously.
---
Yes! Thank you. I wanted to say steel but I knew for a fact that wasn‚Äôt right.
---
Which platform are you on? I'm Xbox.
---
Would love if they implement Wastelanders Update as a seperate version of the game. Highlevel and you can just switch to it once you finished the overseer quest. So it would continue the world, no scourge since we were successful with the SBQ but a lot of other threats, even in the forest.
---
it's an old, known bug. Bethesda is (probably) aware of it but no mention of a fix yet.
---
patch 14 is coming next week. I'd hold onto it and see what happens.
---
Stealth Rifleman
---
* Great for sneaking around solo or grouped
---
* Great for high 1 shot damage giggles
---
* Great for killing just about anything, maybe not as fast as other builds but viable
---
* Wide variety of weapon choices: Handmade for SHTF moments. Lever or Gauss (various viable legendary prefixes) with sneak for one shotting most regular mobs in the face
---
Commando
---
* Great for pvp
---
* Great at killing things faster than a rifleman
---
* Great at reducing weight by blowing through ammo
---
* Wide variety of weapon choices that deviate a bit from rifleman because some just aren't very viable
---
Both are fun. I have and actively play both, but I have to play them differently. Put more thought into how you want to play, maybe write that up and we can see if one is a better fit than the other.
---
get addicted to;
---
1. alcohol
---
2. daddy-o
---
3. daytripper
---
4. mentats
---
5. overdrive OR psycho
---
I'd go with psycho as it has three variants that can easily be obtained and I found myself actually using it while doing westtek, sbq runs so I never feel the withdrawal if I'm doing something worthy. I dunno nothing about armors, but I'm rocking a JFFR RW Gatling Gun, a JCrit Revolver and a JFFR 10mm along with an assortment of other J weapons on and off, but that Gatling Gun gets the job done every single time.
---
If you don't enjoy Destiny or Anthem I'm positive you won't enjoy this either, don't waste your money. üëç Very dry game right now, no content, and they seem to be going in the wrong direction with the game. Use your money on Borderlands 3 or something maybe.
---
Excellent!
---
It would help if you shared what level you're currently at.
---
I always play in third-person mode myself.  Sometimes the camera gets very tight in interiors, but I vastly prefer it to the first-person mode.
---
Dont sell it for 15k, just don‚Äôt.
---
I run a junkies sneaky commando build, the perks are the almost exact same as a regular high health commando build. The only thing is my strength and charisma are low so ive been looking for Vanguard armour that has one of those two as a third perk.
---
Too late, all done :)

Next week (or this week?) As for cost, totally up in the air.... but it's a premium service, so expect a premium price tag. That said.... I'm incredibly curious how RNG drops are going to function on private servers; I server hop multiple times a night just to find a world dropping decent stuff.
---
Just letting you know man.
---
This week an 5-15$ month if not even a bit more...
---
Words from the prophet himself
---
I totally agree, this game is so unique compared to other shooter games, it‚Äôs a shame that they don‚Äôt attempt to get the most out of it. I‚Äôve always suggested that they split the now-gone Survival into two modes, one allows everything without any damage caps, the other would be NW style, no aimbot no legendary effects. Current NW is great for pvp but the wait time is ridiculous and you can‚Äôt use your weapons of choice.
---
Hacks and aimbots are, without a doubt, frustrating. Complaining to the developers about individual player's use of third-party software is an uphill battle at best, and pissing into the wind at worst. This is a numbers game, more to the point a money game, and until/unless this significantly affects the bottom line, it's very unlikely you'll see much movement on this issue. Opportunists are determined to seek a revenue stream at the expense of others in all "Battle Royale" style games, and at this time, players may either manage their expectations accordingly and play, or not.
---
Thanks man. But tbh I‚Äôm more concerned about figuring out why the light bulbs in my camp suddenly don‚Äôt work anymore.
---
:)
---
I can apply camp to metal and leather but not combat armor
---
Vampire is my favorite, with executioners not too far behind. Faster swing speed and 40% power attack.  + STR.
---
Also prefer 1H fast for must things - they give faster swing speeds than 2H, thus may do more damage in the same time frame.
---
(Ive been using a 1* vampire switchblade as primary for about 80 levels.)
---
There are a few Troubleshooters melees, which are handy in watogo, robco, and atlas.
---
Zealots, nocturnal, and ghoul slayer I generally scrip immediately.
---
Butt stallion crossover.
---
It's minimal visual help, at best. The purpose of spectating is two-fold; new players, unfamiliar with game mechanics, get a preview of what awaits them should they progress, and it also enables teammates to enjoy one another's company.
---
I've played in many teams, and I know that the visual assistance aspect is there, but it's minimal.
---
The spectator view is extremely limited. Usually, the real benefit of spectating teammates (with mics, naturally), is to help remind the player to use the appropriate chems or stealthboys in the heat of battle, remind them to make sure their weapons are loaded, or to give notification on the direction the perimeter flame-ring is moving.
---
I've also been in far more teams that don't communicate in the least, or prefer to remain unsocial. If you're going to play a team mode then it's only natural that you behave as one, and if that means spectators may assist in small ways then the win really becomes a team effort, for the camaraderie.
---
Most of the time, if teammates die early, the rest of us may decide to go right to the dashboard and start over, which means that we've just "helped" the remaining players by raising their chances of achieving Overseer.
---
But again, it is a team mode...and regardless if spectators do offer some minimal benefit, it pales in comparison to the benefit of having teammates who remain alive.
---
Lol, where are guys like you when I'm trying to get a deal haha. GL with your lights my man.
---
Excellent advice, wish I had read it about 4 days ago lol.
---
it hasn't really improved all that much, I wouldn't come back just yet.
---
Yeah, but the update was planned for Wednesday, so...
---
It's all gotten a little weird in the past month.  Updates and downtime are often on Wednesdays now, the nuke codes reset on Tuesdays, etc.
---
They have said that private servers will support mods in the future, but it'll probably be limited to what you can do with the Creation Kit.
---
Available this week.... we will know pricing in 2-6 days
---
i wait for the patch 14 so thx for this help , i  hesitate  to separate me but i wait again a little :)
---
My favourite thing to do when people do this to me is just back up and vats crit them.
---
I usually just run off after as well, feels good having the last laugh
---
It's very few average people.  It's typical multi-game studio practice to quickly identify your high performers and then stick them on projects that "really matter".  It's a skeleton crew of the low-mid-range performers who are on 76 which is why the needle is moving so slowly, and when it does, it's prone to errors.  I don't blame Bethesda.  I'd put my high performers on Starfield and TES6 dev, too.
---
To add - if you crouch *before* you reload, up until the reload is complete, the bug ***will not*** affect you.
---
They are hoping that the introduction of private worlds will tie us over until Wastelanders is ready.
---
Aine you and everyone else can go to the private paid to play server im sticking to the multiplayer servers lol.
---
Last time I was there, it was almost nonstop SBs from that fissure.  Had just bout enough time to loot the dead one, and here comes another....
---
Good times :)
---
Pvp and the fallout license make so much sense given the nature of the world you in and themes of the game...
---
At least its only basic shit like throwables and mines, yes annoying but what are they really getting? A mule full of shit to sell to a vendor? While yes immersion breaking but eh can be funny found someone doing tomahawks scooped  up a few hundred and proceeded to chuck tomahawks at everything for an hour or so
---
Unfortunately, that's what happens when there's no competition in this genre.  Where else am I going to scratch the coop multiplayer itch in a post-apocalyptic universe?
---
Google
---
Either weapon is fine. Zealot's with a Stinging mag + Tank Killer will arguably give you better damage. If you don't run Tank Killer, the value of AA legendary affix goes up. As others mentioned, don't waste time firing on the SB in the air unless you're crippling limbs. Either way, you're golden. Have fun.
---
its the first big bug than i see in f76 ,  but it's a huge bug who fck the gameplay 
---
go work bethesda :)
---
Damn dude
---
With the proper mods and gear you don't have to worry about dying much, even with 20% health.  Are you using PA?  PA is generally used in bloody heavy builds because of the emergency protocols chest piece mod.
---
They are taking advantage of 10/23 being the date the bombs dropped for the next update to break away from their usual Tue/Thu patch day cadence.
---
Yep.  Sad to say, it's been that way since launch.  There are a lot of theories about what causes it, but nothing conclusive.  Personally, I'm not convinced it's anything we as players actually have control over.  I blame it on broken AI missing a step and failing to self-correct.
---
I think there actually is a hidden failsafe that pulls her back to the area if she takes off to the northwest, and presumably gets X distance away from ground zero.  The problem is that if she goes in any other direction, she hits the invisible wall at the edge of the world before that distance threshold is met.
---
I think if going to survival was permanent then less people would have tried it out. It would have made it harder for a noob to dip their toes in the water. I think people would not have wanted to potentially give up on a character. Plus sometimes after a hard day of being murdered I just wanted to go chill out in adventure mode.
---
So the game must be letting you like it then?
---
Not much good until higher levels, but it's worth maxing out Agility and Perception, as the majority of your damage will come from those 2 Perk Trees: Perception for Damage and Accuracy; Agility for Stealth and Sneak Crits.
---
High Luck is good for VATS builds.
---
Intelligence is important for modding and crafting rifles, as well as armour.
---
There's others who can be more specific about maximising damage for both builds, but this should cover the basics.
---
 Do you know what Executioner dose? Incisor is standard for a melee build.
---
Cheating and dupers is not the fault of Bethesda. That's on shitty players and they should take responsibility for their actions. Not *fixing it quickly* when found is Bethesda's fault however.
---
Do you have any idea the amount of effort that people go through to dupe cars in GTAO? There's websites with forums devoted to it. They find an 'in' to get the game in a certain state and then work on the actual dupe methods. It's usually a ridiculous effort with many steps to be followed exactly too.
---
Gets posted to YouTube? Sometimes Rockstar fixes a couple of hours later. Sometimes you have a few days to dupe before it gets addressed.
---
The fact people did this is not Rockstar's fault. It's also not Bethesda's fault either when people do it in this game, despite the "*YeAh bUt BEtHesDa...*" crew patrolling the sub (wishing for a nucleur winter yes yes).
---
The difference is getting it fixed quick (GTAO) or taking months (FO76)... and also that Rockstar will ban you without a second thought when they spot you sold 4 of the same car in a day. Bethesda should ban them too, despite the complaints about that as well.
---
Tl;dr: dupers aren't Bethesda's fault but not fixing the methods quickly is their fault.
---
I overrepair to 200%.
---
My 1H Melee weapons seemingly last forever that way.
---
I always carry a backup weapon (or two), so the few times my primary has broken, I have something else to switch to.
---
have u checked both your stash and your character holotape inventory? it should show the game and if you have multiple copies, the number next to it like: nuka-tapper (2)
---
I just want the damn thing to harvest my crops !
---
Any kind of love from Bethesda.
---
Open-world Fallout universe theme park. Hunting legendaries. Scavenging. Building C.A.M.P.s. Managing my inventory. Throwing on Vault-Tec PA and outfit and helping out around the Wasteland. I can progress at my own pace. Plus, made a few friends by accident.
---
&gt;waw my savior , well no choise to play sneaky   
---
&gt;thx for this good trick
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just not for you , lots of other games out there
---
Good point.
---
Huh. I'll look into this and see what I can find.
---
I agree, in fact if the utility items don't make enough money to keep the content free I think they should start selling things like 3* legendaries, legendary power armor (a much requested item), stash space, and larger camp budgets in the store. There needs to be more things to buy so that the game is free. These items are necessary to keep the game alive.
---
That is not a very good argument. Your shooting of the enemy player...while saving your teammate...rewards you the experience for having made the kill. But the reward for the team is that you are allowed to progress further, which gains you all more experience earned based on longevity. Why should you earn additional experience, simply for spectating? When you die, as far as earning in-game rewards, that's where it stops. If you choose to spectate, it's either because you're curious as to what will happen, or you wish to offer some minimal assistance to your teammates (using a microphone); either way, you've already earned your reward (knowledge, in the first instance, and being altruistic in the second).
---
If you're on a team, that should be it's own benefit as you've increased your own odds of becoming Overseer.
---
Platform?
---
Yeah, if they keep private servers a bethesda service than all the mods you can choose will likely be through them, especially since they already have the infrastructure with BethesdaNet mods through Fallout 4/Skyrim SE.
---
Certain dog breeds IRL can track almost anything when properly trained, even if the stuff might seem like it doesn't have a scent.
---
They're probably worried that they will accidentally add it for free if they try and fix it.
---
Yeah, I remember you used to be able to get them just fine. The holotapes just never stacked, so selling or storing them was annoying
---
That would be the end of my time in 76

It must be using same code as shotguns.  It‚Äôs a known and now ignored bug sadly.
---
Harpers Ferry Vendor sometimes.
---
I‚Äôve ran both. Currently playing my bloodied alt a lot. It‚Äôs required more work to get to the sweet spot. Perk allocation, the right mutations, full set of unyielding armor. When it‚Äôs all there it‚Äôs awesome. If you‚Äôre uncomfortable running around a hair under 20% hp, might be stressful however.
---
Thanks. The Zealot‚Äôs Handmade worked out quite well!! ;-)
---
I'd steer clear of MW. Pretty shady business practices behind the scenes recently, hiding an entire game mode for a year from people. Hiding loot boxes until after reviewers already give the game a score. Game itself looks all right but there are definitely better shooters out there atm. And idk where you're playing, but both blizzard and activision definitely do not deserve more business right now
---
If an enemy gets hit several times either on the same tick or close together, the game often ignores the damage.
---
It's a bug.  It sucks.  It has never been acknowledged by Bethesda despite numerous complaints.
---
Up to about L35 or so, life can be difficult in the wastes.
---
You feel underpowered for where the questlines are taking you, and overpowered for places you have been.
---
An thats completely normal. 
---
The center (divide) and east side (mire and bog) are high level (45+) areas.  So is whitesprings, but at least one questline will take you there relatively early.  I was able to survive there solo for that mission step around L27.
---
The west side toxic valley to the north, forest in the center, and ashheap to the south are the ‚Äúlower level‚Äù areas.  
---
Locations on the borders of each may scale enemies to the highest level player in the area.
---
Go to the places on the west side of the map with lots of super mutants - they give good XP.  Loot their weapons, scrap, and learn the mods, or sell to the vendors.
---
Explore, learn the lore, gain XP.
---
You are almost at the point where you can begin the excavator quest and start exploring the Ash heap.  
---
I know there are a couple of points in the Overseers quest down there...
---
 
---
Do what you can with the Mysteries Quest, Roses Quest, and Recruitment Blues.  Perhaps the Firebreathers quest as well.
---
The rewards for mysteries and Roses are better if you dont return to them until after L50, so no need to rush them.  Back burner and pick them up again when you are about L45.
---
Theres another short little quest starting at Wavy Willards - nice reward from that one, too.
---
Ok I can see your point there that does sound fun, I just think about the economy.
---
If you stay in the forest it doesn‚Äôt matter who is nearby... levels are capped. Same Thong with toxic valley and the ash heap. These are all low level areas. If you do encounter a higher level enemy... just keep your distance and you should be fine.
---
Totally agree. This game's code is a fat mess, but even if it was well done people would have found SOME ways of exploiting it. But it's inexcusable that the dupes that were found during the beta did not get properly addressed until earlier this year. And that most of the people who did it got away without a ban. Hell, most of the duped and dev room items didn't even get removed. Still see people with winterized PA skins or laser muskets from time to time. Pretty much the only people affected were mules who still had multiple versions of identical duped items on them
---
man we are at thw fo76 subreddit, I eat shady business practices for breakfast from what you can see lol but the only thing I'm struggling right now is Blizzard's treatment of china, which I truly, deeply hate. tbh I can stand capitalist greed but not tiptoeing around communist oppression.
---
any other arcade shooters with at least 10k+ active players you can think of my man, apart from BFV?
---
I've got 2 Quad shotguns to handle the masses ... and if needed, use my marsupial jump to clear the crowds and stimpack.  I try to cripple first and then use my melee to finish up the job.
---
Strength and intelligence are a PA user's best friend. Strength gives you perks for weight reduction on almost everything and boosting damage for melee and heavy weapons, and intelligence will let you repair your equipment up to 200% and double the usage of your fusion cores. PA also has a useful perk under intelligence that both dramatically boosts the accuracy and armor penetration of heavy guns while in PA if you want to go that route. That being said, past level 50 you can start moving your points around, so you're not locked into any one playstyle, although you will be sacrificing the option to get a perk card for that level up whenever you do so. So, don't be afraid to experiment.
---
Wow that blows I was really excited for my new weapon setup
---
I think the main reason theres a cap on anything is because of dupers. Duping a bunch of weapons for scrip and literally rolling legendaries until they get what they want. Same goes for the vault 94 and backpacks not being tradeable.
---
That's half my thinking, I cant fathom why you would even use this glitch. Why even play the game at that point?
---
No, that's only for recent Purveyor only drops. Those being Fixer, Sheepsquatch club/staff, Shepard's Crook, and Bear Arm. Aside from that it's only level dependant. For example, fat men can't be low level, so that's cut off from low level rolls
---
Maybe when they come out this week? Jeeze lol
---
It doesn't use AP. I've retired from NW after grinding day-and-night, and it didn't use AP back then, nor now.
---
Even changed my main character's build to commando, just for NW, but then the game got boring as I couldn't kill anything, and after months, finally changed it back to melee, ending my NW career once and for all, still better as a person than the tryhards, not having devolved to a feral ghoul like a certain level 300+ tryhard who still plays NW every hour of the day.
---
Don't let the endgame cripple your earlygame. Pick what you need or really want to try out. After 50 you can choose to pick a new perk card or reallocate a special stat to a new letter every level up.
---
Enjoy just messing about with everything now because endgame is just tweaking your build.
---
Usually only vets who know exactly what they want to spec as worry about allotments at your level. For that they start a new character all together.
---
I'm glad to hear it! I'd use that Zealots FFR against the queen, too. You'll see great results against her when she's on the ground, and same for the adds. AAE on a SBQ in the air (and often on the ground due to explosive resist) is a waste of ammo and weapon durability.
---
I've run both and ultimately I switched to bloodied.
---
Instigating was awesome.....for one shot. Not so awesome after that first shot.
---
I started running bloodied at 50% health with adrenal reaction. My per shot damage was close to the instigating damage. Close enough that I could still one shot all the same mobs that instigating allowed me to one shot, plus in the event when a follow up shot(s) were needed I could dish out the same damage each time.
---
It started off as an experiment but it stuck. I now target that 39% health sweet spot.
---
White springs always has the plan for it , at least for me .
---
Under 3k caps I think
---
Could be worse, could be the last two times you killed her you either got nothing or 2 Railway spikes.
---
Wow that PC players.
---
Instigating is good if you play solo , I totally recommend it. Bloodied is without a doubt the most powerful but has major issues that just don‚Äôt work with my play style the term ‚Äú glass cannon ‚Äú definitely applies to those builds. I just don‚Äôt like dying and this games tendency to produce mobs directly behind you out of nowhere causes constant deaths, the issue with hits not registering at all also gets obnoxious and leaves people screaming at their screens ‚Äú how the fuck did he not die! ‚Äú So really it‚Äôs all about what you prefer more , instant kills and constantly dying or having a full health bar
---
They are random drops from the Strangler Blooms. They do spawn outside of the Heart of the Swamp event, but you can only harvest them at night time. It is now 3:42am in my game and I have found 6 spawns. They spawn on the west bank of the river, next to Dyer Chemical. Start from the north, where two Gulpers are. Kill them, and get the 3 spawns there. Go south along the west bank of the river, and you will come across another 3 or 4. Good luck.

I think its high time we reconsider some aspects of neoliberalism especially when a consumer types a goddamn essay to defend a multibillion dollar corporation's shady business practices without getting paid. I'm pretty fucking sure Milton Friedman didn't think about these types of fellers who get so sentimental about a product that they hinder improvement or possible competition by sticking by it no matter what lol.
---
I mean if you are getting paid, its totally fine tho.
---
I'd like to see what this looks like. Though I feel like I kinda have an idea based on the trade sub. Everybody should vote on this plox.
---
You‚Äôre on a decent path for a heavy build.  I would not say you‚Äôve messed up your spec at all.
---
A few words of advice:
---
Go here and work on your spec:: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
I would think about only +2 most skills as you level, you get perk card packs and may get lucky, and can smooth out your spec as you get closer.  It may even be worth it to only +2 your weapon skills as a point for 5% may be better spent on utility.
---
You cannot bank perk points as you level and use them all on high skills.  You can‚Äôt see the lvl 30 skill until you put in that lvl 29 special point.  That may make more sense as you play.
---
Starched genes is pretty much mandatory in this game.  The unmutated player is a unicorn.
---
Search perk like pharma farma is huge at low levels.
---
Take workshops as you level.  Defend/retake is up to you.  It‚Äôs great xp but puts you at PvP risk
---
If you don‚Äôt care about PvP put on pacifist mode.  It‚Äôs easy to get in accidental trouble.
---
how is this still a problem lmao. the game's "end-game boss", both according to the story and according to gameplay mechanics, can still glitch out in half a dozen different ways and become impossible to fight, wasting the efforts and time of everybody involved. This should have been their #1 priority after fixing dupes and the damage bug, long before adding any major new content. Although neither of those are really fixed yet either, so I guess there's my answer
---
I ran instigating lever build up to over lv100, then switched to bloodied primarily to play around with unarmed bloodied weapons - 
---
at just under 50% health, my BE lever does more first shot damage than my instigating at full health ... so i think that is the tipping point based on my observations.
---
Edit: I didn‚Äôt change my specials at all and the sniper cards that worked for instigating have worked great for bloodied too ...
---
i dont remember anyone saying that
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/6OWNNxTBMAsMmIwGOs8U8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-november-27-2018
---
A lot of builds need tweaking. But we wont see anything until after Wastelanders most likely. Definitely agree the meat hook it stupid busted right now. People are 3 shotting the Queen with 15+ people there leaving some people who dont run a bloodied build like myself or something to be able to get in enough dmg to get loot..
---
But it's not a shotgun for the heavy weapon class and it's not about how you personally deal with a situation. I'm suggesting either a new weapon or maybe a shotgun mod for the auto grenade launcher that can be loaded with about 40 shells, capable of rapid fire crowd control.
---
I've done Monster Mash 3 times today ;)
---
lol
---
I think it‚Äôll be a good turn for the game. I remember how when ppl realised that there weren‚Äôt going to be human npcs, there was a lot of uproar and was the main reason some (including myself) were skeptical about the game.
---
You seem genuinely surprised by that; keep in mind Fallout 1 and 2 were PC exclusive and we've been around this franchise for 22 years now.
---
Theres definitely more players on Consoles. They will vote an pass PC soon if they participate. ( Source on PC )
---
I'm not a power armor user myself, but as far as I can tell, your stats seem to be on the right track, Most power armor perks fall into Strength and Intelligence, so just keep that in mind.
---
You can sort of respec after level 50, so don't feel hindered by picking the wrong stat. Most pistols require really strong legendary effects in order to be of any use late game, so I'd recommend straying away from those early game. As long as you keep dumping points in strength, melee and Heavy guns are what you want to delve into. Shotguns also fall under strength, but require VATs style combat to really get the most damage out of them (and using VATs in Power Armor will eat up your fusion cores).
---
As you continue the main quest, you may end up finding the map spawns or sidequests outlevel you,  and it will become difficult to progress. My advice is to join and participate in Public Events (especially the higher level ones), as these will generally provide decent XP. Once you have a strong gun, then consider farming XP from super mutant mobs at whichever locations they spawn.
---
There are other games, but... It's Fallout. 
---
That's what keeps pulling me back in.
---
Seems like there was a hacker or two most games, for a while - dunno if it's still that bad these days?  I quit playing a few months ago.
---
2 months is not old - I find it quite upsetting very often that threads get locked at 6 mos - people say "search, no need to duplicate posts" but then when you search, most things you find are "too old" to join.  They shouldn't lock threads for a couple years IMO.
---
Yeah its 85% console trades. PC is very light in comparison.
---
Sweet!
---
I believe you. I just got an anti armor ss baseball bat from the purveyor the other day. I dont really like anti armor so im just gonna sell it. However. I got an instigating ss grognak axe as well. Imma spec into 2 handed and educate some fools...
---
And not to brag, honestly, but i have an instigating ss +1 strength meat hook i paid 21k caps for. It is straight murderous. I love it.
---
Huh, now that's a new one to me. Looks like you're getting LOD models, like you'd see from a far distance. That's a bit odd. I'd submit this as a bug report.
---
best advice I'd give is do not look anything up before level 50, its where equipment and special maxes out and where you can actually start min/maxing.
---
game gets mighty stale and easy after 50 so screwing up and struggling a little bit before 50 is definitely fun. I had a blast until 65-70, then you start to see game's flaws.
---
Now I‚Äôm just picturing Sulik and his ‚ÄòGrampy Bone‚Äô from Fallout 2
---
That's what's caused me to make this post today, i  hit the queen about 15 times but because there was one or maybe 2 people with OP unarmed builds, i didn't get the loot drop and probably neither did anyone else. If it was a single player game then fine do what you want but it's not, and it's become a problem.
---
Sounds fair. I‚Äôm a PvPer is this is a good one!
---
Ok, thanks for clarify
---
As I was üòõüòÇ

Winner! I got it thank you!
---
Not sure about arcade shooters, I think cod is the only one I really play. For more competitive ones csgo is my go to, but aside from the community it seems like r6s is still doing pretty well. For looters shooters I stick to warframe or borderlands. Bl3 seems to be pretty good from what I've heard but I have not gotten it yet
---
Got it from Wallace in harpers....thanks everyone!
---
I have PC and PS4 versions, and can‚Äôt say that I feel any actual difference in player numbers for now.
---
Thanks for replying! :)
---
I know but I found a lot of people in console servers (PS4), but for now we need to wait until more people do the test
---
Great advice, thanks!!
---
He had a clean space suit for 2000 caps
---
oh and can you tell me 3 more games where a) it charges you for a one time or monthly price and b) sells and pledges to sell even more non-cosmetic, unique items in a weekly/daily updated fashion via lootboxes or direct purchases?
---
recent CoD games are the only ones I can think of tbh and they are going away from that; not implementing more of it.
---
Yeah, noticing this a bit more in the last week. Was taking my buddy through some Queen runs an his build isnt that good right now an 3 times he wasnt able to do enough before she got 3 shot even though I told him ignore everything else an just mag dump the Queen.
---
You can tame attack dogs in the game to have at your camp.
---
those are trolls
---
Most mines do. Blackwatet too.
---
Once you learn the entire story of postwar Appalachia it makes sense that there were no human npcs.  It also makes sense that once the plague had been contained that humans would return to Appalachia.  Why stay in the capitol wasteland when there is lush forested area just south?
---
Look up. They don't vanish, they just get launched into orbit. They will land you just gotta look for them as they fall.
---
Why amusing, was that you?  There absolutely was some hacking going on when I posted this - as to weather noobmaster3000 was for sure hacking, or just suspicious, I don't remember now.
---
I used to be really good at another FPS game and I got accused of hacking all the time - I even had 3 - 4 players spec me for over 1/2 hour then \*insist\* I was a hacker.  It wasn't hacking, it was practice, and game awareness - I usually knew where the enemy was, where they were going - I could throw grenades across the map without seeing the enemy and have it literally land on their head.
---
I'm nowhere near that good anymore - I try to play Apex Legends and I feel so noob it's painful.  Still really fun to get wins though.
---
The map made by u/FloorBelow is pretty comprehensive :)

So with my idea you'd be able to cash all of that crap in immediately, be free of the weight and have credit for weeks without going back. Until you get more ledges, of course
---
Microtransactions in games do nothing but harm every game in current time, but also all that come after it. It is a literal cancer upon gaming and has contributed to borderline ruining an entire generation of games.
---
Like 3 days before Halloween.
---
I consistently see the same players in severs an its actually hard to sever hop stuff on PC because a lot of the time there isnt a ton of opened servers or only a couple active. With the huge delay to the next content drop an judging by how many people on my last Reddit post said they are gonna take a break or just straight up quit until then I wouldn't doubt it evening out some. But if you look at the trade subs it's like 85% console trades an very few PCs mixed in.
---
You're welcome!
---
It would be better if the question had parameters:
---
Is it good for a solo player who just wants to build
---
Is it good for me &amp; my friends who want to hardcore raid all night
---
Is it good for someone who just wants to be a player vendor and sell things 
---
Is it good for PvP
---
Good is subjective. For some it's awesome, for some it's just something to do and for some it's just not for them.
---
Put on your excavator, go someplace large, pick up anything that isnt nailed down.
---
Go to you local bot vendor, scrap what you thing you might need, equip hard bargain 3, pop a grape mentats, and sell everything you just picked up.  Repeat.
---
Two runs through whitesprings doing that - dont forget inside - those phones and vases add up), and I‚Äôm are at daily cap limit.  If WS is to high level, try Morgantown airport.  The scorched drop weapons, and the hangers are full of chems and misc items.
---
And you get the incoming cargobot mission as well.
---
I honestly don't understand why they wouldn't just make scaling a thing. If you're lvl 50 everything should already be a high lvl
---
Oh I was talking in a pure numbers perspective. Not Role Playing.
---
Nothing remotely even begins to compare to Strangler's PA Build with any quick weapon preferably Heavy. It's a joke and the game really has 0 balance what so ever. Surprised there is not bi-weekly balance patches like other games with far less issues have.
---
Maybe people ask because TESO has a similarly horrible launch, but after a series of updates, has become an AMAZING game. Not only is it another Bethesda game, it‚Äôs also the first online game in its franchise, it‚Äôs on the same engine, and when Wastelanders comes out, they‚Äôll basically be reskins of each other. Also, Bethesda HAS been releasing a lot of updates to try to improve the game. I can see where you‚Äôre coming from, the inexperienced crowd who fail to see the redeeming qualities can be annoying, but you gotta admit, they have a *somewhat* valid reason for asking.
---
Doing too much dmg too fast. Happens alot with shotguns an tesla. Been a known "bug" around for a while.
---
I was simply asking if you were aware of the issue, I didn't say you were responsible the existence of the problem. You're free to play however you want, just as others are free to complain when one player's behavior has a disproportionately negative effect on how others enjoy the game. One person with a tesla or plasma weapon can completely ruin a nuked Whitesprings for the entire server.
---
"Help I've fallen and I can't get up!"
---
Yes, the set bonus is incredibly overpowered and broken. Far worse than pre-nerf TSE.
---
but if the game is mediocre at best in for example in all the things you said, wouldn't that add some weight to the original question at hand?
---
Ammo Mutt

Bone: 10/10

Leather: 10/10

---
I totally get that , but if they didn‚Äôt like it on day one why would they now is my issue,  I understand some things have been fixed but it‚Äôs not a different game in any way from what it was on day one
---
Ash heap
---
Location? Like what do I farm over and over again?
---
Yeah we still have this with automatic rifles as well. Health will be gone, vats will click off the target then a few seconds later the fool is standing there with a third to half of its health back. Gotta shoot it again. And dont even get me started on melee. Body party parts flying everywhere, everyone is covered in blood, damage numbers stacking up. Dude has still got a full health bar after 4 to 5 hits. 3 or more super mutants will back you into a corner, they will take zero damage, stagger the hell out if you, break your armor then beat you to death. Fun times.
---
What would you say for perk cards then? Right now I‚Äôm running a stealth sniper AAE so I already have all the stealth stuff, rifleman, and tank killer perks. In other words, what would you say for bloodied cards should I go in that direction and which ones should I focus on first?
---
The DMV in the Ash Heap at the Capital has a crap load of ghouls
---
Just do everything. Quests, kills, crafting, building, events.. the lot
---
Go to Welch, kill all the mole miners and sheepsquatch or fog crawlers, sell the loot then hop servers to same location
---
Great, thank you! I‚Äôll hopefully be level 50 by the end of this week :)
---
I mean after f4's dialogues, character building and quests, I actually didn't miss it one bit tbh. On the other hand, Austin did a fine good job with the state of the lore they have with all the environmental story building and postmortem story telling so I'm kinda hopeful about it. If, that is, I don't lose my interest in the game after 5 months :(
---
And we just killed 36 million scorched in WV..ü§î makes you thunk
---
Yes, but I don‚Äôt wanna do quests that grant me one time rewards. Like the ‚ÄúBunker Buster‚Äù, the ‚ÄúAll Rise‚Äù, the ‚ÄúUltracite Power Armor‚Äù etc..
---
Unfortunately my best was a bloodied bash damage Plasma Rifle. Might not sound like much but I've been on the lookout for one of those for a while. That's about it. I was kinda hyped for the event as well
---
I'm on ps4, couldn't buy anything

Stash/use/sell that lead...dont carry it around, it is the apocalypse after all.
---
Really all that needs to be said is the atom shop is what keeps FO76 going.  They haven‚Äôt hit it with me yet, but at some point they are going to do something objectionable to keep the $$$ flowing in my eyes.  The recent inside the vault was their warning of that.  I‚Äôll take my money elsewhere if it bothers me enough, and not hang out on fan subs and bitch for months on end.
---
Otherwise I‚Äôm not sure what people think keeps this game running.  It‚Äôs quite possible to have not paid a cent into this game after launch, have some nice atom stuff, and keep chugging along.
---
Now I will say I‚Äôll not buy another day 1 Bethesda release.  Fool me once and all that.
---
Use lone wanderer if playing solo
---
Well, I do not think it matters something, since all of them are mechanically completely separated from each other.
---
How about this scenario, make games that people want to continue playing for the full price they paid and then make newer games, like the old days.  If they don't want to continually make new games and take the lazy milk it for all it's worth path then hello, I give you Fallout 76 destined to die.
---

I role play as an enclave special forces agent sometimes, - so I‚Äôd love some cool outfits and helmets that fit that üëçüèª enclave x-01 skins would be cool too ...
---
I saw that in someones video once! I'm definitely going to be trying that out. But they can get killed though right?
---
Isn‚Äôt that the ‚ÄúRusty Knuckles‚Äù mod?  Or am I confused? (Which is quite possible)
---
They‚Äôll only spawn in containers once you‚Äôve found a dead tourist and looted the camera that starts the quest.
---
maybe they didn't keep up with the game and was hoping beth added more my man? I mean as you said before, game is not a different game as we are doing the exact same content for a year now and its not players' fault I'd say. 
---
If I were fo76 mods tho, I'd put up a sticky, in caps, ITS THE SAME GAME WITH LESS BUGS just to reduce the amount of these posts.
---
Ah gotcha....also, start at the welch train station.  Easier to see all the enemies.  To your right will be train station and your left up the road a little bit is where the sheepsquatch, fog crawlers or super mutes spawn
---
Because the people who left on day one or day 50 or day 300 and are thinking about coming back are doing so because they liked the concept of the game or some elements of it, but the problems were too big for them to deal with. The community is a the best place to ask whether those have been addressed yet or not. The patch notes aren't particularly helpful, some of the biggest changes to the game were stealth nerfs and they don't mention all of the new game breaking bugs they introduced with an update
---
What level does the Sheepsquatch normally spawn as? Level 50?
---
the extra damage is hardly game breaking. even if they switched to DCGs you wouldn't see much of a change.
---
If we have to buy the atom shop items to keep the lights on at these studios so that they can deliver this free content then its not free is it? What are you a shareholder or something? Its not our responsibility to keep these guys paid. Its theirs. Don't try to put that on us. If they have to pull the plug on 76 because we didnt buy enough PA skins and refrigerators then this experiment was doomed from the start.
---
I'd even settle for a cyberdog from that New Vegas DLC... or was it F3?

Incorrect. Its not a bug an neither is the pipe revolver. Stop crying that others are stronger than you.

**Spell Tome removed: Exploding Familiar**
---
If using this method I highly reccomend using a container in the world rather than a paper bag. For this reason
---
The camera controls issue is most likely due to the game's V-Sync setting located in one of the ini files.
---
You can find your ini files by going to Documents&gt;My Games&gt;Fallout 76.
---
Open Fallout76Prefs.ini and look for iPresentInterval=1. You need to set this to 0 and save the ini file.
---
This will disable the game's V-Sync setting, but it will also unlock your FPS.
---
I recommend limiting your FPS to your monitor's refresh rate using a program like RTSS.
---
As for the lag, the only thing you can do is hope to find a good server or stay in the same server long enough for it so stop appearing for other people while searching for a server.
---
Hope this helps.
---
I think it was a great idea and my reasoning back at the start has been more or less confirmed, If they had npcs at luanch would of just been more buggy code pissing people off. Proof they planned on releasing it a year after luanch, still to buggy so pushed it back another 3 months
---
I am laughing so hard and I'm so sorry for laughing. I feel your pain I really do.
---
Not really. If someone asked if it's a good game to waste time in, mess around and collect stuff and be a player vendor then yes, it's pretty successful at that. If a group wants to be all night raiders, not so much.
---
I think you nailed it the first time ;)
---
I usually do. In fact only yesterday I used the 3 containers inside the barn to transfer stuff. But today, lack of sleep and general dopeyness got the better of me. Lesson learned.
---
If they add a dog companion, it had better interact with other dog companions: sniffing butts, fighting, etc.
---
No dodgy?
---
I was just at Whitesprings and the golf club was full of red ash piles. No big deal, just server hop if you want to run the place.
---
It's not really feasible for me to change from energy weapons. I've finally got my BoS character set up: Elder Skin on T60, Bloodied Prime Ultracite Gatling Laser, Bloodied Prime Gatling Plasma, 300+ plasma cores, 200 fusion cores (Ultracite &amp; regular), Quad Tesla rifle, Bloodied Tesla Rifle, Bloodied Plasma Rifle, all how I want them and perfect for the character I've been trying to set up all this time. I'm not changing. I wasn't aware of this Pile Situation and it's not my fault. Hopefully it'll get fixed at some point
---
Yeah, 50
---
Yeah theres only 2 I'm pretty sure. Lead an Junk an Lead an Acid locations. The Lead an Acid one sucks you get hit by Scorch Beast all the time.
---
Why not just deposit them in your chest?  Or was this characters chest already almost full?  I've never had to leave weapons or armour behind, I'd rather just slowly walk to a train station or my camp to throw them in my chest.
---
Maybe I should try to avoid it then üòÇ
---
If it was a server we could run at home, sure. But if they're providing additional hosting at their end it's fair enough.  
---
Would I like them to be free? Of course. Would giving 100k players who want a private server free bandwidth and processing cycles severely damage the financial viability of the game? Hell yes.
---
It's hilarious. I'd totally laugh if it was someone else.
---
Hes easy, just stay up on the rocks in sneak mode, he wont come after you
---
game having absolutely 0 player vending = bad
---
the current state of player vending with temporary camp placements (not an auction), no extra stash space, no item4item barter system, and to top all that the looming caps inflation crisis of 2101 that is plaguing the economy = mediocre?
---
so that aspect of the game definitely improved but would you honestly say its good?
---
Oh, great tip! Thanks!
---
All but one stash box from 5 characters is at max. Just so happens the one with some free space can't jump very high.
---
Id imagine that the enclave will come looking for answers to what happened to Appalachia, their now deceased comrades and will try to capitalize on the findings...maybe at odds with Modus.
---
The legendary system is so broken why is the 3 star legendary giving me a 1 star legendary that's bull shit it's a bug and beh doesn't kny how to fix it

You laugh but that has been Bethesda as of lately.
---
Sooooo....you just want dogmeat back.  Dont we all.
---
I have no idea for sure but I don't think ESO uses the creation engine. I think 76 is the first online game with the engine. If ESO already had the technology I'm sure the launch of this game would've been a lot smoother server side.
---
It is amazing. But why is it NSFW?
---
cripple the legs maybe?
---
Yeah, all my meat piles glow purple.

Its actually no more than 8 a day. Super easy to get around by selling 2 cars every 2 hours. Rockstar isn't as competent as you're saying they are. They leave godmode glitches unpatched for obscene periods of time, literally any time a new dlc comes around its immediately dupe glitch central, you can still use the orbital cannon for free by closing your game as soon as you fire, and this also doesnt trigger the cooldown, so you can spam someone with an orbital space laser over and over again. Fuck id argue GTAO is in a worse state than FO76. Rockstar patched it so people can't glitch and shoot people off the orbital cannon anymore but they refuse to make the game save sooner so people can't skip the cooldown. Let's not even get into the balancing nightmare that is the Opressor Mk2 and how its been a stain on GTA online for over a year now with them only fixing one thing on it, and it was a speed glitch.

How to get 81 lead and 162 steel in less 5 minutes: Travel to Eastern Penitentiary, get the 3 can chimes outside and the 6 inside. Rejoin world.
---
You're welcome.
---
I giggle at the bugs but have grown use to them not shure if thats a good thing tho.but i love how things are atm with everyone playing together. Tho my experiance is just thru XB1.
---
Honest question, ALL five characters at max? Are you planning on rebuilding a city? I'm just surprised sometimes that people have so many characters with so much stuff, I can't imagine what it is.
---
It is true, but PS4 and XB1 are separated from each other, so viewing them combined against PC does not seem logical here.
---
I've had it happen if you scrap items in your camp when your inventory is full. Some of the components take up more storage than the built items do when stored.
---
20 hrs from your use of the vending machine
---
Is that from when we open it or take scrip out?
---
For real.
---
It would still be too easy.
---
I thought Bethesda had an ultra hard-on for the Creation Engine, why would they use something else? Although it does seem a little different, and TES 6 might use a different one, apparently.
---
This. Makes no sense to leave 76, to find BoS, Responders, Raiders, etc all dead, Scorched everywhere, but NPCs came back. They're supposed to come back because the Scorched threat is gone.
---
What's that, you want to buy a new corpse finding helmet mod?  
---
No problem, we'll rework the code from the recon sight to pick up dead mobs, 800 atoms to you.  
---
(Fucking brainwave, we'll retcon stuff and say that the fitting on the combat helmet is the corpse finder, not a light, which can explain why the light never worked!)

Can also run Lucky Hole Mine in Excavator PA and get a shit ton of lead in about 10-15 minutes.

Yes. Their damage resistance seems to be extremely low so it could be best to take one only if your camp is in a pretty safe spot i.e. the forest.

Maybe you should look into gravity and it's effects on centrifugal force instead of whatever crackpot on youtube you got this from. The earth would have to spin much faster to counteract gravity which is determined by mass. The earth spins at 1039 mph and it takes 24 hrs to complete one rotation. Your tennis ball has much less mass and spins much faster. These and other interesting FACTS can be yours for free at your local public library.
---
I remember in skyrim i would turn into a vampire lord after i killed things just to find the corpses with the detect all creatures ability lol so this would be really useful
---
Hang back and snipe while the mole miners fight him first.  He'll be down to about a third of his health by the time he's killed them all
---
I feel your pain - bot the Stars &amp; Stripes skin for my hazmat suit a couple of months ago but still no joy. Tells me that I need to buy it (again?) from the Atom Shop in order to craft. I did get a credit on atoms but would really appreciate the working skin instead.
---
I like the sound of that a Vanpire Lord. Is that an actual thing as I‚Äôve never later Skyrim.
---
 thats my point, I cant fathom why they would need to use this method? what is the point of playing, almost like a lack of intelligence. arguably all they cause is extra server instability.
---
I don't think "Ground Drops" work in this game like they do in other MMORPGS. I used to get a server with a buddy I knew was not going to leave and I would do the whole move both characters to a secret spot and loot a container and put stuff in it, Log on and remove said items. It stopped working after a patch and I attempted twice and the items would be gone. So I recently tried three different times to drop items and log on with a different character. The bags would be on the ground but I would not be able to loot. It might work at a workshop but that's just too risky for anything valuable- unless say you do it in an out of the way container like the airport. This is on PS4 BTW
---
PC sounds a much better way to play. Neat piles that turn purple and you can have perk hands.
---
I'm not sure it's on purpose. But yeah, it's aggravating since challenges are the only non-paid way to get items from the Atom Shop, to have these bugs once and again, some of them been reported for months and they keep putting the same bugged challenge up again.
---
It's a bit like asking the stupid backers if Star Citizen is out yet.
---
This bothers me so much. A sniper rifle to the head SHOULD kill me instantly. I don‚Äôt care if I get one shot, I just want some basic level of immersion and the damage cap completely breaks that.
---
All of the above, and the hundreds of hours I've put in lol
---
Server hoping is a bit tricky if you're running a nuke.  
---
I've had corpses turn to ash piles before I've finished looting them, Bethesda need to sort their crap.  
---
I run a quad auto tesla rifle and I just can't use it at WS, else I only get one round of loot (if I'm quick).
---
Oh, sure, a moment of empathy before I blast it's head off of course. I mean that surely makes everything morally and ethically sound. :D
---
I know there's one in the toxic valley that has lead and junk, and if you position it just right there's a water source you can get a purifier into as well.  The downside is that it's the toxic valley, and the super mutants who spawn outside of your turret range have lots of trees to take cover behind.
---
Well as bethesda explained from the start. 76 wasent supose to be based around Pvp what so ever. Yes minor pvp at times but when the greafers whent overbord is when bethesda cut pvp out of adventure mode. So thoes who wanted to play the game from the Pve aspect could do so safely inside adventure mode. And then the survival mode came to give thoes who love the pvp aspect a place to play. We all know were that went. But there is two sides to every coin and you need to look at both sides. Enjoy down voteing me im use to it.
---
Thing is according to a friend of mine, who dabbles into this sorta stuff, the fix doesn't take more than  30 seconds to do.
---
I bought the gold paint for "The Action Hero" but it can't be applied.
---
(Re-upload as previous title didn't quite give enough of a description of the post.)
---
For some people, The Outer Worlds
---
Sorry that one slipped my mind. Absolutely dodgy UNLESS you are wearing cav/sent armor (which is why it slipped my mind).
---
That is why I laughed.
---
You win reddit for the day
---
It can be game breaking, but the whole "I 3-shot the Queen" actually takes a fair bit of prep to pull off.  It's not so much that the Iron Fist and Gladiator both apply - that's small potatoes, actually - it's that food buffs get computed weirdly on top of this.
---
If you have 1 rank of each Gladiator, Rank 3 Iron Fist, and a Glowing Meat Steak, you'll only do comparable damage to a Deathclaw Gauntlet.  But as you take more and more food buffs, they seem to apply almost exponentially.  But as a counterbalance, maintaining all of that food is a game in-and-of itself, as some ingredients are difficult to find, and then you need to store them until needed.  It's actually quite tedious, so I don't do it myself.
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply. Any details on the 30 second fix? Is that the fix on Bethesda's side or the player's side.?
---
I thought about buying the skin again but Bethesda tells me to watch patch notes and they will reflect the fix when it happens. Been watching.
---
Gotta love that Jet.
---
PS and XB are relatively close. PC definitely seems like it has the smallest demographic. I guess we will see.
---
Bloody does like 2000+ damage with my lever, depending on sneak and crits. I don't really bother with drugs. I've even stepped away from the lever, and am using a pipe revolver. I don't have all the perk points I need to fully kit it out, but I've wanted a usable pipe weapon  since the beginning. I just like'em. It does a little less than my Lever, but still can 3 shot kill level 65 Scorchbeasts. 
---
Instigating does like 300ish? Not great. 
---
The problem with bloody is dying all the time, but honestly if you're doing a sniper you're killing everything before they really even know you're there. So I do die more often, but not that much more. And I have a steady scrap and stash mentality, so when I do die it literally doesn't matter.
---
Right, I get what you're saying. They've been in the Fallout universe for a longer period of real world time than say, the Responders. But you're confusing chronological time in the real world with chronological time in the game. This game is a prequel. The lore in the base game is very specific -- the BoS and Enclave are all dead in this part of the world at this point in time. It doesn't matter that those factions are among the oldest in *real world* fallout history. If they were to be put into the atomic shop it would literally break the lore of the game. Yes, as you say the BoS and the Enclave are in the lore at current in Appalachia. All dead, or driven off. That's the part you don't seem to be getting of what I'm saying. It's literally a fundamental design problem with the game, that they've backed themselves into a corner with.
---
I actually *do* think they will eventually release BoS and Enclave packs in the atomic shop, but I can't see how that happens until after Wastelanders, when there's actually non-Vault Dweller people from outside the Appalachia region returning and we've advanced further in time.
---
I don't know if you're being deliberately disingenuous or just misreading my posts?
---
You cannot just jump servers and hope to find a NUKED Whitesprings, so yeah it is a big deal. If i go through 20 minutes of my time, ammo and a nuke card so I can enjoy running a NUKED Whitesprings, I'm going to get pissed off if some selfish idiot with a plasma gets ahead of me and totally ruins it.
---
But just to be clear, I'm not going to blame them for the general problem, but I am going to call them out if they decide to ruin the event for me and everyone else. I think that's fair don't you?
---
Yeah edit because i didn't want to be mean
---
i have try , this work perfect , thx a lot
---
Hoarding just in case they need something ever lol. 
---
I did it for a while, but now can't be arsed. Now if I don't have room, and don't have scrip left for the day, I'll just give shit to people.
---
Rest In Pieces in peace
---
This is why you only do this with the help of a friend.
---
hrhr, it is quite easy.
---
Just take those 3\* with the 250dmg resist, that were actually godly if not for the bug. If you have space and time, they'll be quite the moneymaker. Same goes for lead, steel, plastic, you can not have enough of it.

They can't be the same thing as they have separate wiki pages regarding one another.
---
that's more of a melee problem rather than something specific to the meat hook though, isn't it?
---
I'm usually to heavy for power armor it's to slow I only get in it when I have big shit coming at me
---
Huh
---
Could you link to more than one post where this was said? You know, for science?!
---
I would have been on PC. But I had pre.purchased PS4 because of friends who then jumped out of the game.
---
AHH, that could explain the unlootable bags I keep finding at train stations then.
---
I've seen over a dozen reddit posts asking if they're in the game. I damn hope they add them eventually..
---
I don't see the harm in asking since the game had a fucking awful launch.
---
Im sorry to hear but at the same time u needed to learn ur lesson the hard way. As everyone who drops power armor .
---
Shit, I love a good rant, thanks for sharing your fuckup :-)
---
I've gone back to playing NV and FO:4 a few times since starting 76, I find myself picking up all sorts of things that I shouldn't because I forget those games dont use junk the same way.  I leave lots of extra around some of the shops in case people need it.
---
I honestly don't know how to fix it myself. He's Aten-Ra the guy from the bug round ups. You can ask him but I think it's on the player's end.
---
I though I was just the one unfortunate enough to battle an "unkillable" SBQ. In a Scorched Earth event down in the Bog several nights ago, this happened. There were about 10-12 high level combatants of which I was one. After the second "muscle up" of the SBQ we got her to ~ 35-40% health. She would take no further damage. Everyone dropped out of the quest until there was 2 of us left. I put another 2,000 rounds of 50 cal explosive into her and damage never recorded. Time ran out and I did a quick audit on the amount of resources I wasted and decided to stay away from SBQ battles for a while. So have any of you seen this happen? Thx
---
This sounds like it might work well with the way I usually play I don't think I have the stabilized perk, the batteries one I need to upgrade and the other I use for big ass cryptids my best is a 2 star mutant slayers ultracite gat Lazer, which shouldn't be two hard to prime, maybe rough on ammo though lately nobody nukes anything anymore
---
Prove to me it's not a bug then.
---
Just gives us end gamers something new to nuke.
---
Scrap and reconnect the nearest power cable.
---
Sorry for laughing.
---
I feel your pain.Great read.
---
I jumped in the Goo at Westek looking for stuff.I forgot to put the stuff i was alreadycarrying in my Stash first.
---
"Retrieve your dropped Loot"
---
Must have died 20 times before reluctantly calling it a day.I thought the Ultracite Power armour and Rad-X would be okay.
---
I can see that.  I've just never been able to get that many X* weapons.  Most of what I do get is garbage and I just sell them at the shops.  I'm actually in the mode of trying to get all those resources because I do want to build up a nice camp lol.
---
Be sure to make a post about it. I haven't heard of  that being buffed but I obviously wouldn't be surprised.
---
I use a 3* deathclaw guntlet and have every mutation so sue me.. lol and last i checked TSE does just as much damage
---
I will
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten any addictions in the entire time I have played. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it.
---
&gt; Everything not added from Fallout 4 and it's expansions as long as they  can be explained would be nice.  Full suits such as the Coastal Armor or  Cage Armor could be turned into outfits most likely. 
---
Why bother explaining them? Not like they explain other FO4 outfits, like why the Brotherhood has the same field scribe and engineering outfits as they do 200 years later.
---
Oh man just spam my copy/paste at 'em, that shuts em up pretty good
---
Then I went to try out this whole workshop claiming thing. 8 pvp‚Äôrs jumped out of a bush, killed me and took my stuff.....
---
Just kidding, cool story. Nice to hear about the good people too!
---
Wasn't Fallout 4 16* real time? I could be mistaken. I had been operating on the assumption that roughly 16 years will have passed since the servers went live. Although it will be closer to 20 by the time Wastelanders gets here. I have a feeling Bethesda will choose to go with "1 year has passed" which is a little underwhelming. Let's see how it plays out, I guess
---
Not every online game needs a microtransaction shop to thrive.
---
It‚Äôs quite a different game I think
---
Again books written to control you baseless and factless. Gravity doesn't exist the earth is constantly moving upwards.
---
Well, ESO is made by Zenimax online it certainly can't be using the creation engine for ESO. The Creation engine is still terribly optimized and not really made for a multiplayer framework. If Creation Engine was used for both then we should have had text chat in FO76 day one and the friends/party system would have been a lot simpler since ESO already had to go through all that trouble.
---
Not always, I quit a week in to release and just came back. But I‚Äôm already turned off seeing how negative the community still is, and seeing a bunch of issues being brought up online still. I was very close to posting and asking a question like that in here
---
Yeah, you‚Äôve got a point.
---
a base game that should include basic items such as a fridge?
---
Ironic post title since this weeks inside the vault is Bethesda ‚Äúcomplaining‚Äù about the Atomic
---
Shop.  And rightly so, they know they need to come up with ways for to make ‚Äúplayers feel good‚Äù in a system that‚Äôs ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù and for ways that ‚Äúmake the game better.‚Äù
---
Although most of the community (and me) suspect the results may end up being worse, the idea of improving the atom shop in the ways they describe sounds like an improvement, and recognizes that the Atom Shop is not those things today.
---
I hope they can figure it out!
---
Not to be an ass..
---
But was it your nuke, or could it have been the guy that killed the SBQ's nuke ?, just asking ;)
---
And no, you can't 3 hit the sbq and kill it with a meat hook, somewhere between 10 to 20 hit's are needed.
---
I play a lot with HH's, and they usually drop the nuke, then soften her up and let's the rest of us do the rest...
---
Btw, have you seen anyone use a quad assulatron head on here ? there are several really good weapons in the game that can and will kill here fast..
---
I switched from PC gaming to PS4 over the last couple of years. As I've gotten older sitting in a chair for hours just isn't good for me. With the PS4 I can walk around and stand. 
---
It's a sacrifice because of mods &amp; things. But healthier than sitting. For the most part I haven't regretted it other than old games I don't have access to. I wish GOG would platform their library onto PS4!
---
I learned this lesson the hard way. Now when I see a copy of RobCo Fun I drop the holotape if I'm carrying it to get the magazine than pick it up again.
---
I expected this to be honest, a load of people flapping on trying to defend a broken game mechanic. Admit that it's broken. This and the pipe revolver. If those weapons are able to share weapon class perks, why not the missile launcher? Why not the auto grenade launcher? 
---
The deathclaw gauntlet,The boxing glove, knuckles, power fist,
---
The flamer,
---
Modded shotgun versions of the laser, tesla and plasma,
---
What makes the meat hook so special? It isn't. It's bugged.
---
3m bethesda will fix ur lack of DPS soon when they release the update that allows everyone to win even if they didnt touch it. Witch will be grossly over used by noobs who dont belong near craberry bog.
---
I said it, but tbh the sheep-posters who kept making the same suggestions over and over, the ones who wanted Fallout 5, kind of glossed over people who enjoy a survival game like No Man's Sky or Rust. But it's not gonna be like those anymore.
---
We won't ever get to see Bethesda's plans for the original game. There wasn't going to be any vault raids or human NPCs ever, and I'd be fine with that. I'd have liked to see where they took it, as having too much community input can be a bad thing. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the team at Bethesda got as many death threats as Sean Murray, so of course the team would let a festering community like that have full reign over the direction of the game just to get it to stop. No one should have to deal with that, but I'm prepared to eat these downvotes my guys
---
Thanks for the tldr. It made up for the time spent reading.
---
Hunt Scorch Beasts.
---
Any?
---
I don't really play pvp, no matter what I can unload on somebody I always get taken out in a hit or 2
---
They always drop some body part that breaks down to ultracite. More so with Queen Fights.
---
That last bit is a little uncalled for if taken wrong. I'm not saying this Fallout76 community. I mean the gaming community in general. I'm sure a lot of you know how hate fueled it is
---
I am so freaking dumb I've been getting so much parts from the scorchbeast and I never knew that thank you

I would say personal enjoyment is subjective. But quality of a game can be determined by ratings and sales numbers. 
---
I just returned to play after quitting a week from release because I want to give it another try and get my money‚Äôs worth.  Carry weight is still an issue for me but I‚Äôm enjoying it a little, hopefully it doesn‚Äôt get dry the farther I get in to the main quest and I can keep it going when they add NPCs
---
Understandable but all I have is caps, unless there's something more common that you're looking for. How about 500 caps for 5 flux?
---
Had a similar issue around the bandit camp near top of the world, just south of the train station. Many of the barricades were LOD models with very poor resolution textures.
---
If you wait about 8 hours the game will stop adding people to your server and youll eventually be left a lone
---
Alright, to be fair, yes, some people go into Monster Mash completely clueless. Actually, people go into all kinds of events totally clueless. I guess I would just hope they could understand the simple concept of an arena battle.
---
I saw the same at Pleasant Valley Station a few weeks ago but they were literally blowing out the rooftop and overflowing from the bathroom. I picked up several hundred and and stored them on a mule. 
---
If Bethesda wants them back, they are available. I stay at max caps anyway so was not tempted in the least to sell them. Believed it to be the honorable thing to do realizing it was indeed a glitch.
---
However, after reading this post I think i'll put them in a pile and shoot from a distance and see what happens. That sounds like fun. If I get around to doing it, I'll post a pic. 
---
They will almost certainly run far better than the main servers. I mean, even when you do the thing to get an empty server it runs way better
---
it's more like you're complaining about a non-issue based on the misguided notion that meat hooks are oneshooting the Queen. they're not. a fully specced one outdamages a DCG, yes, but not by much.
---
plus you either have to give up on incisor or martial artist. or gladiator/iron fist, which defeats the purpose of a meat hook in the first place.
---
Take a bunch of workshops west of Savage divide and do the retake events
---
How come?
---
It works if you have it installed but it doesn't work if you're adding it to a new piece of combat armor.
---
Well that's fine with me, there's more to scorched earth than just trying kill the queen faster than anyone else.
---
Nice man
---
BETHESDA PLS

As a pretty much daily player I ***legendarily feel your pain collecting things that took a lot of work and with me many times my bag would get stuck in part of the scenary just out of my reach being forced to log off and cry just to start over another day,or I'll get killed and before I respawn I get booted from the server, sometimes your day is gonna be fucked in 76, and just know at some point it'll probably be worse
---
I love that place!!  One of my favorite spots in the game.
---
Yeah, that sucked.
---
FYI, paper bag disappear if you leave the server and no one is around it.
---
I also Learned that one the hard way.
---
Always use a world container or  just buy a second copy of the game and mule your stuff the safe way.
---
even potato computer can run two instances of this game at same time with low fps.
---
They didn't plan on it, they said onstage that their original plan didn't go over like they wanted and so they decided to give the community what it wanted. Now what most people don't take into account is that more than likely most of the people posting criticism were part of an Astroturf campaign, or at least were parroting others and saying "yeah ofc this will fix it!" But no most of the additions have been community suggestions, except Sheepsquatch Questline, Pioneer Scouts, and Faschnacht
---
Kudos for acknowledging my point that I probably did not communicate well enough in my first post. 
---
100% agree with you. I would hope as well but don't always have the most faith in humanity.
---
Thank you!
---
Having login issues rn but shoot me a msg on XB1 and I'll let you know when I'm on 76 - GT is QuasarSilva
---
I doubt they're going to change it. You might have a server to yourself, and still only have the tiny BL. 
---
My hope is they'll upgrade the limits in Adventure mode soon. They upped everyone's stash months ago, and honestly even on my crappy internet, the servers have been more stable than ever in the last few patches. I think they can up things again a bit and see if it adversely effect the servers or not.
---
Eh, they only added them because most people didn't realize this game was a different genre and the same level of difference in 3&amp;4 as ESO and Skyrim. People kept asking for Fallout 5, and so they're trying to give us Fallout 5 lite. Still won't be enough to appease those who are already hateful in their critiques
---
Bloodied explosive is great for a Sniper build, when there is distance between you and your [targets.You](https://targets.You) can do insane amounts of damage with the right Perk Cards/Chems.
---
Others will disagree. I personally dont think Bloodied is suitable for close arm combat.
---
Some of the Ghoul Slaps at Whitsepring hit hard,and will kill you running with low [health.You](https://health.You) will almost certainly insta- die running in to a P v P situation with bloodied
---
I run only with a Bloodied for the Sniper.Before switching to Full Health and Melee.
---
Most of the time, the mole guys Will kill him for you and your job Will be looting the body. Try using a different server if you see everyone Is really high level, because if you are 23 and everyone else is 40, well... That's a tougher fight.
---
Its all there in the first true book about the earths creation..the bible. These modern day scientist are tricking you into believing the earth isn't 8000 years old. They are servants of satan who controls humans via vaccinations and chemtrails  via the illuminati Rothschilds who shot Kennedy, faked the moon landings with the help of Bigfoot and run the globe earth organization from within a giant pyramid hidden under the Hoover dam...RESEARCH FLAT EARTH GLOBETARD!
---
No it wasnt my nuke. The SBQ was just an example of how silly and broken this weapon is though.
---
See the great thing about having two ps4s and two copys of the game, is not having to deal with shit like this lol
---
graykee you should go play ESO were players are requiered to Pay $120,00 usd just for a in game home. Or play skyrim or fo4 were the creation club charges $$$ for mods. Or play Skyforge its free to play but you need to pay $30,00 + to get a toon. Nothing is free everything costs money. And it costs bethesda alot of money to run the servers were useing every day.
---
if it takes away from my max stash weight, you can bet your shiny metal ass, I'll not give ammo out for free.
---
I need more stash with that my first 24 turn ins at least 20 were keepers
---
The question is will workshops be persistent. If so they have a MUUUCH larger build budget than camps. You could build a town at Abandoned Bog Town or Wade Airport
---
I can‚Äôt really blame them. Their vampire of an investor is holding Zenimax by the balls. They really needed that money back then and I‚Äôm sure they weren‚Äôt expecting to be hounded for exceptional daily/weekly profits when they make videogames that takes months and years to release.
---
Investment companies like Providence Equity continue to forget what type of companies they invest in. Only interested in the numbers, not the logistics.
---
Developers have been creatively restricted by the demand for more routine profit and Providence‚Äôs incredibly blackmail-y vampire business tactics are a large part to blame
---
It's really more comments, but yeah I said it a lot. They just needed to give us more to do, not a whole new game. Some of the demands were ridiculous
---
Repair kits work great in a pinch like during the SBQ.
---
You go to the weapons bench and find out youre short 1 spring.
---
I'm sorry but did where did you read that it didn't happen on a fallout server? Seriously man just give up, someone did stupid shit, weirded me out so I wanted to know if anyone else had weird interactions, not Tedtalk opinions from people who most definitely were not there to witness. People don't approach me in public, so no, this didn't happen in a grocery store much to your chagrin
---
They all ran into my line of fire as i was unloading ultracite rounds into the queens face.
---
One day after my PlayStation Plus membership expires.  Thanks Bethesda for crap timing.
---
no bethseda quite literally said they would never cross the line and keep to cosmetics only, a lot of people, myself included bought it at that promise.
---
Also if you are experiencing this you could ask for a refund. You welcome.
---
Damn you put all their conspiracies into one paragraph. It looks even crazier put together like that lol. Damn us luciferians for not believing in sky wizards
---
If you're ever looking to do one and on XB1 I run a brotherhood style crew and we're looking for new members. Even if not we're setting up a RP private server when they drop
---
The wing fragments and bones from scorchedbeasts and the hardened mass from nuke zone mobs all yield ultracite when scrapped but hardened mass you have to scrap manually scrap all junk dosen't scrap it
---
I definitely will if it's not fixed by the next patch.
---
I haven't actually played gta online but I bet it's that crazy
---
Well I can certainly see that some people may ask that question if they played the game at the start and decided to stop. They would check back on it occasionally and they would see the big PvE content added to the game in the form of the scouts and vault raids didn't release well and still aren't really worth it. 
---
So they would have good reason to be curious if things are being well received yet by a majority of the playerbase. Especially when the big filler that's advertised for the game until the Halloween event comes out is to kill millions of a specific type of enemy in order to get double the chances at an rng machine.
---
Then they see the announcement that the biggest update that's supposed to overhaul the game is going to be delayed for most likely another five months. Meanwhile the atomic shop is going to get more convenience items that the community originally requested to be earned through actual gameplay events or by killing enemies. 
---
Instead they're being sold on the atomic shop when what should have been sold were just skins for the earned items. That "convenience" is only needed because Bethesda deliberately implemented such grind designs into the game in the first place and still have yet to remove or fix them properly.
---
I'd say players have good reason to ask such a question when Bethesda has mistreated the playerbase for this game since the start in treating them like beta testers and cash cows.
---
This did help! The camera's moving a lot more smoothly now, I'm surprised how much better this is. Thanks!
---
Beside i'm sorry for the lost bag...
---
**"Tldr; took a shit in my hands and clapped."**
---
I lost it there. Lmao
---
Best tldr i've seen in a while.
---
I suggested this in another post.
---
The most annoying thing is they probably gave better loot than the queen.
---
Much quicker bud, hit Blackwater mine, pick up everything from the corpses. Scrap everything with scrapper on, easy hundreds of steel in 20 mins or less
---
Used to get all the steel you'd ever need in a day of ammo making by running uranium fever, scrapping the guns with scrapper perk üëåüëåüëåüëå Problems there now, between scarcity and one shotting.
---
If ur gonna take the steel plant, make sure you Rob all the weapons and scrapper perk that mess!
---
Was just about to say this lol
---
Then I‚Äôll count that as at least two votes yesüòâ
---
Yeah you've gotta loot em while they're disintegrating, even your own goo piles have about a 1% chance of being immediately empty
---
Yep, it needs sorted. Energy weapons have been lagging behind for a while along with this bug that even affects non-users. Got a Bloodied Plasma Rifle recently and it's still not as powerful as any other ballistic rifle, and can't be silenced
---
A great way to collect steel that my friends and I do is go to an area or event with enemies that drop lots of guns, collect the guns, equip the Scrapper perk, scrap guns, and you‚Äôll be swimming in steel in no time.
---
Edit: typo and a few words
---
Look for a better server
---
Damn, my eyes! I get a headache with this FOV -.-
---
I don‚Äôt need it. They keep pushing product in the store and we can ask people in game. It‚Äôs obvious it works because they haven‚Äôt had to stop like Battlefront did with loot boxes. Real outcry results in change. 10% whining is a drop in the bucket.
---
You require making multiple assumptions. I don‚Äôt. The store is still there. New products get added regularly. They wouldn‚Äôt keep adding things if no one bought anything, it‚Äôs just business. They have to make money to justify continuing work.
---
It‚Äôs been the same excuse the minority has made for years. 5k players in Total Annihilation insisted the Arm faction was OP, but more than 100k actively played. You cannot base opinions on a subreddit or a forum. If we want to know what the player base really thinks we would have to ask everyone. Most players simply don‚Äôt bother going to forums for ANY game.
---
Half the topics in this sub are complaints. For C‚ÄôThulhu‚Äôs sake, this sub had a melt down over that stupid bag.
---
It will have moved you if it wasn't okay. If it's still there then you're good. Do you need to know about any other additions? I have a copy/paste available. A lot of users find it helpful
---
If you really are lvl 88 I would keep that character, yes there's a massive amount of new content but most of it is preferably better to do with a high lvl character. And about the house, there's always a new spot that will call your attention, look around the beautiful post nuclear Appalachia and seek the best spot, if you think you're good were you are, just do some new stuff to your base, that never comes bad.
---
Enjoy the game because we're about to see great changes with wastelanders, I know it's delayed but I have faith that on maybe 20th January 2020 we'll be able to say hi to our npc folks.
---
I dont enjoy a super zoomed in small FOV view. Sorry I guess.
---
You're a junker on ps4? Well whenever you want you can play with me, my name is on the post. Have a wonderful day/night/afternoon.
---
No one give time to this guy. He has nothing better to do than troll lol
---
You have to be out of combat for it to heal you
---
That is an option but in my opinion not a very good one considering you cant get a legendary version.
---
Huntersville is great for that - there's a workbench in a trailer near the north end, so you can scrap quick when you're encumbered.  Hop servers once or twice and you'll have all the steel you can handle.
---
It's not the biggest spot, but it's not hard.  Super mutants have a lot of guns.
---
I wouldn't mind reading it if it's not any trouble. I know there's a lot of stuff but I'm not really sure where to get started.
---
You have to be hidden for it to heal you. It also reduces all chem effects (including stims) by 55%

---
Thanks I like that idea, but as I said, I don't like to grind so I'll just run huntersville once. Even with that I can work, I just need ammo and repair.
---
Awesome, thanks so much :) I'm free all day so let me know and I'll hop on and we can meet up
---
I don't know. I've made 13k in caps today selling bulked junk, nuka colas, ammo, drugs, stims, legendaries from Watoga, bobble heads, magazines and assorted things. Seems ok to me. Ymmv
---
I got you my guy, no trouble. It's just the content updates, none of the QoL stuff. There's been some interesting changes with those, including reworking the interiors of multiple locations
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
Max caps/trade only
---
Thanks for the info, though what would you say perk card wise in terms of necessity‚Äôs since I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of points available
---
Lost Carl the deathclaw bc of this :(
---
I use my gf account and just run F76 in two programs and just alt tab between them. My one character is my mule and populated area player vendor in whitesprings and my other main has a fire watch tower on the highest point on the map.
---
If you got a friend with a mule soon as you get some have him log in take it and log off, spoils slower if offline
---
Max caps like 30k or more? Cause someone said its like 75k-150k if you find the right person. I have 2 Plans so that would be nice lmao
---
And got your data stolen as a result? /s
---
Glassed cavern is probably the best but every fissure sure has nodes around them too. AMS headquarters in Watoga also has a decent amount of ultracite scrap throughout it.
---
That's why I said /trade only. Someone probably won't put down that many caps, but they would trade for something that is valued at that 75-150k price. Hell you could probably get caps *and* something valued at that price since most of PC's trade items are dupes
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I ain't got no friends and I dont have any mules either. Have to find another way I guess.
---
Just pick any locations that are lousy with Super Mutants‚ÄîGrafton Steel, WestTek, Huntersville, NIRA, the prison‚Äîkill them and scrap their guns with the scrapper perk on. You‚Äôll have more than you know what to do with in no time. Each Assault Rifle nets like 20 steel with the perk on.
---
damn, nice
---
Depends on chest piece. Sometimes you can learn it by scrapping multiple pieces of the item.
---
You are welcome bud, haha. U learn different things as u go on, but don't forget the scrapper perk. Makes a big difference
---
It's way more than 30k check old posts and offers. You can pretty much get what you want from the right buyer. Or you can give it to me and have a friend for life.
---
Feel like if Bethesdas game wasn't a shit pile and they supported it the way one would expect from a multi million dollar studio people wouldn't have been crying for npcs. 
---
It didn't feel like they had a vision to deliver on. It felt like they had jumped on the games service model to keep people invested whilst they waited for starfield and tes.
---
I really think wastelanders will only be a positive, if they even have the capacity to launch something without issue.
---
The game knows you're looking for it so it purposefully acts this way.  Every time I go out looking for something specific, I never find it.
---
well, im an asshole i don't need friends :P
---
Right?! Screw em :)
---
I just started using gun-fu and adrenaline recently and my goodness you can get some big numbers clearing mobs
---
greed mostly
---
Handmade is really good
---
Judging from the way they implemented vault raids it makes me think these won't go over well with the community. People were mad that the vault raids weren't what they expected. The screenshots look really good for Wastelanders though!
---
Two shot has lower accuracy AFAIK
---
I found out the hard way as well with the Wastelad holotape. Putting the 1st copy in my stash did the trick.
---
I drink and I know things though.
---
Wym
---
Funny i get a downvote because its absolutely true. Whoever down voted isnt very smart..although if your under lvl 50 the drops will be too. But you getter better drops with higher charisma and luck
---
Isn't there a power armor frame in the middle surrounded by dead raiders?
---
i do the same hehe
---
When you shoot a two shot weapon the chance of you actually getting more than 100% damage is lower
---
Two shot has horrible accuracy and needs both projectiles to hit or it only does half damage so it‚Äôs not really sought after.
---
5.56 had the same value as caps, almost always 1:1, and has no limit. So it's basically just caps with no max
---
Depends on what you're doing.
---
I generally run with an instigating handmade, everything dies in 1-2 shots when I'm farming, and I rarely have to repair.  With a sniper, with instigating you're into serious overkill territory, 1 shot is always enough.
---
For harder fights or SBQ, neither is ideal, but 2 shot is an improvement over instigating (since instigating doesn't really apply, or only once).  You're better off with furious or bloodied or a few other prefixes for that.
---
There‚Äôs ALWAYS gonna be that guy to one hit the legendary. If it aint the meathook it‚Äôll be something else. There‚Äôs no sense getting all bent about it. You can‚Äôt nerf human nature.
---
I agree since the Nerf to TSE people have lost faith in 2shot.  I'd rather have the 30% evertime. The instagating prefix is good for one shot sniper builds as well as sneak melee. It's useless on heaveyguns.
---
A lot of rifle builds and you can actually use them unlike caps. I take 5mm rounds or 50 cal rounds instead 50 cal rounds
---
That‚Äôs near top of the world... it was their arena. I‚Äôd like to see a dedicated location with different forms of cover and multi story firing positions...
---
Do it during prime u.s time, thatsbyour best shot. What system are you on? I can help if its ps4
---
So if you‚Äôre on a sport team, and get benched halfway into the championship game and don‚Äôt play at the end buzzer, you shouldn‚Äôt get the championship ring? I don‚Äôt think you understand teamwork and shared reward.
---
Enclave vendor in Whitespring bunker
---
It is always a crap shot. I have seen times where the whole server joins and times where the guy stands there alone.
---
I am on PS4. He is pretty strong right?
---
Yikes
---
I feel like things can differ from expectations and still be recieved well providing they're good. The vault raids were gash, and even when running smoothly they're just kinda meh at best.
---
I hit level 50 with a full set of ultracite and felt like a god. I always feel humbled when a level 20 in RD pops me in one shot.
---
Sure seemed that way. I was going nuts. Server hopping to spawn scorchbeasts only to not get any meat from them. Wasted so many bullets, fml.
---
Fence-sitters at V9 can make this happen. This is why I nuke so that the Overgrown Sundew Grove is left out while V9 is in the nuke zone.
---
I still can‚Äôt find one
---
Before you activate it i would suggest you look at the map and see if there are higher level players on your server if there is not that many just server hop until you find a server with more high level players then activate it.
---
Didn't think that would qualify it.
---
Yeah that makes no sense.  556 is a popular ammo and it trades at almost a 1:1 conversion for caps.  So people use it to circumvent the 30k cap limit.  How is this greed?
---
Yeah but we can do it with a few people who know what to do. I'll be in in about  6-7 hours.
---
That is an understatement. In my opinion, it‚Äôs the hardest event. I‚Äôve not successfully completed in about 6-7 attempts.
---
Cosmetic doesn‚Äôt give any advantage, utility items do. That‚Äôs the whole point of a utility item is to pay irl money to get a benefit that helps the player. And just saying no that‚Äôs stupid is childish when you‚Äôre not willing to make a mature argument.
---
But... why didn‚Äôt you just store them in your mule‚Äôs stash? How would marsupial have helped you? It‚Äôs only a mere extra 20lbs of carry weight. 
---
Your misfortune has given me much mirth, but I‚Äôm confused.
---
Scan around the map and look for level 100+ players before you launch. Make sure nothing big is going on like Project Paradise or Scorched Earth (I suspect the best time is soon after a Scorched Earth, but opinions may vary). There is a ten minute window from the time you insert the card to when you have to actually recall the robot. Use that time to let other players travel to the event and get set up for it. If there is any way you can get a team together and decide responsibilities beforehand, your event will likely be more successful.
---
Not alot of people can hold alot of caps and there is a demand for 556 at 1c each, so it's a good way of holding cap value in an item that's relatively light
---
Money is what makes the world go round in darkness
---
Good idea
---
My buddy and I were playing when the event popped up recently. Monitored it closely and only two players showed. No thanks!
---
people will likely show up.. if they help or not is another story
---
correct
---
I can‚Äôt wait that long sorry
---
In theroy it also stops spoiling if you drop it or put in a container, risky but its something
---
Worth a shot I guess when and if I get in the mood to farm them.
---
Np, good luck. Remember, someone has to take pylons and other attack.
---
Did a lot of trades in fallout so ended up with lots of god tier weapons get boring after a while. But yer reddead is a much more even playing field and not as toxic as I thought it would be
---
Instigating
---
Now we need a Bethesda replied and we‚Äôre set
---
They won‚Äôt.
---
naw game is still shit.
---
This or buy from a player who can make them.
---
Why is it better than F especially. Im using a 2* TSE lever and I'm afraid I'll suddenly be doing  half damage or much lower damage.
---
Don't think there's a guaranteed spawn for plasma.
---
Try Robo Research, elevator up and there's a shelf on the left that spawns energy guns.
---
Would not dissaprove but it needs to be higher than that.
---
&gt;I'm aware there is no new info
---
Anything posted is either wishful thinking or fearmongering.
---
Deadass tons of accounts are getting stolen and sold on the Russian servers for dummy low right now. Saw a sight the other night selling bulk account bundles for like 1$ per account. 
---
Edit: can provide link if requested, just can‚Äôt post it here for obv. Reasons.
---
Planned for "early" 2020.

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again
---
Had a convo on here a few days ago about acid farming.  One person was saying cave crickets whereas I was saying Hemlock Homes.  I went on how I haven't seen a cave cricket in almost four months because I always went looking for them.  Yesterday when I was just running around, I came upon six of them, when I didn't need the acid lol
---
Wrong analogy; it doesn't work that way. NW matches are all independent of other matches. You're not in a tournament, with future matches being dependent upon prior matches. So no...it is _you_ who does not understand.
---
I  use a 2\* IE and with the right perks you can one shot pretty much everything.
---
I have full demo and full rifleman. Should that be good?
---
Well rifle perks of course. I'd have to look when I get home for other ones.
---
Cat backpack???
---
Sooooo. It took me 3 months but I got round to a map of that. [Here you go :)](https://i.imgur.com/EE4OAhe.jpg)
---
It was a limited time option when they first introduced the space sci-fi items, and it hasn't made a return yet.
---
Okay bud, keep on being you. You probably think you got everywhere in life all on your own. Cheers!
---
Nah, peasants are the ones fighting in the ring.
---
yes! a pebbles backpack, never seen it till someone rolled up with it
---
that sucks /: i never seen it or i totally would‚Äôve gotten it
---
Yes, also you may want to equip covert ops and adrenaline.
---
Iv been having the same problem with tryin to apply camo paint to my combat armor. I think its kinda ironic that they put so much time and effort into the atom shop items rather than fixing the bugs in the main game that theyre now overlooking the bugs they have coming from the atom shop. Hey guys come and spend your hard earned caps or actual money spent on caps in the atom shop... the items arent guaranteed to work but we will still accept all the money you spend.. fuckin greedy assholes
---
You can use the Butcher's Bounty perk to 'search' for extra meat on them. With the perk leveled up all the way sometimes you get multiples when you search. Always useful when you're looking for a specific kind of meat.
---
That's your opinion. To each their own.
---
I had it on, it did nothing. Thought maybe it didn't work on scorchbeast.
---
Sick, guess I missed that
---
*atoms not caps, my bad
---
Did you press the button for it before you looted it? It's Y on xbox. I'm not sure if you're on pc.
---
Edit: It definitely does work on scorchbeast. I did it when I was looking for meat for one of the possum challenges.
---
Will be fixed 2020.
---
I've never had to press any buttons when I was farming brahmin meat. Some had extra some didn't.
---
This is a fantastic idea.
---
So were plans dropped for the mask?
---
I'll be on in 20 mins if you want a hand
---
Aim for the legs. Cripple those bastards.
---
For perks like Butcher's Bounty and Can Do, you need to manually search when you're looking at the container/corpse to get your extra stuff. There should be a search option when you have it equipped.
---
It wasn't like that at launch. Forget what patch it started but it's been that way for awhile. Once she goes into that fly past watoga mode and then flys back, she heads off the map.
---
Even if you kill her on her on the way back from the long nw to se flight (done it once), she turns green and disintegrates like she's been turned to goo. There's no meat pile either. It happens when she's shot a lot in the air by a bunch of guys who don't know about it. Cripple her on the ground after the health spike and don't let up.
---
My characters normally have roughly 400/800 in their stash. This weekend they‚Äôre all at 750+ just from excess legendaries. The struggle is real.
---
the 2 options I could see is have a generic version like the backpack and a custom skin version that costs atoms
---
alternative would be to make it free the first month as a thanks for playing deal
---
If i can. I run split between crafting and rifle/melee. I definitely need to make a more specialized build.
---
But is it good yet?
---
I've also seen times when half of the server shows up and somehow still manages to fail the event.
---
FML
---
Also true
---
Where did they quite literally say this? And that was the reason you bought the game? I smell an exaggeration.
---
I've been selling legendaries as I get them.  I just started to try and farm them.  More or less just looking for something I want to keep but I keep getting sickles or broadsiders.  Nothing I care to keep lol
---
Why would you sell something you can turn into scrip?
---
Not everything can be solved with double XP. We need content. 
---
Also I just got back on my high level after a while of low level play, and my camp is gone
---
Nice.. I take it was from way back?
---
In the meantime, if you are on PC I highly recommend the Glowing Meat Piles mod.
---
It's especially handy in the cranbog where red meat piles are practically camouflaged in the reddish grass.
---
Is it good if game breaking glitches and debilitating desync was a problem for my enjoyment of the game?
---
Yes. Grip makes it a pistol, stock makes it a rifle.
---
Do not tell me not to eat the crunchy snack rope
---
They could be level 500, if they dont fix the AI it doesn't matter.
---
You must have a ton of .33 and .44 ammo then cuz that shit is worthless.
---
Dont legendaries automatically turn into script if you use the machine? That's what the weird chime sound is I thought.  You get he same chime at normal shops.
---
Uhhh...no disagreeing but since we‚Äôre not getting new content, ya know what I mean?  I‚Äôd rather have new content that works well. 
---
Also, I could make negitive upvote bait posts, but that doesn‚Äôt interest me
---
But bend tunnel and the scrapper perk on one run through of it I‚Äôll have 600+steel
---
Thanx,i found an b ffr one but im b commando build.put it up for sale but no takers so gonna try it out myself,maybe its a fun gunüëçüèø
---
Any clue when the actual drop day is? I know they said thus week, just curious if anyone knows when it might actually happen.
---
Did you take a pic?  Tried to kill that mothman for the badge and he was immortal at that time.
---
I have a ie handmade, the problem is the explosion ruins the insti effect for all the mobs around the target. I don't like the lever, not enough bullets and no perf mag. Might as well carry a 50 sniper rifle with a perf mag. Then of course the handmade.
---
Anti armor vampires two shot and a handmade is your best bet weapon wise furious too but it‚Äôs kind of weak imo
---
That's a great roll :) you'll have plenty of fun for sure with the gun!
---
It depends on the weapon. For heavy guns, definitely take Two Shot. For rifles, Instigating is probably better‚Äîprimarily because of the accuracy penalty on Two Shot. This is doubly true if you‚Äôre primarily a solo player, as the vast majority of enemies you encounter will be at full health.
---
I think its going to be pretty generic with few setting letting change occur at the beginning. Ideally as they persist this will be more thought out.
---
Check the server, see if it has a good number of high level players (level 50 min) and check for nuke zones. If people are busy doing something else, they won't help. But most if the Time, three, four or More Will show up.
---

---
I smell a Shill
---
I think I did, but it might not have saved, but yeah I just found a random wise mothman, snuck up on it and killed it. But it's corpse was still there
---
How much of your own money would you spend on all this ‚ÄúI would do‚Äù stuff?
---
adrenaline, gun-fu, and grim reapers Sprint. throw in quick hands and it can get crazy
---
Or you just don‚Äôt list it and you don‚Äôt pick it up/drop what you have at a train station why would I waste stash space giving away free stuff?
---
Another idea that comes to mind are seasonal events that have human npcs rather robots. Seasonal characters that come and go through the year. This would draw in people to play when there‚Äôs a limited time only. anyways i‚Äôll be playing Outer Worlds until then.
---
[Yes](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/102)
---
I can agree with this that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a heavy build rifleman didn‚Äôt look as appealing to me when I when I was a lower level and it‚Äôs not efficient for sbq fights
---
Now that you can't drop bags, it's not bad. I still see bag thief's though run to the dead guys. You can see the excitement in their mouse lol Carry a nuke mine to lay on the imposters body for the bloodied if you want bags.
---
1+1 Is not 2 in this game. And instigating gets the job done once you specialize. 200 + 100 Is better than 130 + 130 + 130. It's cheaper and faster.
---
Sniper go bloody. You are back far enough most of the time you wont actually die all that much and you can get by with less gear and perks. Bloody melee not so much in my experience ... you have to pay far more attention.
---
What level are you? And what damage output are you looking like? 
---
Generally I hit the fissure sites throughout the cranberry bog, then end after the glass cavern. Takes less than an hour, although I am bloodied. Most of the time I'm just waiting for the sob to land.
---
Had it happen a few times actually. After she regenerated health the bar would drop at an appropriate pace then just stop. Eventually people left because they also noticed nothing was happening. It is a bummer when that happens. One time she had less than a quarter health and just could t get it to move.
---
My server has a SBQ but after that gladly
---
If you don‚Äôt mind smelting and have Excavator PA, there are about a dozen iron ore spots at Hornwright Testing Site 3 in the Ash Heap. They are on the cliff immediately to your left if you FT there.  You can walk away with about 100 iron ore, which will turn into 250 steel (more if you have the Super Duper perk).
---
I've started it twice and no one showed. Server hopped til I seen enough higher levels too. Now I'll just wait for someone else to do it.
---
Oh ok
---
&gt;some
---
rumor has it that aqua boy will keep you alive in that
---
Yeah, GTA griefers get wrecked fast. Those red dots really help decipher who is a dick and who isn't.
---
Not rude at all. I did, it‚Äôs an old Reddit joke üòÑ
---
It should of been made single player with multiplayer scaling available if you wanted to play with friends.
---
Otherwise keep the wv world and make it fallout 3 or 4 style game.  Full of npc and a big main quest with side quests available.
---
The difference between raiders and responders
---
With private servers coming, this would be a nice added incentive for those of us seriously considering the fee.
---
I would go for QFFR, best one for various scenarios, playing alone, with friends and vs mobs.
---
I don't want to guess.
---
If you're on PC, Nexusmods has a mod for that which works really well: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
I'm using it myself and wouldn't want to play the game without it. I hope Bethesda's own solution will be at least as good as this.
---
I'm level 82 and have no issues solo'ing scorchbeasts. I'm guessing part of my problem was rng and not properly searching with bountiful meat or whatever it's called.
---
Cant you just mod it with buttstock and auto mod so it will work with commando?
---
Private server Diamond City!
---
Cool, psn same as here?
---
That was a long time ago. Its been patched since then.
---
Before they made a ton of mods and plans available at the vendors, I used to server jump and found enclave plasma mods at the Harper's Ferry vendor bot. It was listed as Enclave plasma too, not just plasma. Since the update that made vendors sell tons of plans and mods came out though I dont know if he still sells Enclave Plasma mods. I cant find High Tech light plans at vendors at all, and past threads listed said they used to sell them. 
---
You're probably better off just server hopping and checking modus for the enclave plasma you're trying to mod for. Or grinding enclave events for it. That's how I got my enclave plasma with the sniper barrel mod with reflex sight, no scope.
---
My medic flamer is just insanely useless lol
---
Just takes time really. Be sure to press the search button in the future. 
---
What are you looking for meat from sb for anyways? Got a specific buff food in mind?
---
Didn't know that, I'll have to keep that in mind next time the challenge rolls around
---
Just trying to complete a Tadpole World Challenge, lol
---
Low health or high?
---
Depending on armor I like welded rebar, emergency protocols or motion assist servos.
---
A TSE lmg is basically a heavy weapon shotgun. Same spread, same range, much better damage, and ultracite .308 is undoubtedly easier to produce than shotgun shells.
---
A flechette harpoon gun is also very shotgun-like.
---
Because capitalism prevails unanimously. This includes post-apocalyptic MMORPG‚Äôs.
---
Rifle, is that you?
---
Nah they disappear for me sometimes, I‚Äôll be at whitesprings and I‚Äôd have just killed a legendary, gone over to it, and the body just disappears in front of me. It sucks too.
---
Ahhh, I thought you mightve been looking for the roast that takes multiple pieces.
---
Welcome to the wasteland, bitch.
---
I server hop Welch and gather all guns and scrap them at the benches nearby. I can VATS 80% of the enemies from the spawn when I hop back in a server. 
---
You can get that back in less than an hour including loading screens.
---
Yeah, I just want self host because latency is TERRIBLE in Brazil. Makes the game barely playable. That's why I haven't played FO76 for about 8 months.
---
Not everyone who gets tired of whiney fanbases is a shill. And there's a big difference between "pay to win" and "nice to haves".
---
What would you say for perk cards if I went bloodied?
---
My biggest most ambitious had I made this game....1:1 scaling and cloud gaming to handle it.  I seriously want a game that literally takes days or weeks real time to cross the map on foot. And this is while being a post apocalyptic style game.
---
Have they added a story with branching paths, karma system, and an awesome narrative like New Vegas?
---
Have they added more to the endgame to keep players invested? 
---
Have they added more to CAMP and Stash sizes yet? 
---
Have they stopped lying and forcing Macrotransactions where they don't belong? 
---
If answered no to any/all of these, then I'm continuing to not play.
---
You'd be naive to see that they have been starting off small and are expanding on pay-to-win mechanics it started with repair kits now we have NPCs collecting things for us. And frankly I'm getting tired of whiners whining about whining while excusing poor behavior in he development. You probably excused their bullshit with the collectors bag too
---
Yeah just 2 zs
---
That was NV, Rex, I think from the leader of The Kings.
---
More money than Bethesda put into it which some how was a lot of money for a game like this. If we are talking about a Bethesda budget, It would probably be at least a lot more than fallout 4‚Äôs budget plus the money that it would take to make it a real multiplayer game centered around fallout. Bethesda lost a lot of money by making the game and is barely gaining more from the atomic shop. Most of the money would go into the engine, the imployment, and everything else. And if this game that I made up where to be successful and run all day everyday, it would be even more money to keep it online.
---
Country?
---
Trade only. 30k for plasma grenade plan is a goddamn steal. Its highway robbery. Trade only. You could have a nice pick of legacies in a trade with that plan. Make you feel like that scene in boondock saints when they shop at the armory
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying anything with my camp disappearing. I genuinely wonder where it went. I needed to go to it.
---
The only way is to 3rd person :(
---
As a chameleon player from the beginning of the game i don't agree with you, at all. It makes perfect sense that the sight on your invisible gun would be invisible as well. Just practice with it more.
---
Think freddie is a girl. I guess shoot her xD Or find the guy who radiated the mine, that would be a better kill.
---
The bag was on the roof of a barn out of reach.  His other character didnt have the marsupial mutation to be able to jump on the roof to retrieve the bag, which makes this story funny as heck.
---
Well thank you for responding, that was my only question. I just wanted to make sure you knew that all these things cost lots of money.
---
Yeah you might have to crouch and stay hidden to get out of combat for those harder to find enemies if you get low health and enemies are still around
---
Someone just activated it on my server so 2 in a row
---
Or make a lfg if that is a thing on ps4.on xbox it is
---
Ah. Ok. It was tldr.... lol
---
THANK YOU KIND SIR
---
While that would be awesome, they need to buff shotguns in the first place imo. I use a bloodied plasma flamer for close range ghouls and that's super effective
---
What a shame
---
You wanna have one of my plans?
---
Yep. You got me pegged alright.
---
I better not mention this to her, it will just upset her.
---
Love this
---
The only obnoxious thing is that the answer is still "NO".
---
Legendary Enclave Plasma guns. Then my Plasma collection would be complete. No point using the base enclave plasma right now.
---
BOOMBOOMBOOM
---
Lead/Acid south of South Mountain Lookout, at edge of tree line on the map.

---
Lead/Junk east of Black Bear Lodge.
---
Hey dude, I actually buy some miracle was just able to hit white springs during a nuke and collect all the floor I needed. So thank you so much for your help, but my jetpack is complete üòä
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs meant to cloak everything
---
Text chat, guilds, faction that you can actually join, faction pvp, mutations with graphical representations, cosmetics that don't include the entire rainbow of tire colors and instead a few dozen handmade skins, a way to completely opt out of pvp, stairs that snap right. There is more but I'm tired now.
---
if you are talking about them spawning at the top of the cliff and falling off and dying that had happened since beta just depends where you stand to make them spawn in
---
I do enjoy watching them do that, cracks me up
---
All good and well my friend
---
It would probably cause some lag so why not only make it where they keep their glow until someone takes the legendary item
---
It is. But considering release and a good time after? A fair question.
---
Where was this?  Curious where that plan can spawn
---
It‚Äôs be nice if you could adjust everything so you could have a camp with much larger borders and limits
---
If you don't like commando with this gun (I tried my bffr ultracite with vats commando and it just didn't work for me) try rifleman with a non-auto barrel.  iirc the auto barrel drops the ammo capacity and increases the ap cost on the ultracite laser pistol. The firerate is still pretty high non-auto and you just twitch the trigger a lot.  Just something to try if you're also vats commando and don't end up liking it.
---
Awe i missed it before the delete :(
---
I had basically the same idea too, but it would just put all your trash legendaries in a queue (where each item has 0 weight), ready to be scrapped when the next rollover comes. I think yours is better because having a queue of hundreds items could cause server lag, especially if it applied to several players on the server. 
---
There is one problem though, if you don't log on every day then you lose 150 for each day you miss. It's not a process that can be run in the background. The alternative is to make it retroactive, so it has to calculate the days you didn't log on and then apply the 150 per day rule.
---
Unmarked location, a shack with loads of ticks, near the Sunday Brothers Cabin
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpounce‚Äù when I saw it and now it‚Äôs gone. üòø
---
Try having all of the crafting materials in your player inventory and not in your stash (if you aren‚Äôt already doing that).
---
I know some people have had issues crafting serums and this a workaround.
---
The problem survival mode had was all the incentive Bethesda forced into it, the XP and unique three stars. I think it would have been far more successful if the only benefit to a pvp area would be the pvp.
---
I would just love to see more locations added to the map overall. Or more map added to the map.
---
OP said something like "Even though your opinion sucks, thank you for sharing it"
---
Strange, they've never spawned over there it for me. I used to do Collision Course on some alts and they always came either from the direction of the Airport or the opposite direction, never from top of the hill.
---
Please! This is an amazing idea, I don't understand why we have to have this large space between camps.
---
Glad to hear that but this isn't Minecraft.
---
The most annoying thing is when you join the event to complete challenges and they jump before you can kill them
---
Ahh, I know the place.  Thanks!
---
Regular but I‚Äôll be using power armor etc for weight . But what do u mean by effects ? The guns ?
---
i have a level 1 three star pipe revolver, so level 5 should exist as well.
---
Glad to help!
---
Like if youre bloodied you maybe want bolstering or if youre full health vanguards
---
That case about it not working properly does not hold water with me if you have over a hundred hours of play time to my mind.
---
Run maxed tenderizer and ffr weapon. You leech off those guys damage. They end up doing 7% more because of you. You'll see the leech damage in the second ghost of her health bar and get the drop. I don't run lone wanderer myself, think it's a waste of perks when you have gear.
---
I wish questions were the most obnoxious thing about 76 and not the game's tendency to just *break*. Like this thread posted about an hour before the OP's:
---
[So, today the Queen decided it wasn't really feeling like being killed.](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dklsqy/so_today_the_queen_decided_it_wasnt_really/)
---
Get a level 1 bloodied or instigating something, even if just one star, your mule is ready for the adventure.
---
Scrap, they are everywhere
---
Sounds boring, sorry.
---
If this was implemented I would hope the 150 per day would just get backed up instead of deleted. A certain amount allowable per day but if you don't claim it it just sits there
---
I'm stuck on my FO4 ways, and i think its a waste.
---
Nope just the mask. Effigy camp item had plans.
---
Haha! Scrap with scrapper!
---
It should say less Net bugs, as for every 3 bugs they've fixed 2 have taken their place.  But, at the least, the game is generally more stable and has less game interrupting bugs.  Those things still exist, had some myself today with hard stalls, PA freezes, damage being ignored, ect., but my char hasn't been deleted in a few months, so things are looking up.
---
Edit: Spellings.
---
Yeah it's good enough to progress through the story. I like the state of the market now, although it doesn't empty the stash quite as fast as I'd like, there is no more ammo problem now. Everything at 1c or less.
---
I dont even have that perk
---
I read in another thread that a gatling plasma spawns in the goo vats at Wes Tek.
---
Wait is wastelanders out now???
---
Leave them somewhere in an odd stonehenge setup!
---
üéâ...there ya go
---
I‚Äôd like to see when the vid is done
---
I might just, i think right outside the vault should do nicely
---
No not yet
---
Wait.
---
I have a level 5 quad explosive 10mm.
---
Nope, we should have faction based PvP. Safe zones in each faction's territory and the rest is open world PvP. Fallout 76 as it was introduced at E3. If you want to be left alone, go buy a private server.
---
Killed hundreds of queens at V9 and never had this happen. At forward station delta it‚Äôs risky since you are so close to the maps edge.
---
Unless I'm going nuts too I'm pretty sure I heard it on some TV show.
---
That worked. Thank you so much!
---
Only hurts if all duped legendary items were deleted because Bethesdas Legendary lotto system sucks.
---
How about they just give you every weapon and armor piece you want, make you invincible and with unlimited caps? Would you be happy then? Or maybe just a big red button on ur Pipboy that says "you win everything". And maybe Todd could show up at ur house and cut the crusts off ur PBJ sandwiches.
---
I have it linked on my profile. :)
---
A way to make grinding for legendaries easier heck yes, tired of losing sight of them after death or when someone launchs body with explosives.
---
I was just thinking about how awesome it would be to bring back the 5 raider factions from the Savage Divide, I'd love to see more of them.
---
That's what i said. It doesn't cost AP.  Why is snailknife getting upvotes for blatantly spreading lies?  
---
We all know in nuclear winter jumping takes absolutely no AP at all.
---
Sorry for digging up an old thread, these last few days I've visited West Tek frequently looking for that Gatling Plasma. I've always found the Fatman but the plasma was never there. Can you confirm you've found it consistently?
---
Why are people upvoting this?  You're wrong. Just plain wrong.  In nuclear winter jumps cost nothing. That's precisely why it's a problem.
---
Yep
---
i had this happen a lot at encryptid. you can arm your camera and walk around the area. the camera will id it even if the actual body isn't there. 
---
good luck &amp; happy hunting.
---
Auto mods deleted it because I linked to a site that is black listed (Amazon). You really shouldn't be making assumptions and spreading false information like that.
---
I know about NMS. Unfortunately I'm the owner of a pre-order of that game I haven't bothered to log back into since about a month after release. :-)
---
Once again though, I'd really like to avoid arguing back and forth over P2W and/or how much of an advantage or not each of the things are that Bethesda has added so far. Nobody is "winning" that fight since everyone has a different definition of what constitutes a "competitive advantage". I do agree with some of what you just wrote. 
---
If I can come up with ways everything could have been added, possibly placing the basic version in as a quest reward of some kind like noted(read as "content" people are always looking for), and still possibly meant cash for Bethesda others could as well. We might not even be having any P2W discussions on these boards.
---
And yes to all, I know ultimately the post means nothing at all nor do I expect an official reply. It started as a comment in a different thread and I said hell with it. Seriously the Collector Bot could have been a HUGE atom shop draw for players in multiple ways with players heaping praise on Bethesda....instead we got what we did and the associated negative press. It just doesn't have to be that way.
---
Scrap them. The last thing we need is more of these littering the train stations for nobody to pick up.
---
Now that I think about it does sound boring
---
it just works
---
It‚Äôs the least I could do. Literally :)
---
We should be able to grow most plants and fingi at our camp to be honest, given our soil meets the requirements.
---
Wastelanders isn't coming out until Q1 of 2020, Bethesda pushed it back.
---
The only reason it "breaks" with every release, is due to the weird way bethesda patches its games. Not because the mod is suddenly "incompatible", its more to do with them cluttering up the config every update.  
---
All in all, this wouldn't be a difficult thing to implement, even given the fact that they have to support multiple platforms. In essence consoles are just PC's running a different OS and with less flexibility in hardware configurations, it's not that dissimilar.
---
That'll never happen. It would fuck over low level players and they aren't gonna do that. Especially when they just updated a bunch of stuff to make it easier for them.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, soeey
---
I'm a quasi shotgun build it's really taken the pressure off making shotgun shells and all the plastic needed. Being able to buy the ammo really changed things.
---
I deliberately go to low level camps and buy their pipe guns and stuff. It's worth the 100 caps to clean them out and give them a boost. Fun too!
---
Ps4
---
What I mean is that if you were on holiday for 4 days and couldn't log on, then when you came back you would now have an extra 4 x 150 scrip added to your total amount of scrip. I think its fair to do it this way.
---
&gt;Fear of missing out, or FOMO, is "a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent". This social anxiety is characterized by "a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing". FOMO is also defined as a fear of regret, which may lead to a compulsive concern that one might miss an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, a profitable investment, or other satisfying events. In other words, FOMO perpetuates the fear of having made the wrong decision on how to spend time since one "can imagine how things could be different".  
---
  
---
&gt;FOMO is perceived to have negative influences on people's psychological health and well-being because it could contribute to people's negative mood and depressed feelings.
---
&gt;It is not uncommon for advertising and marketing campaigns to employ the appeal of FOMO in an era of new technology. Brands and companies often inform their customers of "can't-miss-out" experiences or deals.
---
Pretty sure keys are region locked.
---
Hooah I support this I would love is Bethesda implemented this. 
---
‚ÄúMen who mean just what they say
---
The brave men of the Green Beret‚Äù
---
John ‚Äúiceman‚Äù Lovett -7th SFG A
---
Absolutely. It's also a funny thing that you can craft 5.56 and sell it for caps to buy shotgun ammo in the same amount. It costs less materials for you because the current market demand is around 5.56 more than 0.12 caliber. 
---
&gt; to clean them out and give them a boost. Fun too!
---
I'd love a way to make a one-time free package for new players, with a upper level limit.
---
A fallout 76 game key?
---
I paid $80 for Tricentennial edition. But I've realized I don't need a private server. I've adapted to the public servers and like selling in my vendor. 
---
The only achievements I'm missing are the group ones üòÑ
---
Nice! Enjoy man maybe see you out on the wasteland!
---
If you see a huge mound of mines back away and shoot one
---
Easily true
---
Well, it's better than "This game has always sucked and will continue to suck!"  If you don't want to answer someone who asks if the game is good yet, that's on you... but you're being an asshole. :-)
---
Also they pushed back promised free content and are releasing monetized content that they were obviously working on instead of the new wastelanders stuff or bug fixes
---
So what you're saying is you want a free copy of a game that costs almost 60 dollars?
---
There are now 10 sets of PA chillin at the terrace of vault 76
---
Nudes.
---
Give us an update when you can. I'm curious to know how it turned out.
---
Whats wrong with that! Fallout 76 players won't pay to support the game so the Russians have too! Good bless Murica the land where its ok to sell user info to other countries without consent.
---
In all seriousness though seen a few places with Fallout 76 player info being sold and few posts about here on reddit and since still 2FA doesn't exist despite every company having it things like this are bound to keep happening.
---
Ok so a couple things.  Frog legs is great for several things. Traversing morgantown and the hills surrounding, jumping in combat to line up head shots, and adding a vertical direction of movement for avoiding gunfire. 
---
More movement means more chance to dodge bullets and throw off an enemies aim. Playing in full zoomed out third person with froglegs is actually busted.  
---
"If they jump around while fighting it‚Äôs even easier to kill them."  That's not true in the slightest. Even fundamentally. It's an addition of a another dimension of movement that would not exist without it.  I mean good for you for not having a problem with it but saying it's easier is just factually untrue.  Adding verticality makes aiming all the harder.  
---
I mean that is precisely why the high ground in shooters and warfare is a universal concept. Because it's simply better and does make it harder to hit a target in a 3d  space. Case and point Winston from overwatch.  You hop in and out of the fight with extreme verticality to avoid the bulk of damage.  Same exact thing with Genji.  Jumping around does make it harder to get shot. That's a fact.  I don't know why your saying it makes things easier.  Competitively in shooters characters are designed and used with this very skill because it's common knowledge it does make it harder to get hit.  Don't be silly.  
---
 The issue with froglegs is it's momentary on demand high ground mid combat.  In a shooter, there is never a reason not to have that. It simply out performs any alternative because it's so good. 
---
That being said I run melee and have a unique counter to frogleg spammers.  If they dodge the melee one shot with frog leg spam i just drop a mine under them while they are in the air and use my enhanced run for your knife speed to get out of the blast radius.  They always land on the mine and die. Freaking hilarious. 
---
The weakness of froglegs is the inability to sprint at a moments notice once in the air.
---
More accurately would be that the overseer was found half dead after her encounters with the mole miners, by some wastelanders. After patching her up, she fled apalachia with the wastelanders, were she helped them build an entire community and tough them key survival skills to make a settlements. A year passes and a group of these wastelandera go rogue, bevoming the new age raiders, who will attemp to colonize the region. The overseer rallys the people in an attemp to stop said raider faction.
---
Is that a question or an assumption ?
---
When they first brought them up over a year ago I believe Pete kept saying it was a service they were trying to figure out all the kinks on - the moment they said service, I knew then there would be some money involved.
---
Just cause not everyone wants something doesn‚Äôt mean no one does. And if I wanted single player I would play fallout 4. However I don‚Äôt. I love playing with my friends on 76 and such an experience would be enhanced with amazing mods.
---
What happens to the Mega CAMP if you log on solo? Do you still get all the stash &amp; build limit benefits for yourself? Could one team member max those out during solo play so when another logs on he can't use his own stash?
---
And if not, what happens if members of the original team stop playing, or take a break for a while? Does the remaining player only get access to the parts he built, and to his own stash? Do we trust the game to correctly tag stash items based on who put them in the stash so he doesn't risk losing access to his own stuff?
---
Do players with part in a Mega CAMP also have the ability to build solo elsewhere, so they can play solo without the Mega benefits &amp; drawbacks? And if so, do they get the normal build and stash limits for the solo camp? What happens if one player is playing solo &amp; the rest of the team log on and want to use their Mega CAMP?
---
I get credit for killing the queen about 50% of the time. Really annoying pumping hundreds of ultracite ammo into her for nothing.
---
I thought this is what the short scope was for.
---
This is Way better than mine
---
Would be so funny :o
---
It starts at noon on October 25th.
---
poggers
---
I bought all the nice white spring camp plans, after that I bought some calibrated shock plans, and now I'm onto serum plans
---
If you make an alt character, level it to 5 and then transfer junk legendaries to scrip, you can take that character to Murgh and buy random low level 3 star legendaries that way I think.
---
If on PC you can fix it where you can see it equipped when using hazmat suit but only you would see it not other players by changing what is shown when equipping hazmat suit and would be everyone using hazmat suit, or he may be referring to the coding which yes simple mistakes that take a short time to fix as most players know the code since its mostly reused from Fallout 4 to the point you can change your pipboy light to blue on PC by changing files. Once we get mod support we will be able to enjoy a working game soon but only once Bethesda gets a monthly cut of coarse.
---
 I find T-Shirt and Slacks to be the best paint for my BoS Heavy Combat. ;)
---
Well that's exactly what you're saying. You want a free copy of a game that others have paid for. It's never been free, even if it comes with a console or computer the price of the game is factored into those specials so you're still paying full price for the game.
---
There's a risk to using something niche like serum plans as an investment vehicle. Bethesda could very well turn around and put them back in the queens loot pool. Or worse add them to many events at an easier to find rarity. This would plummet their value below the already low (7k) secondary market value.  You already take a loss on each one today.  Ammo like 556 is a better alternative as the base value has a way lower chance of being eroded.
---
Because his Jimmy-bits are clearly visible
---
If you are looking at the scrap/craft atom challenge it's tough to finish without crafting some yourself. I just went back and finished it by crafting plasma pistols. With drops from the game i had only scrapped 12/76 in 1000 hours
---
Honestly I think Bethesda had a ton of data on how people played Fallout 4. Especially when it came to building. A ton of the mods (on PS4) are settlement/building related. Also NPC related. I would have used that data to make a game for the playerbase, not make a game it was *assumed* people wanted.
---
But still, it's obvious a lot of dev work went into the map, areas, little surprises and interesting locations. That part I appreciate!
---
Slip that ghoul some chems, the T pose isn't fully erect!
---
That‚Äôs interesting, I didn‚Äôt know!
---
That's why we need to kill her as fast as possible. The shorter the fight, the less likely it is to encounter a bug or server crash :D
---
I know so. I, unlike you, did the research.
---
Scam alert, he will sell it. He just deleted his last post.
---
What price drop? The black friday sale? It immediately went back to normal pricing right after black friday.
---
This is an example of why you can't ask this question here. There's too many ignorant people on this sub who repeat bullshit they heard from OTHER people on the same sub who did the same thing.
---
Even the reviews this person is quoting were done by people who -freely admitted- they were criticizing shit that had nothing to do with the game. The metacritic score tanked after a concerted effort to complain about the stupid ass bag that people got, something that was completely irrelevant to the game itself. Half a dozen "major" streamers FREELY STATED they got more press by shitting on the game than by playing it, so they did it.
---
Bias works in both directions. Unfortunately, 76 never stood a chance because no matter what Bethesda did it has a sub community completely dedicated to destroying it. There are idiots on this sub who still think Bethesda should cancel the game in its entirety.
---
This community has a serious problem, and only part of it is the actual game itself. Multiple people -in this very thread- state they've put hundreds of hours into the game but they don't like it. What? Why? Masochists? The game has serious issues, but this community is just as flawed. Really, they belong together.

you on ps4? i saw a lvl 3 near my camp today so i crafted a fully modded pipe weapon and ran over to give it to him
---
If a future patch ever allows to use decimals in caps trading the value of all ammo, 556 included, would fall to a tenth of its current value though

Still cant complete her quest cause it isn't done bud.  Poorly explained but her last tape is supposed to be a cliffhanger. We find out what happened to her in Wastelanders.
---
If you do the event where he comes and gives blessings, he‚Äôs immortal there.
---
I just want to be able to plant cranberries
---
Yeah that's it. Or that's how I'd imagine Bethesda implementing it
---
Oh sounds alittle like you're almost on your way to building Rex!
---
automatic handmade is the ak47 of the game
---
I get where you're coming from but it's a good sign, not a bad one.
---
It's not "Is it good yet? LUL! Get rekt!". It shows they want to play but only if it's gotten good (whatever that means to them).
---
Maybe ask them to be more specific but if we care about increasing the player base, we should welcome these questions.
---
Yes real sad to see this still a problem. Before it was just server crashes not its mainly the bugs ruining this game and they aren't equipped to fix these bugs and by prior track records modders were the ones to fix it, heck Fallout 4s Lever Action Rifle reload bug where you had to refill all 5 bullets despite only using one still exists in Fallout 4 but surprisingly those quarterly updates don't fix it only add creation club content.
---
No i wont sell the key
---
I just want to play that game
---
Oh okay cool! Our all the new quest and story content instantly in my quest tab or like I have to find posters to start them like previous dlcs
---
I ended up in the Bog after drinking Nukashine at level 11. Ran all the way back to the forest. It was amazing. I really wish we got more than 5 toons I enjoy playing as a low level for a challenge!
---
YES PLEASE OMG.
---
You should be able to pick one up at your local electronics or superstore. Additionally, Amazon has them.
---
It's a valid question, especially for anyone that played the garbage that was release
---
Yep - very disappointing.
---
 Bloodied is kinda pointless for PvE and essential for PvP. ;) 
---
 My META in all games is to be extremely dangerous and very hard to kill.
---
Haha, I scared you right? XD I'm practicing for Halloween.
---
&gt; Release the items but put out skins for them to make money! 
---
Bethesda seem to running in an alternate universe when it comes to some of the logic they use to design the Atom store.
---
They're half right. It's a great game, but alot of issues . As long as they listen to our complaints.
---
Can't use em for pumpkin pie, for one thing
---
I'll take that as a no
---
Hope they actually do something I'll gladly drop atoms on it then
---
right now for PvE its bloodied or junkie.  bloodied still remains top for damage at 95%? with bloodied perks.  junkies is a bloodied^lite at a 50% boost but the ability to keep full hp.  thats the reason its also a wanted stat
---
2000 iq
---
Polly never
---
There's tons of pumpkins at pumpkin house. More than enough to satisfy pumpkin pie hunger
---
OH NO! HE'S THE LORD OF DESTRUCTION, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
---
I preordered, so paid full price üôÅ
---
I have some nsfw stuff on my account and I guess my whole account is flagged as nsfw idk lol it‚Äôs kind of annoying
---
Lovr my junkie build. I can swap a few cards and go from heavy weapons to unarmed to sniper without too much hassle.
---
I don't know about PC but on console you can find the game for 20$ or less literally everywhere since like Christmas season last year lol
---
I was under the impression that the Atom Store team and the general game development team are separate.
---
There was supposed to be a "Military Intel Officer Uniform" on the atom shop that was datamined AGES ago with a proper beret like that. Some of the ghoul / scorched officers wear it. But it never showed up, and the Fasnacht beret is the only one like that we've been able to get so far.
---
I‚Äôm rolling a new build with higher charisma perks just to see if I get different reactions/quest from my main.  Also moving from melee to a marksman build (lone hunter/mountain man).
---
Slow metabolizer under endurance increases effectiveness of all food:)
---
Ok so what's the way around it?
---
So what is it?
---
Except no, you couldn‚Äôt. 
---
https://isthereanydeal.com/game/falloutviivi/info/
---
You are literally spreading false information.
---
For a vendor camp, settle close to the Whitespring Station. You have access to a vendor, and people frequently go to the Whitespring. Your camp Is also near Blackwater Mine, which makes going to and from Uranium Fever easy.
---
I bought an online game code for under $20 at the time, ¬£16UK
---
I haven't stopped playing it since launch, it's had its issues but has been a pretty playable game as a solid player.
---
That's what vault tec shown us, to rebuild but not alone, to rebuild but not just walls, to fight but defend the neighbour.
---
Appalachia is dangerous, but dwellers aren't... Well except for the griefers, don't trust them XD
---
Let me guess, send $19.95 and you'll tell us the secret?
---
There's been price drops all the time on this game. Heck right now I could buy it for $16 on Amazon (directly from Amazon, not some no name third party seller). Thats no searching, just going directly to the largest online distributer. They're have constantly been sales for this game.
---
Don't get me wrong one bit. I don't think this game deserves all the hate it has gotten. I think at the very least it's a mediocre fallout game, and if it was anyone else It'd be considered a much better game.
---
It has always been extremely easy to get it at a discount (or even few with the purchase of something else).
---
I've noticed this if the server is at Max capacity.
---
That's kinda weird.
---
I did this earlier today but 3 people I went to had their items in a vendor that wasn‚Äôt besides their other ones almost like a joke
---
Depends what ur looking for. If u want traffic for ur vending machines build near whitesprings, need to farma specific resources? Find a extractor. If ur just in it for that scenic vibe the skys the limit!
---
30 min $$$ video ‚Äúand if you stick around I‚Äôll tell you this amazing secret‚Äù
---
Yes, NOW you can. It didn‚Äôt go on sale until nearly June.
---
The game is still what it was at launch, with some updates and added content. It‚Äôs not like No Man‚Äôs Sky where the game was overhauled completely where the first few hours of the game are drastically different from the launch experience. If they didn‚Äôt like 76 before they probably won‚Äôt like it now. The game is still buggy. It probably will always be buggy. I don‚Äôt mind it but plenty of others do to the point that they probably spend more time complaining about 76 than playing a different game.
---
Why is that? I don't see your reasoning.
---
I thought the OP was looking for ways to spend their caps so they don't go over the limit. I guess I misunderstood. You're right though about the serum plans. I'm going to buy the ones I use so I'll always have access no matter how they change it. 
---
I don't know. Bethesda doesn't seem to like it when the playerbase gets comfortable with something. There are some under used ammo types I can see them making guns for to spur using that ammo rendering 5.56 unviable.
---
Nah it's a pretty reasonable one tbh
---
This.
---
Just northwest of whitespring on one of two lead deposits!!!
---
This is true. Just thought I saw one for specifically packaged food.
---
Workshops are public resources meant to be fought over. Don't like it, don't take workshops.
---
What a disgusting attitude to have. Someone beats you in a video game and youre all proud that you found a way to make their game unplayable. Just gross
---
Shop around some more online because I'm seeing it several places for under $20.
---
Yeah man he could have asked someone, literally anyone to guard his shit.
---
The danger is always there, because no one has a clue what really leads to a ban, thanks to Beth being inconsistent.
---
Yeah, they should add a doghouse item to the Atom Shop and have it spawn a doggo like the feeding trough spawns a Brahmin. Interacting with the doghouse lets you change the name and you can pet the doggo like you can milk the Brahmin.
---
Maybe add a food bowl next to the doghouse you can fill if you have canned dog food in your inventory and the doggo will eat it and do a trick for you.
---
I‚Äôm lv 204 and stopped caring about 100 lv‚Äôs ago , caps are basically useless when you can just go farm anything you need
---
Yes. Sometimes re-joining the server seems to work for me.
---
Tip: Nobody will ever, ever take your stuff from the ash heap. Nobody plays down there.
---
Thanks for the info! I didn't know murmgur sold in terms of level, thought it was all 45 or 50
---
You need about 250gb free on your internal drive.
---
Nope no one gets it.
---
Troll?
---
Hey,  that‚Äôs my house! I build my camp directly over that building , for some reason the tic spawns keep scorch beasts away.
---
Did you noticed I did not shared it and not pretty to attack way lower lever than yours with your buddy.
---
It‚Äôs not the best but not the worst
---
Ah okay. Yeah I don't think one exists. Could be wrong of course, but I've never seen it.
---
I‚Äôve got a lvl 5 Vampiric explosive laser rifle. It‚Äôs possible but hard to obtain low level legendaries.
---
You on PC? I can probably hook you up, doin some farming tonight for low level gear.
---
It really depends on what level you are and what are you looking for.
---
Instigating is highly reliant on being able to not only one shot everything, but also be the first to damage everything. It's not a very powerful build because of this, it's more fragile than bloodied because you can easily get overwhelmed by mobs if you can't one shot them or if they're in combat with another mob or player already. If you do go the instigating route you might want to keep an executioners weapon to quick swap to if the first shot doesn't take something down.
---
Omg yes
---
 A level 30 char being destroyed. Of the horror!
---
How do I get the box out of my inventory?
---
Ok, so it can be good but if I use it right?
---
A long wait? Gotta see what's in their next ITV but I'd assume just seasonal events for the holidays, some atom shop content, and... probably not much else. If they're delaying the update to work on it more I doubt they'll be working on something else in the meantime.
---
I'm also on PS4, but I've had this problem multiple times. And if I log out while in PA, I have no ammo or a fusion code for a good minute or so of just sitting still on the server.
---
I think the reason we can't grow pumpkins is because they're tied to a daily event
---
I think you should. If they‚Äôre taking a workshop just to kill a low level, it‚Äôs fucked up
---
Wow really? Why? Maybe it happened me and I didn't even noticed maybe.
---
You're the one making a baseless claim not me.
---
A lot of people use the handmade as a primary for commando or riflemand builds or as a backup gun for heavy or sniper or melee builds. So, yeah, a lot of people run handmades. They used to be even more popular when the drum mag held 75 (or was it 85?).
---
Although, one of the weightless ammo variants would make a lot more sense. IIRC 5.56 still has weight even with 90% ammo weight reduction perk.
---
I hate to say it, I have walked away after 2000+ hours. I 
---
have put up with enough of the bullshit in game. Tired  of chasing the carrot. 
---
What a joke about this being old news, this is the very reason that makes me cringe, and devides this community,  nothing like good old dictatorship. This is a community, not a fuckin commune, any question is a good question,  unless someone trying to hide the truth about the game. Lmao. 
---
I wish you the best.
---
Either that or a fobbit 100%
---
I'm more of a sack hood with straps and Pioneer Scout skirt kinda guy.  It's a look that says "mentally unstable but helpful in a pinch."
---
I would like to see a mutation like carnavor just only packaged foods
---
What exactly do (human) NPCs have to do with fetch quests? Lol.
---
Btw how would you fund all this content without marketing and without the atomic shop?
---
Check your local pawn shop. I bought mine several months ago for 14 dollars
---
don't you just love this game mechanic
---
I wear the faschnacht beret with the patrolmans sunglasses, and leopard print bandana. Reminds me of a mercanery. But I‚Äôd totally wear other colored berets. So long as they don‚Äôt look damp or aren‚Äôt in a decent fold
---
That's a good idea. It would free up a perk card slot.
---
Yeah not a big deal but it gets a nooying the second and the third time today tho.
---
Now let's watch as they ignore your post and continue to put them in atomic shop like the greedy company they are, really sucks. üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥
---
Dude that happened to me and several others on PS4 the other night.
---
Is there any deal doesn't cover physical deals. It doesn't show it for 17 on Amazon right now.
---
I think I have quite a few. I‚Äôll check.
---
I'd love the idea of, like, a clan system too. Let you build together as a group instead of individual camps that are 9 miles apart.
---
I play with a guy who's constantly buying them, I keep telling him that you'll get more just doing SBQ runs than grinding out free atoms to spend on them.
---
How is it messed up?
---
Think of it like this, What's more likely, that the game developers purposely only allowed one unarmed weapon to also be buffed by melee perks, or that there's another bug in a Bethesda game?
---
do let me know, i‚Äôll gladly pay
---
Not even just prevent us from getting low levels, but also make the game a bit easier on lower level players so they don't have to come across Lv 50s all the time as Lv 20s and 30s.
---
Weird thing is I do. It's actually installing it just resets when I turn it on after rest mode. I've just left it be and it seems to installing
---
No, but I do think on a survival mode, you team up with these certain players randomly, and fight the opposite faction
---
It‚Äôs from path to enlightenment event. That mothman is immortal
---
Camp overlapping will be 20$ extra. /s
---
It‚Äôs ok the problem with it is that it doesn‚Äôt increase damage in any way with its prefix
---
The PC digital download is still 50$ on amazon. The hard copy is what you‚Äôre referring to. Online stores lower their price relative to sales. If it had been 17$ for the last year it would be 17$ everywhere. It‚Äôs not.
---
You underestimate my pumpkin pie hunger
---
Ill buy it for 2k caps
---
God I've had it for too long
---
With no disrespect, seems like way to much work for a few weapons. I guess to each there own. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you the best.
---
That's normal. Don't worry. Just keep it loading. 
---
Say the game has 70GB to download. If you fire your ps4 back up, from rest mode, and it prepares the download again the overall GB should be lower. 
---
I don't know if that's make sense. English isn't my native language.
---
...
---
Well said
---
Shoot them as they fall
---
They usually do "resets" at 4pm GMT so if you are home before that you can still use the discount
---
I'm not on ps4 but thank you for being a good vault dweller
---
It stops I believe 11 Eastern maybe 12 best to be safe tho
---
Wait is the marine helmet in the game now ?
---
There won't be any new quests until next year. Very dry game right now, but on the flip side you can buy a server next week, lmaoo.
---
Instead of ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù the Purveyor, maybe give her script.
---
I would say:
---
1. Adjust mechanic
---
2. The fewer ppl know the better
---
3. Be nice to ppl. One of the greatest things in the game is the community.
---
I‚Äôd grind on her if she‚Äôd show me some love in return.
---
The disappearing bag never happens to me. Mine is always there when I come back and I never drop when ppl are by me.
---
Bethesda has known about both the pipe revolver and meat hook for a long time. They are medium teir weapons unless you use double the amount of perks on them and then they just barely outperform similar weapons of the same archetype. They are balanced because they cost double the perks without gaining double the damage. Bethesda has never said that it is a bug, you can achieve comparable damage with other weapons that dont double dip in perks, and the damage you are talking about doesn't even come from the perks. The high damage output isnt because it uses 1 handed and unarmed perks at all, you can do the same thing with a deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
It's anything bloodied, 40% more power attack damage, +1 Strength, max strength, Full unyeilding armor, radicool with high rads, melee bobblehead, pshycobuff, revenant, nerd rage, and  the anti armor perks for melee. What you're actually mad about is just anyone who has mastered a min/max build. The meathook is irrelevant.
---
Sorry to hear about your experience. What else is new. Lmao. If you don't get booted off the server 10 seconds before you kill her, or stuck in your power armor, or game glitches. Nonetheless it has become a virtual joke. I  hope you get her next time. 
---
Mmmkayyy.
---
Thanks for the advice. I have a shotgun character that‚Äôs been neglected ever since the last shotgun nerf and was considering junkie, as I have two junkie shotguns.
---
What are the disadvantages to stay aware of, or in-the-field advice?
---
I‚Äôm guessing that staying stocked on five different chems is far too much of a pain in the ass, so I assume stat hits are just something to live with?
---
Except specific legendaries...
---
Sometimes I feel like the only one who does not care at all if they even add weapons to the atomic shop.
---
It would make me feel unfair or anything. Of course, I would prefer other stuff focused on, but they got to make money. And I liked the stuff they added to the atomic shop recently.
---
Oh... I've been throwing her through the legendary grinder for scrip.
---
Who ever said mods were not going to happen
---
Chill, he said should i snitch to Bethesda he aint proud hes telling us he found a glitch that he didnt even tell you how to do, overall your comment was pretty shit and made you look like an asshole
---
Its just killing low lvls because they cant do anything about it
---
Wait, actually?
---
I hate it when that happens. Getting ready to snipe and I forget I have a piece of chamelion armor
---
That flux might be alright just be prepared to use it quickly.
---
That's your assumption though. Why assume that high levels never need a workshop? Also losing 30 caps 1 time isnt that bad, they dont have to keep coming back to fight someone they cant beat. Just playing devils advocate here.
---
There's one just down the road from the white spring service entrance that always seems to be in that pose.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I always run 3 into nerd rage. I like at least a point into serendipity, but not super necessary. I‚Äôm running a bloodied stealth commando and I‚Äôm loving gun fu maxed out with a maxed out adrenaline. Don‚Äôt forget those mutations; adrenal reaction, bird bones, speed demon, marsupial.
---
Yup that happens. Kinda funny to watch.
---
They've always done that.
---
For the sale definitely 3*. Costs 50 caps and you can scrip to get 40 back if it‚Äôs junk.
---
Just gotta learn to scan the screen for certain colors. I see that weird blue/green from a mile away lol
---
This game is the best and you‚Äôre a dumb idiot if you don‚Äôt like it and even dumber if you don‚Äôt spend money on Atoms.
---
Alright. Thanks man
---
10 hours? Damn. What kind of internet do you have in 2019?!? I have basic internet and it takes 39 mins.
---
That would be one large chainsaw
---
I use the scope with a cross-hair in it that one doesn't disappear.
---
Oh yeah? What about Rainbow Six? TF2? Terraria? Civilization? Star Craft? Overwatch? Dark Souls? I could list every game across every genre I‚Äôve payed for that the devs at least game enough of a shit about to give content updates years later for free, but I‚Äôd probably hit the post limit first.
---
Hell, even the No Man‚Äôs Sky devs cared more about their dumpster fire after release. They added MULTIPLAYER to an otherwise singleplayer game for FREE, two years after release. If I recall, they just put out a big content update a couple months ago, for free, no less.
---
It was more than a refrigerator, I can tell you that.
---
I‚Äôve thrown a couple thousand scrip at her. All for 2 star ranged. Was hoping for a bloodied handmade but didn‚Äôt receive any bloodied‚Äôs in almost 80 rolls. Gave up today and tried 3 star attempts.
---
1st roll- bloodied, faster fire rate..... gamma gun.
---
Really is RNG. More chances with 2.
---
I hate that bloody church.
---
Right Ok well perhaps fixing the meat hook isn't the answer, maybe it's down to bugs surrounding stacking foods and chems ok.  I mean mutton meat pie seems to stack with Yao gui roast when glowing meat steak doesn't, so I think mayne mutton meat pie is bugged? The games riddled with them.
---
I'll take your word that Bethesda are already aware of the meat hook, would be better if you could source that claim but whatever. But just cos they say they know about it, doesn't mean it's not a bug. They know about loads of issues and still won't fix them. To me it sounds like a bug that is too much of a problem to fix, and from the sounds of it reading the comments on this post, would probably annoy more people than if they left it the way it is!
---
Now if you're saying that low tier weapons such as the hook and pipe need to benefit from double dipping in perks. Then why cant all the other weapons I listed earlier benefit from this? (I replied to somebody else on here).
---
This game needs a serious re work in balancing weapons anyway, the way I see it, damage should just be flat across the board within certain tiers of weapons, then we would get some variety. A hook and  DCG should have the same damage and it just be cosmetic choice. But we'll that's not the point of this post, save that for another day.
---
FYI there is a whole questline associated with the sheepsquatch... several actually. It‚Äôs not just the (2) events.
---
Do the quest or wait the 24 hours
---
That's actually something that would work well in 4 as well (I don't play 76 but just came to the sub to see if 76 is worth playing now)
---
Nice!  If you need anything else let me know im online now
---
It‚Äôs been in my inventory for almost 3 months
---
How was it in the previous fallout games? Seemed to be doing fine all this time. These Fortnite-esque requests are ridiculous
---
For a low level, it is bad to lose all the stuff invested in the place man. No one is assuming that high levels don't need workshops the issue is taking the fully build workshop from someone just because you are higher level. The civilized thing to do here is the workshop needed is already taken is to switch server.  I don't attack low levels if I need the workshop they own.
---
That‚Äôs a smart idea I just wish more people would do that kind of stuff.
---
Right, out of combat, and I put my weapon away, about a minute later the meter kicks in and you can see it filling up.
---
I'm looking for a nice flat area near water and with trees
---
I'm level 17

You've been able to get it for 40 or cheaper since Christmas last year on Amazon. There have been days where it would go to full price but in general there was no reason to buy the physical version for full price since the month after release.
---
Digital is another story entirely (and FYI, isthereanydeal doesn't cover every promotion, like email codes sent to members of sites for specific games, it's how i got mhw for 20% off at release).
---
Im all about the looks. For example i dont use "small" or "slim" weapons when playing with power armor, cause i just think it doesnt fit wearing a giant suit of armor and wielding a small pistol or a slim combat rifle. Gauss rifles and heavy weapons on the other hand are weapons i would never play without powerarmor. Also the recon scope is a no go for me because i think on most weapons it looks weird and out of place.
---
Would you say it‚Äôs more important to have the mutations or other perks like dodgy or serendipity?
---
Well we are getting the president event, pipboy skin and a secret service PA
---
It ends at 12pm EDT
---
Honestly , I‚Äôd do what I did when I was a kid and encountered those people with just a bucket on the porch. I‚Äôd take it all!
---
This little reddit convo just made my day lmao
---
Yes. Go to purveyor at lvl 5 or try with the horde events.
---
How's anything p2w in fallout
---
We definitely need an account bank.
---
You're god damn right.
---
One the one hand does suck for the low level to lose what ever junk they used to power the workshop but on the other hand it's not a game changer. You're correct that the civilized thing would be to change server but what if the person is on a team and they dont want the entire team to have to queue up into another server. Also, civilized isnt exactly the way of the post apocalyptic wasteland. Again, just playing devils advocate because I dont think its "messed up" but more just impolite.
---
My two fav low level spots start from One and when the stuff start getting very far move to Spot 2. [http://prntscr.com/plzenr](http://prntscr.com/plzenr)
---
I hope this helps a bit
---
I just use a third party screen overlay and add my own dot. Works better too since recoil and jumping won't throw off your crosshair.
---
I‚Äôd personally get those mutations first. Don‚Äôt forget the mutation perks though. Class Freak and Starched Genes.
---
Everyone who's not a fucking moron
---
If the basic dog was obtainable from a mission but then they sold different breeds in the Atom shop I think that would sell pretty well.
---
Was cooking at my base and someone headshot me with an explosive pistol. Turned around, did the "???" Emote, and then they dropped the weapon, legendary explosive 44 assassins / explosive. Picked it up, gave them a thumbs up and they left. 
---
I dont know if they were throwing down a gauntlet or just had a change of heart.
---
The flattest areas are in Cramberry bog üòàüòàüòà
---
No
---
Then yiu gotta do the quest
---
My friends ask me this all the time, and while it‚Äôs far from perfect, it‚Äôs been getting better and better. I love the Event changes, I‚Äôm loving vendors and especially with some new BPs I‚Äôve gotten, think I have a nice base that welcomes shoppers. It such a fun game and has so much potential to be better
---
Man if we are "rebuilding the future" as the game says I want to be civilized it's up to everyone I get the party thing thou. The main question was how to prevent the thing I found, I will file a bug report or something.
---
Well, yes, but also no

Nope

There‚Äôs good doggy which increases benefits of dog food.

Fuck yes, what he said

Meathook seems to get more dmg bonus from melee buff food. Without glad cards on just glowing steak my Meat hook and power first are about equal. With glowing meat and one other 10% melee food running the meat hook pulls ahead. With all the melee food the meat hook is way more damage. Add in the glad cards and the gap is even larger.
---
&gt;New quests and human NPCs will be coming Fall 2019 in the free Wastelanders DLC.
---
hmm
---
Lever action is all about instigating, one hit kills. Furious and executioners are better on automatics. Quad is great on teslas, vampires works great on heavy weapons. 
---
The perks need to match the weapons.
---
Thankyou!! Not used CRs much on this character so never broke em down!
---
Instigating or bloodied deathclaw gauntlet, gronacks axes are good too, I run with 2 all rise super sledge, I havent found a better hammer, you get it from mayor for a day quest in watoga

Isn‚Äôt there a Boy Scout quest too something about a backpack
---
Do you know if there‚Äôs been a fix for this? Feel like I got ripped off.
---
Also, I saw someone wearing the stripes hazmat suit already
---
You'll have better luck on the trading forums. Search fallout market and youll find it, not allowed to post link
---
thank ya thank ya
---
Honestly, it wouldn't make the daily any easier. There are pumpkins behind the house hidden in the grass, you don't have to go to the spot marked on the map to get them. The spot on the map makes you aggro 2 sets of enemies and triggers a SB spawn.
---
I'm not telling, I guess I will just make a report if they have a spot for that in the BE app or website.
---
Bull, it would be trivial to release a standalone self hostable server and offer a premium official rentable option. At this point it is industry standard.
---
This happened in a videogame.  It's a totally different situation than someone coming up to you in person.  It's not like you were ever in any actual danger.  You could just mute they guy and if worse comes to worse, log out and relog in.  And there was nothing he could have really done to you anyway besides yell at you and try to pvp you, both things you can avoid.  This was just a player being ridiculous and trying to interact with other players albeit in a very aggressive way.
---
yer welcome yer welcome :)
---
Thanks I checked them out and I like the first one
---
I have a bloodied 90% weight 50% limb damage 50 cal. Is it any good?
---
Noticed as well, once I tried fast traveling to the exact same camp again and the vendors all loaded up the right way. But I‚Äôve tried to fast travel trick before and the vendors stayed empty as well
---
Where?
---
For PC?
---
Fixed
---
There is a mod for "Glowing Meat Piles" which really helps. 
---
You can pick between Red, Blue, Green and Purple. It's amazing for finding lost loot.
---
Ok, so tonight's it for me then. Thanks!
---
I had my current char there and it was very nice. If someone starts the Nuclear power plant you can allways hit the Sunshine meadows for food and more junk.
---
Feel free to check my YouTube channel for builds, here‚Äôs one that doesn‚Äôt require any legendary items https://youtu.be/m1OTKSxeeCw
---
I wish they hadn‚Äôt told us there were no NPCs, but let us discover it. It would have made Roses quest better. I think maybe they should have just said there were very few NPCs and let it be a surprise.
---
Yup. I don't care how much it costs, I'll buy the President Gauss rifle from anyone selling it. If I can't earn it myself somehow.
---
I don‚Äôt care what they sell. If it‚Äôs all bs I don‚Äôt play or buy. No one is going to stop the current model. As games become a service they will either charge for dlc, charge a subscription or run a store. It‚Äôs no different than what WOW has done for years, it‚Äôs just a different set up. 
---
If we want added content then manpower and time needs compensated. If I don‚Äôt like the direction of a game, screw it, cosmetic nonsense I don‚Äôt like I simply don‚Äôt buy. It‚Äôs not hard
---
No mine was for ps4 ..I'm not sure if they have PC as I'm not lookinbg ,,,sorry
---
Junkies or bloodied, here‚Äôs my bloodied heavy gunner: https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
Thanks, so at least the mods do exist.  Though I haven't seen any mods in vendors recently.  Might still be able to find them out in the world maybe though.  For now I'm going to stick with my mutant's plasma gun with the +10% mutation damage.  It does like 2 less ballistic and energy damage but I can mod it out with exactly what I want so it's worth it.  I'll try to farm more enclave events and see what I get.
---
As for the high tech lights, I am pretty sure I've seen those recently though I can't tell you where.  It could've been in a vendor but heavily RNG dependent or more likely it was from a workshop defence.  I wish I could remember to help you.
---
Personally, I ENJOY playing the game but the game doesn‚Äôt enjoy being played. When I play and everything runs smoothly I have fun, and grinding levels and running around with my friends is really cool, but when it isn‚Äôt running smoothly? Oh man is it a god damn disaster. Sometimes it just runs so incredibly poorly that I can‚Äôt believe I spent money on it.
---
I think you should. Bugs are bad for everyone. Of something that makes the game unplayable for others gets out then think how much worse trolling will be.
---
Man most of these five chems are actually reducing your int, chr and luck so i'd not say its actually a pain in the ass at least not for me as i'm not min/maxing that hardü§î sometimes tho that psycho is more than a luxury so i'd keep some in hand 
---
One thing i would advise tho is if you enjoy capping bot vendors or like selling bulk stuff, i'd equip better prices peek and keep a regular beer at hand to combat that negative charisma effects.
---
So this post was pointless
---
Nope what?
---
This is actually a pretty good idea, I hope it gets implemented
---
Shotguns really need to function more realistically and still be deadly past 10 feet.  The whole videogame logic of shotguns tickling enemies past spitting range just doesn't work.  A single shotgun pellet is realistically comparable to a .38 pistol bullet but the pipe pistol can be used as a sniper rifle while the shotgun is most effective in melee range and anything further than that it does greatly reduced damage.
---
I think the change is asked for since Beth regularly updates this game with small patches, not to mention this started to become a problem in Fo4 and is greatly a problem in Fo76.
---
The Responders and the Free States are also all dead, and have had faction packs in the atomic shop.  
---
According to your logic this is lorebreaking. It is not, we the people from vault 76 can easily pick up the banner and carry it on.   
---
On top of that, using your logic the only faction that should have any sort of presence in the Atomic Shop is the Enclave as they have a functioning AI in the region that is very active.  
---
What you are saying is lorebreaking is absolutely not lorebreaking....
---
At point blank range the pump shotgun should do way more damage than any other firearm does, just with less armour pierce
---
sorry, XB1, I appreciate it.
---
my first was an instigating hunting rifle with 33%vats hit and the dreaded 250DR.. it is still the only thing ive ever pulled that fits my build
---
other than my first gun everything else ive ever pulled went right back into scrip
---
Contact support if it didn't say it wouldn't work for that gun. They can return the atoms.
---
Easiest and best starting build in the game is an Instigating Lever Action Stealth/VATS build.  You‚Äôll one shot 99.9% of mobs, be at full health, use very little ammo, and get rich.  
---
The only hard part is finding the level 45 Instigating Lever.
---
This is my version that can be tweaked as necessary:

I sent you a message on Live. I can make one for you.
---
No prob!
---
GT: PeteMcNasty74
---
I'll build you one, I know most if not all of the mods
---
Fine by me. Make your chameleon armor invisible. Keeps your exposed body parts and weapon visible.
---
That's the essence of what you're asking for. If you want the whole gun camouflaged, use a scope where the optics are inside the invisible thing, so they're still operable. Seems logical to me.
---
Yea both fissure sites are close, closer to you than me, but I have already moved locations, I moved to the north of Whitesprings, no problems so far.
---
It does sound like a stock music track.  If so, it could turn up anywhere.
---
I'll pour some out for you for your loss. What station? Next time I log in I'll jump on the roof and leave a beer.
---
I used my son to transfer some items to my mule and after he picked it all up he immediately dropped it all without telling me. When I logged in with my other character he was in a different part of the world/ I was so confused. Luckily enough I  found the bag. I just shook my head and thanked him for his help.
---
What if he already does that?
---
No cross platform play.
---
Im leaving bags of fertilizer and tp at every camp i visit until nov 1st
---
Give it time, that 250Dr might get fixed... maybe...
---
...glowing plans mod... \[PC\]
---
Loot everything then sell it to a bot vendor.
---
The spend it at someone‚Äôs machine ...
---
Earlier today,  I had 8000 caps from the former, then spent 4K at one player machine....
---
Say come, easy go....
---
I disagree.  There‚Äôs always a reason to have lots of caps.  I‚Äôve easily spent over 100K caps in a day trading, while I also sold over 100K over the weekend.  I like to have minimally 100K so I can buy/trade any item I find and want.
---
Marsupial is a game changer for ranged tactics.  Since so many enemies are melee, one can gain a higher position a pew pew.
---
Just kill scorch and super mutants and scrap every gun for tons of endless steel.
---
I found the nuka clock plan at a player vendor today :)
---
I bet you really enjoy unsolicited PVP
---
&gt;What do you think guys and girls?
---
No, it was OK I guess. Now I know what are few of the Fo76 players thinking.
---
Next time if I find something strange I will just report it and not make a scene out of it :) Lesson learned.
---
Third person aiming is so much better for so many guns...
---
I do hope is gets fixed soonly.. but I only use it for long range sniping and low level areas now.. also Im sneaky/crit so Im mostly crouched anyway
---
lever and handmade are my workhorses
---
Kill 50,000,000 super mutants would be a good one but agree that double exp aint needed.
---
Instigating by far. The only thing that compares is Bloodied.
---
100% correct.  Preach on.
