Is the XP good? I'm guessing everyone is salty that the Halloween rewards got yanked.

---
Thank you üòÑ
---
Honestly what isn't bugged at this point?
---
Level 251 never launched a nuke, never went out of adventure mode lol I haven't been on in weeks playing the new death stranding, so bad ass. I might check out 76 in the future when wastelanders hits and maybe launch a nuke..
---
I only buy whacky outfits anyway
---
Whitsprings
---
Someone who doesn't play that often. He was sooo close to the costume though. I hope that they fix this in some way.
---
this, though xp should be set to 0
---
C'mon, its current year and they're programmers.

That's all been automated.

fo76map is pretty incomplete compared to what map76 had.

Pumpkin pantsuit yesterday 40c, treasure maps 500c lmao
---
Are you 10 years old?
---
What you said makes no sense.
---
How many times does someone need to FIND the same exploit? 400? You find it, you report it, and you move on. There's a differences between finding an exploit and using an exploit.
---
I‚Äôm have no idea what happened here, but I just want to say that in general repeating things is a big portion of scientific research... haha
---
I thought it got nerfed?
---
Omg thank you.
---
I thought you were being sarcastic at first
---
What am I lying about?
---
Not noticeable
---
Nope never had it to equip in the first place. Heading home soon to test more or see if a hard reset fixed it.
---
Reminds me of the molerats who burrow through the floors in the Fort Defiance.
---
K thanks

The Fallout Five 0 made an in game quest that was just this. They sent a radio message out... and people started to reply.

I don't have any relevant resistance perks but I'll try scrambling and then resetting my build to see if that does it. Thanks!
---
He literally reported the cheater, wtf is wrong with you?
---
Lvl 232 never launched a Nuke.  My husband and I play and talk about it but we just haven't done it.
---
According to Fallout 1 and 2, the two versions of enclave power armor were both designed after the Great War.  T-45d and T-51b were the only pre-war power armor until Fallout 4 introduced T-60.
---
I mean, if he's the kind of guy that likes to find errors in games so they can be reported and fixed, yea, he may have used it hundreds of times legitimately. Fallout 76 has more than enough bugs and glitches and other errors to keep him busy.
---
i have no reason to find this credible
---
What is burrows
---
Then go enjoy playing it.  We're not stopping you from doing that.
---
Once people start complaining and badmouthing Bethesda, then that‚Äôs not loyal anymore  ;)
---
Right, can you name a single exploit they have fixed without being handed details of exactly how to do it? Because every one I can think of, someone gave them the exact details of how to do it. When people don't give them the details, they email them asking how they did it after a ban. Remember all of that. Oh man, but sure, they will figure it out.
---
Well, when you find them on "some obscure site", then I would say that counts as *finding an exploit*. Without using it.
---
But that's just me, you do you.
---
I upvoted, but I'm honestly ambivalent on this issue. On the one hand, the dataminer really should have not used the exploit hundreds of times because it makes the datamining look like a weak excuse. I know that if I were a Beth employee, I would have looked at that and said "yep, we got ourselves a cheater" then gleefully rolled said cheater in scorchbeast guano.
---
On the other hand, Beth really is beginning to surpass EA in terms of shady shit done by the company in general. Also, the ability of NW cheaters to evade bans is clearly a sign that tougher measures are needed: console and IP bans will go a long way towards stemming the tide.

Hey carnivore mutation, if you get hungry you can eat a radroch no questions asked seriously a good mutation because you will always have food as long as you kill stuff and no need for cooking
---
You need power to run a vendor? I don't have any power in my base and i could place it down. People have bought from it to.
---
Sorry, that was my poor attempt at a joke in keeping with the general tone of the thread. I haven't actually hid in a bush in NW. I somewhat understand the motivation as I played to level 10 only to get the overseer chair. One thing I like about this game is alot of the players don't take it too seriously. Combining Fallout fans with a battle royale is bound to get you naked guys in bushes.:)
---
He didn't test it 400 times. If you have to make a false exaggeration like that to back your point, then you don't have a point.
---
better yet, fix the god damn exploits before they ever make it out the door

Diehard FO4 player, and I've got to say that while there are lots of similarities with FO4; '76 seems desolate in comparison. There are more enemies it seems in '76 but it's missing the heart(at least until Wastelanders drops, hopefully) due to the absence of the stories of the NPCs you interact with in FO4. You get some of the 'heart' through reading the terminals/notes/listening to holotapes, but it's not the same as having an NPC standing in front of you telling you their story. The crafting elements in '76 are better than the vanilla FO4 and the player vending element is great, but some of the limits set by the building and inventory management are enough to make '76 a pain in the ass. With all of this said, I've still had a great time playing '76 and interacting with actual people vs. NPCs - even when some of those real people are violent assholes who will kill you for no freaking reason. It is a rewarding feeling that isn't part of FO4 when you can help out another player with supplies that you don't need.FO4 is like you're in a populated city, FO76 is like you're in an empty rural area. The feel of the world is empty despite all of the enemies. 
---
TL;DR  - FO4 &amp; FO76; while similar in some respects are drastically different in others. You'll definitely have different experiences in '76 that you'd never have in FO4.
---
A place in the sewers of Berkeley springs
---
So is this post.
---
I expect 76 to be dead in a year, maybe less. What a massive shame. No wonder the game has no on going support. If they actually released really cool Atomic Shop shit, people in droves would purchase the Atoms with real money. Noticed how Zenimax Online Studios has made a killing with ESO. Because it‚Äôs supported, a lot. With updates, new DLC and cosmetics.
---
Cosmetics alone could have funded 76, but I guarantee a lot of people dropped this game over the past few months and I don‚Äôt blame them. If they actually supported it with big events, more frequently, had amazing atomic shop stuff etc, everything would have been dandy. But just look at this update. Lazy joke. They really don‚Äôt care anymore.
---
Im gonna buy the new wallpaper bundle from the atomic shop later today
---
Good: The emotes?
---
Bad: Bethesda/the entire game
---
Ugly: Bethesda/the entire game
---
What about Reshades? Or ENB type things? Never got a firm answer on that.
---
All I know is the Reshade I use makes the graphics look way way better.
---
So you're upset because you're being lied to and feel stupid? So you take it out on me. Perfect. üëè
---
Sooo they‚Äôre getting banned just because of a refund? That‚Äôs gay
---
I cannot find the bungalow to buy!!! What am I doing wrong?!
---
Good for you so you support being lied to and sold a crappy beta game which we were promised a million times more then we got?
---
How do you get on their server for that
---
Not that I would buy any Atoms for this dumpster fire of a game anyway, but why is the Greenhouse only available in a bundle? What if I JUST want the Greenhouse and none of that other crap?
---
I‚Äôm level 167 or so, I‚Äôve helped launched and launched some myself. If anyone has Xbox and wants help launching one I can help :) get it done quick as we can.
---
I had a junkies expl 44, but I liked my Junkies +33 VATS pipe pistol/rifle the most. You can use the gunslinger and rifleman perks with it so it had some pretty good damage. It wasn't bad for one or two mobs here n there, but I had to go with a Handmade when I got overwhelmed with mobs because the Pistol fire rate is shitty on those you mentioned.
---
Anyway, if you're on PC I should still have that 44 for sale if you want it, I'll give it to ya for free. It's a cool sidearm, but I'd say use something else tbh. I ended up getting a Plasma Rifle and a decent Laser rifle so I dont do pistols anymore, but I did for a good 90 levels or so.
---
Oh Bethesda, you wouldn't lie to us... would you? 
---
Not about 16X the detail...
---
Not about cosmetic only microtransactions...
---
Not about all content being added to the game for free...
---
Not about scrapboxes eating scrap...
---
and certainly not about banning community members reporting exploits...
---
After all, you have such a sterling reputation.
---
And not use it? It being an **exploit** and all?
---
Then yes. 
---
If you then repeatedly use the exploit you found, that doesn't make you the "good guy" in this scenario. Not even for "research purposes".
---
[this video says different...](https://youtu.be/hbmf1mh4I50)
---
I enjoy this game! I wish I could enjoy it without supporting them, but oh well. I dont like what Bethesda has been doing, and I dont like them. If I thought they'd change if people stopped playing, then maybe I'd stop. But I don't have any faith theyll change, so I dont think about it. The game is bad. But I still enjoy playing it! So imma keep playing it
---
Can't they ban the ip address or something like that?
---
It's how the right ones do.
---
If you build a doorway, you can attach another doorway to the other side, and get wallpaper on both sides. Then you "replace" the doorway with a solid wall. You can do the same with half-walls and angled roof pieces (though you have to do it before adding the roof in most cases). I use brick for the exterior, and warehouse for the interior walls, because they have better looking door frames.
---
All doorways work now, not just brick. :)
---
I do the daily/weekly challenges for Atoms and have been working on my Camp, but that's about it. It's a good time to play other games.
---
That's a very close minded perspective and that's why they won't ever change because, just enough people apparently are keeping it going. To the generalized public of people who have a sense of dignity this game is dead.
---
If rather work on making the game run and operate properly first, then new content.
---
There are some bridges along the big river I'm pretty sure
---
I get tons of HM and HRF from Morgantown.
---
Did you select it in the atom shop after purchase?
---
It is a lot of extra work, but I primarily use the brick walls flipped inward and then apply the wood paneling wallpaper to the exterior. It really looks good on my treehouse, but I would absolutely love more options.
---
Toobad nobody has what i need. I already tried 4 times.
---
Never heard it called a 'dumpster fire' before... that's pretty original.
---
There's a bridge in point pleasant that was destroyed by the responders so the scorched wouldn't leave the state and spread the plague
---
There's a bridge leaving the map on the west side at point pleasant, leading to that area where all the cargobots are swarming
---
Do you care to elaborate on how he was wrong? No one has said anything in this thread proving that his opinion is factually incorrect. This is literally opinion vs. opinion at this point.
---
Plenty of people have stopped playing, and more than enough people have made their voices heard. They've shown blatant disregard for the cares of their own fans. I have full faith nothing is going to change no matter what happens.
---
Sarcasm is the lowest form of intelligence. Congrats.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why people who hate the game and Bethesda so much put forth so much effort into constantly going on the social sites and complain over and over. Go play something else and leave the people who enjoy playing alone. I know there are problems with it but I still enjoy playing it. Just think what you could accomplish by putting your efforts toward a game you like.
---
They NEVER made optimised games, but tell that to the THOUSANDS of hours of playtime since morrowind.  They make amazing content and new ways to experience it.  It has always been buggy, didn't matter.  Nothing else was ever quite like it. 
---
Not everyone believes in the new Cancel Culture. Why do you think your opinion matters at all? Do you really think you will start some movement to force bethesda to make bug free games or go out of business?  Are you so Woke that you know the gaming business better than people actually in it?  Why don't you go tell your mom Karen, she will fix it for you.
---
I thought it would be bacteria or something, but it's a sarcastic guy on Reddit? ok
---
I love you vids! Very informative and you have a great personality and sense of humor to make that info fun!
---
I do, I spend plenty of time on games I like, I was on here scrolling and I voiced my opinion. Which I'm fully allowed to do. I'm just tired of companies getting away with releasing such incomplete piles of shit and then selling them for 70 a pop, or more. I just figured you would value your money more than that and would like a fully complete game that isn't trash but whatever.
---
Look around man. Gaming has been this way for years. Lets stop pretending that this is a new phenomenon and a personal attack carried out by Bethesda. The self righteous outrage and "wokeness" coupled with the non stop martyrdom is truly exhausting at this point. You are owed nothing you dont matter to them nor do we. Its a game made by a company whos goal is to make money. Like all businesses. Ethics and morals are a myth designed by the marketing department dont like it theres the power button. Wouldnt you rather enjoy your life instead of being angered and judgemental of others? Like people playing this game is a source of conflict in your life? Thats a problem man.
---
I meant intelligence as in how you chose to respond. Sarcasm takes no effort and it's not even funny. I'm not talking about the lowest intelligent being of life?
---
Your engrish hurts me.
---
handle checks out...
---
There are train tunnels that are clogged up. And as other people have said. The responders likely destroyed large scale ways in/out of Appalachia. 
---
Jets would be a good way if the SB weren‚Äôt so rampant. Boats are good option.
---
Some people are only happy if other people are miserable like them.  Can't stand to see other people enjoying something they do not.
---
Dont use cheat engine. If you load it up no matter what its a bannable offense. Funny how yall will believe someone by their word just cause they made a map. Yet go on other fourms of games and yell at people claiming to be wrongfully banned.
---
PERFECT!  Tarpit them is perfect.  They could even accidentally leave bugs in on those clients, and suck up memory, and grind the CPU harder.
---
look in the shed with cages behind the district ranger station in cranberry bog, one usually spawns in there.
---
I don‚Äôt even know how to. Level 90. I have the mission to go down one of those lifts, it always points me to the port potties but I can't click on them.
---
Ah but the thing is that Stable flux will give you Pure flux. It‚Äôs like scrapping a wrench for steel. A wrench will give you steel in the same way that Stable flux gives you Pure flux, as long as you‚Äôve got Stable flux in your inventory or Stash Box, then you‚Äôll automatically have Pure flux. 
---
This can be seen when you go to where your Stable flux is stored, highlight it and it says Pure flux in the same way that mods and scrap items show you what scrap material you can get from scrapping that item.
---
There is a 33.3% chance of each plan type. So 100% chance u till you compelet a set, then it gose down with each set you compelet. I went 6 runs with no plan before
---
It's not like it's my life goal. I am voicing my opinion. Why was your time responding let alone clicking on it if you disagree. Saying I have the problem lol
---
What a valuable contribution to this conversation! By someone who literally does nothing but posts about FO76... Almost as if he's getting paid to do it.
---
Sure
---
Why are you doing an impression of a foreign accent? Are people who can speak more languages than you funny ?
---
thank you for the info, that sucks
---
Thanks for your meaningless opinion regarding my intellectual capacities based off a single comment.
---
Yet any other fourm yall will yell at people whining that their banned. Funny how you take someone at their word just cause they made a map. And data mined the game which is against tos. Every game is that way. Next time someone not popular gets banned be sure to stick up for them using your logic.
---
The only way out, is suicide OR you grab a saddle toss it on a scorchbeast and fly to freedom. Sometimes its like we arent even playing the same game.
---
IP addresses are ez to change. Have to do HWID bans and more.
---
ok boomer
---
Yeah, it's a bummer. But just think of it as getting more steel haha
---
Not seeing it
---
This did the trick....eventually.  The generator must put off ambient power because as soon as I was able to get my building close enough to it, it worked.  The vending machine was on the second floor of my house so I had to put the generator on a little hill so it could get close enough.  Thank you.
---
Well my friend you are missing out on quite a bit of story and exploration by not, most of the events have story conections and upgrading your weapons and armor have always been a part of the fallout experience I can solo a silo without firing a single round in about 15 minutes but hey you play your way!
---
Wah
---
Scientific, yes, criminal, not so much.
---
Yes . Such a cool mechanic to grind parts and designs and could add arenas and such related to em but nope xD
---
So no country roads to take back home to mountain mama?
---
Can I ask how many people you have assigned to this task?
---
Try jumping + pressing forward + weapon dash
---
Funny thing is if bethesda good will unbans him the person will never ever report it. And the hate train will keep going wish mods would just delete posts.
---
yeah fair enough
---
I think Elder Scrolls Online has also tarnished Bethesda and Zenimax‚Äôs respective reputations as well. There have been MANY times that the game was unplayable. Either you couldn‚Äôt even log in or the sheer volume of bugs would crash your game. 
---
It‚Äôs a real shame too because both Fallout and Elder Scrolls has such a devoted fan base and these both had incredible potential to be Game of the Year. 
---
Unfortunately, it seems they have a serious problem developing MMORPG. Either in the code writing itself or the maintainability of its servers. If you take a look at Bethesda‚Äôs history, they seem to only excel at single player RPG.
---
Sweet forgot about that
---
It's an opinion that I wish they cared more but clearly all of you don't give a fuck and are just as toxic as Bethesda has become.
---
Way to be a guy! Guy
---
He never reported it and is a proven data miner which every game bans for. Why arent you on every other game fourm yelling at them or sticking up for non popular people who claimed they were unfairly banned.
---
I know everyone is mad at Bethesda but I believe them on this one. Think about it logically, they wouldn't intentionally get more bad press. It is possible their cheat security thing went off when they did the cheat for research or testing then they unbanned them, I dunno. 
---
it's more likely that someone on the internet lied than a large company added more controversy they have to deal with and banned players that play and spend money. 
---
I'm not defending their bs on everything but even if you think they are the most money hungry company ever, they wouldn't make their lives more stressful by banning legitimate players who spend money. It makes no sense on every level. 
---
For that reason, I believe them
---
you will have all the plans by the time you have all the steel for a strangler heart set.
---
&gt;everyone who disagrees with me is either a bot or a shill
---
sweet logic, there
---
'Dear BGS, I found a reference to some way to dupe scrip on this discord server. I can't tell you how it actually works or what steps are necessary to reproduce it, but they said they can dupe scrip! pls hndl, thx.'
---
Yes, that's exactly right. Carry on.
---
To be fair you've never lied.  Spun like a top, omitted detail, but never lied.   The trolls who are jumping on your bandwagon, they lie as they breathe.
---
I'm happy preordered day one, played PS4 beta day one, bought every atom point bundle, purchased 1st day one, and no regrets. I have a heavy weapons chr with tsewr gatling laser and a bloodied melee. And the one thing I've hated is the virtually zero AI NPCs which is coming and I'll be downloading that update again with a big smile.
---
Almost 200 and only launched 2 maybe 3
---
I still don't think the third point is a fair point at all, actually. Yes, after he was banned he got rid of a mapping tool the entire community used. But that was *his choice,* and more than that, *it's entirely irrelevant.* Dino was trying to provide "facts" as to why he got banned, and the only "reason" was number 2.
---
By that logic, can we appreciate games that got the time it needed to improve and evolve with free content and not a single additional payment.
---
Games like No Man's Sky, a development team that was so hurt by the backlash of its first release that they dedicated TIME and money to make it right!
---
Agility perk Enforcer. I don't even run a shotgun build. My strength is 1 and I play a stealth rifle build.
---
With Enforcer perk, chances are you will cripple at least 1 limb per shot.
---
I use this for Assaultrons, Sentry Bots, Deathclaws, Sheepsquatch, Scorch Beasts, ectectect.
---
Go for the legs. Want them to just not do anything at all &amp; sit there? One shot per body part &amp; done.
---
I WOULD be on other game forums yelling at the devs, if other devs did what Bethesda is doing. Also data mining isn't always banned for. For example, one of the biggest games right now, Destiny, has data miners and they have been doing it for years with no repercussions.
---
yeah I had the same problem, but the 2nd time I killed one it counted.  I have no idea why but my current theory is the SB must be on the ground for it to count as the 2nd time it was on the ground and I got the atoms.
---
Well, hello there, Captain White Hat.
---
You need to wake up and realize you are supporting a company that doesn‚Äôt respect you, and because of people like you that blindly support crap, equate any valid criticism with ‚Äúhate‚Äù, and continue to dump their money into bad games, game developers just keep doing it. Which makes games worse for everybody.
---
I think it has to be AT the fissure.  If you're too far away it won't work.  Even a little far away is too much.  That was my experience today, anyway.
---
You have to be in a fissure, not the enemy. So stay as close as possible to the fissure when you kill it
---
After using my big iron build. The single action is good for solid damage. I find that executioner‚Äôs, instigating, and anti Armour to be great picks on legendary effects. 
---
The only pistol perk I don‚Äôt use is crack shot mainly due to the single action having no real sights. 
---

There‚Äôs the build I run for it.
---
Your message has nothing to do with caring about anything, in fact you attacked anyone who does. You yourself are toxic. You are imposing your opinion on others, believing them too stupid to understand your reasons, and you know what's best for everyone, and it happens to be what works best for yourself.
---
Ironically the day that feature was added I found ansil on the light tower doing guided meditation before using my terminal. I'd been searching for weeks prior.
---
Well said
---
I know this is an old one, but, yo dawg, we heard you like patches...
---
Shaaauuun!
---
The NW event started a day early, I think that's why they ended it a day early.
---
However they should give people another day as the skeleton suit is  why people even noticed.
---
It‚Äôs not a problem for everyone. Mine works fine, hope this helps your troubleshooting. You may have to assign it like you would an icon, on the Atom Store page.
---
Then why don‚Äôt they acknowledge it?
---
Are you people gonna go defend everyone who claims they were falsely banned now? Gotta stay consistant. The only reason yall hate on bethesda so much is cause the outrage culture is currently targeting it. Maybe if you people realized that most games do these things and people still happily play and enjoy it you would realize everythinf yall raged about in fallout is wrong or stretched.
---
I‚Äôm sure there is. It is strange that the highway has no road out of the area. But maybe wastelanders will add some in. Or expand the map to reveal them. 
---
And other than walking or rowing on the Shenandoah river.
---
that was never a common thing.  it required some very specific and ultra rare set of circumstances.  
---
It hasn't been reported in months, but even during the height of the fear it only hit maybe 3 or 4 players out of thousands who ran the missions.  It never was a real risk even before they fixed it.
---
&gt; So my advice, if you find an exploit. Like if a little box pops up in front of you and says "press x to exploit" by all means, don't press x and report that. If you do something and think, oh wow, people could exploit that. I would advise you not to report it, 
---
You heard of an exploit.  You spent days trying to duplicate it, *you didn't report it*.
---
So now you advise others not to "click on x", not to report exploits.
---
You are dishonest.  Dishonest with the community, probably dishonest with yourself.  This is not a good way to live.
---
Bethesda: OK, here's a subscription offer for Fallout 1st Ultra-Premium Mega Super Edition, Now with Enclave Stuff! Only 199.00/month!
---
Go and defend non popular people who claim to be wrongfully banned otherwise your not being morally consistant.
---
Smart machine?
---
you saved up 5000 candy? wow
---
My claw is doing less damage .. about 100 less
---
whoever made the site probably has an alt in there that reads all the messages and uploads them to the github site
---
I understand and yes everyone is entitled to voice their opinion. I do value my money but I paid my money and have gotten way more than dollar amount of enjoyment. It‚Äôs just that I joined Reddit only recently to socialize with people that enjoy the game I like playing and mostly all I‚Äôve seen is negativity and it‚Äôs not unfounded. I just haven‚Äôt had many of the problems others are having with the game I guess so it isn‚Äôt trash to me.
---
I tried once alone when I was lower level. I went through all my resources fighting robots in the silo and then the game crashed right as I was about to launch the nuke. That was enough for me to not bother again.
---
Have an downvoted yourself üòÅ

I‚Äôm lone wanderer, so it would be nearly impossible alone. I‚Äôm level 110.

---
No turrets or any other power consuming items.  My house was a Scorch-beast Queen hut.  Meant for me to place near her for allies to utilize...so no turrets.  The vending machine was the only added power consumer.
---
Same way they pick locks and get into my camp
---
Redeem candy for prizes.
---
Because food builds are too crazy.
---
Yes, the people earning us millions, yeah they don't matter...
---
yup works for all wall types.. downside is that it uses more precious build budget than just one wall would.. interior walls would be the best!
---
Keep goin with it! Spread the item love.
---
Theirs nothing to respond to it got over 40,000 subscribers across all platforms thats a sucess compared to what you vocal minority screech out.

&gt;  Just as George Orwell used lies to tell the truth

What the fuck are you talking about?  Orwell wrote fiction and nonfiction. Where did he lie?  Or are you suggesting that when he denounced his friends to the secret police he was lying?
---
(1 month later) New Enclave paint job, just 2000 atoms a piece! 
---
(all-black with a tiny Enclave logo)
---
I agree...it was always a pain so eventually I settled on a camp build that only has 2 square spaces used as the bottom floor...allows me to place my camp almost anywhere.  It‚Äôs just a concrete floor with concrete steps....the rest of my building is up in the air.
---
Yes
---
"Yeah the guys who want to play our games don't have a say!" 
---
"I made a shitty ass game, half broken and half made, I still expect you to pay 60$ and buy all the content I made just because I realized it!! 
---
If people would treat bethesda purely as a business and not a game producer, it would lose its entire fanbase over night
---
Um, all of it.
---
That must be it haha, It's hard not to use traveling pharmacy and thru-hiker /sigh
---
Are you searching for validation?
---
Ps4 you change you ps4 user ID which didn't used to be possible until 6-8 months ago

Sorry for your loss of time now only if Bethesda was...

they dont want to get sued for stealing someones work/idea
---
&gt; I'm willing to believe that the map dude wasn't banned just for finding and reporting an exploit.
---
Well, yes, by his own account he *didn't report it*.
---
They announced close to a month ago that they want more time to work on it and delayed it to early 2020. Most likely late February or early March.
---
I suspect this is to cover them is case of someone suggesting they stole their idea
---
Could you clarify whether the report submitted by "someone from [your] group" to "one of the community managers in [your] group" included a reference to your account's role in testing for what the exploit was/how it worked? If not, you just leaving it may have understandably left BGS in the dark as to whether what you'd done earlier had any connection to exploit identification. That's no excuse for them not unbanning you once the whole thing was clarified, but would help explain the quick initial ban.
---
Defending the non popular people is a fight you won‚Äôt win. Getting the devs to reverse their decision with big people who can get a crowd going, will help lay the groundwork for the unpopular players to have their stuff fixed too
---
Which is interesting because they have been selling our ideas back to us with the fridge and tent, etc.
---
Nope. Since you asked, they‚Äôre not going to release it... out of spite
---
I have over 40k atm. It's been my only source of food since the first month of release.
---
jfc, someone must have *just* told this guy that's what all the cool kids are saying now.
---
Yeah, I gotchu. Even EVE has NPCs--and it helps facilitate (and automate) certain aspects of the game. 
---
That's fine.
---
I guess my stickler was more that I wish we could have some real human drama in rebuilding Appalachia. NPCs are fine. :P
---
Im level 77 and did my first solo run two days ago
---
Deathclaw hides used to not drop from deathclaws. There was a small chance of finding one in meat sacks around supermutants.
---
Thankfully that was fixed in a patch &amp; deathclaws now drop deathclaw hides. Spend 10 mins swrver hoping at deathclaw island or another static spawn location and youll get plenty now.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize it either.  Maybe it works without power...but it definitely has the connector on top of it...though this may only be for light aesthetics and not necessarily for the machine to function in trading.
---
Why are you even here?
---
I've got some names for you and video proof. Incoming!
---
Shillbot ?
---
I say play it NPCs will arrive yearly next year by then you have time to explore the numerous quest lines and build a character or two and gather some decent items. You'll be happy to be setup for when they arrive.
---
Eso is a good game. I play f76 but it's has a lot of issues. Eso fixed alot of issues I had with it since it was released.
---
I'm just chilling waiting patiently for Responder themed items to come out xD
---
&gt;  Yea it's called a cheat engine, but that doesn't mean he was cheating.
---
Yeah it does.
---
And the company, who knows far more about what happened than you - agreed that he was.
---
Um I think he means using fiction to describe and diagnose issues of the real world..
---
Easy there
---
In some cases.
---
This is a policy that is on pretty much every big company out there, especially those related to entertainment...
---
&gt;People do not just tell you about these things. There are rumors and pieces of evidence pop up, and I tried to figure out what they were doing...
---
'Durr, sum1 sez they dupe scrip!!11eleven' is not a reportable exploit.
---
Pretty much.  76 has been a front row seat to witness the fake news apparatus in action.  When people have no genuine interest in making things better, and only seek to troll and score points for their "tribe," this is the kind of nonsense you get.
---
And if you sit there scratching your head, trying to understand it, you never will.  Because you're not the target audience.  You are the proverbial "other" that is mandatory for the controversy to work.
---
&gt; Getting the devs to reverse their decision with big people 
---
WTF are you even talking about???
---
Developers don't make these kinds of decisions.
---
My main is lvl 340 been playing since beta with over 2200 hours, I've launched hundreds of nukes and have only one question when nuking prime are the enemies in glassed cavern affected by the nuke?
---
The whole purpose of reddit, to speak our minds, did I offend you?
---
WickedyChickady has a pretty good video guide for a lot of them. One of my favorite YT creators when it comes to FO guides.
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdilVsDTuT9oNtO6rYOlQTKFYM_eYmLFG
---
I don‚Äôt speak in memes , sorry
---
That doesn't just automatically make the company right either. They could've still made an incorrect or just shitty decision.
---
Hm. Is your generator in a different blueprint from the rest of your building? Like, when you move your camp, you've got multiple blueprints that contain parts of your camp aside from your whole building? Maybe set the generator down first?
---
Shut up and make a good game cunts
---
I'd like to help out, I need vault steel to make the power armor. I got experience in all raids so if you need any info or suggestions for expert runs, I can usually assist.
---
Thanks for the input. I had seen a few posts saying pretty much the same. And captainoob wasn't a big fan in his spotlight YouTube videos. 
---
Full disclosure here, I'm almost level 400 on my main and 120 something on my alt but I've been getting tired of just running through everything with my commando or heavy gunner/melee set up. So this is more for a change to keep things interesting and experiment with some of the lesser used play styles.
---
Do you remember the type of damage you were getting with your pipe pistol/rifle where you can stack the perks? I had considered that as well. 
---
And unfortunately I'm on ps4 but I really appreciate the offer! That is really frickin cool of you :)
---
Was it a 76 ban or a psn/xbox communication ban
---
People in this sub will nitpick and completely ignore the point at hand just to invalidate perfectly sound logic. I have no idea why I still read things in this shithole
---
Hahahaha
---
Not the 44.  Its outright junk.
---
&gt; then report to Bethesda.
---
Except that u/undefined7196 didn't report it.  He has an excuse, claims somebody else reported it, but when Bethesda review account activity they see some guy using the exploit who didn't report it.  They ban the guy and he starts bitching, saying he's a special case, demands a refund for his fallout1st sub (then lies online, claiming Bethesda refused to *cancel* his sub).
---
I have words to add to describe him, but I'm self censoring.
---
It seems it's more your fault since a quick Google search would reveal it only gives you a one star item.
---
I was standing near the edge of the fissure when I killed the legendary Scorch beast and it triggered.
---
I will be happy to buy Enclave and BOS stuff period. Modus shirt would be worth wearing in game lol
---
Xbox ban
---
Feels good.
---
i been playing since beta i wasnt aware intelligeence and charisma increased loot drop role rates. i thought luck did that
---
That is not what the OP is asking for. In fact, I don‚Äôt know WHERE the Bethesda user display name appears because on XBox it shows my gamer tag, and as the OP refers, my character names are ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù, you can have five of them so I don‚Äôt know how this process even comes close to addressing that. I clicked everywhere and there was no option to rename Fallout 76 character names.
---
That is why everyone is saying no.
---
Just use the photomode it will stop the emoting
---
ok thanks for the info, cant wait to get the full PA set.
---
&gt; The only reason yall hate on bethesda so much is cause the outrage culture is currently targeting it. 
---
Are you seriously sitting there saying you can't think of a single legitimate reason someone would have a problem with Bethesda right now? Everyone that has a problem with this game is just following the trend?
---
You need to pull your head out of your ass man.
---
Yes, I will believe the word of someone who put multiple hundreds if not thousands of hours of work into a community project more then just a random forum user.
---
Did you spend days with cheat engine bombarding different memory locations trying to get the purveyor to sell legendaries  for caps?  If not, don't worry.
---
Ok then why are you posting it here you make it sound like it was Bethesda's fault
---
It got nerfed in the sense that its not an endless stream of ghouls coming out of the clubhouse.  Still plenty of killing to be done and if you follow the fence around the outside, youll find plenty of radberries and gloam.
---
No worries. It was just a guess. I'm glad it worked.
---
It's more like he set up a camera at a bank to spy on people all day, with the hope of stopping a crime, and the bank found it one day and said, "WTF is this doing here?"
---
Now this is what I'm talking about. I've been experimenting in nukes n dragons but couldnt decide where to allocate everything. 
---
Have you noticed a big difference in hipfire accuracy with different revolvers? What about vats usage? 
---
I might try picking up an IE version instead now that you mention it, to help with that upfront damage bonus to compensate for the small clip size and fire rate.
---
Please cite one "shady tactic".
---
You should continue to talk to Microsoft about that. Bethesda has no control in there.
---
Do you have visual damage indicators turned on in your settings?
---
Are you sure they didn't think it was elicit items they thought you wanted?
---
Because i was banned dor using an in game term and wanted to see if anyone else had this issue? Whats thr issue man
---
I do I just haven't been able to test it and record all damages.
---
To be honest I don't mind the wait for quality content instead of something rushed, it shows Bethesda do care by delaying something they're not 100% happy releasing.
---
No i 100% think they did but thats not my fault that an in game item is labeled acid. Ya know?
---
Can confirm, I gave Bethesda $100 and they've been attending to my every concern.
---
The wiki shows it as having the lowest damage and range so I figured it would be the worst of the bunch. Have you used any revolvers with vats a lot?
---
"If you find an exploit, you should absolutely report it to us but do not continue use of it." 
---
I can't believe this was really necessary, but ok.
---
So you're happy to share that with us, or you'll just make a pissy little drive-by.
---
Drugs are bad, bro
---
title is misleading
---
That won't be coming.
---
I meant to put the s and i shall keep the s on tactics.
---
Same. Still hyped.
---
Yeah I suppose but I would refrain from using acid in the post maybe say junk....hmmm.... not sure that's much better. LOL!  Sorry to hear of your ban though that sucks hope it gets resolved quickly.
---
What controversy?
---
'Cuz suicide is painless...
---
See: All the decisions that YouTube has been making recently. More specifically, the YouTube-Markiplier debacle.
---
Yes hip fire is good at least with the single action. I don‚Äôt really use the other pistols in game on this particular style. If I‚Äôm crouched I can get a good hit off before needing to ads.  
---
Vats is good I can Burn a full cylinder in one use of vats. IF I‚Äôm not moving too much. 
---
Yeah instigating is good for most use. I‚Äôm carrying around 3-4 different single actions depending on the fire. Gun fu helps with groups a little but should always try and 1v1 mobs.
---
So if a cop.gets caught drunk driving or selling drugs the state should give him a free pass for all the community service hes done . He wasnt selling drugs on purpose though , he was just seeing who buys them .he wasnt drunk driving he was seeing how welll the cruiser controls under harsh conditions.
---
The more you post. The less sympathy i have for you
---
Have an upvote.  I am sorry that I have but one to give.
---
At the time, they did not know I was working on it, and intentionally so. As the group's primary purpose is datamining, I do not share any possible exploit details with the entire group as that could lead to it leaking to the public, which is not my intention.
---
I have done battle bots around 1000 times since my last plasma grenade plan drop lol
---
I evidently missed this part of the Halloween stuff guess I'm not to upset about it though
---
My jack o'lantern bag is working, try selecting it on the atom store, if it's already selected try unselecting and selecting it again
---
Did you use any "bad" language in any messages recently? Xbox can auto-ban you if someone reports messages that have any kind of flagged word in them. I've heard its also possible to be banned without being reported. Just from the system automatically picking it up.
---
It doesn't tell you what message/post your being banned for, so you don't actually know it was the lfg post.
---
Microsoft's AI thinks your trying to buy lsd lol.
---
So you would agree your initial ban made good sense?
---
When I did what I suggested on the PC my character's name changed.
---
You seem to be replying to some other post.
---
Aw hell yeah! That would be so dope!!
---
It drops from any ash heap event
---
/u/MrTestiggles was correct.
---
All five at once? Just the first one? I don‚Äôt understand how that manages your character names.
---
Or you know, you , yourself - who has no direct experience with what actually happened - could be wrong.  'Ya think??
---
It's from the monster mash event at watoga. It's a year round thing so you can still do it.
---
I‚Äôve gotten it 3 times from battle bots
---
And this is why I'm done with 86 and likely Bethesda entirely.
---
I've launched two. One at Prime Fissure site to fight the queen, it bugged and after the first 1/4 damage she quit taking damage. And the second at The Whitesprings, server crashed a few minutes after it landed. I haven't bothered with them since
---
Or you know, you , yourself - who has no direct experience with what actually happened - could be wrong. 'Ya think??
---
One of his 6 accounts got banned . That leaves 5 mule accounts with 3rd party software free to do whatever they want .
---
Ever hear of a sting operation?
---
Zow, the downvotes,  Are we supposed to pretend that Orwell *wasn't* a police snitch now?
---
How did I spin like a top? What details am I omitting? I have gone out of my way to give as many details as possible without directly posting the offsets and process to perform the found exploit. Many people are misinterpreting what I am saying, and in many cases taking my side with that misinterpretation, which is just as frustrating to me as it is to you I can assure you.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
On one hand. Hell Yeah!
---
On the other. I don't have Atoms for it
---
Historically, there is a precedent for tool makers reverse engineering game code.  It's how the first DOOM editors were made.  No one had the source code except id, and id wasn't providing the tools themselves.  They had to figure it out on their own.
---
But I think there's a very different thing here when you're dealing with a live service game that others are playing.  You affect their gameplay experience and part of the social contract we enter into is that we agree to play by the rules.  Hypothetically, what if testing for an exploit required crashing the server?  Is that something the bug hunter should have a free pass to do?  I think most would say no, no matter how "justified" the hunter might argue they are.
---
Why do you think I have five characters?
---
Where exactly does the O.P say he has five characters in his post?
---
I‚Äôve been in your boat. Hell I still am. For me I‚Äôm just trying to smooth out my build. Search for the perfect gear. 
---
Look for a squad, or discord group to join. Vault 94 seems to be fixed for the most part. 
---
Start a business, roll a new character there are plenty of things to keep trying.
---
man the paranoia is real... burrows crashing the entire server?  that's a new one...  
---
the vault 94 thing - it required some ultra rare set of circumstances to lose gear in there and got fixed swiftly.  The missions are challenging but rewarding once you figure them out and finally get that hard earned completion on expert mode.  
---
but hey at the end of the day the game is what it is.  There's activities should you choose to engage in them, and maybe starting an alt character with a completely different build would be a way to re-invigorate the game for you.
---
Well, there's no endgame and there's no content. We can't give you reasons to log in when they don't exist.
---
Cryolator is really only useful on SBQ iirc. Think that‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôve seen them used
---
They should allow this but only for Fallout 1st members.
---
Great.  So he spent days trying to duplicate it.
---
But he *didn't report it*.
---
I was about to hit the burrows up... but then about that time I seen posts saying if it said ‚Äúinaccessible‚Äù and you tried to enter it would crash the server
---
To paraphrase, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have it because I say so‚Äù.
---
I do a single action revolver run. And I do fine. All we really need is anti Armour really. 
---
Tbh I would rather see a new weapon that only comes in dual wield, over a mod, or perk.
---
Alternatively, if you have *zero* idea of what you are talking about then maybe you should stop talking?
---
Then don't.  Go to something else for a while.
---
No, it is better in every way, except for the need to use flux when crafting ammo. Awesome for Queen fights with the extra damage to scorched.
---
Successfully completed the photo and flamer challenges.  Killed 3 legendary scorchbeasts, no credit.
---
When one of the posts above says all that‚Äôs displayed is your username and he says he knows and states ‚Äúit‚Äôs dumb u can‚Äôt rename‚Äù. So he gets it, this isn‚Äôt the name that‚Äôs displayed, it‚Äôs the characters within the account (5 allowed). Which is also probably why he asks about changing character names and not usernames. 
---
We‚Äôre all on the same team here, I want to see his question addressed too. I have the same issue.
---
Have asked for mostly the same, have read others asking for mostly the same. I upvote, but they have said they are "rebalancing" weapons with Wastelanders... Fingers crossed.
---
I never knew about this!  I was selling the darn stuff at robo vendors! üòÇ
---
Nope use prime on my bloodied fixer.  Once you get the flux you actually make more ultracite ammo then standard so it works out well. Just remember to put on the appropriate perks when crafting the ammo
---
[removed]
---
Level 144 and I've yet to launch one. Probably because I'm endlessly distracted by little things and so I spend the evening bouncing all over the map. Launching a nuke would require some actual focus.
---
I'll never understand why anyone would buy steel.  With the scrapper perk there is a ton of it in the game.  Between Westek and Uranium Fever I net almost 1000 steel.
---
Ammosmith 2 and Super Duper, baby!!
---
Best to be naked if you're spending a long time in a bush.
---
if you do a debug you should be able to get their machine code and ban the machines serial.
---
You claimed plural, I asked for singular.
---
... crickets,
---
Why would anyone believe you at this point?
---
I think he was more referring to why would you waste your time on reddit page dedicated to a game which you apparently hate? Seems like a giant waste of time to me.
---
 But hey, you be you.
---
 why did you not reveal any of this new information in your original post that got gilded and thousands of likes? Only now after beth speaks up did you reveal these new details....
---
Usually find a 10mm when i leave the vault.  Not a big fan of 6 shooters.
---
I didnt think The burrows took excessively long, but it as still entertaining whle I was there.  And I marked it off the list of things I still need to do :)  No crash issues for me.  I carry the reward as a backup for my primary weapon.
---
Obtaining more backpack mods gives you a goal, even if it is kinda grindy to achieve.
---
Theres probably events you havent done, and perhaps a few places you havent discovered (at L151, I found a few new places in the ash heap over the weekend.)
---
Other then the difficulty in crafting enough ammo, cryo is basically almost as good flamer( which suffers from the same problem). Flamer has higher damage, but the slow effect of cryo, especially with critical hits,  is pretty sweet. 2shot is ok anti armor is better, furious rocks, and bloodied rules(of course).
---
Bingo....lol
---
You're making a lot of assumptions.  a LOT.
---
I am simply answering his question and telling him *what worked* for me.
---
They took away halloween stuff from NW a day ahead of schedule.  So theres that.
---
Zing.
---
Am I high or did you forget to change usernames to make this comment?
---
To paraphrase, "I don't need to explain myself to dumbasses like you" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It's possible. But I'm entitled to my opinion and I feel I'm probably fairly accurate.
---
Ok, just saying he‚Äôs asking about character names and you‚Äôre solving a username issue. Let‚Äôs agree to disagree and I hope he got some resolution. Now I don‚Äôt know how to post my question so it‚Äôs interpreted properly!
---
Open up atomic shop, featured, the amateur inventor paint, the second picture on the right
---
Because Bethesda has a great track record of getting their games to where they need to be, and community contributions have never played a part in improving their work at all
---
&gt; he said he reported an exploit through proper channels and they banned him? was he lying? 
---
No he's not lying, because *he said he didn't report it*.
---
&gt; Someone from my group stated that they already reported it to one of the community managers in our group, *so I just left it*.
---
Source: map76.com
---
you are high and reading the tag :)
---
I believe the dude's story about goodwill and hunting exploits, and initially my response to the situation was that Bethesda should look more into his case. I think he deserved that much for being a helpful community member.
---
But now that I'm aware of (I hope) all the variables, the problem is that he downloaded cheat tools to do his investigation (not a smart move), found an exploit and sat on it (not a smart move) and then continued to dig deeper (not a smart move). So I can't really support the guy's case anymore; if I worked for Bethesda and reviewed these details, I'd find them pretty damning.  
---
A permanent account ban still seems harsh to me, so I would be in favour of giving him the account back in another month or two and applying a 'no three strikes' rule that would see it permanently squashed if there are any future problems.
---
Last thought and a bit of a curveball: I find it weird that the map dude would shut down a site made for the community just to spite Bethesda. It's not like the site is bringing in tons of customers for the company, it's just a handy tool for current players, and so taking it away is only hurting the people he claims he wants to help.
---
These are super obscure patch notes. These are like the first set of patch notes Fallout 76 ever released.
---
&gt; Ok, just saying he‚Äôs asking about character names and you‚Äôre solving a username issue. 
---
1. Why do you keep saying that?
---
2. Why are you refusing to acknowledge that doing that I stated *actually changed* the *character name* that everyone sees.
---
3. Why are you being so dense about this?
---
Well it started good.... then the usual non-sense somtging about a lawsuit idk you lost me in the salt.
---
using a cheat engine in a game is a bannable offence, it doesnt matter if you dont use it. just like not turning on wallhacks in csgo but still having them is a bannable offense.
---
Your not inferior, just sad. Your like that middle age women who refuses to admit your in an abusive relationship.
---
I don;t believe i astrology either - just so ya know.
---
OK... Neither do I...
---
Also the imposter Sheepsquatch
---
Well at least this time I'm able to see all items. 
---
I couldn't see one of the Halloween bundles nor last week's red rocket bundle. Idk why.
---
He also didn't report it, so.
---
They did not know I had been working on it when they reported it after a method was posted publicly.  I agree, my initial ban was justified. I have opinions that bans would be unnecessary if they would just fix these things, but, even after a month now of knowing about this, they still have not fixed it. So I guess banning is all they can do. Which is, not fine, but what it is.
---
Ofc you have, i'd too if i were just looking for an excuse to defend bethesda
---
So exactly what I said?
---
If it says inaccessable it won't let you in because it's inaccessable. Happens with Biv occasionally as well just server hop.
---
I‚Äôll mod it for free for you on pc if you bring the mats
---
No, what I said. Now go away
---
Not to be an ass, but it takes far more than a hex editor to edit a game meaningfully.  Many games these days check for modified files on run-time, then there's also the resources actively in use in memory to be altered which may also be checked, etc.  Don't hate me, I don't hack etc I'm a developer, so I understand a bit about it and like to spread knowledge, lol.  But, you're correct in that editing or hacking games is largely PC-based.
---
Just like they tried blaming Micheal Jackson saying he touched little kids , why would he do that , he spent so much time helping kids and trying to make people happy .
---
I think I'm few steps ahed of you. 
---
I tried everything. 
---
-Helping new players.
---
-1 cap vendor where everything is 1 cap. 
---
-Free Backpack for everyone 
---
-Free Power Armor for everyone
---
-Free legendaries/scrip for everyone
---
-Free CAMP builds for everyone 
---
"Sounds good, doesn't work".
---
I guess I‚Äôm being dense, but there are usernames (displayed to other users in the game) and character names (displayed only to you for your character select menu) and he asked how to change character names which your solution doesn‚Äôt address. 
---
I can‚Äôt be any more clear but I‚Äôll let you have the last word, not interested in a battle of somantics with a fellow wastelands. Be well
---
If you could timestamp random events that the player inputs and use that as a random hourly fingerprint. You could tweak it so that ever game has a unique serial. Maybe even drop random packets for a trace. It would eat bandwidth but the 24 player limit would be an advantage to this.
---
Ah ok. I'm getting tired of automatic weapons so I figure revolvers would be the biggest change. Might go for a lever action also
---
You can get full suits for a little more on r/Market76
---
It started early and ended early
---
Prob just the Goblin Masks and Marine Helms.
---
But my man according to your stupid analogy you missed the part that he a) frequents the bank every single day b) has come up with a scheme that helped every single bank customer for months and no one before this said anything to him c) was in touch with bank management. But yeah sure spin the story so almighty bethesda is safe and sound from this evil hackers
---
I'm going to try again tomorrow, but I did get "An unknown error has occured" 1:1:0 from being idle too long.
---
Paintball gun, acid soaker, thirst zapper. Other dev room items apparently are still in the wild.
---
It's the first one I've seen that somehow managed to bring the French president into it
---
Ok, awesome, thank you for your help!!
---
Lol solid point.
---
I was able to fix it.  I had no generator initially because I had no power consuming items before the vending machine.  When I first built a generator it still didn‚Äôt work because the vending machine was on the 2nd floor of my house.  I then tried putting the generator on a small hill to make it higher...I was then able to plop down my House.
---
This refers to some Joe Smoe who sends them some ideas for a game or whatnot. They've obviously implemented many of the ideas posted on this sub. 
---
The difference being you have no copyright to the ideas you post on reddit. They are in the public domain the second you post. Same with Facebook every photo you put on there becomes public domain you no longer own or control them.
---
Btw its bethesdas fault not to enlist him as third party source since he has done so much for that shitshow of a company more than any of you fellers here
---
Obviously they should be doing a much better job with finding and fixing stuff than they are, yeah, but it doesn't surprise me they've got an auto-detect/ban set up for something like what you described. Actually, given the state of NW, it kinda *does* surprise me...but that's another story.
---
Either way, you guys have been doing yeoman's work with data mining, running down details BGS either won't or can't, and your map. Many thanks!
---
**First:**  
---
I feel like Bethesda's Customer support is misrepresenting the situation here, and not being transparent and honest.  
---
Have a long history of both being a critic and praising them, and it sees like CS is trying to force damage control over a situation they let get out of hand.  
---
**Second:**  
---
We are not exploiting, CS above is broad brushing and misrepresenting the situation involving the dataminers to try and spin the situation.  
---
Not being one of the people suspended or banned, but intrinsically involved, I do have an understanding of the situation and have been involved since they day they were suspended.   
---
**Third:**  
---
They are not asking us to **"exploit"** and we haven't been, and these have been in conversations and feedback we've had with Community managers.    
---
These conversations have mostly been though PM's on Discord, Reddit, or in my case, face to face in Dallas.   
---
They've wanted as much information as possible so the Dev's can nail down the issues and replicate them on BGS's side and then fix them.  
---
That involves replicating the things on our end, which is understood,  and sometimes involves the use of the tools.  
---
If the people involved were "Exploiting" they would be duping, or hacking in NW, or one of 1,000 other things, what they were doing was finding out the "how", reproducing it, and then reporting it.
---
Yea what this guy says.....I guess?  What now?
---
Im still searching for what this error code means, but im not having much luck finding it
---
You're welcome!
---
If you need to ask, then you don't want to know
---
Poor fella probably spent all day googling Political figures with low approval rates to find that one.
---
Nailed it
---
Chapters, when first released, are not considered DLC and you're forced to buy them separately with money, not crowns. What makes a Chapter different from dlc aside from ESO devs declaring them different? Whether you call them DLC or chapters is semantics, since a chapter IS dlc no matter how they market it
---
False. I still have the game on PC. I don't care if that account gets banned. I downloaded Cheat Engine and the hex table that is floating around. I messed around with all the hacks. All it took was Cheat Engine.
---
I even got into a NW match. Killed most people, got killed by one of 6 other people that were hacking. 
---
The best party? The hacks work in adventure mode too lol.
---
This game is a garbage fire on PC. So glad I switched to PS4.
---
Well this is a 100% wrong comment folks carry on
---
the mark of a skilled builder
---
Does it say in photomode on the challenge description?
---
Do you know about the rug glitch?
---
Who buys steel? It‚Äôs all over the place. Can‚Äôt spend the anmo? Take a baseball bat to the Morgantown airport and crack some skulls
---
This is a pretty common practice among big companies. I'm not the least bit surprised by it.
---
Lol. Well, now I really do.
---
&gt; **Stability:** Implemented a fix for an issue that could cause a server crash when being shot by enemies under specific circumstances. 
---
...That's what you call Server-Piercing rounds..
---
False.  Cheat Engine isn't just a hex editor, it also scans and allows modification of memory addresses.  Live applications have data stored in memory which must be manipulated to take effect at run-time.  Hex editors can modify files prior to execution.  Games can check for modification through checksums.  Purely hex editing cannot take effect while the file is already executed.
---
You are 100% correct, if they are lying, which I don't believe they are because I've worked with this people for a while, it would not be the first time.  
---
As for being afraid of bans for reporting bugs, it's something people have been since the B.E.T.A., it's one of the reason I've had such luck with my bug pages, people have DM'ed, PM'ed and chased me down in game to report bugs and potential exploits, because many are terrified of reporting them for fear of retribution by Bethesda, who has proved anything but consistent in how it handles things.  
---
  
---
&gt;Everyone says that reporting exploits gets you banned but he admits that  what happened is it was already reported by another player, but did  that player get banned too or were they spared because they reported it?   
---
I don't think the still banned people were banned because of reporting the issues, however if I'm wrong and it turns out they were I'm done with BGS and I'll condone the release of the information we've held back.  
---
The timing of the banns and the complete lack of Communication for 2 weeks, when TONS of other people suspended and banned at the same time got responses from Bethesda is however what is making people suspect foul play.  
---
As for NW, we can't post IGN's or other details because that's "Witchhunting" per the Sub's rules, but the Community Managers and Customer Service know who they are, and what could end up being catastrophic hypocrisy on BGS's end.
---
Very cool of Bethesda to finally respond. 
---
They were nice enough to share a video for everyone as well to help further explain the situation.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xy_H5uK8vk&amp;lc=z22ntx0g2rmafbzcsacdp43bcjj1wn3e1f5ymipkmqtw03c010c
---
I see a hex address in the table, and an option to lock it at a certain value. 
---
So what am I doing here then? No, really, please enlighten me. Am I freezing a hex value in memory? Why, yes I am.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 üò¢
---
We have UPN's and Discord handles of people, with video evidence, who were unbanned for "lack of evidence" or just issued warnings for weeks of hacking in NW.  
---
The larger problem here is Bethesda/Zenimax's customer service is erratic in how it's handling these issues, with some people being Ban hammered for a minor infraction, and others skating free multiple times for blatant cheating they brag about.
---
I did not download cheat tool. I have some memory scanning tools that is use professionally installed on my computer. I do not think they were ever used on this account though. I have stated this, a few dozen times now.
---
If you call working on it until 2 am and passing out "sitting on it" then yes. I sat on it. 
---
By dig deeper, are you referring to me finding another one and checking to see if it used the same method to see if there was just one exploit or two? Then yes I dug deeper.
---
Youre gonna sue?  Good luck with that and keep us posted on your progress.
---
Hmmm
---
Currently my long term project is to get All the serum recipes with my main. I want to always have one of each serum on my vendor at some point to both make profit and to help players out when they finally get starched genes and want to set up the mutations. I love those shops when I get level thirty. I want to have one of those. and holy shit collecting those recipes is WOOOOOORK lol. definately keeps me busy. I have long been maxed out on progression and dont really "need" anything but this project keeps me hopping. its not the goal its figuring out how to get to it that keeps me from being bored I guess. 
---
my next long term project will be to buy every plan I dont know on every vendor. I will try to get every plan in the game like you apparently have. the plasma grenade plan is a drop only plan eh?
---
Something is fishy here
---
I am not looking for sympathy. Just sharing my experience. I am done with this game anyway, I am only posting and responding to people to share my experience.
---
Yeah..... respec isn‚Äôt going to be atomic shop. If it is it‚Äôs just a free pick up. 
---
There is in no way they would put respecs behind a cap wall. Also there are many players that aren‚Äôt at max caps. 
---
If anything their going to make it as simple as possible. Reach levelX respec to 1 gain cool thing. Repeat.
---
Standard trolls has nothing to do with FO1st. Players have been doing this since day 1 only back then you didn't need to engage in PvP to destroy a camp.
---
I've had both a Two Shot FFR and Quad FFR and I prefer the Quad.
---
When they were new events, Two Shot was able to slow the Sheepsquatch and Project Paradise Foghorn Leghorn quicker, but couldn't keep it as easily frozen as the Quad.
---
Same as the queen. With the Quad I can totally freeze her switch weapons for damage then switch back to keep her frozen. Two shot still worked against her but took longer.
---
This doesn't mean shit if you don't debunk the rumors. Tell us why dedicated fans like the fo76 map creator got banned for reporting exploits and maybe we'll listen.
---
This may sound silly, but double-check for typos in the file name. 
---
Also, I know Reddit's format messes with spaces, but make sure the formatting looks like [this](https://pastebin.com/0NQ3ttNr). 
---
Remove "bFull Screen=1" since it's a duplicate and contains an unnecessary space.  Also, I think "fMouseHeadingYScale = X" may be missing a number.
---
Which means they had even more time to make a formal announcement regarding this. And customer support is now saying that it did end early, so this isn‚Äôt really a valid excuse.
---
clip the bench to a rug then place the rug inside with the bench attached.
---
Sorry man...I got it last night off Censor violence.. don't know what else to tell you.
---
This kind of stuff is why I read these forums. been playing since beta. I was unaware that the area was sealed off by the res ponders the whole time. 
---
saw the bridge and the swarm of cargo bots. (wonder if that swarm of cargo bots will be part of the story in wastelanders?) but never considered getting in and out of west virginia.
---
We ran into a 68 year old dude the other day.. 4 characters over 100 Nd he's never launched .. said he was too scared to run solo... So we took him through his first...
---
I remember the days of thinking that it couldn't be done solo... Now a solo silo takes 20 minutes without lag and he is part of a group that launches 12 nukes a night!
---
the only troll is you for saying that it's better than The Witcher 3 XD
---
Pretty sure a breach of security was found and reported that left accounts vulnerable, and the guy didn't use it to steal accounts like what was allowed...
---
Are the tools you used approved for use with the game? My impression is they're not, but I'm open to correction.
---
As far as your other two points, my impression is that you found the exploit, crashed, then continued to look into it without sending the report (yet?), which constitutes sitting on it and digging deeper. To clarify, I don't think you were doing anything with bad intention, but it does look bad if this is the case. So the ban doesn't surprise me or seem so draconian anymore, though I think it should be temporary rather than permanent.
---
Oh ok, I get you. 
---
To be fair, cheat engine is the most common such editor on PC.
---
Sad they made it so easy to cheat.
---
You say that like these devs have ever had their pants up.
---
Your the fool if you believe those die hards are 100% innocent. As well at believing the duppers are innocent for doing what they did. 
---
Just because they said one thing or Pete hinds said so or dec panel said that. Doesn‚Äôt make it so. Everything they‚Äôve said in the roadmaps have 90% been correct and has been delivered. 
---
Part of being a customer is believing that your money if well spent and that you are getting what you put in. Personally BGSA/BGS hasn‚Äôt done me any form of wrong. If I‚Äôm going to continue to be a part of their growth I have to hold on knowing that. If you jump ship at the first sign of wrong your wasting money that you aren‚Äôt getting back in the same value.
---
Lol
---
Eat a dick Bethesda
---
Only a couple. First was top of the world because rosie annoys me so much. Second was on a friends camp. That was hilarious, he was fine with it but didn't realize it would destroy his camp. So the whole time we are in the nuke zone he is getting more and more pissed while running around trying to rebuild his camp ignoring everything else that was going on around him. After that it just didn't seam worth it. I did back up a friend last night who needed nuked flora for a power armor build, first time I have done it in many months. I find it takes too much time and I"m always getting lost in the silos. Of course if I did it more often that would help.
---
Bethesda has a bad record for monetization and performance issues so far. As far as false positive banning and exploit shenanigans, I haven't seen anything to make me cynical.
---
I noticed the same thing a few days ago.
---
&gt; The worst part about the included BoS paints is that they don't even match the ranks Taggerdy was using or the power armor they were using.
---
Elaborate on this for me please. Cause remember that BoS didn't really use paint to signify rank until FO4.
---
I know someone already said it but Brotherhood of steel too please!
---
Yeah, definitely the most common for gaming.  There's many others for when it comes to reverse engineering, I was probably too programming-oriented with my responses.  Bad habit, my bad.  For gaming there's also an old one called ArtMoney, which I used to use in high school to cheat in Diablo 2 to have better items in single-player, just to save time.  It's definitely sad that it's so easy now, probably the main reason we have so many hackers these days.  I mean, people probably do still learn programming and how to modify things themselves, but I feel like every kid who wants epic items without effort will just download a program and use it nowadays, ruining it for everyone else.
---
Don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt play it. You might see something as a problem, others don‚Äôt. You should wake up and get out of the world that revolves around you.. you like Minecraft? Fornite? Among many others you probably enjoy, those are examples.. I think those games are complete shit and shouldn‚Äôt exist. Everyone has an opinion, keep yours to yourself
---
Can anyone explain to me why of the items listed in the "atomic sale" area only a couple ever show a discount?
---
Many enjoy the multiplayer, I don‚Äôt want a single player. Go back and play the single player FO‚Äôs if you want to live in the past
---
I don‚Äôt know about that, but an easy way is just scrap a roof and rebuild it. Repeat to complete challenge.
---
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies.
---
Gave up on that dream....then I gave up that game...
---
Probably not solved yet, they just reset.
---
Maybe you‚Äôre extremely small set of people. But the cases that have made headlines here on reddit even admitted to using cheat engine, not reporting it, using exploits, etc... It sounds like a lot of these people ‚Äúhelping‚Äù are more helping themselves first.
---
I now have a bloodied +33% vats accuracy fixer. I can kill any scorchbeast within a clip, and any legendary within 2 clips. I've downed some in as little as one 3 round burst to the head.
---
I set up a tent at fissure site prime and kill them in pairs, then go off to some other site like Westtek to look for legendaries, coming back on a 5 minute cycle.
---
It's gotten to the point where I honestly fear the scorched more than the beast since they deal more damage than thanks to the Fireproof perk.
---
Did you actually think this comment through or are you just offended that I'd dare to insult bethesda
---
Who do I believe? A company that has repeatedly lied to us or an individual who was active in the community and devoted his free time to add to the game and resources for the community *for free*.
---
Right, and normally that would be fine but when I remove the item I don‚Äôt get the budget back so I can‚Äôt replace it.
---
Have they said its coming in wastelanders?
---
Game Files have 9 Variations of the Ranger Armor. Grey, Riot (Green), and Desert with each of those having a Standard, Advanced, and Elite variant. The Standard Grey was the initial unlock for 1st and then Standard Riot was released as a free paint for 1st subs.
---
Would that be why they latch onto literally anything? Stealth nerfs! Trade steal glitch, hackers, battle royale, banning, etc
---
This is entirely on Bethesda though. Some server side checks would go a long way. Can't do this in WoW, Anthem, or even the crap that is Metal Gear Survive. 
---
I expected more from Bethesda.
---
It says "Take a photo at a Fissure site"
---
My girlfriend bought it.  It won't let her toggle it in the AS.
---
But where do we get the advanced and elite variants? Are they something thats coming in the future
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Thank you
---
No idea but becoming wanted hides all player icons.
---
It‚Äôs all pretty boring to be honest. More weapon and armour skins would be awesome. I‚Äôve been waiting for non camp related nuka cola stuff for ages. My metal armour needs an interesting skin to match my nuka t51 power armour.
---
What platform
---
I killed a legendary scorchbeast at a fissure to complete.
---
If you‚Äôre wanted, you can‚Äôt see anyone else on the map, but they can see you.
---
high level armor weapons and ammo
---
Nope, have not launched a single one yet. I‚Äôm like 120
---
Roads? Where we‚Äôre going we don‚Äôt need roads.
---
Dude. I hear you. I haven‚Äôt logged in and been excited to do something in ages.... so I don‚Äôt log in unless a friend asks specifically.
---
So. I hope you find something else to play that you can enjoy with that beer (I switched to being a space ninja)
---
Prime receivers on guns take 2 flux of various colors (I need 2 stable violet flux for a prime receiver on my Bloodied Fixer), ultracite ammo requires 1 flux of various colors (for example violet for 5mm, fluorescent for .308).  Some power armor mods require stable flux, like calibrated shocks on T-60 require 2 cobalt flux.
---
Not just roaches but fucking fireflies keep opening the door to my wife's camp. And then it lets the radstag in. Those damn animals are in cahoots I tell you!
---
they had it up in like an hour this week, kinda surprised me since normally they don't get it before i go to bed
---
What‚Äôs you GT I‚Äôll come take them 20 caps
---
Same. I grinded same as you did and was on my last match when it disappeared, with 4 hours to go in the event. How would I have known they didn‚Äôt really mean it would end on the 12th? If it began early and was to now end early, that should have been clarified.
---
lol yup and considering that pvpers exploit the wanted system to trick players into pvp it can actually be pretty hard to get rid of it. I would clear the bounty of a trusted friend but if its an unknown rando I assume he has 3 other players on his team ready to bushwhack me.
---
Very likely they will be 1st Exclusive to keep people subbed, much like the Riot Paint was.
---
Lmao dude you cant see other people when you're wanted
---
i am level 177.  just launched my first nuke solo.  if you need help, find me,  traceylorris
---
Well, I'm looking at the records right now and I'm telling you, you're mistaken... it's not possible... don't know what else to tell you.  
---
Side note: it's called "Census Violence" - not "Censor Violence".
---
I farm fusion cores for my laser gat. 
---
I farm queens but not for the legendaries those are a side benefit. I turn the flux into serums. then I dispense those serums to all my low level alts to easily reach vendor cap max with them. 
---
the eventual goal is to get all of the serum recipes but man they are expensive I have about 5 or 6 so far. 
---
after that I will start getting every buyable plan in the game for a long term project. 
---
after that /shrug who knows.
---
He said he tested the exploit...
---
Definitely not treasure maps. According to the game files, it can only drop from liberators.  It's a 3% chance, and once you learn the plan, it won't drop anymore.
---
/u/LudSmash
---
Edit: That's not fair of me. I don't know what the exploit was,but he did mention on his map76 message that they had tried the exploit. I said at the time, I don't think he should have been suspended, but people being dishonest about their level of involvement, has been rampant.d
---
I hear what you're saying, not trying to argue or cause strife.... I'm just saying it like it is...like I said.. don't know what else to tell you. I only remember it because one of the dailies that day was to kill with a commie whacker and I tried to build one at a workbench only to realize that the plan was to mod one not make one.
---
Based on past performance, I think I'm going to believe the map guy.
---
'Cause at this point, Bethesda's track record isn't good and the map guy hasn't lied to me.
---
Great.
---
Ah the naked bush dweller they have been heard of but spotting are rare due to their high shyness.
---
probably just lag try restarting the pc and relogging etc. 
---
on a side not I moved recently and lost a good portion of things I had built already. so there may be an issue with camp budgets currently.
---
I don't see how it matters of he used ce with that account or not. If you have ce on your computer at all it is a violation and cause for banning any and all accounts you own.
---
As far as I know the Maps76 author was using CE for the same reason the rest of the dataminers were, R&amp;D, etc.   
---
So not exactly who you are referring to...
---
Launched a few to get platinum on ps4
---
ü§£ I actually read that as skids first and thought this was some kind of Craig's list type postü§£ sorry
---
Because he knew it had already been reported. Was it a small mistake to not report it anyway? Sure. Does he deserve to be vilified because of that small mistake? Hell no.
---
I find they are quite viable when combined with stealth.
---
I mean some people might want more undies with skids but i would like something nicer for the first add üòâ
---
I've been playing Fallout since 1998, so seeing things come to this stings.
---
The fact BGS has done very little over the past year to keep promises, and outright broke some with the refrigerator, junk collector and Fallout 1st, has led to the situation where players trust the rumor to be true. "We're not lying this time," isn't going to work.
---
I realize whoever made this post is not a decision maker at BGS, but the decision makers may want to ask themselves if the current base of Fallout 1st players are enough to make Fallout 5 commercially viable, because they are likely the only ones who are going to play it after the alienation that has occurred.
---
It is one of the greatest reasons of sadness. In my imagination, multiplayer fallout was going to be like that: people getting together and building their own Diamond City, with fixed perks leading to jobs and specialists and small shops. 
---
Can't see why it is not so.
---
&gt; If you have ce on your computer at all it is a violation
---
This is so bullshit. Where do people get that idea from? Read the EULA.
---
The bootlickers are seriously out in force on this post. It's unbelievable
---
no it's not in the game yet. They always tease new outfits in the screen shots. The evil kaneval outfit was teased in a picture with a robot paint, so was the mohawk, raider clothes etc. N They are going to release it but they have not released it yet. It will most likely be a skin for the NCR ranger outfit. or it may be available to everyone for atoms. I'm not sure. it's not in game try relax man.
---
Im down with this....some heart boxers
---
I have to say as a retired military guy it makes sense that we were issued brown underwear. tactically they're less visible in the field if you have to squat in a bush to do your business but also I imagine hand washing whitey tighties in rivers and streams would turn them into a nice tan pretty fast. 
---
so yeah . they're not dirty underwear they're just issued  tan ones. just think of it that way if it helps.
---
I'd love either underwear options, or underarmor choices that could serve that same purpose.
---
try it in PvP on a long range sneaky sniper. . better Explosive radius then explosive shots
---
Lol, as futile as frequent flier points!ü§£
---
Nor did they use the rank structure depicted by said paint till fallout 4.
---
The west coast ranks are drastically simplistic by comparison
---
I was thinking more along the lines of ESO
---
The Bethesda rep said that the people who were banned were using the same exploit hundreds of times, so 400 would easily fall in line with that description.
---
Bethesda is responding to refute the allegation that it has been banning people who simply report exploits or the related allegation that Bethesda has been banning people who find exploits using cheat tools but never take advantage of those cheat tools. Here, they are saying that they are banning people who are actively engaged in exploiting, not just one time for a report, but hundreds of times. The poster I was replying to was suggesting that Mo0kish didn't understand how finding exploits works. That is incorrect. This isn't about finding exploits. The people who were banned were abusing a cheat.
---
Why make things easy for you when they can keep you playing longer by sending across the map &amp; back making drugsü§™
---
Tbh your comment set up a straw man rather than addressing the question: Why did the user not get a response to his request for lifting the ban after providing an explanation on his use of a third-party utility (ie reproducing the exploit)?
---
What kind of cheater would disclose his exploit openly if not for helping Bethesda fix it?
---
Draftiest Drop 1, standing in front of Charleston RR Station.
---
Forgot that, haven't been wanted in probably 120 Levels.
---
I have a question for you: do you really need that extra damage? My stealth vats commando is a killer and carries two weapons: an automatic anti-armor Tesla and a fixer modded to fire .38 ammo. Perks and points are so well- placed that I don't need to cause more damage. 
---
Another question: when was the last time you saw scorched Earth fail? We are all really powerful. Sooner or later, she falls. Five decent players are enough.
---
My bloodied faster fire handmade rarely leaves the stash.
---
And again Bethesda can't win...
---
Sparse additions to the atom shop?  People complain that they need to be focusing on adding more new stuff.
---
New stuff added to the atom stop?  Coin toss between complaints focusing on how everything added should have been free in the base game or complaints that they're wasting time adding cosmetics when they could be fixing the actual game.
---
Every.  Fucking.  Week.
---
Thanks for everything you did for this game even if Bethesda doesn't appreciate it.
---
Post it anyway if i have to see this game is awesome posts then we should the other side of why im not playin anymore posts
---
You stay right there, eta 4 minutes
---
I enjoy the reloading animation of the single action and prefer it over other revolvers... Is that weird? I have a bloodied explosive and love it.
---
Was just curious
---
Just like no one was wrongfully banned for "duping" get fucked.
---
Whats funny is that you think calling someone a boomer is an insult lol.
---
This is a really good point. I have tons of regular .45 ammo (like 6k) already. And I haven‚Äôt failed a SBQ fight since passing Level 43. 
---
But there is something almost magical about watching her health bar fall faster....
---
&gt;People **should** report bugs and exploits. (Immediately if they trigger them, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve learned.) But they should not be out there methodically testing them. Pass the info along and let Bethesda do that. Its not your job; at the end of the day, you‚Äôre just a player like the rest of us.
---
Because we all know how good Bethesda is with stamping out bugs quickly and effectively. /s
---
Bethesda games have always relied heavily on the community to help with bugs. He made a small mistake by not reporting the bug immediately, and then another small mistake by not seeing the point in reporting it again after he found out an associate had already done so. Those small mistakes shouldn't cost anyone a permaban, let alone someone who has  contributed so much to the game and the community.
---
Looks like someone got to you first
---
Yeah! Put more non-cosmetic shit into the cash shop!
---
when I was more active, id farm mostly junk for screws and adhesives.  But I will grab everything else if I have room.  I dont particularly go out of my way to farm legendaries tho, only if there's nothing else to do and I just feel like it I mostly go whitesprings and that other place far eastside.
---
You're missing the forest for the trees here, dude. In this context, finding an exploit does not mean coming across it through unofficial channels like forums or discord. The process these people are using runs an app called Cheat Engine, which can be used as debugging software. When a glitch or exploit are found, it is prudent to reproduce the glitch as many times as necessary to get the conditions for reproducing it correct, and to communicate them to the devs. This is helpful, because then the bug can be adequately tested by the QA team. If these players were using this software to work on the game for many months, then yes they would have been seen using exploits hundreds of times. It's part of the process.
---
Bethesda with their finger on the pulse of mediocrity. It's like they look at what people are demanding and just decide to make an ugly wallpaper and a new potted plant.
---
After they got a free win out of it, isn't THAT convenient.  You see the same damn thing every time, the cheater running around with unlimited stamina shooting into the air and killing everyone on the map and people like this guy running after him waiting for the game to end so they can rack up another win.  You'd have to be comatose to not notice that someone on your own team is cheating, it's already obvious to everyone else on the map just watching the kills broadcast one after another after another after another.
---
Know what you do if you get teamed up with a cheater?  You immediately report them, kill yourself and join a new game.  If you don't then guess what, when people start reporting the cheater you're ass is getting caught in the crossfire because for all anyone else knows you're cooperating with someone that's ruining the game.
---
It‚Äôs exactly who I‚Äôm referring too. He says on his website that he tried a lot of things, and then never actually reported it.... 
---
Let me add here so it‚Äôs not mistaken. I appreciate the work that goes into data mining, Map76 and FO76Edit... BUT
---
But in this case it was pretty obvious he tripped a bunch of red flags, rerolling or custom rolling weapons, that‚Äôs just dumb, research or not. I‚Äôm pretty sure that wasn‚Äôt asked of him, you or anyone in your group by Bethesda to figure out. He crossed a line and then he went on a verbal tirade against Bethesda like he was 1000% innocent. That‚Äôs become clear he‚Äôs not. 
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate that sometimes people lie about what they were doing or why they were doing it. I‚Äôm not even saying he did lie, but large companies don‚Äôt take such drastic steps without a fairly solid set of violations. They‚Äôd open themselves up to litigation if it was actually all willy-nilly.
---
All good.  I'm just saying, the data doesn't lie.  I suppose it's possible that there was some kind of rare bug, but it's much more likely that your memory is simply false.

Cheers

Fucking agree with this so much. 
---
The map is no different than a mod. Should everyone in the mod community be able to hack away andtontheir hearts content?
---
You made a map, you're not a hero bud.
---
101 qualifies for "hundreds" as much as 400 does. You're intentionally choosing an extreme amount to bolster your corporate shilling.
---
One of the most pathetic people on the internet are those that think corporations need people to white knight for them.
---
I have every revolver you can imagine, tried all combinations. In my experience, the best revolvers are (in this order).
---
1. Instigating + limb damage + low vats cost Western revolver. The best. That limb damage makes the build viable against everything that survives that beast of a first shot. 
---
2. Max level Somerset Special. (Anti-armor + extra unique damage). Very underrated. 
---
3. Bloodied + explosive low vats cost Western revolver.
---
I have been playing since beta. I have tried launching a nuke three times. All three times my game crashed during the process.
---
S'Lying.  Don't bother Bethesda, you've already ruined your rep, stuff like this is now expected from you. Just say you stuffed up and admit it for once jesus.
---
You're slipping
---
Yes, 8 3* and got 8 1* items.
---
This is the first direct statement from them since the shit storm stirred back up and it's a bold faced lie.
---
The whole thing that started this latest brouhaha, was the map76 guy. Who said, he found an exploit on an obscure website, and was banned for "testing" it, before reporting it.
---
yep that's my strategy, if you see a red diamond it's me, naked, in a bush
---
Leopard print banana hammock please, I would respec to berserkers just for this
---
The game just needs better guns, period. The handgun variety is terrible. Give me a PPC revolver, a Buntline Special or some kind of autorevolver.
---
not only that but just fast traveling to the map sometimes doesnt trigger the event. you have to check that you have the quest up and active for killing the queen in order to get credit for the event and to also be protected from pvp. its one of the reasons I never group and dont bother defending my work shops any more. 
---
I always forget to leave or enter passive mode at the correct time and either spray the attacking pvper with non lethal fireworks or I forget to enable passive and tag half the crowd at the sbq fight. add in the fact even if I prep right and dont screw that up i am not built for pvp and lose 90 percent of my engagements anyway I just dont bother any more. 
---
a guy takes my workshop its just his I dont even go back. since private server I hardly ever even bother with public shops. those always turn into a waste of caps and time for me. better to just stock up on fusion cores with all three power plants at once in private mode.
---
Hey Doc, youd better back up, theres not enough road to hit 88 miles per hour!
---
lol thank god.
---
Hey, give the guy a break. It's hard to keep up with all the popular stuff when all you do is post about FO76 on Reddit as if it's your job.
---
I understand that. The exploit needed to be confirmed, and the steps reduced to a repeatable list in order to efficiently and effectively correct the bug on the dev side. The more info they receive from reports, the faster and more comprehensively they can fix it.
---
Today's challenge has been a breeze thanks to this. Many thanks.
---
To increase range you need longer barrels. And even then, shotguns are useless unless you step next to the enemy and blast the legs before going for the head. 
---
Nowadays, shotguns are almost melee weapons.
---
Yeah, I only T-bag people who have been rude to friends and need to be knocked down a notch.
---
uuuh beth have devs that are part of this subreddit. simply speaking gets them down voted to oblivion. I wouldnt talk to portions of this playerbase either.
---
If you haven't noticed it, does it matter?
---
Its just honesty, the same honesty you asked for in your post. People give 76 shit for lots of reasons, some good, some bad. I just feel this one complaint truly is a self made problem.
---
Same here. Logged into my gfs account &amp; usually it just resets my emotes. It reset my bag back to sack lunch &amp; no option to equip the Jack o'lantern again
---
What this post says is a lie. Bethesda doesn't care about its fan base anymore. All they care about is money. I firmly believe that. 
---
Dammit elder scrolls 6 is gonna be such a pain in the ass.....
---
You're welcome.
---
That's genius
---
This is an out of context nothing burger. Yeah it says that but understand the context of it.
---
Also Bethesda in this sub on numerous occasions have encouraged and requested people's feedback. You'd know if you bothered to even look.
---
Why the hell am I still subbed here? Bye
---
Spoiled meat is what i ate
---
I like it because it is fun. Sometimes I send a request with a PM offering to buy 'x' for 'x' caps. 
---
Like, dude... Who's going to buy those missiles at 30 caps each? 
---
I have seen high level players do so. At the same time, some people just use the suggested price for some rare items and plans. I bought Halloween outfits for less than 100 caps more than once.
---
I get two extremes:
---
1. I try to jump and use up all my AP from my jetpack activating.
---
2. I try to fly and end up flying all the way up into low orbit, like a mile into the sky (very common during SBQ).
---
wasnt the marine helmet
---
I'm also on Xbox. I joined 3 rounds in a row to rest server population. Once the first server hit 52, I quit and reloaded. That server reached 52 with a new set of players. I quit and reloaded. That server hit 52 also. This occurred over a period of 3 minutes. These were entirely new sets of players, as I had friends in all 3 servers.
---
Johnny motherfcking Rico!
---
Ya it's fine now. I'll take the post done.
---
So get popular make resources and hack ingames and youll be untouchable?
---
Anything that you take that adds HP will "hide" behind the rads and when it wears off things like this happen, rounding down....Do not take or eat anything that gives over 40 HP bonus, you will literally drop dead when it wears off if you are below 20% HP in most cases...I run HP at over 450 so my hit points at 20% health are about 90 or so...If I take a buffout (60 HP) and it wears off I drop to 30 HP instantly..  Anything that has BUFF in it is bad for bloodied build....watch strong meats and such also...
---
I made the tools I use. So they are not 3rd party tools, they are 1st party tools. Ironically though, my map was an unapproved 3rd party tool that gave everyone who used it an unfair advantage over those who didn't. I can use it, as for me it was a 1st party tool, but it is technically a banable offense for everyone else. Which is ironic because all of this is over me taking it down to begin with. It is all grey areas and people are always fine with their shade of gray.
---
Trading communities sell everything at really high prices. Random shopping in the Wasteland I have never paid more than 4000 caps for God Tier √≠tems. But again, I am patient. Sooner or later, your dream weapon shows up. Or something good enough to wake you up. 
---
800 caps for an instigating + extra vats hit chance low weight combat rifle was a happy day for me.
---
The problem is, you could be a great person, fun to hang around, fun to play FO76 with, put in lots of your own time and sweat and energy and make an amazing tool for the community, find a horrible bug/exploit/security flaw and report it to the company for the common good, AND you could still use that exploit for your own gain or leak it to friends to abuse.  You could do all these things, they are not mutually exclusive.
---
I'm not saying this guy did this.  I'm saying that it could happen, probably has happened with others in the past, and none of us will ever really know for sure what happened based on what people say on reddit of all places.
---
There is usually more to the story, but that doesn't mean we get to know the rest of that story, ever.
---
Except its against destinys tos as well. And doesnt justify breaking it just cause they havent taken action. If they ban them thier within thier right just like any mmo.
---
Wondered what was up with it.  Kept building benches and didn't see they were moved to roof...
---
u/aten_ra is a known data miner, who has been in direct contact with Bethesda to help them fix the game. They obviously don't have an issue with dataminers who help the game. Here he is in this thread, talking about how Bethesda has requested info from them regarding bugs and exploits, including precise steps about how to reproduce an exploit.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dvfup2/players_are_not_banned_for_reporting_issues_andor/f7cu3jl
---
How is someone supposed to figure out those exact steps without experimenting over and over?
---
Thanks
---
Bungie is well aware of them. They don't take action because they're harmless.
---
Also, not the point, but neither Destiny or Fallout 76 are MMOs, so I don't get why you made that point.
---
&gt;101 qualifies for "hundreds" as much as 400 does
---
Lol wut? No it doesn't. Say it out loud "one hundred.....and one." A singular hundred. 200 is when "hundreds" comes into play.
---
I farm junk pretty much all day. It's the one thing everyone is looking for and never has enough of. With Fallout 1st and the unlimited scrap box business is booming for me! I've always been a junk hoarder in Fallout getting max carry weight and picking up anything not nailed down so now I'm really back at it again. I just hop on a few posts here on Xbox left and right and suddenly find myself at max caps again.
---
I'm the kind of guy that likes to find accounting errors, and root out corruption.  I'm just gonna break into your bank tonight to count all the money, just to make sure it's all there.  Whoops!  Is that the po-po??  Hey I'm just trying to help, get these cuff offa me!!!
---
Cripple the legs. Big bad enemies need to be crippled.
---
What did you lie about?  For fuck sake look at the manifesto posted to what used to be your site, it's a sob story designed to omit key facts to paint you in the most positive light possible and with all of the upvotes and awards and "news" sites picking up how big old mean Bethesda punished you for doing absolutely nothing wrong it worked like a charm.
---
How about the convenient lack of mentioning Cheat Engine?  From your side of the story you just stumbled on a bug and got slapped down for reporting it... instead of the actual story of using a tool you're 100% not supposed to be using and getting caught using it. Whether your intentions were altruistic or not doesn't matter, the terms of service doesn't have special clauses for data miners and wannabe bug hunters.
---
Or how the story evolved from you personally reporting it to "we" reported it to eventually "someone" reported it?  Your original story drew a direct line of cause and effect.  You reported to Bethesda, they saw the report, they banned you.  But the truth?  Someone else reports it, Bethesda goes looking for people exploiting and since you were one of the people doing the exploiting you get hit.
---
And like I also said your manifesto is at least 75% padding designed to feed off of the standard Betehsda hate to help push your story along.  Did your lack of patience for a 1st refund or anger over NW exclusive rewards have anything to do with getting banned?  Fuck no, but everyone hates 1st and everyone knows NW is a shit show so BOOOO BETHESDA BAD BOOOOOOO.
---
Where do you get your technical data?
---
How many times did he test it before reporting it?  I'm just curious to know.
---
You need the subscription.
---
Bottle Cap mines are still in the wild.
---
What if you found a breach of security, making you a good guy, but also you were caught using CE for other things in the game?  I mean, that would be awkward.
---
I use to all the time i made bullets alot of them
---
Always the whitesprings bunker, in the room with a thousand desks (I think the military wing). I also always check desks, filing cabinets and safes. Seems like it would take an impossibly long time, but didnt end up being too bad
---
I have 1st I'm just saying there's an actual picture of riot armor(not the paint or NCR ranger armor) in the atomic shop.
---
Then try the infamous unarmed + unyielding + mutations + unstoppable monster build. 
---
I tried it just to see if it was powerful... Every punch I threw before dying (rads) took one quarter of the Queen's health. Crazy, senseless damage. Thousands and thousands.
---
Hate it when they can't elaborate on something that should be pretty straight forward. Cookie cutter response and directing you to fill out a ticket that'll be looked through in a week.. Hope they fix this, I saw tons of people saying the same on twitter.
---
Im on ps4 psn zeronial, I got experience with all 3 raids.
---
Hmm sorry not sure what you mean. I see ‚Äúranger riot paint‚Äù and that‚Äôs all.
---
I am always wary of those with wanted status. Most of the time anyone with a wanted level has a team in hiding, or an OP legacy weapon and will instagib you, then continue to farm you for all your caps, and will wreck your camp just for the hell of it.
---
I really hope they do. Thank you for the support.
---
Fallout is an mmo. Sorry.
---
At yes, you've seen them, the legend. I went and saw that movie in theaters the day it came out, quality moment. As good as going to a guns n roses concert, well what I imagine them being like... Never been to one sadly
---
Interesting thanks for the info, I was positive I got the plan from a treasure map maybe I was wrong. Wouldn‚Äôt have said so, but I was sure I got the plan myself from both methods.
---
&gt;There are rumors and pieces of evidence pop up, and I tried to figure out what they were doing, because the trade market, which I am/was very active in, was starting to be affected. I wanted this to stop.
---
When your house gets broken into do you call the cops, or do the investigation yourself?  
---
If I stop a robbery should I get mad when the cops also arrest me because it turns out I stopped it by using an illegal firearm?  
---
I'm sure your response will be "but Bethesda wasn't doing anything." Guess what? It's their game. It's their prerogative. If they don't want to fix it, stop playing. Oh wait, you have to stop because you played vigilante and think that because you coded a map you should get a pass. Lmfao.
---
Perma Pants down.
---
There're more version of the riot armor coming, but yeah, the one in the new laser skins is definitely not the basic riot armor.
---
I try to imagine the server trying to deal with four players plus four companions, everyone shooting heavy weapons, and all I see is lag.
---
possibly future atom store content.
---
Hundreds means more than one hundred. 101 as "hundreds" is grammatically correct.
---
Sorry you're too stupid to know this.
---
Did they fix meathooks?
---
Community contributions are why they continue to get worse at QA. Because they know they can. If everyone showed their displeasure by actually not buying their games, instead of just crying on the internet, I bet the quality of their games would have improved a long time ago.... or they wouldn't exist and we wouldn't have to be having this conversation.  
---
At the end of the day it's their game. If they want it to be broken then that's their prerogative.
---
U fucking big brains are giving TEMPORARY suspensions to actual hackers and cheating fucks, yet u PERMINANTLY ban actual players who reported game breaking glitches and bugs that they confirmed themselves. No fucking wonder nobody want to send you confirmed glitches or bugs becuase u fucking morons ban the completely wrong people. 
---
I cant get over how badly you have handled the situation.  Not even an indie developer whose devs are all straight fresh from graduation and making their first ever game would make such a fucking stupid mistake like that.
---
You are incompetent 
---
You are untrustworthy 
---
You are out of touch 
---
And you deserve every little piece of hate and negative comments you get. Nobody wants to help you becuase at this point, you dont deserve it, and you havent shown that u appreciate it, only that you think the people who report issues are as bad the people who abuse them. Its disgusting, from a once great developer, its fucking disgusting. I'd love to attend ANY meeting regarding fallout 76 just to see what the fuck goes on in your guys heads when dealing with these situations.
---
This is a known and persistent bug. There was a video posted on it a while back with a fix. Delete all blueprints, place all stored items, empty containers (fermenter, punch bowl, trick candy bolw if you have it). Then hop servers. I'm not sure if the person also emptied their vending machine, but I'd go all out for a fix.
---
101 would be a single hundred, not hundreds. 400 is on the low end of "hundreds," especially given how frequently people are reporting exploits on PC.
---
You don't seem to know how numbers work, nor do you know how grammar works. You also don't seem to understand what's going on here. You are so toxic and hateful, that when you see me trying to correct false assumptions and inaccurate statements, you see a shill for Bethesda. I'm a shill for common sense, logic, and facts.
---
Yes, ut not enough to invest in INT, if you have more INT you need for situational perks then sure, but it only adds damage to the 20% that is explosive damage.
---
Yeah all I seem to be getting is one-stars too.
---
Paint can be applied any time to weapons
---
Backpacks you have to specifically **craft** a new one, as the selected skin
---
I bet he would play longer if he was excited to do something that is actually rewarding
---
Revolvers don't have silencers
---
It's not NCR Ranger, it's Charleston Police Department.
---
Nope. 101 is "hundreds".
---
Also this is a language question, not a numbers one.
---
Literally Google it. Every source will tell you the same. 
---
Of course you won't Google it because you're not the kind of person that knows how to admit they're wrong.
---
It normally means the vendor is at or close to the cap limit. So it's kinda like stealing that you pay for.
---
Why am I not surprised that even when Bethesda is in the right they're *still* demonizzed and people like you act like they're still the asshole who's 100% in the wromg?
---
It‚Äôs funny, after posting this I got three three stars in a row. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Their issue for not locking up properly
---
I‚Äôve picked my way into someones machines before and brought their stuff
---
Powered doors or bust!
---
Bethesda has a product. buy or do not buy said product. respect, emotions of any sort are completely irrelevant. it is a business transaction and I have gotten plenty of entertainment from every dollar I have given Them. They own the product, they set the terms of the deal,the only thing you can do to influence them is to choose wether or not to buy things. that is up to you. as a happy customer what i spend and how much is none of your business and I do not care if you approve or disapprove. 
---
I do not "blindly" support bethesda I am completely on board with them as a customer so far and think they have done ok. of course they could have done some things better and a lot of the critisism is valid. 
---
I don't equate all criticism with "hate" but I do suspect an astroturf campaign is being carried out by a player base spoiled by a generation of free to play games. nothing is free, since games went to free to play the quality of the games and the IQ of the player base has dropped. if you want the quality of games to improve subscriptions will do that. players who are dumb enough to think "free" exists and entitled enough to demand "free" things are also the players who do not have money. If players do not have money or out of principle players will not spend money why on earth should Beth care about keeping them as a customer.
---
Holy shit this is sad on so many levels. I am glad I don‚Äôt play this game anymore. The incompetence of Bethesda is astounding.
---
I'd love more vegetables/fruit to plant! I already have a large farm, I'd love additions. So I agree with you 100%!
---
 Personally I wouldn't buy off them unless at least one is powered.  Honestly, there are simple ways they can protect themselves from this so I can't be all that down on you.
---
Awesome
---
I think my main character is 147 or so and I haven't launched one yet.  I HAVE used a nuclear briefcase once in NW.
---
He reported stuff through us, Eck and I, because he knew we had the "ear" of Bethesda for things of this nature.  
---
The problem is Bethesda's customer service/support ISN'T doing the work in many cases, I've personally been "shunted" and had tickets closed on me half a dozen times, and they are erratic with how they assign suspensions and bans..
---
The bottom line is you would be better off with a bloodied rifle, commando, or heavy weapon.
---
My suggestions are only geared around making non pipe pistols play on the same field as other,  objectively better weapon classes
---
Heart Boxers or Riot
---
He was reporting them through Eck and I, because we had the "Ear" of Bethesda and almost everyone thinks the Tickets go into a giant waste basket.
---
Kind of a dick move really. It‚Äôs locked for a reason, so chances are they got little or even no caps from the buy. I turn off and lock mine behind level 3 doors but I don‚Äôt really trust people to do the right thing so I put 20 level 3 locked doors on the bungalow with all my vendors in it.
---
this JP . I do not like fortnite. I have posted 0 times on their forum
---
I get that, but this player was obviously a higher level due to multiple 3 star max level legendaries they were selling. Should the impetus be on the vendor to close up shop via putting doors or walls up to prevent shopping or as a buyer to not buy stuff when machines are unpowered regardless of where they are?
---
Yeah, I saw someone compare it to letting a bank (for security reasons) know there's a hole in the outside wall of their vault so they can fix it. I said no, it's more like drilling the hole in the wall (to test their security) and *then* letting the bank know about it so they can fix it. And I say that because you have to use cheat engine (the drill, in this analogy) to even breach the security (wall of the vault).
---
Hold up, the Acid Soaker and Thirst Zapper were in the game?
---
What the actual f-
---
*Bethesda, add it to the base game like right now*
---
He put the word &lt;sarcasm&gt; on the end.
---
I usually agree, but I couldn't tell if they were unpowered or if the power source was damaged and just not working.
---
Moving a vendor sucks. That's why we turn them off. I'm not redesigning my camp everytime I'm full on caps.
---
Im an experienced 200+ player thats done all 3 raids, if ya need someone, I'm more than happy to help since I need vault steel.
---
uu what a smart reply
---
Absolutely. I think they should have every harvistable plant in the game available for your camp.
---
People can still buy from your vendor even if it has no power to it. the only thing power does is make your camp appear on the map to the rest of the players. if someone stumbles across your camp on their travels, they can definately still buy stuff from you  even without power :)
---
Look at you snowflake ü§°

Same answer, Pal
---
Vaults were not for military training they were civilian residents.
---
Then I approve this message!
---
Its fun, the number of hackers and aim botters is a little dumb. Im a 73 and average 4-6 kills a game. But there are some VERY specific names who I literally see arcing bullets. They have been around forever aswell.
---
only play occasionally and my highest level character is only lvl 70 but I don't plan to.  Part of it is I've never really been a fan of wearing powerarmor in any of the Fallout games, and I'm a filthy casual that likes to come up with character backstories and kinda role play my characters with their weapon and clothing/armor choices so I don't really need the 'endgame' content and materials for my style of play.
---
Just launched my first one last night at 140
---
Glad to help.  For some evidence, here's the list of all records with references to the Bladed Commie Whacker plan: https://i.imgur.com/Iy39U4R.png
---
Item 1 is the actual mod itself.  Item 2 is the Liberator loot list.  3 is a footlocker in an inaccessible "dev room".  4 is a list of items that can't drop in Nuclear Winter.
---
I understand that, but if you're going to sell stuff at the level this player was (all machines filled with 3 star weapons, armor, and uncommon to rare plans), shouldn't you adapt your sales are to account for that? When player vendors were new, I was on the receiving end of going over via vending, once. Then I adapted my space to prevent it happening again.
---
LOL I am in the same boat. I am 363.  my heavy gunner strolls through hell casually smiting everything around him and taking 0 damage. even in a queen fight theres no challenge. I still enjoy my main most because of other players atmosphere etc but actual gameplay can get super boring sometimes. so my alts are all completely different types with a pistol user being one of them. they all suck in comparison to my main. which is exactly why I break them out and tinker with them from time to time. after I get annoyed at all the tedium and suckiness of my alts I go back to my main and appreciate him more.
---
Ooooooh Shenandoah
---
I think total bonus is 12% or so since it‚Äôs only a 60% boost to the 20% explosion prefix.
---
Will do!
---
Not your fault. I capped out today when a guy bought up a bunch of plans no one usually buys. Lost around 2k. I ran in and shut down the power while he was in there browsing and logged out. Logged back in and locked the room, transferred the balance to a mule.
---
Are you a teacher giving an assignment?  What info can YOU give? The attempted name-calling is a violation of this subreddit as well as being childish.
---
"One hundred...and one" is more than "one hundred".
---
Or are you really that bad at counting?
---
the issue with you logic is they have lied that 90% of everything they delievered. we expect as gamers complete packages not half backed attempts. every time this game updates 10 things go wrong. its 1 step forward 50 steps back. all thje backlash bethesda is getting for their greed and misdirection is well deserved and backed by evidense. when loyal players are being banned for helping them find issues then oyu know the devs are wrotten. not the floor devs mind you the ones running the show are to blame
---
from what i understand and whats out there its supposed to be in it because we havnt gotten it yet despite having to supposedly have gotten it already but was never announced of any delays. they may not even be doing it.
---
My math might be different but I get 15% from mine. TSE lever goes form 285 to 335, imho 50 points of damage is nothing to scoff at.
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about.  In this case someone on his testing team reported the breach, he just went to bed after the drilling test, and after using prints at the crime scene he got nabbed (i.e. banned).  I'm just saying it's not at all surprising they got banned.  I don't know why everyone is *surprised pikachu* regarding all of this.
---
So you knew why it was off, it has happened to you, but you still think he should have stored the vendor instead? You knew exactly what you were doing, and that the other player would get screwed over.  Bad form.
---
The update states that he doesn't remember if he used it on that account or not. 
---
He also doesnt remember if he had exploited items in his inventory or not.
---
He also tested the exploit for multiple days AND failed to report anything once he found out a friend did.
---
Which honestly makes him look like he is either hiding something or that he was so amateurish that a ban isn't a surprise.
---
Ive said it before. I like the guy. I like what hes done for the community, but that kind of behavior will get you banned all the time from a lot of games/companies.
---
I record everything I do, everything I play. The problem is, I bring cold hard proof. And yet nothing happens. And I mean Iv seen dudes flying under the map, flying in the air, arcing shots, shooting thro walls, mass nuking "that ones rare guess it calls to much attention", but nothing is done, I still see these people, after a ban wave they go away for a bit but are back in a week or so.
---
But that game also has a subscription and an atom shop with even more outrageous prices I don't know if you aren't aware of that
---
He never reported it; per hisbown website update on the 11th. He spent 2 days testing it out, doesn't remember if he had any exploited gear on the account or not, and failed to report anything because a buddy of his already had. He got banned the next day.
---
Two days of testing an exploit he heard about. Was getting results, although not exact ones. Zero reports; based on what he said.
---
No...I didn't know why they were off. I tried to determine if the power generator was off or damaged: it was behind a locked door. There were many lights in the building, and none of them were on. There was a Closed sign over the door, unpowered, right next to an Open sign, also unpowered.
---
Go with sentinel, I have cavalier pieces and it's no help when I'm trapped in a corner with crickets up my booty hole.
---
I would probably play for the same amount of time but just enjoy it slightly more. I'd made berry mentats and use them instead of just selling my mentats
---
Bottom line is what Bethesda said in their op about people using cheat engines
---
I have an Xbox One X with internal SSD and wired ethernet connection 120Mbps.  The framerate in NW is terrible (and it's not great in adventure mode either).  The game is just isn't optimized for consoles.  I also play on PC and there it's silky smooth..
---
Serious question and I mean no harm in asking this.. why are any of you still playing? I understand if you really enjoy a game.. but how many times does this game and Bethesda have to fail its player base to warrant abandoning the game?
---
A few months ago it just wasn't happening as well as badges from the dailys - they fixed it eventually (?).
---
I believe they fixed it by disabling Survival. the players who lost their stuff were in survival and after crashing, loaded into Adventure. That's where the loss kicked in I believe.
---
Not sure this is the place to ask for handouts
---
Any mobs can open doors in this game no matter if they are humanoid or animal, arms or not :P It's just like magic!
---
You can take someone's bag after the queen fight and say you didnt know they were coming back for it too. Still it is just something you should not, but totally can do.
---
Srry
---
Like maybe limit it like turrets or something but why can't I figure out how to grow plants when I can make a fusion generator out of old spoons and microscopes?
---
Show me a game that runs 100% perfect. Zero faults, zero crashes, zero backlash. 
---
No we as gamers feel entitled to have games earlier and earlier each year. That‚Äôs why we get games half baked and missing content. 
---
Again those LOYAL players ‚Äúread‚Äù a TOS and agreed to it. If they decided to break it by exploiting the game then all bets are off. As per my last bit about those loyal players. How many of them do you think abused those ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù exploits making items and caps for themselves before informing BGSA?
---
As for the greed. Would you rather BGSA pull a black ops 4 and drop loot boxes on us and make 76 a true P2W title? So what they charge 10 bucks for a skin or 7 for a fridge, or 500 for a camp item. I‚Äôd rather spend 20$ a month on little stuff I really want. Over spending 20-30$ on a loot box that might have the stuff I want. 
---
That‚Äôs the only thing I agree with. Dev are doing the best they can. It‚Äôs the project leads that need to step out in the light and start being clear about stuff and stop telling the devs what to say/read off the cards.
---
Ngl I‚Äôd kill for a house boat camp.
---
I am not looking for a free pass for anything. Never have I once demanded that my account be unbanned. What I demanded was a response to my ticket. Banning me is fine. I broke their TOS just like everyone who has used my unapproved 3rd party tool, Map76, and had an unfair advantage by seeing where every item in the game is. The irony of that seems to be lost on everyone. It is their rules and their game. I think they should care what my intention is, but guilty until proven innocent I guess, and again, that is fine, it is their company. Others should be aware of it, which is why I mention it at all, but it doesn't piss me off.  What does piss me off, is their lack of communication and refusing to respond to their paying customers when they contact support. This public half ass directed at me response is the FIRST reply I have gotten on this. And it is only after thousands of people got outraged and it was covered by numerous news outlets. That is what it took to for me to get a response. 
---
This is the customer support I fer as a player. I was not given a chance to appeal, plead my case, asked questions, asked for evidence, or even told. "Sorry you are banned.". Complete silence, no response until this.  At the end of the day I am " just a player like the rest of \[you\]." And that is how they treat their players.
---
I'd kill for a house boat but IRL
---
Always wanted to have a boat. Sail the world and whatnot
---
No clue where I got mine but I already know it somehow.. trade/sell it to ya whenever bro.
---
So the aimbotters were sleeping then I suppose.  ;)
---
Badges from pioneer daily's was fixes, but its still a rare drop sadly.
---
No, he‚Äôs not just a player like the rest of us, another player would not go out of their way to create tools and websites to help other people and better their experience of the game, another player would not find exploits just so that others can‚Äôt abuse them, he‚Äôs literally doing more than what a normal player would do just for the community, he‚Äôs trying to improve the game in the best way someone who isn‚Äôt a Bethesda employee can do and yet he got punished for it, you say the average joe won‚Äôt ever do the exploits he finds yet every glitch that has been discovered since release has been abused by lots of regular players
---
Would you rather have lots of people exploiting so Bethesda can notice it or have one guy report it directly to them before those exploits become mainstream and abused by many, obviously he isn‚Äôt above the law and doesn‚Äôt deserve a get out of jail free card, he wasn‚Äôt mad about the ban, he was mad at the terrible customer support that not only refused his refunds but ignored his cries to them as well, and it‚Äôs not just him suffering either, so many people get banned for no reason yet NW cheaters literally carry on as if they do nothing wrong, you can‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs fair that someone who‚Äôs made the game better for a lot of people and has actually put effort to help the community can‚Äôt even get $14 from the very same game he put all that work into
---
I just checked it out. You‚Äôre absolutely right.  Despite the lower damage, the combat shotgun is probably the best shotgun overall.
---
Also, have you found any real benefit to armor piercing magazine mods?  It‚Äôs what I typically use on rifles, but I don‚Äôt see any appreciable benefit to shotgun damage.
---
Unban the map guy you fucks
---
The problem isn't incentivising people to report bugs. The problem is a two-fold issue with Bethesda:
---
1. They don't deal with bugs either quickly enough or adequately enough the first time around, often having to refix the same bug.
---
2. They punish those that actively help them find and report these bugs.
---
It could just be due to sheer incompetence or have some malice behind it but either way, this is VERY much a Bethesda-needs-to-get-their-shit-together issue.
---
I always liked detailing with greebles in Fallout 4.  Good idea for here.
---
I think it's crazy anyone believes them at this point. They lied about the canvas bags, they lied to people in the AU about their right to a refund, they lied about cosmetic only microtransactions, they lied about the timetable for fixing and updating the game (delaying Wastelanders may have been necessary and if that was the only issue I'd be OK with it but it's far from the only issue). 
---
Bethesda has lied time and time again. Yet now we're supposed to believe they are telling the truth and only banning the people that deserve it? 
---
I support a fan who has done nothing but good for the community, including dedicating his time to free resources for the community, over the absolute scumlord that is Bethesda nowadays.
---
Such a touchy-ass game when it comes to building. I rebuilt my camp so it was all inside of one building with a small footprint, sort of like the idea of the floating camps, but not floating. I think it was 9 blocks square, and the fusion generator on the top floor, and it didn't have the sort of issue you're having. However, it did flip two of the walls and detach the conduits in some places for some damned reason.
---
I don't see those two things as being equal. In the case of the queen, the root cause is something often beyond the player's control...mob came out of nowhere and whacked you. You can't necessarily prepare for that. More experienced players often plan for that possibility, but, yes, it still happens...which is why I have a no bag policy.
---
With vendors, it is literally an area and situation you have near complete control over...you build the camp to your specifications. You decide where the machines go and how people can access them. Sure there are those that pick locks and rush in while the area is loading, but this wasn't the case. There was no door and the machines were out in the open. There was no clear indication that the machines were off on purpose. The argument could be made, in this situation, not buying stuff was depriving the owner of caps due to a malfunction or damage beyond the owner's control. The evidence could have been read either way.
---
They fixed it. Fast too. Probably was a bug. 2 friends snagged it at this price, but 3 couldn't find it.
---
Looks like they fixed it a little over 3 hours ago.
---
You almost had me, glad I clicked.
---
This makes me happy.
---
Yeah it does. TS adds a extra shot to whatever the weapon. Like on a shotgun that shoots 8 pellets, it'll shoot 9. 125% of the base damage is divided among those 9 shots [https://imgur.com/aO6gC9b](https://imgur.com/aO6gC9b)
---
Any shots that hit the head get crit damage. If say one misses, you lose 1/9 of the total damage before any crits. It's more of a problem when you have only 1 shot + 1. The 125 is divided by 2, so if one shot misses, you lose 62.5% before crits.
---
The explosions are tacked onto each shot. So the more shots you have and the higher base damage, like a harpoon with fletchettes for instance, the more having a maxed out demo perk matters. It all adds up. If you only have a single shot, like aae, having more than 1 in demo doesn't help much. Same with a laser, mods like the beam splitter (splits the beam into 4) are used for explosive and vamp.
---
Makes me wanna craft barbed wire
---
Same here. Some simple Harvest Moon elements to the farming would also be amazing.
---
I personally think the issue is that players of Bethesda games have gotten so used to having to fix their games to make them playable that it has translated to this, you look at an elder scrolls or fallout game and you will find unofficial patches. Literally everything about this game has been broken since launch. Now many players are highly invested in these games, they want them to be the best they can be, sadly Bethesda has not allowed any provision for this. All previous titles were moddable (something that I am pretty sure was promised for this title also) and thus were fixable by the community. Now I do believe the OP may have made some mistakes in his methods but I also think Bethesda was at fault also, they permabanned his account while many hackers who do exploit and ruin the experience for other players get off scot-free. Bethesda has shown little to no respect for its players, a good product should not leave the community feeling like they have to fix the game themselves because their reports have fallen on deaf ears.
---
It's more likely that a company, that has already been caught lying *repeatedly*, would tell the truth because they can't afford anymore bad press? Over a fan who has dedicated countless hours helping the community for free no less?
---
I doubt it. If they could afford the bad press the last dozen times they can afford it now too. As long as there's always blind fanboys willing to make excuses, cover for them, and still fork over more money they will not change.
---
You have to play the way you want to. ‚ÄúMe first‚Äù is a fine way to play. But you must have considered that he shut it down because he was at max caps.  Ultimately it‚Äôs on him - it‚Äôs lazy to just shut it down without locking it up.
---
My approach towards shut down vendors is to buy the one item you want the most first and then wait a bit before buying anything else. While waiting I usually try to find anything at their camp that needs repairs specifically a power source but also turrets and other stuff too. If they are maxed and see you hanging around they know well enough to log out.
---
Isn't the power fist better than the meat hook because of the covert ops buff? The meat hook gets double damage perks and 3.0 sneak attacks but the power first gets 3.5x sneak attacks and a higher base damage that scales better with full food buffs.
---
Go out and earn them yourself, this game has a good adventure to offer you until late game. Enjoy the ride and don‚Äôt get caught up too much in the caps and accessories. They will come in time
---
Hey, cut them some slack. They went and bought canvas, during a shortage when canvas was very expensive, to make replacement bags out of the kindness of their heart (and totally not because they were about to be sued over it).
---
K
---
Ha! I love doing this, so much free caps, and loot...
---
I play on ps4, I just finished the quest line that calls for it. Other than that no, I haven't reached a point where I'm comfortable farming nuked zones.  I am going to play on PC more since the playstation plus fee just feels like I'm getting fked lately.  I'm sure there are much more nukes and it's much more active on PC.
---
I can‚Äôt listen to it right now but a lot of sounds in video games and some ads aren‚Äôt owned by any one person or company, they‚Äôre available to the public. There‚Äôs a word for them that I can‚Äôt remember.
---
There‚Äôs actually a bird song in 76 that‚Äôs the exact same as a bird song in DayZ SA. It‚Äôs tripped me out the first time I heard it.
---
I mention cheat engine on my site, and how I use it but I am pretty sure I never used it on this account. I say that, and it is true. I make my own tools. Also, they don't ban people for cheat engine, so that is a stupid thing to get hung up on in the first place. Their any cheat has been broken for months. 
---
The story never evolved from me reporting it. I have never said that. 
---
I am not the one lying here. You are saying I said a bunch of things I just didn't say and that I forgot to mention things I did mention. So other than the things that are just demonstrably wrong, go check for yourself, what I am lying about it? Because it seems your only valid complaint is that everyone hates Bethesda, and somehow that is my fault. It took me a while to realize this myself, as I was a fanboy too which is why I dedicated so much time making my tools for this game in the first place, but maybe, just maybe, everyone hates Bethesda for a reason.
---
Some will be doable solo. But the rest will be done with an NPC with bad AI that will run at a pace somewhere between your walking and running speed. Oh, and if he dies, you have to start the whole quest over again. Also, he is very aggressive and likes to run up and punch the big baddies. Yay NPCs! /s
---
They are definitely not the only weapon that takes skill. For instance scoped rifles are much harder to get a shot on an enemy when they are moving and even those don't kill 1 shot unless you get a headshot. It may not have direct aim, but it's dmg is an area effect and does not need to be perfect, which levels it out.
---
It's damage used to be higher, and with the explosive perks you could kill in 1 hit and it was too OP. You didn't need to be accurate and still down enemies, that's why they changed it.
---
Not sure on those, but a nuke mine can get +10 rads with two detonated in the same area. Try a lead lined backpack from possum tokens, I use that around fissures.
---
But you asked if it was bad form. If there is a possibility of screwing someone over, you should go with the side of not
---
We wearing some scuffed underwear in this game. Good idea.
---
Definitely from the same sound bite
---
\&gt;  The problem isn't incentivising people to report bugs. 
---
Pretty much this. We have bug lists compiled by u/Aten_ra that are mile long, and a lot of stuff hasn't changed in months. Main problems here are:
---
1. Inexperienced devs. That's not an insult, that's a fact. Bethesda Austin doesn't have a single game to it's name prior to 76. And as it seems - they haven't heard about "Do not commit to master".
---
2. Archaic mess of an engine that is Gamebryo, which never should've been used for a multiplayer game.
---
3. Last, but not least - subpar customer service department, that's not only unprofessional, but seemingly exists as a completely separate entity, that is unaware of anything that happens with the game at all.
---
So, while we can report bugs, exploits, etc till the kingdom come - we can't do shit about those three points.
---
Lol dont like my answer?
---
Not all vaults
---
It's really not. It's closer to a survival game. Or an oxymoronic Mini-MMO.
---
This...this is an idea I hadn't thought of. I definitely will do this from now on. The players wasn't around, and I looked for them on the map, but couldn't find them. I looked for the power source, but it was behind a level 3 locked door with connectors coming through the wall.
---
It would probably be more acceptable to ask for a hand up instead of a handout. You could at least offer to work in one of the mines in exchange for payment and supplies.
---
https://youtu.be/kiDRaruRrRc
---
His website says he deduced from looking at rolls some users had that there *must* be an exploit people were using. So he set out to figure out what it was. Why would he report something he wasn't sure was there and had no idea how it worked?
---
I‚Äôm wondering how hard this would be to implement. Like say you house was super close to someone‚Äôs and you added to it. Would it destroy part of there house. And say you got into pvp and they didn‚Äôt, orbital strikes are raining down. Are they affected???? 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would like this to happen. Just not sure if it‚Äôs possible.
---
If you are that annoyed about the game, why don‚Äôt y‚Äôall go and play something else for a while
---
Looks like they can fix things fast when they want to, lol.
---
no
---
and if you get tired of farming flux all the time, just un-prime it
---
The bag debate is for a different post...a different, heated and emotion-filled post. The vendor thing is something else IMHO. This case was weird though. The player had solid equipment that was cheaply priced (Vamp Explosive Single Action Revolver with FR for 2k). So, obviously they were a higher level due to the volume of stuff, but the design and placement of the machines looked like someone that just got out of the vault with no vending experience. It was just an odd place that spawned next to my camp.
---
No they will make fallout 2nd for that so dont worry about it
---
Maybe it was your farm I raised tonight...
---
I did look it up. There is no exception to the rule of singular and plural usage.
---
In order to have (plural) HUNDREDS, you must have multiple sets of one (singular) HUNDRED. 101 is not multiple sets of 100. It's a single one hundred.
---
Show me a grammar manual that says otherwise, otherwise get back to harassing people who like facts.
---
Not everything is as it seems. I and others managed to get Bethesda to comment.
---
That's something usually reserved for people paying for premium membership.
---
Yeah no shit, thanks for posting this as I was just telling the wife it went on sale really cheap went to look and didn't see any real good value in the whole atom shop. This reminded me what item I'm looking for to bad it's gone now. They get right on that but can't tell the community anything about what the future holds like any other company would do with an online title or fix any of the thousands of bugs we actually care about .
---
Bethesda's gonna halt all development efforts for this one! Can't lose a dime! Get that shop running!
---
How close do you want people to be able to get? You can literally have camp boundaries side-by-side. For example, the Thunder Mountain TM-02 substation outside of Watoga can have a camp on either side of it, and that's not very far.
---
I hustle all night for that bungalow i knew it would be gone quickly if i waited for the next day!
---
This. If you character is a natural explosives expert, enjoy the bonus.
---
It's coming in a new "superscription" called Fallout Firsty First. You add it on top of your Fallout 1st subscription for another $20/month.
---
Very nice
---
Because you report bugs; not test them. Its not his job.
---
When he got done, he let his buddy report it and he did nothing...except fail to adequately track what he did or keep track of whether or not he used exploited gear OR if he even used Cheat Engine on that account at all.
---
Sounds like an amatuer bumble-fucking around if I ever heard of one...
---
No surprise he got banned, since to Bethesda it looks like your run-of-the-mill cheater. He was relying on his "clout" to get him out of it if ot went sideways. It did...but his entitlement didnt extend as far as he thought. 
---
Then he purposefully mischaracterized  it multiple times to make it sound like he was the victim. Even going so far as to "not remember" key details that make HUGE differences in how it would be seen. 
---
He could have reported what he saw in the blog and let them take it from there. Instead, he bungled it and got banned. Road to Ban-ville is paved with good intentions.
---
Play another game then?
---
How is it reserved for people paying for premium membership if premium membership is new and Bethesda has commented before it existed?
---
ive never done it but mostly because the whole process is just such a pain in the ass
---
Same here.
---
kind of seems like a good thing if you ask me
---
I have seen no signs on my private servers so far that they have been previously used. 
---
If I leave a private server and then immediately come back as a different character, the server seems to be the same. I have used this for some quick muling, using a duffle bag in the bus in the 76 parking lot as my container. So far no issues. 
---
I haven‚Äôt tried going from private to public to right back to private so can‚Äôt answer your last question.
---
I've heard that you used to be able to put your camps close together but then people started using it to dupe so they separated them the miles apart they are now.
---
I never said that 76 was a bad game, I also never said I played it. It's a good game but I avoid paying any money on it. It also is really glichy and annoying. And trust me I have went to other games but game back. I don't really need a great game because I don't play all day everyday. I usually only play a few hours a night
---
I havent

101 is more than 100. Therefore it is hundreds.

This is such basic grade school logic that you're failing.

I do campfire tales ten times a week, maybe.  Haven't received a single badge from it.

I was literally complaining about this earlier, so glad I came across this post to see this rug solution. Genius!
---
My experience on a private server in visiting areas i dont typically visit alot of containers are empty, no junk just nothing, plans arent in known locations, no PA chasis in known locations. No lead weights in the hotel or firestation. People say your last 100 or so looted containers will be empty but ive gone to places i rarely visit and theres nothing.

"I only rob other banks. I dont rob the banks you put YOUR money in."

NO, Trelane.

Lol IKR?

I got all of my candy some idiots bringing them into Survival. Literally thousands of them.
---
Ok boomer. Let me know when you will actually start listening to the community and do something about the rampant hacking problem on PC.
---
you admitted to having a side account on which you cheat, and your beef is that the account you DONT cheat with got banned.
---
There are no clean hands here, so you can't seek justice.
---
Exactly. Seems like a little over an hour is all they really need to fix the bugs that hurt their bottom line.
---
You could nuke the queen. She's legendary.

Lake Eloise
---
That sounds dope, Unlikely but dope, I just want my skeleton outfit from the nuclear Winter challenges. That made a lot of people angry and they're not even addressing it
---
Banning a player who had 700 hours in-game for having good loot comes to mind
---
Can you post again when you get banned?
---
Would be nice to know the gap in time
---
They started out as recycled. Dead enemies and such. But this doesn't happen anymore. My guess is they fixed it and pretended it never happened.
---
It shows you when you launch a nuke. The green zone is from the farm workshop in the south to Deathclaw Island in the north.
---
&gt;I also never said I played it
---
No one cares about your opinion then
---
In before this is deleted. 
---
I appreciate what you are trying to do, and I'm in the same boat. But this will be removed and the majority will not know how easy and quick it is to hack this game. 
---
Playing it on PC is just stupid.
---
Who buys steel? You can literally get it by the hundreds with the Blackwater Mine event.
---
Yes. I equipped it just fine the first time. This is how I realize it will no longer equip.
---
Seriously? Lol. If you did this and advertise it and still don't get banned.... Why would anyone even play?
---
Appreciate the response!
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
Appreciate the input!
---
I mean, Bethesda would never lie to us, soooo
---
I meant to say I never said I PLAY it, ahole.  And like this is all that's going on with Bethesda. Who's to say I don't play another Bethesda game
---
Just flash them the trade emote to show them your moneybags, then dance the night away in front of their peasant asses.
---
Bethesda is literally writing all these things down on a yellow legal pad under the title, "Things To Make People Buy Fallout 1st."
---
Just so you know.
---
That's what I thought as well. This is probably just a combination of people being away after the update and the holiday in the US.
---
I also literally talked about it In the post, said most of the stuff that's going on with it.  And in that comment I said I played it
---
Changing your current weapon is an easy fix for this.
---
Oh ok. So there has been zero indication of a new way to respec.
---
Got it
---
Sorry! I was just trying to help and that was my issue when mine didn‚Äôt work. I hope you find a solution
---
just because you can...
---
Personally, Im okay if they want to call these 'surprise pop-up sales' - a lot of online retailers do this kind of 'deal of the day' offers.
---
What I think Bethesda should do is let us sign up for alerts and let us buy from the atom shop using a phone app.
---
Yea well I saw that rage posting about that and I checked their main page it did say before the 12th and not the 12th.  They really shouldve worded it better as at first glance it seems the 12th but it wasnt.  Poor wording choicing on that for sure.  I thought it was the 14th for some reason but I also wasnt paying attention.
---
you have a 20 cooldown period to get back on. it's so your friends on your server (that aren't fo1) have some time to finish up before a DC.
---
Banning an IP can mean that when the IP gets passed onto another player the. That Sasha can‚Äôt play because Jimmy abused an exploit and got his IP banned which is now assigned to her router. Then she either has to wait for her IP to change, call he ISP and hope they‚Äôll help, or get Bethesda to remove the IP ban based on her word that it wasn‚Äôt actually her.
---
Best way to get guaranteed 3 star loot is to take trash drops from enemies and scrip them, then try your luck at the vendor.
---
doesn't this use the budget for 2 walls? A single wall for this would be ideal.
---
Entitlement are the people thinking they're owed this guys work while Bethesda completely screws him over.
---
Oh yeah, apologies if that came off dickish. Just trying to explain that I‚Äôve for sure tried to re-equip in the Atom store. Cheers!
---
Do you have the Mothman billboard? This happened to me. They increased it's budget and so when I deleted something, I was still over. Not until I deleted it was I free from this curse.
---
Call me the fun police, but if this leads to people making giant 'pajama houses' with wallpaper on the outside, put me down as a 'no thank you' vote.
---
I want a vendor app!
---
WHY NOT
---
&gt;Has anyone else never launched a nuke?
---
&gt;they're already going off every five minutes by other players anyway.
---
You answered your own question
---
Nope.
---
I was 600 away about to finish a game, opened up the challenge page just to check the exp I needed and it was gone.......  Thanks for the 5 hour early finish.
---
I'm agreeing with you
---
Reads like a troll post.  This is clown shoes level PR at the way they've handled this incident.  Should just reinstate the Map guy and apologize.
---
+1. I would love to know this. I stopped playing on PC because of the hackers, who I have reported countless times. 
---
Would be good to see how long it takes for someone to get banned after hacking.
---
Wow this is an amazing idea. Of it has sales alerts and exclusive offers, it would be even more epic.
---
Awesome idea for sure!

Fallout 1st Bug Hunters Program

Costs $11.99 to join and costs $4.99 for each bug you report.

Each bug earns you a sticker.

That'll be 5 bucks.
---
yut, but the shoulda used the green pt shorts
---
What? Only 180 Atoms?!
---
I bought it last week for like 480 Atoms because they were going to vault it (original price was 700 Atoms). 180 for it was probably a bug because for all I know it should be already vaulted after the weekly reset.
---
I work in software, the people who wrote this policy who think you can just report an exploit without verifying it clearly don't, and aren't doing Bethesda any favors.  I spent years in software support dealing with people who couldn't articulate what they were reporting, couldn't reproduce it, and couldn't even tell you exactly how they were impacted by it.  Those tickets were a giant waste of time.  There's nothing to go on.  I'd argue it's one of the reasons Bethesda's bugtesting is so awful, and why reported exploits and bugs overwhelmingly don't get fixed.  They genuinely have no idea what they're doing with policies like this.
---
Bethesda would never lie to us, sooo....
---
What's FO76 ?. 
---
Never mind, I hate it.
---
It's Bethesda
---
Maybe because it's bullshit with no apology, no attempt to rectify the problem, and it reads like more lies from a company who constantly lies.
---
Well, they're wrong so...
---
thank you
---
Assuming (and it's a stretch) that you're not just being obnoxious because the Internet, no - what I was asking for was for them to tell me either "Yes that's definitely an exploit thanks" or "No that's just a creative use of the game's mechanics, feel free to use it now you've thought of it".  Instead I got something that leaves me not knowing if I'll get banned for using my clever idea.  I just wish they'd put the tiniest bit of effort into their communications with me over something that's potentially serious.  I'd have no sympathy for the OP at all if it wasn't for the fact that he couldn't even squeeze a response out of Bethesda, that's just rubbish.
---
"3rd party software" is kind of a hollow statement.  Using Discord to chat with people in the game is 3rd party software by this exact same logic.
---
I must've missed the PA paint for the Responders.  Anybody have pictures of it?
---
Hacking for what? The rewards are stupid. The duped items will get nerfed and forgotten about like tse. **The hacks and glitches are bait for hooking people into buying and playing fallout 76**. Soon there will be a detection, a mass deletion, and a ban wave.
---
No they are not.
---
and raiders love em
---
Absolutely not. Players are only hating FO76 because time and time again with this game, Bethesda has shown how incompetent they are with the game. Everything from poor optimization, to server problems, to a ton of bugs, glitches, and exploits, all the way to charging people for services that actively work against them (see the storage eating items from players using it), to even Bethesda themselves \*\*requiring\*\* people send in an essay to people that either exploited a bug in the game explaining how they did or, or even people they \*suspected\* of cheating. Or even the people who put in a ton of time in the game and they ended up getting banned from it. FO76 while it may be a fun game for some, it is a buggy mess of a game that is riddled with problems that go beyond the actual game play. If you would like proof for any assertion I made here, feel free to ask, I will gladly post them as needed. Also, saying "stop hating on something I enjoy" is  childish. People are free to hate and love anything they want, independent on others feelings towards it.
---
and it's hard to see on the receiving end
---
That's scary to think about that a dozen of corporate heads got together and this was the best response they came up with.
---
Fix your shit Bethesda.
---
and toes
---
Oh the damage control. Can't have people believing they banned someone for testing an exploit to verify before reporting it can we?
---
lol  
---
that's the thing, it wouldn't be armor because it would be a costume. it would look more like it did in nv or fallout 3, only more costume like and less armor like.  check out the poster outside freddy fear's house of scares you'll see what i mean.
---
It would be cool, but I'm not sure how it would be implemented, nevermind the fact that you basically never go out naked unless you're roleplaying something.
---
WHY NOT....( have that, too!!)
---
A "cheat engine" just reads the memory on your computer.  It doesn't do what most people on this page think it does.
---
ah yes I'mma derp
---
QUITE POSSIBLY
---
;O)
---
Lvl 220 and I have not done it. Like you said someone is doing it all the time. And then there's that reclaimation day thing. We leave the vault to rebuild but nuke everything instead. Really makes sense.
---
I got naked sometimes.
---
Seriously I came here expecting this was the reply and instead got a reply that read as combative and belittling.    
---
At this point banning the Map76 guy looks like them being embarrassed that he's doing the kind of bug testing they are failing so hard at.
---
ü§°
---
"So then I went to his stash and this IDIOT left it unlocked so I stole everything out of it and waddled down to the vendor to sell it all, even his LEGENDARIES. What a MORON"
---
They can pick lvl 3 locks also. Watched them do it. Haven't bothered to put A lock on A door since.
---
I don't think you understanding what datamining is or developers stance on them but ok
---
just copy paste WOWs Auction House app
---
There's no motivation. Without motivation, there's no action. There's surely not action if the motivation is detrimental. It defies logic to go out of your way to harm yourself. Bethesda wouldn't say anything if it was true. Companies don't face strife and say "let's just push it as far as we can go for no reason other than they're mad about other stuff we did." 
---
I think there's much more motivation and plausibility to the fan continuing to use the glitch without his fans knowledge than a large company already in hot water intentionally harming themselves because they don't feel like unbanning someone and already have enough crap to deal with. 
---
It's a no from me
---
OK SURE
---
They're not so...
---
ROFL. Samesies though. So I would theoretically upvote your theoretical thread if you made it.
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Q76H7tP7Ig/hqdefault.jpg
---
Um, where did I admit that?
---
faa my drink out my nose
---
Do you have any concrete knowledge that they didn't continue to use the glitch?
---
How many versions of the same armor do they think we need? And shouldn't these slight variants just be in one pack for like $10. Already shitty they took the most requested outfit from the community and locked it behind 1st.
---
this is a problem on the ps4 as well.
---
I quit.    
---
The stash limit finally got to me a few months ago.  I couldn't play the game anymore because I was full on rare mats and weapons and things, and there was no further reason to play.  They told us for ages that increasing the limits would have caused stability issues and other problems, then after over a year they lock the biggest functional improvement to the game since release behind a paywall you have to dump cash into monthly for.  
---
They lied about the stash thing.  They could have fixed the problem ages ago but waited until they figured out how to monetize it at over $100 a year instead.  
---
I really have no intention of coming back until the stash issue is fixed and it's not locked behind a paywall to get it.
---
I like this lol. i keep a nice garden and purifiers for visitors. hopefully you got some melons and water from mine too !
---
Did something change? I thought that cheat engine can't change anything in multiplayer games. Or?
---
Their motivation for previous lies for profit. 
---
This harms them without the motivation of profit. The result was bad press and anger and neither fit as a logical motivation. 
---
That is why I believe Bethesda on this one. They have no reason to lie and that makes this one different.
---
I can help, having a similar issue where people disappear and when I ask if they wanna do it, I get radio silence. Still need steel to craft the power armor and I'm working on the challenges (rad ants is such a pain) PSN: Zeronial
---
Clearly not enough because this is like a clown shoes level response from Bethesda
---
But they're not profiting off of this
---
&gt; I mention cheat engine on my site, and how I use it but I am pretty sure I never used it on this account.
---
&gt;
---
Players: Bethesda sucks why don't they respond to the current debacle
---
Bethesda: *responds to current debacle*
---
Players: Omg wtf Bethesda still sucks 
---
 üôÑ
---
Seriously what is wrong with you people. At this point, y'all just hate on them for the sake of hating on them. They could literally develop the cure for cancer and solve world hunger and you guys will *still* complain about them being "a bunch of greedy dirtbags" or something similar
---
Me to... my gunfu bloodied vats build knocks everything in the dirt... just has a little trouble with highly armoured creatures but even then it's maybe a clip instead of a single shot. 
---
When I go to the golf course I feel like I'm bowling. One shotting those lvl 62 ghouls and knocking them down like pins.
---
Another post with lying and misinformation, thanks Bethesda :)
---
It's true, it's never getting better.   Everything in FO1st could have just been wrapped into a 1 time DLC but they monetized it into a monthly paywall.  It was also the biggest lie in Fallout, they claimed for over a year they couldn't increase the stash limit because it would cause stability problems and then it turns out there was no real game stability problem behind the stash limit at all, they just were waiting to release functional parts of the game as paid features.    
---
I wouldn't have been mad if I had to pay up for extra content but this was a uniquely garbage move.
---
this doesn't affect me because I am not playing to compete. If i were wanting to play NW and actually compete I would be pissed. 76 is like elite dangerous in my mind. I left elite because it was very hackable as well but in their version of adventure mode you could not easily avoid pvp. the only way to avoid pvp completely in elite dangerous was to play private server. which sucked because then you never saw other players. but in public some  peeps would hack pvp and wreck your game all day. 
---
at least in 76 passive mode adventure lets me enjoy the game and the world without dealing with pvpers.
---
This is your first comment about something NOT related specifically to Fallout 1st subscribers since that service was launched. This implies that the message was only intended for them, as you seem to only want to directly communicate with subscribers these days.
---
Literally half of fhose things you listed didn't even happen.
---
Awhile ago as a last ditch effort to keep interested, I started going for the achievements for breaking down weapons and armor. Now I couldn‚Äôt really care less about atoms since there‚Äôs nothing worthwhile in the Store, but doing the grinding for those pieces to break down has really taken me to nooks and crannies in the Wasteland that I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. 
---
Long story short, I‚Äôm a wee stoned and thanks for the tip to go for possum badges!
---
Can you run it up the chain to make the next Fallout game more like Outer Worlds?  It can't help but feeling this is what the last 2 Fallout games should have been and have been waiting years for a game like this and Bethesda just seems like they can no longer make great open world RPG's with interesting characters and choices that actually affect the game.  
---
Also stop lying to your customers all the time.
---
I already cant use half of what I bought because of the low camp budgets. Im literally done shopping at this point as my camp is now pretty set.
---
It‚Äôs 5 min if server is empty
---
&gt;"...us find and fix the things..."
---
Are you being serious right now?
---
That's a real knee-slapper right there, Todd.
---
In other words.....Report it...Don't extensively Test it...that is not your job...
---
Your not wrong but come awwwn. The horse is dead.
---
I have lots of cards if you want some but I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Yup.  Powered doors is the answer.  When I hit my caps limit, I scrap one wire and it takes me off the map and closes the door.  Unless some NPC shoots a wall open, my vendors are secure.
---
No we need a better game
---
I need help, I have experience with all raids and a map of pump code spawns for the 3rd raid but my teammates have disappeared for awhile. psn zeronial.
---
Thanks for the replies I will try it when it happens again
---
This game needs a lot of shit lol
---
I have F1st from day one and never experienced recycled server, either anyone from my friend list. Most people talking about recycled servers don‚Äôt know how this game work or are just trolling
---
Then you get banned because you were using CE for your own (or someone else's) gain. It's a shame it happened, he could have just been the good guy. But the temptation to abuse this *other thing*, thinking it would go without being noticed, was too much.
---
I launched one nuke, one time, as per the quests that led me to that...  I was super confused and alone, but some other players who were in the area with me helped and guided me, also, his GF helped get the code online to help me out...   then, when given the map to choose where to Nuke, I didn't know where, but everyone always nukes the lower right zone, so I chose a different area out of curiosity...   then everyone around me said I had wasted it, and sounded disappointed, and shamed me, and left. Lol  
---
So...   I can't say I enjoyed that hectic and confusing and then, in the end, disappointing, experience, very much.
---
I want a few in difrent poses. So we can set them up to scare people üòÇ
---
&gt; Yeah except Bethesda hasn't asked anyone to find exploits
---
Yeah that's part of the problem. Bethesda hasn't asked *anyone* to find exploits, they should have been paying competent staff to do this 18 months ago.
---
I just want that greenhouse, Bethesda. Also, why no discount if I already own 50% of the pack?!
---
&gt; 2: Yea it's called a cheat engine, but that doesn't mean he was cheating. Knives can be used to stab people. I own a knife. It doesn't automatically mean I use it to stab people.
---
That's such a terrible analogy, man. Fair play on you for providing a counter-argument, but that's close to being authentic frontier gibberish.
---
Nice good to know, Thanks
---
Click hate title üòÇ
---
Base game? You mean fallout 1st+? Subscription members get bug fixes!
---
Here's an idea. Get a job,earn some cash. Use said cash to buy rtf you like in to or in-game. Don't have enough cash? Tough, that's life, deal with it. Wasn't gonna buy 1st, but now I am just cause I can :D. I buy tons of stuff from the Atomic shop too, not cause I need it, just cause I can. And I really don't give several flying fks if you can't afford it. Again ... tough shit ... bro. :D
---
Those plant boxes will almost certainly be microtransactions.
---
I‚Äôd usually agree with you but you can‚Äôt just stand there and saying that the entire fallout 1st situation was not fueled by Bethesda‚Äôs greed and desire to milk money from a dying game by pushing an incomplete and glitchy premium subscription. 
---
Anyone who defends Bethesda on the creation of Fallout 1st is an idiot.
---
Yep, Pipe revolver thing sounded neat, but I just ended up trying the whole Commando concept with him and enjoyed it a lot more. 
---
My main is level 250~ Unarmed with a few commando perks and Hunters Handmade for SB's. I have a 155~ Bloodied stealth riflemang, I have a handmade and bloodied expl bolt action pipe rifle. My Junkies dude is ~110, I use weightless gear for Chameleon mutation but I might try Vanguard later on, having fun with plasma rifle, laser rifle and handmade atm, but i'd like to find a tesla to mess around with too.
---
So I dusted the 44 and Pipe Pistol w/ a stock off and ran through Harpers Ferry to get you some numbers, this is all about 40 feet or so range unless otherwise stated, Level 68 Scorched enemies:
---
Bloody Mess 3
---
Tank Killer 3
---
Gunslinger 9 (3 each card)
---
Rifleman 7 (3, 2, 2)
---
Junkies Expl 44:
---
headshot:  290/15  	797/19 sneak 2x	350-400s up close
---
torso: 155/15	450/19 sneak 2x
---
Junkies limb -25vats pipe revolver w/ stock:
---
headshot:	520		1232 sneak 2x	
---
torso: 276		551 sneak 2x
---
Anyhow, decent damage, but not very great fire rate on said damage imho.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Give everyone the infinite scrap boxes you greedy scrooges
---
That's not even anywhere close what my comment is going on about...
---
People still arent getting that it isnt the devs and art designers that assemble and approve these bundles. 
---
Its like those people who will slap you for using a plastic straw, meanwhile large corporations are doing most of the polluting
---
I think it's the galvanizers who try to turn communities against games they enjoy with youtube armies and astroturfers
---
Atom challenges. Nothing like summoning wise mothman with a bunch or people in their briefs.
---
Yeah Anti Armor is the way to go on Pistols
---
I don't know what exactly are you trying to accomplish with this post...
---
BoS Jumpsuit &amp; Enclave Agent alternative skins would be awesome.
---
Some times some things seem a bit strange. But I don't think they are recycled.
---
And I'm not sure about the last question. ü§î
---
I didnt ask if people in general drop nukes. I asked if there are people out there who have NEVER launched a nuke.
---
Personally, I'd prefer that they work on fixing the myriad of bugs and balance issues with the game and respond to all the long unanswered support requests before getting to this.
---
After that, sure, whatever floats your boat.
---
If youre on Xbox we can figure it out together.
---
Your comment implies that just because Bethesda responds to a controversy they should be immediately cleared of their wrongdoings. Hell no, they don‚Äôt get a ‚ÄúGet out of jail free‚Äù card. The only thing that changes is that we know that they are aware of it. I can shit on the hood of someone‚Äôs car and come back 2 weeks later and say that I‚Äôm sorry and I didn‚Äôt mean it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything when the hood of their car is still covered in shit. 
---
Also, people have the right to call Bethesda a greedy company, because that‚Äôs what they are. They have never done anything for the community after launch that could even warrant the comparison of ‚Äúcuring cancer‚Äù, it‚Äôs been an IV drip of content that only exists to prevent the playerbase from being totally nonexistent, and every patch breaks even more things than before. I‚Äôll put my pitchfork down when Bethesda turns this game into what they advertised, and that will either happen like 3 years down the road or never at all.
---
"i will buy them all".  I'am so sorry for this mindset. So used to this cash grab, don't even demanding that at least some new cosmetics are released as game play reward.
---
So sad to see. Wasting probably hunderts or thousands of dollars for no value. Don't forget: You can't keep those things, they will be gone, when they shut off this game (if it is next year, or in years in 4 years).
---
Whats your GT?
---
I was probably a fired sale. Similar to a fire sale but someone likely lost their job afterwards.
---
Never in about 150 hours. I quit the game without doing the intended endgame.
---
Western. Its the handmade of revolvers. Best dmg and reload speed
---
Fucktards are out folks, lock your doors.
---
GamerPandaBear
---
Isn't the combat like really bad and the game too short, like half of what a Fallout game is? Just seems like another Obsidian conversation simulator
---
Empty containers and items not being somewhere is also in the base game and can have nothing to do with someone taking it beforehand e.g. server hopping reveals "missing" loot sometimes.
---
You sure it's not just that?
---
&gt; Can you run it up the chain to make the next Fallout game more like Outer Worlds?
---
Can they not? It‚Äôs fun, but it‚Äôs not a Fallout game, and doesn‚Äôt feel like one.
---
Yes! I'm not the only person who noticed. üòÇ Thanks for posting. I couldn't remember what the commercial was for. üòÇ
---
Lol for real i saw a dmg exploit was removed and actually got my hopes up that they patched the god mode glitch. 5 mins later im watching a buddy of mine fight raiders once agin completely on fire and imortal.
---
You probably believed the dupers back in February didn't you?
---
Why do they have to test it hundreds of times though
---
or a broken emote.
---
You should be able to do it, but you‚Äôll have to build everything with half walls and then apply wallpaper separately.
---
I like to put my camp somewhere in the lower savage divide so i can cheaply hop to SBQ or Whitesprings should a nuke drop.  
---
Start grinding on your weapons and armor asap.  Basically farming junk legendaries and trading/gambling for better options.  Also pick a weapon and perk accordingly but be careful cause respecing is a pain in the ass.
---
"Then I realized the stuff in the stash was MY STUFF!" üòî
---
Sound Effects: Sentry Bot gunfire sound effects no longer sometimes loop endlessly.
---
I don't think the combat is much less monotonous than Fallout, only the difference with Fallout is they forgot the bits about the actions you take having any affect on the story, hell, in FO76 even your SPECIAL points don't really seem to have any real checks on what you can and can't do to influence things.
---
Noticed this 2 weeks ago. Had to delete 2 water purifiers some concrete bases and a painting to plant 1 corn
---
Is there any proof the person I'm referencing did so? Or are you using the logic, "He got banned for exploiting therefor he had to have been doing it over and over again!"?
---
That's an entirely different situation but lol ok just gonna ignore the point I made?
---
Thank you 4chan, godspeed anons.
---
The fallout 1st exclusives haven‚Äôt gotten anything new yet.
---
Some pot plants also wouldn‚Äôt go amiss. Maybe also with the option to plant the various wild flowers one can come across?
---
You say 3rd party software like there is some magical 3rd party software out there that has a bunch of cheat buttons for this game. There isnt. I make my own software for most of my memory work. Also, I do have at least 5 accounts I am free to do whatever I want with. Which happens to be nothing. There hasn't been new content added in a long time. Unless I just want to go get my ass kicked in NW by hackers they don't ban, there is nothing else to do.
---
Personally i hate this idea and i think it promotes the wrong message but hwy, its your money to throw at a greedy company that lies to its player base dozens of times and manipulates its community constantly.
---
^^^IWontBeRespondingIfYouSaySomething
---
Maybe not in the atomshop ... ah well what am I thinking, ofc it will be in that shit ...
---
Thanks.  
---
Seems odd they'd have a "home defense" category this week, but only have three items in it, only one of which is home defense related.  I couldn't help wondering if there were more items to justify the theme, but they were invisible to people who don't subscribe.
---
Based on their consistent history over the year of lying to the community your post is not even worth reading no matter how valid and well written it is. 
---
I will be downvoting you simply because in the current climate.. it deserves to be downvoted and for that i applaud your effort but shake my head at your ignorance.
---
Most nukes were send to the scorchbeast queen, which is not the location I want to nuke. I've nuked plenty of other zones for fluxes.
---
I fail to see how its a different situation at all, how many times has Bethesda just told us a bold faced lie? *cough* fallout 76 release state *cough* numerous bug "fixes" *cough* promises of content that never came or was addressed like player prestiging *cough* sorry had to clear my throat. If you're believing anything Bethesda has to say at this point you're clearly insane. They most likely messed up and just doubled down on the mistake since the creator of Map76 wasn't too polite with his departure, especially for the last bit on his website.
---
Map76 guy said himself after he tested the bug multiple times he didn't report it, since one of his other friends did. He wasn't covering himself v well for the automated ban. He does have clout in the community, he and his group were asking to be unbanned for weeks, a couple of them actually succeeding in doing so (because of the clout I mentioned)
---
Also they found dozens of exploits, this community uses many of them that were leaked by other exploiters (Excavator weight glitch, nuke silo skipping, the infinite deep pocketed bug when it was around), it's not farfetched to think that this bug finding group would continue to use newfound knowledge because they didn't think they were a big deal compared to heavier exploits
---
They did all of this testing on alt accounts, btw. Wonder why they didn't use their main accounts. Probably because they realized it could get them banned huh?
---
I would have looked for their name in the recent list and sent them a message or friends request, and asked if the machine should be off, and if so ask if I could buy the item later.
---
Hey, you're the one with a ticket on the hate train, I can dig it but I can almost guarantee you Bethesda doesn't give a fuck his website lol
---
Ip-Adresses are not static for most consumers. It's like the worst way to ban someone because it's only active until said person restart it's router.
---
You just said you didn't read my post and are therefore ignorant as to my reasoning, and then called me ignorant. Seems kinda ironic
---
Yeah, sorry but I kinda don't believe you. You guys seriously need to get your act together.
---
I thought it was Camden Park Deputies üòû
---
Hate train ticket? I'm not down voting each of your comments like *someone* is doing to mine. It seems you're the one in some sort of tunnel my guy. But hey private servers will save the games with mods right? Haha, ha.
---
Do you also get pissed at people subscribing to Netflix, or Sky Q too? ... for having a better experience  which they chose to pay for?
---
I see the mistake here.
---
You brought logic to a two shot explosive handmade fight.
---
Achievement and finishing the main questline?
---
That is a pretty big assumption since I reported any movent from them this far. When they finally gave me a refund, I took the time to update the site with their response. So the idea that I would not report it is simply unfounded.
---
Serious question. What did they lie about?
---
I think 3/4 of the previous post before were complaining and game hate, had to lighten the mood.
---
Neither of those are free to begin with, so thanks for providing an irrelevant argument.
---
Hey guys why haven't you said anything about Fallout 1st?
---
I see an astroturfer I downvote lol my bad. It's pretty clear that this is just another "900 hours guy" situation to me, the guy who turned out to be lying about duping. People who entrench themselves in the community think they'll be allowed to slide because " they do so much for the community." They use their clout to avoid consequences, and when it doesn't work then there's always attempting to galvanize the community to take action right?
---
The white springs is a heavy traffic area by most end game players. It's a must build location if you're a trader.
---
I'm guessing you only watch freeview tv then. Or are streaming video services such as Amazon, Netflix  etc, also employing greedy practices by having a subscription service for fans who want a better viewing experience?
---
Great you have Bethesda a Atomic shop idea
---
I want to plant pumpkins.
---
He posted that on his website. Are you actually following the story or just the drama?
---
You mean Sentry robots?
---
Well I mean, you also get all of the other monthly benefits, right? I actually didn't know or expect that there would be new exclusive outfits every month. I figured the ranger outfit would be made available on your first month along with the emotes and such, and after that you'd just get the atoms, scrapbox, etc each subsequent month.
---
Guess so
---
Well we can agree to disagree, especially considering the fact real hackers often do get away with hacking even with video evidence of them hacking due to "lack of evidence". I personally severely doubt Bethesda support's competence level to switch a light bulb let alone manage player support tickets.
---
why are we banning players for glitching in the first place? shouldnt you not make a glitchy game? oh wait you are modern bethesda, making a complete game is out of your reach in the first place anyways
---
It looks hilariously bizarre with the impostor sheepsquatch helmet.
---
Typo clickbate.
---
We've got a decent selection of floors from the past year or so. I'm frankly just so glad that they're finally giving us new wall textures that I'll take whatever they give us for the time being, until we have as many wall textures as we have floor textures. 
---
Then maybe they can get around to finally giving us the greenhouse walls and roofs from Fallout 4 and I'll be truly happy.
---
My cousin got banned for reporting he fell through the world
---
In my case (on PC) servers were not recycled.
---
As per the usual game mechanics, if I looted a location on public server - it will stay looted on private server for the usual respawn period.  Also, all doors are ‚Äúclosed‚Äù - even the ones I opened at train stations.
---
The server will reset if you leave the private server to join a public server and go back to private.  If you leave (or disconnect/crash) for a short period you can return to the same private server.
---
The answer is, they could have like 10,000 wallpapers saved and ready to go but they will release like a tiny few at a time for 800 atoms etc, to milk and gauge us as much as they possibly can.  This is not unexpected mentality from a company whose main goal is to make the maximum amount of money for the least amount of investment, it's just that it has gotten to a farcical point where they think all of us will just bend over for any insane deal they put up (which isn't true; only some of us will do that).
---
This was actually some of us at release :( the worst part was thinking the overseer's caches were player stashes &gt;:(
---
Imagine if the suits talked to each other.
---
Sounds like a big misunderstanding and they should reinstate him instead of dragging this out for weeks and posting a combative top level post about it.
---
That's often the problem: We keep getting really cool-looking skins for weapons which you'd never use after the first ten hours of gameplay. It's neat for new players or when you start a new playthrough, but I know I'd rather see more skins for gauss rifles and deathclaw gauntlets and such.
---
I'm getting a "lodes emone" vibe lmao
---
They're definitely worth having, if and when you get the chance. There's some great texture-work on those.
---
Well, that's the 1950s aesthetic for you.
---
Problem is that there‚Äôs a non-insignificant portion of this sub that treats constructive criticism as inflammatory.
---
You can get another free icon. You need it! ok?
---
Yeah. I always told myself "if there's no 'store all junk' option, it's not a stash. I was always afraid I would store stuff in the metal box, next to the stash in the Enclave. I'm not sure why ü§î
---
Someone‚Äôs having flashbacks to their time in the X-Men
---
Haha, b/c the game is real life! :D
---
Yeah? Because? Bethesda? LOST? Their? Loyalty?

I‚Äôm genuinely confused by this response; like, do you actually think that loyalty is meant to be totally and endlessly unconditional, regardless of what actions the party it was initially pledged to takes?
---
Flamer kills work and I killed legendary sb at fisser site it worked also. Last took pic using photomode at fisser site all worked.. I collected a silo code still doesnt wotk
---
Cya Partner have fun on your country roads! 
---
Screw the people who booed you
---
Exactly this. Very few people actually go out of their way to craft these things.
---
My budget didn't change, I scraped a wall today. Try restarting the game.
---
They could just IP bam couldn't they? Or would a VPN prevent that?
---
No I have proof that someone else reported it. Beth did not respond to my tickets and would not let me defend myself. This public post is the first thing even remotely like a response I have gotten from them about the ban. Almost a month later now. 
---
I requested that my FO1st membership be canceled and refunded because you know, it is broken. They ignored my request until I literally spammed every department.
---
Unless you have some facts I don't? I don't get to sit in on those meetings ;)
---
You're aware of ESO's business format for whole content filled DLCs huh? Yeah it's going to cost money.
---
I think it has to do with loading. I have crashed many times walking from one camp to another that were very close together. ü§î
---
Yeah like why anyone would pay for it.
---
This guy's post no offense
---
No, all fasnacht masks and hunter's hood weren't removed.
---
If you don't want rugs under everything... 1. get a flat surface. 2. Put the bench on it, and a rug in front. 3. Blueprint the rug first, then the bench or whatever. 4. Store the bench and rug. 5. Place the blueprint where you want. üòâ https://youtu.be/PgIVA8sj2KA
---
I appreciate it but I just had another person kindly sell me one, so the search is over. Hopefully this servers to anyone else who searches this question on reddit
---
Ooh and now you guys can respond?
---
Seriously Bethesda, the problem is not just that people "might" be banned for reporting problems, but the fact that the communication is complete garbage again...
---
And you guys haven't said a thing about that
---
No good deed goes unpunished!
---
The power first doesn't get a boost from one handed on top of unarmed, but the meat hook does. You can get +60% damage with only 6 perk points. Add a few more perks and mutations and you can do stupid damage with a meat hook that's unattainable with a pet fist.
---
Only if he was playing on PC
---
Bro the series as a whole has mostly ditched the whole 1950's aesthetic if you really think about it. Cant use that as an excuse.
---
Im honestly glad that some of you are standing up to them. The paywall is  ridiculous. I did this same thing when Black Ops 4 turned everything into micros. I was a huge fallout 3 and fallout 4 fan.. so when I played this the first time i was highly upset and its only gotten worse. I hope they can turn things around later but I highly doubt it.
---
Cool.....I'll hit you up tomorrow.
---
Me and my fianc√©e do raid a lot of days sometimes  with a friend or 2 sometimes alone but always looking for new friends, go ahead and add TheLastMasiah and SpiderPandaXXL we are off for the night but will be raiding again tomorrow about 4 Pm Pacific time.
---
I have both of them. The meat hook has a lower base damage. Pipe revolvers get double perks too but they don't outpace any other gun because they start out so low. 
---
The extra sneak attack damage from "covert ops" doesn't apply to the meat hook. 3.5x sneak attacks VS 3.0 sneak attacks is a big deal. The power fist is better
---
Cool, now that you know how to quote and add emphasis, show me where I say I cheat on another account.
---
They don‚Äôt need to accidentally leave bugs in, they‚Äôre already there
---
Nope. It just says to take a photo.
---
That's hard to imagine considering there is just a single employee at BGS and Todd Howard spends day in and day out hitting him with a whip while giving contradicting demands.
---
"heh, nothing personal kid"
---
In some cases it makes me go higher than normally.  I'm using the raider PA. Also when modding the PA theres the jetpack options on every piece on the PA
---
Me also love to do raids. Ign medic_mischa. I live in the Netherlands so different timezones unfortunately
---
Level 55 here and haven‚Äôt even finished the story. Don‚Äôt think I can even get in to a silo.
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll hide that stuff. They want u to see the benefit of paying them
---
Yes, and given all the camera challenges lately it's possible that others may try to use the camera. But it's photomode only, not a camera photo that they want.
---
I hope they do the light machine gun buff on the pistols.  I loved pistols in FO3/NV/FO4.  I'm planning on an alt becoming an expert at pistols for fun. I have a bunch of quad pistols I want to try with Gun Fu and other perks.
---
I wish it was more like fortnite [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuY\_X5ALrak&amp;t=43s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuY_X5ALrak&amp;t=43s)
---
Nice! I thought I was slow!
---
Do you regret spending that much time on stuff that you did with or around Fallout 76 or are you fine with time spend because it was fun while it lasted? What do you think about time now when you will not be playing/"exploring" fallout 76?
---
Well actually, Yes  you do pay more for a better service on Netflix. Hence some ppl pay for the basic sub and get standard service. People also pay more for a better experience with Netflix Premium. How is that not the same as buying FO76, and then paying more of my hard earned cash for a sub and better service? Almost all sub services are tiered, eg: Premium sub magazines and graphic novels with benefits and collectibles for those that wish to pay more.
---
"The citing of a logical fallacy made beard grow out of his neck"
---
I would try un equipping it, if you can. Go into a world. Exit the world, restart the game. Then try re equipping it, and go into a world. If you can't equip or un equip, then I'm not sure what to do.
---
Mine sometimes doesn't work the first time I drop something.
---
perhaps add the bull barrel its the best looking and it not even in the game
---
Red Rocket Megastop, you'll see the emblem at the top of the map
---
Me! Level 98 and never launched. I also always play solo. I've only recently gathered up the courage to join Scorched Earth events and tend to hide more than kill stuff, lol :)
---
Bethesda **needs** to rebuild their variation of Gamebryo and stop trying to short change their customers. 
---
Bethesda **needs** to stop doing build mergers to fix bugs which reintroduces and makes other bugs.
---
Bethesda **needs** needs to put out a quality product and not the bug filled mess that 76.
---
I had a single ad on there. I didn't want to cover it with ads. Most people use adblock, I do as well. It didn't even bring in enough to cover my hosting fees, which was the intention. Ads do not work well on single page applications. There are not really any good ways to monitize them except by methods I refuse to use (charge a fee, pop unders, pop ins, etc).
---
You tested just one out of several things I said and I admitted you were right. Dunno what else you want to hear. You should do that test again in vats, since you said the beam splitter is always better, which I disagree with. The beam splitter is not better in vats against sb.
---
Replying to one rn :(
---
IKR
---
I'd pay for dlc if it was ESO quality. It's not a great TES game, but its still a solid mmo with new islands and provinces to explore with each dlc. I got Orsinium and the Theives guild in Anvil and they were both definitely worth the price. I did buy another dlc, but i can't recall that one, so i don't remember if it was a good deal or not. Think it had something to do with Trinimac
---
Sweet! Will do
---
But standard service on Netflix is still a stable service. Your videos aren‚Äôt randomly dropped or the app freezes or crashes. So you may get more features with a premium account, but to receive a more stable version of the product is outlandish. For an online oriented service, I would consider it the bare minimum to function properly. I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay an unreasonable, repeating fee to stop the game from crashing becuase I already paid for that when I spent the $60 on it.
---
@MandyMarieB Be gone bethesda PR SHILl!
---
Thank you. my garden, camp, purifiers, and junk extractor are open to all. I can‚Äôt stand when I go to other people‚Äôs camps and find locks on everything.
---
Dude, I think that every single time I see that commercial! So glad someone else noticed it.
---
Just use the veil of secrets
---
I like it when they stagger you with a sledgehammer, but then lol Jk it was a switchblade the whole time
---
You are carrying too much
---
Over encumbered maybe
---
Probably over encumbered
---
Yeah its every container in an area and on a fresh start to the game. Not all areas just enough to notice. Most things have at least 1 piece of junk in base game. This is nothing at all in 5+ containers.
---
Well, track down the 1\* Legendary Scorch Beast who keeps popping up as I travel around. I'll hear it flying around, and then I'll start shooting, it will dive bomb me a few times. Scorched will attack me, and I'll kill them all and get the SB down to nearly dead.   
---
Then it heals up, and flies off into the distance and over a hill never to return. 
---
It's done that to me about four times now. Troll Scorch Beast.
---
No, I loved my time I spent. I made great friends and had a lot of fun. I have sunk rediculous amounts of time in this game. Just the one account banned had 5 chars all over lvl 50, a few were well over lvl 100. And that was just one of my accounts. Everyone I played with got sour a few month ago with the new bugs and nothing being fixed. I was that last fanboy in my group. And then this happened. It was the complete and total ignoring my requests that did me in. The death of another fanboy. 
---
I will go back my my other projects I have been working on now. Various pieces of software.
---
90%, check here - [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Use AA Power fist with Puncturing mode and Incistor perk...
---
I can imagine there's the part that they want us to play the survival aspect of the game and forage around, but by now most plant locations have been documented.
---
Wait, people can still buy stuff from your vending machine even when it's powered off? Does the vendor owner still get the caps? What's the point of powering it at all?
---
Wow! Thank you for all the work you put into these Bug Roundup's. Makes life easier for the CM passing the info to the devs :)
---
You still get the caps. Powering a machine on makes your camp visible on the map. When it's off, your camp doesn't show up.
---
If you leave private to public then back to private, it will be on a different server. I learned the hard way, mistakenly joined the public when transfer between character. So don't miss click transferring between characters.And there is a bug where containers will not spawn again. Luckily a friend joined the server and could pick the stuff up.
---
Wow. The amount of baseless and irrational excuses in this post...
---
Look we found the man who still supports what Bethesda‚Äôs doing after all they‚Äôve pulled
---
PvP is good endgame content, try speccing your build for it
---
Thanks that programmed showed my math was right. Looks like the game isn‚Äôt technically capped, it‚Äôs just limited to the perks, attachments and legendary effects if you can get a power fist to 90% armor penetration
---
It kept playing during every commercial when I was watching a movie and I just had to look it up.  I can't take one night off from 76 without being reminded haha
---
Level 170 and never launched a nuke. I find the Silo boring, and the only time I actually got around to complete it two dudes came in at the end and stole my nuke.
---
Besides, it's not like I need to nuke anywhere. In my 300 hours I have collected over 25 of each pure flux and have over 700 ultracite scrap.
---
&gt; because it's only active until said person restart it's router.
---
Your IP will actually likely remain the same. IPs are leased out for a time and get renewed periodically, and the ISP's system will remember who had what IP last, so if available, it will assign the same IP again and again till it gets assigned to someone else.
---
I once had the same IP address from my ISP for 6 years.
---
Full-faced motorcycle helmets also don't fully protect you from smoke and particle inhalation like a dust mask or gas mark. 
---
Go figure.
---
Lol nice
---
There are many other better options out there...
---
Different department. The Atom Store team are the top performers of BGS. They're about the only team I've see that have their shit together.
---
I think I've seen maybe 2-3 proper bugs and they're all dealt within no more than a day most of the time.
---
Welcome to 76. Get used to it ü§£
---
For now though you can at least remember to block them so you won't be matched with them.
---
Nope - it changes a lot of things - ask anyone playing NW.
---
And some rando on the internet is *always* more reliable amirite???
---
Dude. I remember the first time I got put in a bad sport lobby in GTA Online. I was a lot more humble after that. People driving on the walls with tanks and shit. Never again.
---
Not sure where you're from, but in most european countries (at least to my knowlege), the TTL (time to live) for IP-Leases is no longer than 24 hours. Routers will regularly cut the connection in the middle of the night (between 1 and 2 o'clock) and fetch a new IP-Address in the process.
---
I'm also fairly sure that the ISP does not remember your IP. For legal reasons, yes, but not for technical reasons.
---
Maybe you had an ISP that assigned static IPs? This is very uncommon for most private customers and usually reserved for businesses, but idk. Reassigning the same IP over and over again within 6 years seems very unlikely to me.
---
Did they made it so bad that online game can be altered with a hecking cheat engine? I don't know any other mp game which could be altered with it...
---
Ah darn...I'm ps4. I know u can Google the codes. I'm lvl 112 and should be strong enough to take on the creatures. But I've heard there's alot! Thanks anyway man!
---
Yes, it is capped to 90% by the perks and weapon bonuses - as far as I know you can't have more bonuses than 3 - one from perk, one from weapon prefix and one from weapon mods.
---
 Congrats!
---
They changed a setting rather than fixing the code. Why does this surprise anyone?
---
I just want them to make the 44  and the western revolver be double action like the wildlife versions are
---
There are LOTS of cheats out there for LOTS of games.
---
Yes, but were talking about fucking CHEAT ENGINE.
---
it was rigged
---
The conversations are really good but otherwise yes, I really don't want the next fallout game to be like it. It feels flat in basically all other areas.
---
Same answer, Pal.
---
Not to shit on anyone's day here, but to be honest... this shit should have been fixed 2 years ago during release and well prior to pay content like subscriptions. I would love to hunt down some bugs and agree with this completely... but. With abuse of trust when it comes to Bethesda's aggressive actions, makes one wonder... do they really care about the players? Or **just** the investors? 
---
And no that isn't a trick question, its quite simple really... You please the players, players pay money for more content to support said platform and investors are ALSO happy that they are getting a return on their investments.
---
With so many corners cut as of late with the production, support, and the LACK of competence of understanding what the community really wants, just spells out a big **NOPE** in my mind. Why bother wasting my time, when other games have went down the same path and did it better. What makes them different is, they actually gave a dam.
---
The Captain Cosmos would preclude that. 
---
Also, long time no see.
---
So, it's cheat made specifically for F76, or we're talking about the one which changes numbers to numbers we want?
---
I miss launching nukes on the scorch Queen :( I can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve seen a lobby with a nuke on it :/ here‚Äôs pics of the last run we did like 9 months ago: [Scorch Queen Nuke full lobby](https://imgur.com/gallery/IwySCzK) was always a blast having a whole lobby of people running amok
---
Oh no a good suggestion, be careful they‚Äôll monetize it just like they did with the fridge and tent ideas that came from this sub
---
Ohh that‚Äôs a new one. Interesting.
---
F76 is even bigger joke than I thought it is.
---
what banning scandal?
---
Hey just saw the notification for this, dont know if you two ever set it up but I sent a FR from a PSN that starts with R
---
Hey just got the notification for this. Sent a FR from a name that starts with R.
---
Average rando on the internet has a better track record of telling the truth than Bethesda so yes
---
Just did a SBQ tonight and we probably had fifteen players stomping around in power armor. Player population on PC seems very healthy despite Bugthesda's antics of late.
---
I came back about five weeks ago. In that time five guildmates have also returned and we're having a lot of with raids, SQBs, C.A.M.P.s, looting and trading.
---
Bethesda said they were considering a public tests server at the end of the [Wastelanders delay announcement](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more), it would be remarkably simple for them to implement a system that flags bug reports from the test server as resolved and rewards Atoms to the Bethesda.net account.
---
Possibly the world's worst job would be to have to manage the Bethesda reddit account. The amount of negativity must be overwhelming.
---
Depending on what system you play on. My fiance and I play on XB1 and we do at least 3 a night with a pretty decent turn out lobby wise. We utilize the LFG forums through Xbox to find fellow queen hunters.
---
Yeah I have pictures. She was also diseased I think.
---
Intelligence increases XP, Luck increases dropped gear condition, Charisma increases caps rewards. There are not other effects of SPECIAL stats on drops.
---
I envy you, hard to find them on Xbox I guess, everyone I know has uninstalled the game. Even more so after Beths shenanigans. I just returned tonight after a few months only stopped playing because everyone else stopped :/
---
Technically, it's 100% - When using the Blade of Basset with the Garb of Mysteries and Eye of Ra
---
But only in that instance.
---
I have never seen so many people with such terrible reading comprehension before...
---
I play XB1 and I usually use LFG, just wish my irls and long time urls would still play,
---
Someones lying. I'll have to assume Beth is lying once again. Only common sense.
---
Or corpse flowers to get corpse flower stamen
---
Why did I not read the future and come up with responses to things before hand? Are you serious? The same reason people do AMAs instead of just telling us everything. I put a lot of this on the site as an update days ago. My initial take down, I was just giving an explanation to my users, and nothing more. I also did not anticipate Beth trying to discredit me publically like this. I mean I had already lost respect for them as a company, but my God. They are still throwing me surprises. I thought for sure they would respond to my tickets first, but I was wrong, and here we are.
---
What is even more odd is why the first post anyone from Beth has made on Reddit in a few weeks?
---
Sure, upgrading gear is part of FO, but not the MMO approach of mindlessly farming for rare materials or a legendary that just has that one extra stat. By the time you get to that point, it's time to play another game.
---
&gt;As per the usual game mechanics, if I looted a location on public server - it will stay looted on private server for the usual respawn period
---
u/sauced_baucey, this is what people get confused with in regards to "Re-cycled" servers.
---
I believe so
---
- based on what I read it‚Äôs 180 containers or 20 hours
---
I mean, most online games usually have a policy where if you're using 3rd-party programs to alter the game, you're fine as long as you report how it's getting passed their security.
---
Lol they don't give a shit about bugs there's still bugs in this system since fallout 4. And rediculous amount of bugs that have been around since the beginning of the game they've known about and haven't fixed. It's not that they don't know these bugs exist it doesn't pay to fix them
---
It's not THAT much of a consideration since they've already done it a few times. PC players have already been public testers for the console players. 
---
All the PTS would do is formalise it and maybe open it up to console players as well.
---
"Yeah, I thought of a how something might happen, but I didn't actually test it to see. Let me know how it goes!"
---
Guess what, saying "THING HAPPENED! FIX IT!" Is much less useful of a bug report than "Thing happened, here's how it happened, and here's how I found out about it."
---
Could have a disease which reduces your AP.
---
Your elementary school skills are earning you a lot of down votes! You must be smart.
---
Go to the bank and hand them a penny and a dollar bill. Ask them if they see one dollar or two dollars. If they say it's only one dollar, remind them that they're wrong! Because 1 dollar and 1 cent is more than a dollar, therefore $1.01 is the same as two dollars!
---
ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
I'm not doubting you that there are online game companies that do this.  But I do doubt that it's most of them, only because no online game company whose online game I have ever played has ever taken the stance that 3rd party programs that actually alter the game (we're not talking overlays or stuff like that, but actual alterations of the game client or server communications) are totally ok as long as you report to them how it works.  I could be wrong, but I don't think that I am.
---
Why offer bounties on bugs they never intend to fix?
---
Sure have 14.99?
---
I quit for the 1st debacle, but now that I stepped away I really don‚Äôt miss it. I see now that a lot of my dedication to the game came from the amount of time and effort I had already sunk into it, hoping it‚Äôd all be worthwhile. I‚Äôll probably be back for Wastelanders though if anything just to play it out.
---
Now I just read the top posts on the sub and read ITVs for reasons to come back. Doubt there will be any until 2020 though.
---
Xbox has them all the time to I find them randomly every maybe 6th server hop also if you go to the official club people post them every 30 minutes a lot of times they do all 3 silos.
---
Lol this is what you want rn? With all the bugs and lack of content and stuff? Beth is too kind to you fellers i'd charge fallout first more
---
‚ÄúTested‚Äù the exploit for days, aka ‚Äúused‚Äù the exploit.
---
I do.
---
I remember it being a thing for Planetside 2 when I played back in the day.
---
Boxer shorts...
---
Thanks I will look when I go on later
---
Thanks I will check this out
---
Cause not air tight?
---
Yep.  Gone to the end with several teams but never done it.  Kinda feel tjat would ne the end of the game for me if i did.
---
Thanks so much I will check this later on
---
I haven't played since launch, but I've launched 4 or 5, they're cool and all, but for the time it takes not really worth it. Though we did launch it at the far city, whatever its name is in the south-east part of the map to kill the "final boss dragon" or whatever it was called.  
---
IIRC I'm level 96 or something near that.  
---
The game would spawn officers all over the place, it was hilariously easy to find one and get codes, especially with even just 1 friend.
---
I thought the same. Then I realized I was storing them and not
---
The only drop rate I need to happen is the red asylum outfit on ps4, I have personally found only two farming and a few more trading..
---
Why? Because they failed to deliver a good product on time? They are getting paid for this, its not a hobby its a job.
---
I'd not mind if most got firedüòï
---
Not only that but it also leaves an ugly end if your wall doesn't span the whole building and it makes them thicker than exterior walls.
---
Inner walls and half width walls would be very good to have.
---
Sadly it does use the same budget as 2 walls, but i think this is the nicest looking way of doing interior walls, well until they add actual interior walls.
---
&gt;  the cheat engine he used was still on his account.
---
Was it provided by the hacker 4chan? 
---
(That's how you sound)
---
Nah not a dick. Someone could have powered down his vendors to eliminate competition for all you know. When I'm getting close to max I'll leave the world so the guy buying stuff cant decide to bring me over max. Then I'll go blow it on a serum plan quickly and get back to business. 
---
If the guy is high level than he knew the risks of not having a lockable room for the vendors
---
Why? They probably won't fix it anyway, and may even ban you for it. Hell, people have been banned for not selling / dropping loot.
---
So you just want to be able to farm a red asylum outfit faster? You realise if the RNG rates were lowered it wouldn't be worth anything.
---
Look out for the 'V' on maps, it shows another players Vending machine and they can stack any items in there to sell for whatever price they feel like. 
---
\&gt; People are only interested in trading their rares for other rares. 
---
No, people will trade almost any item they find, but [rare](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rare) ones are often just that. RARE. If something is more rare, it'll have a higher price, called common sense.
---
That includes everyone in NW. They don't have to worry either.
---
You can alreay do that by placing a foundation outside of where the wall should be, place the wall the nomal way. Edit and "push" it out and it will flip. Remove the outer foundation. Sometimes this can even be done without placing the outer foundation.
---
Hey- if you are above the age of 18 slide into my dms.... to join a group I play with on discord. We do queen runs often!
---
I think they fucked up that fix they did
---
The maker of map76 ... He cheated to proof a glitch and got banned. He got salty, closed his website and blamed Bethesda.
---
I play solo most of the time.  Silo is easier alone seems to be less robots but I would be happy to run the silo with you this weekend and show you how to do it   Just send me a message and we can knock it out
---
Hey I play   Xbox with a discord group- super fun but they mostly focus on queen runs and me and one other really want to get that power armour from raids but alas we suck (not fast enough) dm me if you want to play with us aka help me and my friend raid haha
---
If you got 5 bloodied explosive weapons, would that mean that the legendary drop quality was fixed?  Seems extremely shallow.
---
ok, thx for clarification, might have missed that.
---
FWIW, no one has private servers. They have private instances, which they have to pay for. (Hilarious, I know.)
---
Good times.
---
I like power armor and a explosive Gatling.  Don‚Äôt even have to slow down on the run
---
Maybe in like a year or 2 when the bugs are all fixed. While it sounds cool, I dont think it's something they should work on as it would take time out of other development, would be buggy as all hell since its bethesda here, and they wouldn't make much more money. 
---
If anything they could send email alerts when something goes on sale or a special email when something you tagged goes on sale
---
Have to be a general in the enclave to get in the silo
---
Makes it troublesome with windows, but yeah it'll work.
---
Where can you find the recipe for cranberry relish
---
People think they are recycled because they see empty containers but i am pretty sure those are empty because they looted them themselves and the stuff hasn't respawned yet.
---
I prefer the single action. Sounds and looks great. Hits pretty hard
---
The Red Rocket Mega Stop is a work shop you can take over. If you want you can also build at the Red Rocket in Morgantown unless they patched it.
---
Honestly I don't really care what we get as long as they give it soon enough to use it, and not 2 days before Christmas üòí Or 6 days after Christmas üòí
---
I have no idea! But I run an automatic rifle build with an explosive railway rifle. Holy absolute hell that thing shreds. Impossible to aim. But God damn is it fun. 10/10 would reccomend
---
I'm afraid that this will be added later to 1st subscription.
---
&gt; So you just want to be able to farm a red asylum outfit faster
---
Was just an example...
---
&gt; You realise if the RNG rates were lowered it wouldn't be worth anything.
---
It would be worth less, but it would still be worth something. 
---
&gt; No, people will trade almost any item they find, but rare ones are often just that. RARE. If something is more rare, it'll have a higher price, called common sense.
---
And because of shit RNG, almost everything that's useful is rare. What does an AAE Handmade go for? Something like 40k or so right? And that's not even a god roll item.
---
Oh, and common sense says that if the in-game currency has no use in player trade, there's something usually wrong there.
---
I don't agree with items you mentioned - those need to be rare and sought after. There are some plans that should be buffed, since there is completely no reason for them to be that rare (sturdy and heavy metal or raider armor plans as an example).
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äòif‚Äô, that will never happen. Another player did a test on several toons, and found out Extra Bashing had highest drop chance, that was a few months back.
---
Yeah but they broke convention and it was taken down before even midnight on the 11th. So many dissapointed people and toddy just laughs about how much beta testing NW got. Usually refreshes at a certain time every time. I get it's an event but for every person on reddit bitching theres prob 50 in game feeling the same way. It's no just had business its straight up deception. But in my mind it was just ignorance to procrastination but I'm sure they could have pulled the numbers of who was close to getting the suit. At least I got the skins. And I enjoy NW, it's just when will the money grubbing and general fuckery stop. Still nothing back on my ticket response.
---
Just get better at bashing. üòâ
---
Would love for more stuff like this to make it in. At the end of the day, most people end up just sitting around their CAMP with nothing to do besides collect water from purifiers etc. Things like more farming options, fishing, and even possibly more in depth hunting would be nice, instead of walking around and slaughtering everything with your nifty explosive gun (which would absolutely obliterate the animal and meat).
---
Actually no. Cheat engine is just a took uses to view the memory of the game. Any exploit that can be done with it can also be done with a program written in any number of languages.
---
"Hear me out before you downvote me"
---
No, I dont think I will
---
lol wish I could practice on murmrgh üòÇ
---
Finally! Someone else talking about it! I made a post when the shop update hit and I was met with "I dont see it" and "we already have that"
---
Anyways, its very likely to be coming in the future. The armored variant in that picture, that is. Of course the normal and green standard versions are already there for first members. And this will almost definitely be a first member exclusive
---
You lied about cosmetics, released a broken-utterly mismanaged joke of a game that is STILL a dumpster fire nearly a year post launch..
---
Hmm.. I wonder why your credability is a little low? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Inivisible underwear.
---
Or the house near Whitesprings where the Overseer was wounded. One spawns in the basement there.
---
The test you're talking about was done on 5 accounts and it was proven that there's likely a 'seed' on each character or world that affects loot.
---
Here's the thing I think you're referring to, idk why you're still wrong about it though, lol. https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlrwcq/results_of_14500_scrip_spent_on_the_50_off_sale/
---
It would have been nice if they had just used the original. 
---
Same with Ring of Fire when they added it for Nuclear Winter.
---
Crossbow is a rifle. Railway is either under rifleman or commando based on the receiver. The harpoon should be under heavy gunner.
---
&gt;shit RNG
---
For you. My RNG has been perfectly fine, every single mischief night rare outfit obtained, TSE 3* handmade from Murmgh the second I hit 50.
---
That's what RNG is, a random number generator. There is no 'shit rng' you're just not getting rolls you want.
---
There is no actual cap. Theoretically because armor pen is multiplicative not additive you would creap ever closer without ever hitting 100% so 50% armor pen + 25% armor pen is actually 62.5% armor pen
---
There may or may not be some added stuff to roses radio as it gets closer to release
---
Yeah I can somehow see this happening, probably in the form of the tent.
---
I can't even find anyone selling it......
---
I'm a bloodied rifleman and I always switch to my unstoppable monster for assaultrons as they are super tanky if high level
---
If you need people to play with send me a msg on Xbox Unbeatable04 is my GT. I play with different friends at different times of the day and love farming queens or helping other players.
---
Still won‚Äôt ever buy a Bethesda game again, for starters I barely believe this shit, especially up against the comment by the map76 guy who explains his side pretty well, and secondly you stay entirely quite over concerns which affect the ENTIRE community and only speak out when you‚Äôre copping flak over one thing, that can be addressed whilst avoiding all the other BS you guys do
---
Yes that test had a conclusion that there‚Äôs a seed tied to each character, other than the ‚Äòseed‚Äô theory it also showed that bashing had highest chance among all effects. This latest experience looked like as if the 2nd effect is fixed (very high chance) on a particular one which happened to be the most useless one.
---
Complete the set with the same armor variant - combat armor can be light, sturdy or heavy.
---
If you want proof of the situation I will give you every tho I have including the many tickets and replies to tickets I made over a 13 day period to which I only ever got a human reply once and that was when I requested a text message sent to me. I called the customer support phone number which says it's supposed to give you a call back within 24 to 48 hours and never heard back at all. The problem is that you think Bethesda is a single entity. The people in customer service don't have the same ideals that the other parts of the company due which is evidenced by the fact that both jurassica and Lady devann have been helping us out with the entire situation
---
Ahhhh
---
Thanks a lot
---
Not really worth it imo. Demo 5 on a tse is like 12% increase in damage vs 15% from bloody mess 3, or an extra 50% sneak damage from whatever that agility perk is called
---
I suspected the skevers , but never the chickens, I thought they'd be too scared!
---
Did you read? It was an example it said
---
Shit RNG for the fact that it's RNG the amount of modifiers the weapon has, what weapon it is, and what the modifiers actually are.
---
Instigating Explosive is a good set of modifiers on The Dragon for example, but they're REALLY SHIT on a minigun.
---
Then imagine how long it would take for all the area of the map that is nukeable to be totally endgame and out of reach of everyone just starting out in the game. Then what would be the point of launching nukes in endgame
---
If I only have an hour to play I'll just go to wes tek and collect assault rifles until I can barely move, throw on hard barging 3 and sell them off
---
This is bullshit. Then why was the creator of the Map76 banned? He reported an exploit - boom, got banned.
---
All these things can be yours! Just buy FO1st and buy the 7k atom pack in the shop!
---
Could have it last twice as long as the normal blast zone before going back to normal - for gameplay reasons
---
There'd be two fucking huge holes on the map.
---
yep can confirm, came back to the game a few days ago and someone nuked fissure prime last night, I think there were about 10 of us.  
---
Was great, also PC  
---
Amidst all the troubles atm, I'm glad they made scorched earth a public event with free fast travel :D
---
As long they give us some of this stuff in game via a seasonal event (like mischief night) instead of locking it behind the Atomic Shop. Was pretty bummed out when the candy bowl was exclusive to the Atomic Shop, I love handing out free stuff to players who visit my CAMP.
---
&gt; If something is more rare, it'll have a higher price, called common sense.
---
Also, coming back to this, rarity =/= high value. Value for an object comes from demand compared to supply. Someone could have a one of a kind object, but if no-one wants it under any circumstance, it's worthless.
---
Obviously there should be limitations to where one could nuke / who could have access to a nuked area. Idk how it'd work... lmao.
---
Did you report it? You know about it now yes? I have given details. And did you report it to Beth? Oh you haven't? Why not? Oh, it has already been reported? They know about it now? I did the same thing, you are doing right now. Knowing of an exploit, know it has already been reported, so not reporting it. Has the idea even crossed your mind for a second that maybe you should go ahead and report it anyway? No, it hasn't because it has ALREADY BEEN REPORTED.
---
Hey everyone this Hugh guy knows about the exploit too and also did not report it.
---
See how your logic breaks down? The only valid argument about me not reporting it is that it would have helped cover my ass. But wrong there too because the person who did report it was also permabanned.
---
You can get away with more shenanigans when your game isn't complete shit.
---
Gauss Rifle is an energy weapon, so it can no longer have explosive.
---
Yup, do like Overwatch and ban the BIOS serial number. Literally no cheaters to speak of.
---
Did you actually understand my comment? You say we will never have another good single player rpg. Single player can never be as fun as a multiplayer can. So you‚Äôre welcome
---
This game needs in general more "busywork" flavour activities... Farming, better metalsmithing, better chemistry (like Skyrim alchemy) or my favorite idea - Aquaculture. That means fishing, water structures (e.g. houseboats and piers), new water plants, watermill generators, new water creaturs (nukalurks, beerlurks \[for Biv\], more radtoad variety), etc...
---
Did I attempt to use the exploit?
---
I'm sitting on 150 technical data and idk how to turn it in more than once in a while. Also I have gotten total shit rewards so far from it lol
---
&gt;seed tied to each character
---
Each character OR WORLD. Very different.
---
&gt;bashing had highest chance among all effects
---
So the weaker effect has a higher chance to drop, welcome to RPG games.
---
&gt;fixed (very high chance)
---
Fixed does not mean something has a very high chance, it means it's guaranteed.
---
Overall I'd say stop reading things to suit yourself, the actual words that are written as they are written tell a much different story.
---
If anything, sound like it‚Äôs gonna be focused on single player missions. From what some of the leaks say, there are certain quests that are locked off for other players in your party so they can‚Äôt even join you on that specific quest. My guess as to why this is is that certain quests will have you making choices and decisions you can‚Äôt go back on, and so they want to ensure other players in your party arnt being forced or put in a position they don‚Äôt want to make just yet. After all, you might want to side with the Settlers while your buddy is more into Raiders.
---
Check his update to the situation, he has admitted to extensively "testing" the exploit and noted that while it was reported by his group HE didn't report it.
---
Oooohhh, hate to be the one to break it to ya.. but those are all 100% trash. Cant turn in more than one. And yeah, rewards are trash 90% of the time.
---
Also don't buy technical data from anyone! Those wont work!
---
Well, well, well - Lucky me then.
---
The incompetence of bethesda never ceases to amaze me
---
Getting the perfect weapon for your character should take an insane amount of RNG, once you obtain it - there's not much left to do.
---
‚ÄúGreat tragedy on the river Ohio‚Äù. The collapsed bridge in the game is a reference to the incident in Point Pleasant where the Silver Bridge‚Äôs main span fell into the river in 1967. 46 people died.
---
You're modifying memory, that's what's gets detected.
---
Reading memory is pretty safe.
---
Yes!
---
Actually no. Cheat engine itself is looked for by the anti cheat. It has nothing to do whether you modify memory or not.
---
Well you sure seem against people finding these exploits and them being reported. I am not saying you did, but if you did I would expect you to behave exactly this way. So just to be clear, you are saying if you know about an exploit, but don't try to replicate it, then you should not report it? Or should you report it then as well? Your little avoid the question tapdance here is confusing me.
---
&gt;..... limited time Christmas skins and force everyone to unwillingly play NW again.  
---
Coming December 28th.
---
I can't get it to register at all it is driving me mad
---
My friend and I played religiously for like 6 months after taking a break during the beginning mess. Then after the announcement and delay of wastelanders- which we were hyped for until the sad news,,,,, ,  they then let us down with fallout 1st...we got tired of doing the same thing. Event after event, the same ones hoping we could get a 3 star legendary.... it‚Äôs what a lot of us High levels do is just hunt for legendaries, maybe find some new plans. Their just isn‚Äôt enough content in the higher levels to keep me engaged. Maybe others will have different opinions in regard to entertainment value and engaging content. Side note, I felt like in fallout 4 I could explore and explore and still find interesting enemies and places. Fallout 76 has always felt more empty to me. But hey I got value and played the game for awhile and enjoyed what was there. Was it perfect hell no, but it kept me interested for awhile. I‚Äôll probably be back again, but for now I‚Äôm with you and we are taking a break.  Cheers!
---
I found that standing on the lip of a spawning fissure site and taking a snapshot - in photomode only - did it. But yeah, like so many photo challenges it seems a bit awkward. I wasted a fair amount of camera film getting it right.
---
Radroaches are some actually some of the most powerful Force users in Fallout lore, followed only by flying Ghouls.
---
I guess, because it would make things to easy?
---
Me as a PS4 gamer üòè

Look at Jick , the creator of the [kingdomofloathing](http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/) and West of Loathing as an example of how to treat bugfinders and reward those who help the game (Aside for a minor controversy here or there) in the last 15 years it has proven very successful at keeping the bugs at a minimum.
---
Jick gives custom items to big bug fixers, to whole clans that are active fixers, he takes them on into teams to help and even hires some as staff. Plus they get custom animations or content written about them specifically.
---
The Pipe Revolver does. (^.^')
---
 dualwielding would be awesome with knifes aswell!
---
Both Radium and Gauss are considered energy weapons (datamined not so long ago, so 100% legit information), so they no longer drop with explosive and are legacies. 
---
Survival mode weapon might be considered legacies only by their names - all rolls are still possible to drop, so only collectors might consider getting them for their names.
---
Also "Double" prefix is considered legacy - it's no longer drop on any weapons.
---
crossbow works fine, perfect for sneaking / vats
---
It's correct
---
Two fucking huge holes coming right up!
---
Lewd.
---
Yeah, huge difference between reporting an open bank vault to the bank and taking a $1m from the vault then telling them its open.
---
I love that domed greenhouse. I felt soooo lucky when I got to pick up that green thumb bundle at the bundle sale event (I think it was just before Halloween).
---
Now, if only they would put the Whitespring Carpet back into the shop... My greenery base would be complete &lt;3
---
really nice and clever work, I bet owner runs with full pirate outfit ;)
---
That‚Äôs what I was hoping but nope, looked like jeans and leather jacket..
---
Too much cucumbers.
---
(I wonder if anyone remembers this meme...)
---
oh no, someone should give him a outfit for the effort :)
---
Yeah I was thinking that.. I don‚Äôt have it, sadly
---
I think there's a bug atm (on pc at least) where powered vending machines look un-powered. 
---
Ideally we need a couple players to test one of their vending machines to see if while fully powered off, can another player still buy from it.
---
Fucking idiots here spreading so much misinformation. Paintball gun, acid soaker and thirst zapper got deleted
---
I love Pipfall, short as heck but damn that has some playability!
---
PSA: If you find a Wastelad copy of RobCo Fun make sure you drop your copy of the holotape before you pick it up, otherwise it'll consume the magazine without adding a 2nd copy.
---
imo it's on them then lol, personally I wouldn't hold it against a player if they bought from my machine if I had only powered it off and not locked it away or taken out the items.
---
If I get a two shot one do I get free ammo from that? One shot makes two crossbow bolts on the ground?
---
And is quad crossbow any good in terms of rate of fire?
---
Do you mean handgun or revolvers?
---
I mean we have:
---
 * Laser Pistol
---
 * Plasma Pistol
---
 * Plasma Flamer Pistol
---
 * Repeater Pipe Pistol
---
 * Pipe Pistol
---
 * Pipe Revolver
---
 * 10mm Pistol
---
 * Single Action Revolver
---
 * Western Revolver
---
 * 44. Revolver
---
 * Gamma Gun
---
 * Blunderbuss
---
 * blackpowder pistol
---
 * Alienblaster (omg pls give this toy gun a buff)
---
Except for Melee and Non Automatic Rifles, there isn't any Weapon Category with more variety.
---
I'm going to try again, but I was practically in it &amp; took loads all around it. :(
---
I'll hunt 3* enemies all day and get 1-2* weapons/armor. Then when I finally get a 3 star weapon/armor it's usually a pipe weapon or wood armor with a terrible set of perks.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for, thank you!
---
Haha.. When i still played this game, I'd follow others around nuked areas. And when i observed them bite more then they could swallow.. Id steal all their dropped loot. Only leaving something in their bag like toilet paper. I do and don't miss the game.
---
I had Quad once, this thing was pain to reload, while fun to use. Nothing like hitting headshots with a crossbow bolt, which requires some time to lear due to the awful sights. If this was fixed like in NW, it would be OP.
---
Turns out that Youtubers lie about this for views ? Who would have guessed that those guys dont do any research or wait for more info
---
Just resetting your router would change your IP unless you pay extra for a static ip address.
---
I literally find it impossible to believe a comment from Bethesda. You may be right, but I won't hear it coming from you or your paid propaganda accounts.
---
I love that idea!
---
Thinking about it now, having a barn- or hunter's lodge-themed camp tickles my fancy... They could even turn a few bucks if they gave us a few more worthwhile things in the atom shop for this theme. I'd probably even buy some of that.
---
Alas, I doubt anyone from Bethesda even reads this :(
---
will probably be just 1 bolt dropped as it will be 1 bolt per shot with two shot 
---
no idea about quad xbow, im not sure if rate of fire affects single-shot weapons in the game
---
It does!
---
I was hoping thats what would happen pre-release, with the world obviously going back to normal after a time, but seeing how unstable the game still is, I really dont think its possible yet. Who knows, maybe something like this is the pipeline still.
---
It's one of my few major disappointments regarding this game. I actually really hoped nukes would leave totally destructed areas.
---
Incorrect, read the zenimax TOS having CE running isn't against the rules. They clearly state to break the rules you must MODIFY the game. Just using CE to view memory doesn't modify anything in the game. So not against the TOS.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre not missing anything, last thing she dropped for me was a 1* Cyrolator. Worth more trouble hauling that piece junk back to the scrip machine, then the ammo I wasted on the Queen.
---
So creative. I love it!
---
What about it?  You can cancel it, no problems.  u/undefined7196 was mad because he couldn't get a *refund* for a service he'd already used.
---
You buy a pizza, eat half of it, decide you don't like pineapple and ask for a refund.
---
Uh no, check my post history I've defended glorf the 900 hour guy who got accused of duping, jon_blue when his wife lost all her gear prior to him capturing it on video, etc.
---
So no, you're wrong about your assumptions. I know how buggy this game is and have been around online gaming long enough to know false positives happen in ban waves.
---
I look forward to playing the Wastelander content Solo in my Private world.
---
Not to mention grated catwalks.
---
Is completely wrong, if that were the case NW hackers would get banned. But they don't.
---
"The only way out.....is suicide" -Chief Wiggum
---
*Porque no los dos?*
---
Bethesda said they don't ban people for reporting exploits, u/undefined7196 said he didn't report the exploit.
---
Nope. Unable to get far enough into the silo on my own, although I might try again at some point, but then again I don't need to nuke anyone, other than the materials resulting in the nuked area, I really don't see the point. Anyway, back to my Private world I go.
---
Melee is less maintenance, I just switched from a melee to a stealth commando blah blah blah (won the purveyor lottery on a fixer). The fights are a LOT shorter as are the weapon/armor repair bills. I always used to have stacks of random ammo, but now I spend hours farming lead and Wes Tek to feed the stupid thing. On a side note I burn through legendary scorchbeasts with relative ease, other than the queen, to get more scrip. It was hard to kill a normal scorchbeast with melee unless they landed.
---
Pick a class (meta?) you are interested in and give it a go. You can always grind levels, even though its a PITA, to switch to something else. This game is a marathon and there's enough time until new content for you to get comfortable with a role.
---
Build your camp somewhere near whitesprings, it's the mid point of the map and there's a bit of traffic. If you need money, start selling ammo. IMO I never find 5.56 or .45 on vendors, when I do I buy it all even if it's overpriced and I'm low.
---
Read the info from other dataminers. Yes tested it multiple times as the first emergency patch didn't fix the whole bug so they tested if the exploit waz still there and reported it which caused the other emergency patch.
---
Read the TOS having CE running while the game is is completely within ths rules. What breaks the rules is MODIFYING the game files\ memory. Just viewing memory doesn't break the TOS.
---
For values of "massive" that are 24 or less.
---
Cool, thank you, now I wish I had never read any of those plans.
---
I think the same abot the pip-boy based chat, it could even cost caps or atoms (but better for free at leat for some time for new players), but this function must be available.
---
I subscribed to Fallout 1st, for the Atoms, the unlimited scrap box and the private world.  
---
Be 1st or be last. ( All jokes and sarcasm aside, it's just nice to wander the map Solo).
---
Exactly!
---
I didn't even realise this was a thing people were doing and there's sure to be others who don't realise, especially new players.  
---
Buyers shouldn't be responsible for lazy seller practices lol
---
Neither is Fallout 76, but here we are.
---
You're literally arguing with the dataminer who found the exploit and reported it...
---
Fo76 doesn't check if you modify the files just if you have CE running, which can be bypassed by renaming it to another program. The NW hacker who did an AMA here even admitted he can hack the game with CE without fear just by renaming it to "spotify".
---
I think I know why it wouldn't work, at least in my case. Fissure sites that are not marked on the map as fast travel points don't seem to register. I got it to work going to a fast travel point one.
---
The wood mask got removed as well, along with the Fatman that shoots bowlingballs
---
Lmao not at all, buyer still pays full price.  
---
Seller just gets punished for not realising or being too lazy to secure the machines.
---
But, they DO get wounded and weakened. Down another stimpack or took some hits to the armor. They MAY get better gear, but not necessarily.   
---
As for wiping us from existence before we finish the job - I don't WANT to wipe you from existence.  I want to down your friend from a bush near the limit of my weapons long range - because that is likely OUT of range for you.  Odds are good you can't see me to start, so, you can come after me, or you can tend to your wounded - can't do both.  If you come towards me, I can probably get one or two shots on you before you pinpoint me - maybe another before you get in range with your handmade.  Then your downed buddy dies on his own.  If you go fix your buddy, I'll put you down while you're doing it.    
---
Now, if you have ALL four team-members, you have a chance because you may have coordinated who is the attacker and who is the healer ahead of time - with contingencies for who takes over which position when one goes down. THEN, you could do both things - fix your buddy AND come after me.  And honestly, if you have a team that you work with on a regular basis and have that all worked out - you've put in the time and effort to deserve that win.  I congratulate you.  
---
I'm just a part-time sniper who scavenges the bodies and waits for the right moment to strike.  I have no friends. I have nobody to save me and I have nobody to save either.
---
At this point with their other lies, and the fact that Bethesda themselves flew them down to Austin to try out NW. Yes I hate to say it but I trust the dataminers who have been active and helpful in this community since the game launched over Bethesda and their repeated changes they purposefully leave out of patch notes these guys call them on, the cosmetic only promise, etc.
---
And that person who won? That was someone like me. Hide and wait for the beasts to kill themselves off.
---
Not sure if this'll be much help, or if the link to my clip will actually work but here's how to do it, you can put wallpapers one both sides of the walls this way too!

---
You're not alone my friend.
---
May I recommend that you play The Outer Worlds? I've seen a lot of people say that it scratches that familiar Fallout itch
---
Yes he tested it due to all the crazy accusations before like the claimed trade steal exploit. He tested it after the first patch they put out fixing it because he was worried it wasn't fixed, and it wasn't until Tuesday the Saturday patch they put out to fix it didn't fix it. That is why he tested it because it wasnt fixed completely and the fix they put in was easy to bypass. So he went and checked to see if it was fixed or how bad it was still exploitable.
---
I don't now a lot about this except this gem you might find helpful: Apparently Demolition expert perk works with explosive weapons.
---
Have fun!
---
Wow literally has LUA scripting code in place to let you modify your client however you want and that includes connections to their servers. Hell, auctioneer add-on will scan the entire auction house and save every price and help you sell items for the most profit by seeing if the prices are over the average for that server or under average.
---
Once again, shame on me for agreeing with the OP? You guys are funny :)
---
That is weird, my request was ignored for weeks when I did it. I had to spam every department to get a response. How did you cancel yours? You did cancel it right? Or is this more of pulling information out of your ass? Because I actually did it and experienced the process. 
---
Buy a pizza that promises a private booth. Anyone you know can just show up to eat it and the solution stop this is to block them. Lol. Just loose that friend fuk them. Great solution. Anyway, all of the hundreds of people on your friends list can come by and eat the pizza, uninvited, and then the pizza steals all of the stuff in your wallet.
---
We get it dude. You love Beth and work for them or whatever. "Brand ambasador" or whatever they call smirf these days.
---
I have no idea if such mod/perk exists in the game. If you are reffering to the √ñre sniffer"technology, it's just a lore behind excavators multiple yield.
---
I recently made a post about lead farming in lucky hole and one of the commenters recommended the mod. Idk if it‚Äôs real tho. Thanks for the input
---
Which post? I'm not OP.
---
I stopped playing a while ago, but I love this sub to check out peoples incredible bases. Some seriously cool stuff in this community.
---
That's great. I saw one similar where they'd used Broadsiders on heavy weapon display stands to make the cannon.
---
Nah man, they can store the vendors if they dont want to sell. I dont put shit for sale if I dont want it to sell (or over price it a lot so it is worth it to me if it does)
---
I had a strategy i used after reading comments here. Basically i always had on me the plan i dropped on the latest run and only that. Learn them one by one and keep on you the one you just dropped.
---
With this i dropped all of them one after another with only 1 miss at the last.
---
Careful with what you say Bethesda might steal the idea and try to sell it to you
---
I'm level 610 and carry people like you.  You're welcome.

I don't know what the policy on links to the nexus is so rather than providing you with a link I would suggest that you search for: 'Fallout 76 ore\_glow'

Did you tested it at an abandoned mine chimney?
---
Bes, go on! Draw yourself a plan for one post and 30-50 answers per day on each platform, and confidence will gradually recover.

Although the whole situation is awful.
---
Make sure you equip the green thumb perk when looting other peoples fruits. YARR!
---
Yes, it‚Äôs a feature.. look for a tree house up the hill
---
Dude this sub is now completly deviod of all rational thought and sentience. Its like watching evolution go backward. All the rest of us sane individuals can do is just watch bethesda fuck them into the ground some more and then listen to them squeal when they get what they deserve
---
Only if you're willing to pay an extra $5 for the ultracite skins.
---
My advice, first if all try to figure what you want to spec into before making an further mistakes. For example, I originally started out with shotguns because I figure one shotgun shell gives you more bang-for-the-buck than any other ammo type, and it s more common. However, in the late game ammo is easier to craft/buy from vendors soI also switched to a Commando Stealth build which required all the points I saved up from leveling up. There are websites and videos online that can help you min-max your build before to start wasting points on perks you don‚Äôt need.
---
Other advice just includes taking advantage of the daily vendor limit. First thing I do when I login is spend around 1,200 caps on people‚Äôs vendors, then I go to Blackwater Mine and Big Bend Tunnel and clear out all the enemies while picking up all their weapons to sell to the trains station vendors. I can get my daily 1,400 caps in less than half an hour doing this, plus you get the XP and ammo they drop. As you level up you‚Äôll eventually be swimming in level-up points, caps, ammo, etc.

Ammo duplication occurs only with explosive weapons, every enemy (dead or alive) caught in explosions have a chance to spawn ammo.

Could I jump on tomorrow? I was just about to log out. I've been playing solo for a while too, need some homies to play with

The codes apparently in the game for it Bethesda just hasn't fully implemented it
---
Just added you. We should create a thread on Reddit to find more people. The other user has to add me yet.
---
Except you playing and supporting a corrupt lying peice of shit dev that cares for nothing but squeezing money out of people DOES affects me personally in that it enables this developer to continue these extremely anti consumer practices and it will lead to shit like this happening when the next Elder Scrolls game come out, a game which I actually do want to play. You're telling them this is okay now, and so it will be in the future. You're part of the problem and you're ruining shit for everyone else.
---
my user is Cactasboy13 lets get together sometime
---
Actually i'm level 92, never launched one, mostly cause i play solo and it's too much resource and time consuming for me at the moment, hope to do it someday :D
---
to back up the other users about the gauss being a legacy, here is the link to the datamine SS

Doesn't all damage also have built in armor penetration at the rate of 6.66%? For example an enemy with a DR of 300 needs 2000 damage per hit to reach full armor penetration, and any additional armor penetration won't do anything because DR cannot be reduced into the negative.
---
my soul stahp it &gt;&lt;
---
And listen to the holotapes and read the notes. They're there for a reason. Theres a lot of interesting lore and stories in this game if people paid attention to it.
---
That will all come in due time... after the settlers and raiders return who do you think will follow in future updates?
---
Yeah, 5 bucks per underwear retexture would be nice. Something I'd totally paid for after spending 100 dollars for private servers.
---
Thank you! I thought I was losing my mind...
---
That's... actually a reasonable guess. Having seen the mechanations of big companies myself, I have no issue believing that a last-minute emergency addition like that would become "standard-issue" as time goes by. Because nobody wants to tackle that particular organizational nightmare once it's in place.
---
Also, for Vault76 it may actually make more sense to have them wear this colour because they are actually supposed to go out into the world to repopulate Appalachia. Makes sense to give them undies that don't "stain" when washed in running rivers or ponds.
---
Granted, it does not make too much sense in having them go out in their crisp blue-gold Vaultsuits from a camouflage-perspective. But it would make a lot of sense if you look at it as either a "tradeable" or "recognizeably friendly" piece of equipment. Thinking along the lines of Vault-Tec: "If all humans died, the Vault folk will know and recognize each other. If some humans survived, you can trade in your garish shinies for useful supplies if needed or in a pinch." - I personally would find that very reasonable. Decently practical for a group of Fallout survivors...... At least in my mind. (I know it's just musing)
---
If you use ultracite PA, you can actually attach the jet pack to arms and use emergency protocols on the torso :P
---
If I ran a company and a Tech support replied that I'd fire his ass. Into fucking orbit.
---
Yess I am playing it and i‚Äôm enjoying it so will continue to do so
---
I don‚Äôt spend any money in game as that is one of the few things I have a problem with - i spent my ¬£50 on it and thats all I‚Äôm willing to do
---
I‚Äôm not going to be spending money on atoms and certainly won‚Äôt be subscribing to it
---
You don‚Äôt want to play it then thats your decision - and i‚Äôll respect that
---
You need to do the same cos in my opinion it is people with attitudes like your to people like me that are ruining it.
---
Not saying Bethesda are innocent and have made mistakes (they have) but you and people like you need to stop being so damn hateful to those of us who do play it
---
They are banned because they themselves have used exploits, which is against the rules.
---
You can't burn down a building and then proclaim "I was just testing the materials for you, wood burns btw" and then claim to be innocent. Same issue here.
---
Yes. Get off my lvl 300 lawn you little shits.
---
Make the more rare plants cost water and fertilizer to harvest/replant. Boom, balanced.
---
Sssshhh... don‚Äôt suggest Bethesda anymore ideas. They might turn it into a another paywall.
---
I quit when the scrapbot arrived. Just couldn't take any more lies and my hope for the game was ever decreasing since release. Never trusting anything Beth say or do from now on. Next time, if ever, I try a game by Beth I'll have a wooden leg and an eyepatch, also a parrot on me shoulder, yarr!
---
It's very disappointing once you find out what it is.
---
Same here
---
Please elaborate
---
Same with combat shotguns/rifles. Exact same model, but you can't apply the same skins to each. People kept saying "bUt ITs A diFeRENt WeaPOn" like that was somehow stopping them.
---
The good thing about Scorched Earth is not the Queen itself, but the several random legendary mobs that appear throughout the fight. I hit a legendary mirelurk king at the last second yesterday, and it dropped a Bloodied Explosive .50cal
---
Still, I think the Queen should only drop 3* legendaries. Being the toughest enemy, it's fair.
---
It just works
---
That's a Remembrall to not forget to renew your sub.
---
I'd be up for joining some vault raids. I have to earn you that I've never actually ran any of the vault raids though so have no clue what to do
---
The first time I heard it a mothman had just appeared and was shaking its wings at me. I thought the two were connected. I've had it a couple of times since, not investigated it yet though, a job for tonight...
---
No them not gaining XP would show to them that they've been flagged. Keep it hidden
---
This game needs to go have some quiet time and think about what it's done.
---
Sadly, that's all on Bethesda.
---
Hopefully they get their shit together for Wastelanders, cause that's their last chance for a lot of people.
---
Canvas bags. Nuka Dark. Only cosmetic. 16 times the detail. 4 times the size of Fallout 4 (yeah, it would be... if they hadn't cut all the edges).
---
There are so many lies it's hard to keep up.
---
Yes and no. Someone has to try burn the house to find its weakness. And when the builders themselves don't know if a building can burn, someone else tests it before the whole town burns down.
---
'hey building houses like this have a high chance of starting a widespread fire' . 'Thank you we won't make buildings like that anymore' would've been a great response, instead they get jailed lifetime.
---
Thanks heaps for answering :).
---
That's close to impossible for me I'm too low level &amp; inexperienced to get to die at that exact moment/place :(
---
Downvoting all my posts won't silence me but nice try. Opinions must be heard, not silenced by the sheep.
---
Of course it would be annoying, but I suspect Bethesda could do it for profit (atoms) or to make it look "realistic" (caps), like we pay for our mobile connection.  Crafting is much better than paying.
---
What a great idea for the christmass tree :) i realy like it
---
You must not know how cheat engine actually works then. The map76 guy used it to look at values stored in the game which is how he and others found exploits and security flaws in the game. Cheat engine allows you to change those values and that would be cheating but that wasn't what was happening. 
---
Ex. In borderlands 2 you can just look at legendary weapons drop chance or you can change it to 100% if you'd like.
---
I gave up because I ran out of bullets. Now off to farm acid for gunpowder
---
Anyone having this issue open a ticket on the official site?  Just curious
---
I don't get It, it's the same trailer we watched many months ago.
---
Annoying. They're usually pretty good at specifying.
---
Please, continue.
---
1st party to you. Still 3rd party to Bethesda.
---
they are? got any proof of this? if so i'll also put that in the main post
---
I normally just sell a bunch of tatos from my camp
---
Marine tac helmets for me. 29 caps per piece on a Just capping Day. If I have time to play, it's All the cooked Meat I gather or chems that literally weifhs me down.
---
I am quite aware of that. People were going crazy about them, youtube videos cranked up, to cover said hoaxes
---
Didn't they remove the bottle cap mines from the game with patch 11?
---
Downvoted by Bethesda employess
---
Not directly from it. Things only last 50% longer in it so even if you could, unless you're in a high traffic area, selling food that can spoil would still be tricky.
---
Y‚Äôall really jumping ship and praising Bethesda ? How about them banning many players who were helping the community? Still think they‚Äôre in the right? Or the unfair advantages that came with fo 1st?
---
:(
---
I sell serums at 500 per with my hard bargain perk equipped then I sell random aid stuff and non legendary armor or weapons for the rest
---
I sell bulked scrap each day.
---
I am a compulsive looter though.
---
It kind of looks like a fire truck. Not sure how to post pictures.
---
I know that duping is possible, but I do not know how to dupe.
---
So, I don't attempt to dupe, and I don't report something I personally have no proof of.
---
Be loyal to your family or your god or something, not to a videogame company. who cares who is most "loyal" to a company a thousand miles away that doesn't know or care about you.
---
Honest question here. Do you actually have any idea what is going on here?
---
Was this post aimed at bringing the community to your side and helping clear the air on the subject? Because you only managed to do one of those things. 
---
You guys messed up... again. And every time you keep plowing forward like this, especially without admitting fault then you keep leaving more people behind. 
---
It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre mad at you Bethesda, just disappointed. Hopefully reddit posts get through to you this time.
---
Lol. The perfect timing so we can have it ready for next year.
---
I'd rather not give Bethesda any ideas to sell back to us. Also helps them to focus on getting Wastelanders right because if they don't stick that landing, I think they'd be pretty much done.
---
loot everything.
---
scrap for components you need, sell the rest to bot vendors.
---
2 circuits through WS and outside blackwater usually does it.
---
Read the notes you find around the cabins
---
In other words, you haven't look in to it.
---
Thanks!
---
I saw this and thought, I‚Äôve already spent so long farming acid...*ohhhhhh, right. Yes.*
---
I would love all three suggestions if they were implemented.
---
:O
---
How many tatos do you grow?!
---
That's the thing, I don't think I could upkeep that
---
*clap* tar *clap* berries
---
Serums sell for 500 each at vendors??
---
Give unlimited stash to everyone, and whale everyone else. I'd be happy with that.
---
I do wish we could compare them
---
Most of the kills like that were slow motion. I don't see that returning in a multiplayer game.
---
Yeah, but that requires effort.
---
First off,
---
Bethesda, why haven't you hired all these guys as they obviously know more about finding bugs and exploits than you do?
---
These guys are computer Masters!
---
They write or rather build their own tools to go in and find bugs and exploits in that broken flaming landfill of a game that you all are price gouging the piss out of your remaining gamers, because either you can't find the bugs and exploits to fix this game or won't do anything at all!
---
From what I'm able to gather, this team's basically had the wink and the nod from the community managers for this team to do what they have been doing, isolate the bugs and exploits that are in the game, either by bad code writing or intentionally put into the game by design to further monetize the players (In other words, exploit the gamers.  Bethesda should be Banned for using exploits, imo.).
---
Which makes me think, so what is it that you have to hide Bethesda?
---
Gotta ban the data miners before they possibly find out something?
---
You know other data miners will find it, right?
---
To the Map guy and data miner crew (Deserving a lot of respect!):
---
Other than a sloppy mistake or two, you have no fault in this at all, imo.
---
The community managers knew you guys had a Love for this game, they knew what you guys did for them and the gamers.  Mostly the gamers!
---
They should Hire you guys Today and be sucking up to you for saving all their asses so far!  Who knows how much you all discovered and how many crisis you averted, perhaps the game might not exist if it wasn't for your efforts!
---
As I mentioned earlier above, I wonder what Bethesda's hiding in that messed up code of theirs, must be some really good stuff or bad stuff.  I can't help but to suspect.  ;)
---
Pay no attention to the trolls spouting off, they're probably Bethesda employees masquerading as gamers!
---
One of them just struck me as being off, like they were overly protective of Bethesda, accusing you of lying, cheating and getting sympathy that's something a company employee would do!
---
Personally, I urge you to not be discouraged and not to give up!
---
If Bethesda's smart (I won't hold out hope there for obvious reasons!), they'll contact all you guys, lift the bans, if they don't hire you like they should do, they can make arrangements for you to continue fixing their game using your tools and/or their tools they approve of, or perhaps even using a hybrid of both your tools you guys built and Bethesda's approved tools.
---
Let the legit gamer fanboys spout off and whatever if they need to, they're probably just jealous!  lol!
---
But, they too now know they aren't important enough to Bethesda to not get banned and now they know it for sure, they don't like it.
---
Purified water you can get from your camp collector's also add up nice to the daily cap.
---
Use grape mentats for extra vendoring price.
---
if BE weapons is meta, Why can't the armor be unyielding/ sentinel?
---
3 serums plus random crap. Done.
---
Probably about 40 plants but I also sell my unwanted chems
---
Sell assault rifles looted from super mutants or go to Harpers ferry kill everything, loot everything and sell to local robot vendor.
---
Nobody has ‚Äúunlimited stash‚Äù you can however have unlimited junk which I‚Äôd be down for being available to everyone.
---
You know very well what I meant.
---
With hard bargain
---
Not particularly no, if you wanted unlimited junk storage then say that instead of STASH, two separate things entirely.
---
That's interesting because I remember seeing somewhere some decent-ish evidence that the income *per-camp* of purified water is exactly the same, and more generators only increase the storage. So by this logic you couldn't get much more than anyone else?
---
There are a few locations that have a ton of scrap like Braxons Quality Medical supplies. Its not the best method but worked for me.
---
They weren‚Äôt in slow-motion per se, but the animation did have to play out. It was always a risk, especially in busy areas, but was quite enjoyable running from target to target knocking off different animations while getting shot at. 
---
I don‚Äôt see it not being possible as it didn‚Äôt change the camera perspective or alter time in game (I only ever play in 3rd person so maybe it did in 1st person), but it would add a level of risk that‚Äôs for sure.
---
Sounds more like yer butt hurt you haven‚Äôt found these rare items or don‚Äôt have enough to trade. You must have been jumping for joy when mischief night dropped whitespring jumpsuits.
---
They ever add garden plots like in FO4?
---
I hate to be a glass half empty kind of guy but judging by previous content releases over past months people are able to run through a good chunk of the content in a couple of days. The raids came out with the possibility for characters to get wiped and nobody does Arktos Pharma and the burrows anyone (except when Harper‚Äôs ferry gets nuked).
---
I don‚Äôt think that Wastelanders will be the hallelujah that this game needs, I hope that I‚Äôm proven wrong I really do but we will have to wait and see.
---
I like the pissed stained one's give them that authentic look ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I have an insigating and 33pct vats crossbow I found in someone's inventory.  It uses the rifleman perks. That is a really fun weapon for my Skyrim stealth archer build. Lol
---
Lewisburg, Uranium Fever, Harpers Ferry all close to vendors or train stations kill everything grab all weapons and sell. Then you don't have to use crafting materials from your stash. Equip Hard Bargain and take a grape mentat.
---
I always found Lead to be the limiting factor.  Steel is like   wood and dirty water.
---
I have a camp just like this, they are cool as hell!
---
Fashnacht, meat week and Halloween event on constant weekly rotation with scrip rewards. Maybe release that paintball gun as a rare reward.
---
Go read his own comment on this very thread, where he admits to modifying literally hundreds of things in the game haha When you are done reading, get off his dick.
---
I still want to be able to make firecracker whiskey.. 
---
We need planters too!
---
Oh and Grafton
---
Did someone call for two, huge, fucking holes?
---
Yeah I think that‚Äôll be the most likely outcome especially seeing as we will most likely get some form of Christmas event, although it‚Äôd most likely be one every two weeks so that the market doesn‚Äôt get too oversaturated with rare loot.
---
Maybe giving events like Vault 94, Arktos and the burrows double exp or loot drops would be a good way to also keep players satisfied.
---
Bye
---
Wastelanders may well not be as you say but it has to be or this game is pretty much dead. I don't even think middling so-so reception would be enough.
---
400-500 caps depending on CHA
---
I think most of the time you see that an enemy likely damaged their wiring somehow.  I just but stuff I guess unles its locked up.
---
Optimist Me: Thanksgiving, Xmas, New Year, Valentine's, Spring Cleaning Events.
---
Pessimist Me: Free Icons, 500 Atom Skins, 1500 Atom Costumes, 2000 Atom Bundles.
---
Realist Me: I'll take whatever I can get, free content-wise.
---
Seems like it usually kicked in for me on the last kill of a battle.  I believe it was the same in Skyrim.
---
Pickup weapons to sell and any chems, purified water I don't use.
---
Battlebot in the ash heap ...... 
---
I forget the exact location, but its along the RR tracks about 1/2 way between Welch and .... lewisburg, I think.

---
This is the only clip I could find from back in the day, but there is no camera cut or slo-mo on either execution. Hopefully the link works. üò¨üò¨
---
Caltrops are still in. One of the few survivors. I really don't get why they removed the thirst zapper and acid soaker since you couldn't get ammo anyways. 
---
But hey this is the stuff to spend time on display items instead of fixing the other massive problems.
---
I've noticed with music, but I kind of like it. Sometimes an elder scroll song will play and its just really pretty and fits the mood. So it works out I think.
---
Because in order to actually properly do it, it has to be tested to determine the underlying problem. They tested said exploit to determine what caused said exploit in order to report to Bethesda the steps taken to reproduce said exploit so it could easily be fixed. It's literally what QA is supposed to do. It's not "go play for half an hour and tell us what you think" it's doing the same things multiple times to see if it works and if there is a way to break said thing. 
---
Exploits aren't a Konami code you can just hammer in for unlimited everything. Finding what  triggers an exploit and how to properly reproduce said exploit. There's a reason any other game asks you _exactly_ what you did to cause said exploit or bug,so they can try and reproduce it and in turn see what caused said exploit to actually fix it. Map guy took the liberty and time to do their work for them, you can argue he shouldn't have and you'd be right to do so, he was trying to help fix their game and they burned him at the stake for it. Risk of the "job". That said, it's dishonest at best for Bethesda to claim that they value the reports and help if they're burning people at the stake for that very reason.
---
End of the day, map guy tried to help law enforcement catch a criminal and in return he was the one that gets sentenced. He tried to help the game, and it cost him said game. He took the gamble, which was on him, and he lost. However that said,it's undeniable with that said and done that Bethesda is throwing out a ridiculous boilerplate PR statement full of sweet little lies as is par of the course.
---
And combat rifle skins for the fixerüò°
---
Bethesda's post wasn't to smooth things over with those who no longer accept what they say at face value. They are playing directly to the crowd who try to frame their every move as improving the player experience.  
---
If Bethesda admits that they cannot deal with the exploiters, then its game over. Best to make vague statements and create doubt. People want to believe that Bethesda is still in their corner, and a vague statement like this make it much easier to get the pieces to fit.
---
:( spoiler 
---
This was a fun short quest
---
My question is, what's Bethesda hiding?
---
The more I think about it, the more convenient it seems to be that the data miners were banned.
---
The data miners can see a lot, I'm sure.
---
I have to wonder how close the data miners were to stumbling upon something Bethesda wouldn't want anyone on the outside to know...
---
You could do them all in a row if you could 1-shot the enemy with a power attack. I would run through interior areas and just execute from enemy to enemy as long as the attack would kill them. If you killed multiple enemies with VATS it would most of the time  do the animation on the last guy killed.
---
Probably because its a Captain Cosmo costume and not a real suit, just like a NASA astronaut Halloween costume isn't going to work in space.
---
Possum badges. Try finding the plasma grenade plans. It might be the rarest thing in the game.
---
I started the possum grind last week and only have collector and chemist badges left. I really like the ever upwards quests and hope they add more ranks.
---
No. This is very important. DLC, which will pretty much define the future of the game. If it's good many players will return. If it's bad, It will be the final nail in the coffin for majoroty of players.
---
I had totally forgotten I planned on doing those! Thanks for the reminder!
---
Well wtffff I want them üò©üòÇ
---
Yup. 
---
Relevance?
---
Just finished clearing West Tek and had a weird experience.   I cleaned out the entire building netting 1 \*\* Enemy (dropped \* regenerating Armor).   Figure this is a crappy server go about collecting the loot from the goo piles/corpses and when I hit the lab area (where I first entered) I get a fresh wave of Mutants most of which are \*\* and \*\*\*.  Netting \*\* Bloodied double barreled, \*\*Nocturnal LMG, \*\*\* Assassin's Fire Axe, \*\* Weightless Armor Combat Leg. Could there be a lag in the legendary spawns? I wasn't there long enough for a refresh of the site.
---
Idgaf it‚Äôd prolly only be 1k atoms, the other display racks where free soü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you've learned Shielded before the others you won't find them in world anymore. As they are supposed to be obtained one after the other. You'll need to get them from another player.
---
As much as I'd love new, meaningful and substantial content if they rushed Wastelanders out and it was a shitshow this game would be dead and buried for good.
---
Yeah most of this sub dgaf which is why we are where we are ü§≠
---
Running through a nuke zone and picking up the raw flux from the various plants can generate a nice turnover. I ran through whitespring the other night and just vending the stuff back with hard bargin netted almost 600 caps and I didn't have green thumb equipped for that run.
---
Granted that method may seem wasteful to some, but I only use prime receivers on my UGL so I've no use right know for anything outside violet flux.
---
Community benefit from their mistakes? They‚Äôd rather jump off a bridge lol
---
I want skins for the handmade. They seem to be the only one that doesnt have a skin!
---
Why would they ban the only playerbase they have left?
---
THIS GAME NEEDS A FISHING!!!!!!
---
it just works
---
They can't or rather won't!
---
I keep mine unplugged because i have a now electricity CAMP. Figure its an interesting find for those that stumble upon me.
---
This exactly.
---
Can I join in too? It's unlimited scrap, not junk.
---
I think I earned 3 or 4 challenge badges last spring when it released along with getting 4 or so from the dailies....just enough to get a high capacity plan. Then I quit doing them. Recently I started on another run to get the armored pack plan and I have had a bunch of fun knocking these out. 
---
I recently traded 5 badges for one of my dream guns and still I'm sitting on 11 total with two more to go.  I still do the 2 dailies and campfire tales when it's active for a chance at more badges!! 
---
One plus is that they are all do able. Last spring a bunch were bugged. The only bullshit part is the plasma grenade plans......
---
Btw I knocked out all the tadpole badges too!! üëçüëç
---
I fear Wastelanders, even after all this wait and delay, will arrive in the shape of a bugstorm and everyone will go crazy anyways, so... 
---
I just hope it doesn't kill the game.
---
Straight jackets in fort defiance go for 45 a piece (you get a lot of them if you search every room) and if you loot the bodies inside you will get close to 1400.
---
I believe a bigger camp budget might come to fallout 1st, so try and be patient.
---
so it's not their fault that they are faultly showing an event to run longer than it actually does?
---
Might copy this, but with wooden railings and a flag
---
I want something for the ceilings. Right now the wallpaper looks weird with just a wooden ceiling.
---
This "dlc" is basically the rebirth of fallout 76. And the delay shows they're aware of this and have learnt from their past mistakes of releasing things too early.
---
I'm more than happy to wait for what could essentially be a fallout 5 of sorts if done right.
---
Uranium Fever collect, cook and sell with the right perks. I get close to 1000 doing that.
---
Wood armor is best in slot for sneak builds
---
*With effective Charisma of 20. 
---
One of my characters has a base Charisma of 1, uses an Unyielding set for +15 Charisma, and Grape Mentats for +5 Charisma when selling. 
---
When buying, add in a Beer for +1 and a Sweet Roll for +3 to get to 25 for buying. 
---
Hard Bargain is another option, but not required.
---
Scrap, junk, potayto, potahto
---
Go to Harper's Ferry and if Super Mutants or Scorched spawn, kill them efficiently, take their weapons, and sell them back to the nearby Vendor Bot.  You can easily get halfway there on each go.
---
True,
---
But this is how the game industries is, the people raining shit on the game right now will also rain shit on it after Wastlanders is released, whatever stat it's in..
---
Some of this shit raining is probably coming from people with interest in other gaming company's, and a lot is coming from children that shouldn't even be playing this game ( ohh.. downvoters, here they come, lol )
---
Good God. Go sctually test it then.
---
Bigger camp budget, some new weapons and maybe some new perks.
---
Maybe some new daily quests as the other ones are very tiresome now.
---
The Pipe Revolver does.
---
On my pistol character, the Bloodied Pipe Revolver is an absolute beast.  That thing hits for close to 2,000 in stealth, when combined with things like Adrenaline and Mister Sandman.  I'm not even taking advantage of the "bug" where it benefits from rifle perks too.
---
They already have a program. You report a bug, and Bethesda puts a bounty on your head.
---
Bethesda already solved the problem - it's Fallout 1st ;)))
---
Doesn't work for me either. The SB was really close to the fissure site.
---
Bethesda "Done we fixed"
---
Players "Still doesn't work"
---
Bethesda "We added it so if you buy it twice you can now apply it to ultracite weapons"
---
Fans "We will take 7"
---
Well they should really make it so that everyone in the event is getting loot from all the enemies. They already clump everyone in the event into one group (which is fine, I like that the default for this is co-operation). So why not have every killed enemy count for every player? 
---
Would turn down the frustration of trying to find that damn Legendary only to see that someone has already one-shot-roflstomped it into bloody kibbles...
---
Some people have fun being selfish, like in real life. Most of the time, people tag, emote and step aside. I have made good player friends because if you know how to behave during UF, that means you are going to be a.gentleman.
---
I'd rather see rare, God tier stuff drop more often, and stuff like the rare asylum uniforms spawn more often as well. This shit is really hard to get, and it doesn't help that the people who have the stuff are either hoarding it, or want crazy amounts of whatever for it
---
They had a skin in the first raider power armor bundle, the scabber bundle I believe.
---
This is really cool. The creativity of this community is epic.
---
Anytime you see serums for 300 or under buy them all. Its guaranteed caps.
---
I launch one at level 23 with the help of a high level.
---
I just started playing late October on PS4. I'm Lvl 54 and currently really enjoy the game. Guess I lucked out by not getting it at launch and that's not sarcasm. A lot of the negative comments are usually from players who have been "through the fire" and been playing for a long time or played at launch.
---
You were correcting someone else... and got it wrong yourself. HaHa. Woop.
---
ye, only fans here, I'm sad, why would someone protec bethesda for things like this?
---
More often then not, I get a ‚Äúcome here‚Äù emote from other players who find the legendary first.
---
My issues is the folks that kill all the regular MM thinking no one wants their loot.
---
You can easily make your cap limit on that event alone with regular enemy loots. Not to mention the loads of scrap if you want that as well....
---
That's correct, I always have it applied
---
You can spot them before the event begins: crouching with their unstoppable monster ready, or testing their explosive Gatling guns on random objects.
---
A big fucking hole coming right up
---
Just bug fixes. This is a decent amount of time to stabilize the game, even if the player count drops. Wastelanders will bring back anyone afterwards who stopped playing in the meantime (probably many more as well).
---
Great video man,  BUT,...... HEEEELLLLLL NO! If that‚Äôs the easiest raid, then I‚Äôm most definitely never gonna touch it! Top work though!
---
This. I get 500c per on my main. I share hard bargain 3 and my alt gets 440c. My GF also does the same and I make serums to sell for friends. Even at 17,500 for a serum recipe it‚Äôs a great investment.
---
I have rained my fair share of shit down on 76, when it's been deserved. Writing off valid criticism doesn't help the future of the game. That said I firmly believe Wastelanders is Bethesdas last chance to make it right. If they fuck it up the games as good as dead.
---
This is the order of rarity, from lowest to highest:  
---
white &gt; brown &gt; green &gt; blue &gt; pink &gt; yellow &gt; forest &gt; red
---
was it ever higher than 500?  
---
I've come back from nearly a year long break and I'm sure I managed to get closer to 700 caps while using all unyielding armor and a tiny amount of health to boost charisma before, could be wrong though..
---
I usually send team invites. We can share the loot.
---
there'd be a lot to consider here, like the map will always look different depending on which server you load into, or that the whole map on some servers will be nuked
---
A shitload of water purifiers if you dont care about your camp.
---
Microsoft thesaurus didn't cut it this time, lol.
---
Wait are you literally saying that you haven't touched the game in a year and read 1 patch note and think that is all that was added to the game?
---
True, if I don‚Äôt make the limit from the two serums I stock up on then I‚Äôll sell the junk like you said
---
The game doesn't need to be great. It just needs a sizeable player base. I imagine the amount of players it had a month or two after launch would be enough, and I'm sure Wastelanders will do at least that for a time.
---
I'm having this same issue, but I think they are aware of it. The community manager responded to a user a couple days after the Adventure Mode event ended. I hope it gets fixed soon too, because that loot bag is just so fitting for gifting people.
---
Try the stalker outfit
---
Glowing meat alone?
---
I used to sell Marine Wetsuit Masks back before I started getting into player vendor trading, basically made 35-40 a day and sold them all every single day.
---
Problem is the rubber runs but besides that it was my main income of 1400 caps a day, soon built up!
---
Usually now a days people saying about serums isn't too far off, problem is most require stable flux and to even get the plan in the first place which is about...10-20k? I forgot what exactly it was haha but yeah.
---
...sometimes I wish the plans would still drop from the queen despite owning all the prime stuff üò´
---
Have you played Nuclear Winter?  
---
When you die you get to observe the game and follow a randomly assigned player, if you stay in until the end you get some good "Windshield time" and footage.  
---
Spend 5 minutes using a little common sense and Google.  
---
Hell if you google the following phrase you'll find **SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED** video results along.  
---
"nuclear winter hacker"
---
Covert Operative?  That's for guns.  I've never heard of it applying to the Power Fist.
---
If you're talking about Ninja, then I don't know.  I typically keep my Meat Hook for SBQ battles and use my Mole Miner Gauntlet everywhere else.  Against the SBQ, the Meat Hook is certainly getting the expected 3.0x sneak damage bonus from Rank 3 Ninja.
---
I would say that there seems to be a quirk with the sneak damage message where it will sometimes report odd numbers.  Like, normally, I'll have a 2.5x bonus with my Pipe Revolver and Rank 3 Covert Operative, but every now and then, it will become 3.13x.  I assumed it was the effect of Mister Sandman or possibly Adrenaline.
---
no I read them all.
---
I'm thinking Bethesda believes if they ban the gamer for whatever reason, that the gamer will make a new account and repurchase this broken down game because the gamer just Loves Fallout 76 so much they can't live without it!
---
Give me a break!
---
But, I'm really beginning to understand their twisted thinking!  They're freak'in Nuts!
---
OMG!  My head!  I don't want to think like them!
---
I mean they added a lot more than that (brewing, player vending, sheepsquatch questline, pioneer scouts/backpacks)... but whatever
---
I'm with you on this. They need to nail it. I expect pretty much a new game. 
---
Anything less than a Reaper of Souls style expansion will pretty much make me leave.
---
At level 173, there is nothing for me to do other than NW. I don't even update my vendor anymore. 
---
We need an end game. New, more powerful items to hunt, more enemies, and new story content, with side quests that lasts at least 20 hours combined. 
---
I hate to say this, but I would rather they delay it again and deliver a solid product.
---
No word yet, but I know it was acknowledged by the community manager a few days ago to another user. She had asked what console he was on, and we essentially said that every console is affected. Hopefully resolved soon.
---
Last night some guy killed all three supervisors with a legacy gatling laser before almost anyone else was able to tag, then came on mic and asked everyone to give him any dog food they found.  Over level 200 too.  And he got pissed when nobody gave him any.
---
 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
That‚Äôs pretty wishful thinking man, as much as I‚Äôd like to believe that myself this game needs more than just bugs fixes right now to keep player retention. I mean just look at yesterday‚Äôs maintenance, 3 hours for two fixes which don‚Äôt affect the game is quite frankly ridiculous. I understand that they delayed more of the fixes due to an error but the amount they were planning to fix is way too small compared to the amount of issue the game has.
---
What are they hiding?  Top secret files on aliens, the real 9/11 report on who did it, and the return date of Jesus.
---
Discovery of any of that information would be a diasaster.  Please understand why they can't let that info get out.  It would literally mean the end of the world.
---
They won't but should. People say animations don't go well with online multiplayer but you can get killed while you are cooking in/out, sitting, sleeping, crafting, reloading, etc.
---
Oh jeez, that‚Äôs gross
---
That isn't what your word choice would indicate
---
Lol people still play this?
---
I always figured that, at some point, they could apply the Nuclear Winter scorched effect to Adventure Mode nukes.  It's not true damage, but it does make everything look a little more destroyed.
---
It definitely is. Dead in the water is super easy. Even soloing on standard isn't really a problem once you know what you're doing. It's much easier than the others to solo.
---
Weapons, glowing meat, junk. Glowing blood and other aid items.
---
It seems there are 2 types of technical data: active and inactive.
---
If a player drops technical data to be picked up by another player - you will get the quest.
---
The inactive ones trash/sale.  In my inventory, they listed as separate items but look identical.
---
can confirm this, shiny golden color with skull on it if given a big clip
---
You don't realise how hard that would be to make, they would have to make an entire new map basically
---
And I've invested HUNDREDS of hours into it, worked with countless people who have given up on '76 because of how slow the progress is on Bethesda's side fixing the easy "low hanging fruit" let alone the critical issues.      
---
&gt; Inexperienced devs. That's not an insult, that's a fact. Bethesda Austin  doesn't have a single game to it's name prior to 76. And as it seems -  they haven't heard about "Do not commit to master".   
---
Won't claim to know either way, but if they pushed the updates and fixes into Sub-Plugins, which is easy to do, they could compile them quarterly into a known good base ESM and save allot of headaches.   
---
&gt; Archaic mess of an engine that is Gamebryo, which never should've been used for a multiplayer game.   
---
It is outdated but does have some nice features, like it's flexibility.  
---
Worth noting it originally had a Multi-Player feature that was stripped out when Bethesda originally acquired it, if memory serves.  
---
Ironic eh?   
---
&gt; Last, but not least - subpar customer service department, that's not  only unprofessional, but seemingly exists as a completely separate  entity, that is unaware of anything that happens with the game at all.     
---
The problem is the erratic nature of CS....

You must be the bestest gamer ever if you were able to formulate that masterful opinion of the state of a game just by reading patch notes.
---
If I see someone trying to 1 shot I just follow them and one shot everything around them before they can. Some people only learn from having it done to them. On a good run with everyone calm and cooperative I use emotes to signal legendary enemies.
---
survival tent
---
I sometimes do a run of random encounters. Some are fun.  Seems there are more merchants spawning now.
---
Might be too late for that, considering the player Die-Off's we've been seeing, I would love to be wrong, but this situation has killed the commitment of allot of the hard core people on our side.
---
lol
---
Don't you love the reload animation on it too? Probably my favorite of all weapons.
---
Happy to help where I can!
---
I was able to complete this this morning without issue, probably just need to be closer to the fissure.
---
They are Christmas lights from what I believe.
---
Long time indeed my friend. Haven't been in in ages. Captain Cosmos?
---
It's just the Bethesda employees downvoting the comments and occasionally throwing out a strange comment in a futile effort at damage control.
---
And Bethesda wonders why so many fans have left them and won't be back!
---
This is unsustainable, something's gotta give and it won't be the gamers!
---
These really are eyesore camps but I can see how it wouldn‚Äôt take long to get ‚Äúrich‚Äù
---
Why not a Christmas hide and seek public event that appears in set places on the map but has many random spawns for what you‚Äôre looking for within the vicinity of those locations, like a Santa Gnome which could then be unlocked as a CAMP decoration, with many more alternatives like a Christmas themed reskinning of the Fallout 3 merc outfits, new weapons/weapon skins. Hell maybe even an instanced ‚Äúplayer home‚Äù sort of location
---
lol no never heard of that. i would try to scrap them both and build them again
---
I haven‚Äôt found the tactical marine mask plan yet (despite countless hours server hopping on Xbox) but I do craft a lot of Halloween Skull Masks after killing and looting everything from Grafton Steel. The weapons I get from super mutants I sell on to vendors alongside my skull masks with the hard bargain perk. 
---
When I‚Äôm out exploring areas I do kill everything and loot every weapon  I find to sell on, I usually get the 1400 daily cap limit doing that selling weapons and Chems etc. 
---
Reading this post I‚Äôve just discovered that grape mentats increase charisma to improve my selling price, I never knew that I always sold them!
---
The level of anger at times is disturbing. It‚Äôs a video game. I know that might be trite, but it is just a video game.
---
I thought ME3 was a disaster far beyond the ending controversy. The level designs, the story, the quest hub/structure, writing, etc. all just a complete mess. I played it through and tossed it away, not doing the alternate playthroughs like previous entries. It even had some early loot box mechanics in the multiplayer. I just walked away and nothing from BioWare has been compelling enough to buy since. Nothing lasts forever.
---
The idea of sitting there and going on and on and on about it with virulent hate posts just seems like madness to me. Temper tantrums.
---
Something is currantly \[REDACTED\] up at Bethesda, at least in Austin. It‚Äôll fix itself or it won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs direct effect on my life is not even measurable.
---
What's the bug?
---
Yes but it was such a weird experience.
---
Is this still possible? I tried not too long ago and couldn‚Äôt get it to work
---
I wish I could use razorgrain flour for something like bread. Maybe have some more complex recipies for food to preserve it.
---
you do the resurrection animation but the person does not get revived so you have to do it again
---
If it is for sale, I buy. If it is in a machine, it is for sale. Don't put things for sale and then complain you have too much money.
---
Some things dont seem to work in the custom.ini and have to go directly into the prefs.ini and vise versa. I played around with viewing distances (it works but only if you hate your pc and yourself) and changing pipboy, quickboy and pa colors. Its awful and requires alot of testing to know what works in which config.
---
On xbox here and never have issues when I drop a nuke. Always 8+ show up.
---
&gt;The problem is the erratic nature of CS....

\- Have a problem making an Atom shop purchase?

Solution in 7 seconds.
---
&gt;It is outdated but does have some nice features, like it's flexibility.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Worth noting it originally had a Multi-Player feature that was stripped out when Bethesda originally acquired it, if memory serves.
---
Still, I can't understand why they didn't take the modified Hero engine from ZOS, since it's already quite polished for MMO use.
---
Creation engine needs to be buried at an undisclosed location at this point.
---
As far as I know, this is essentially correct. The water output was determined to be somewhere between 60 and 80 per hour per CAMP, I think - I'm fairly certain it was more than what an industrial water purifier can produce (60/h) , but not much more.
---
But given that the performance of the water purifiers in my two characters' CAMPs varies rather a lot, I am not sure how reliable this actually is.
---
Bots, I think Bethesda is using Bots to make it look like there's people playing the bug-, I mean game.
---
Marine wetsuit helmets are chess p to make and sell decently.
---
This entire game was a mistake. You're not even equipped to manage an online community, yet you made an MMO. And now the repercussions are chipping away at your reputation day by day.
---
&gt; My issues is the folks that kill all the regular MM thinking no one wants their loot.
---
&gt; 
---
I would never expect someone to tag regular MMs.  Those to me are a free for all
---
The Legendary enemies are another story...tag and let it go
---
Thanks for your effort but raids are way too boring.
---
Is there a way to know which raid is running on a given week, other that starting it and finding out?
---
True, i see stuff like this way too much.
---
Right i always feel bad for the people who get vegitarian mutation because of the lack of variety. You end up eating a lot of one thing. As a carnivor therea plenty of meat to be got and cooked.
---
It's called blinders!
---
They only see what they want to see!  That's apart from the Bethesda employees chiming in to implement damage control!
---
Beware the Bethesda defense force!
---
Not only that would require effort but it would also require more powerfull servers, meaning they would have to make the microtransactions even worse in order to be able to afford the costs for this. Which is sad really.
---
Well ultracite weapons are different weapons so it‚Äôs best to keep that in mind
---
My lil soapbox: 
---
The offerings and the prices on more then average suck. 
---
I get they are busy /overwhelmed but the optics of the situation make it seem that they don‚Äôt care based on how they continue to squirrel all that *could* satiate people.  
---
They‚Äôve vaulted and priced themselves into a corner and it‚Äôs getting really tiring. 
---
Also please stop with the icons. It‚Äôs even more tiring and the hand is showing. 
---
No one needs yet another icon from the F4 C.H.A.T app. I would rather a hundred slightly dissimilar modern art statues then another icon of a cow or a gun. 
---
Until we can spray paint icons on westek they mean nothing regardless of the price you assign to them.
---
You think the framerate and servers could handle that in a full server on console?
---
Uranium fever event, I run to the legendary supervisors and lever rifle bash (weak) them once or twice. The glowing meat steaks and loot are nice too.
---
Definitely a rebalance of the Vault raids
---
Leaving a comment to track this awesome advice.

&gt; Spend 5 minutes using a little common sense and Google.
---
The joke  -------&gt;
---
Your head
---
The vault 96 raids, christmas event, release of the race for the presidency event (a cut enclave event with a possum badge-esque reward system. Save up presidential seals for a unique outfit, gauss rifle, set of PA, and more!), new NW map and more NW limited time loot.
---
Im sure you will love it once it deletes all of your stuff because of a bug with the instance technologie...
---
Future pay to win microtransactions?
---
The real reason people defend Bethesda despite the fact they are being lied to by Bethesda.
---
It's cheaper to have the server spit out a list of names (or however it's done) and wholesale ban anyone on the list than it is to spend man hours actually looking at each individual situation and making a (human) judgement call.
---
I can't comment on the specific person you're talking about, but it's likely that he/she met some threshold of activity (whether it's 10 individual actions on the server, or just the act of having a cheat program open, there's no way to know).  Once the threshold is hit, the name gets sent to a list, and from there it depends.  The easiest solution is to feed that list into the system for suspension.  At that point, someone probably reviews the list and the reason for the action, and just presses the ban button if the reason looks legit.
---
For someone to go through each individual report, review log files, and contact the person to see what excuse they want to use would take a lot of extra time (and I suspect that there are quite a few names on that list).
---
Test servers, even if initially pc only.
---
Oh ty but this was a while back now. I ended up getting a group together and [we now sell raid carries here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/dtpzhl/ps4_h_vault_94_raid_carries_w_15k_caps_total_for/) Hmm... you know what... I might could put some of these people in touch with you. Some of them are willing and able to be in a raid group of their own. I'm going to friend you and see what I can do for you.
---
Honestly, if even Bethesda thinks, it's not ready for release, it surely is a buggy mess of a fuck up.
---
Although i've been playing since BETA, there is no way i would see myself playing for another 5 months with no content being added.
---
No hood
---
Well they still have another Vault to open... personally I would like to have it open as part of a winter event since that vault will be linked to frozen animals...
---
Would also like to see a winter event and the leaked mail boxes as a new feature for Xmas...
---
I dunno about you, but the one thing I want to return is the power armor filter
---
Sure, our character can"t speak, but at the grunts should be filtered
---
We need eggnog
---
What‚Äôre some good perks for the lever? I‚Äôm trying out a quad vats crit +1 agility version
---
I don't think I understand what you are questioning.
---
 The OP was asking for alternative ways to help reach the 1400 caps per day.
---
During my playing sessions I go to my camp and collect the purified water from my collector's (I only have 2) and vendor it at the train stations. I never make the 1400 caps per day only out of it, I also craft the marine helmet but the purified water helps.
---
Just so you know for future use. That‚Äôs still a 3rd party tool. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you yourself made it.
---
Checkpoints... thats all I ask...
---
Best way imho to get what you want *(because I used to do this constantly)*
---
-	explorer or scavenger outfit
---
-	green hood
---
-	PD mask
---
Explorers has no backpack and an always-down fur lined hood that jiggles. 
---
Surveyors allows for a backpack and has now good.
---
Me too... I loggin for my friends and do the daily challenges.
---
Just saying that (according to my understanding) even if you have loooads of purifiers, you won't necessarily get water any more than anyone else, meaning it's not really a viable source, but as you've said now it just *contributes* and isn't the only thing you rely on
---
Run west tek one....
---
The public event "fix" was one of the worst changes made to the game.
---
Bethesda Austin was known as Battle Cry Studios and has only worked on one game (BattleCry) before that, which never came out. 
---
but yeah, they are very new and very inexperienced. they were thrown into the deep end when they were just learning how to walk
---
I believe they ordered two
---
Not a totally bad indicator tbh
---
There‚Äôs a set difference of one word addition. If the challenge says to take a photo, use the photo mode. If it says to take a camera picture, use the camera
---
The dailies and weapons are a good idea, if they aren‚Äôt going to give us Wastelanders now at least let us play around with the bow while we wait.
---
They still get destroyed. Mine did....
---
Test servers would be a godsend
---
Who knows honestly but there seems like a  slight difference between last week and this one. 
---
I‚Äôve been getting 2* and 1* out the ying-yang from 3* mobs but the 3s seem lower then before - perhaps the servers I‚Äôm on just suck that hard
---
They did, but they came backnI have seen them in several vendors.
---
They do. For sure. 
---
My CAMP is right on the border of the most common Whitespring drop location. Half the thing is destroyed every time if I'm not watching out
---
Hey, I just got a message from ya but reddit deleted it when I went to read it, what did ya say? apologizes
---
As someone looking to maybe play this again, this is really helpful. Any leveling advice?
---
Fishing
---
I also doubt that public test servers would change anything given how slow Bethesda is at implementing fixes. Without any change to the frequency and quality of releases they make, public test servers will just be the same old shit we see now with extra steps.
---
Scroll down. Still there for me, but on different reply.
---
There is no screaming.  Maybe it's coming from inside your house?
---
if you aren't already, try using the contractor perk.
---
My camp budget was full, and compared to lots of other camps I have seen, rather spartan.
---
Had to scrap an item to place an item.  Finally decide to rebuild from (close to) scratch.
---
Deleted the few items I had stored, scrapped everything except a fusion generator, 2 heavy MG turrets and a couple of small items a teammate placed for me.
---
I equipped the contractor perk.  I am in the same location.
---
Building is about the same size, but now I have walls and a roof, 4-5 more display cases, and still have some budget left.
---
Look at the weekly rewards. There's usually one for completing Vault 94 raids and it will say which mission is currently going on that week.
---

I‚Äôm a massive POTC fan so I enjoy all forms of ship builds! Cheers Matey! ...oh, you should also take a gander at my own creation... welcome, to the the Black Pearl https://imgur.com/gallery/gRIPmjA
---
Probably right, but sadly there are too many people who think just because you love a game u have to accept every shitty practice related to it.
---
Yup, but they use all sorts of stuff from their old games. Scorchbeasts _are_ dragons from Skyrim just with a new model placed on them. Chameleon absolutely is the same as stealth boys, that effect dates back to Morrowind. People have made lengthy YouTube videos to argue that Fallout and the Elder Scrolls are the same universe because of all the similarities.
---
Realistically it's just dev teams reusing stuff to save time and it rarely harms the experience much. Of course, I can't think of anything more boring in Skyrim than the actual dragons (just. land. already.), but they kept that too.
---
It‚Äôs not stealing if you don‚Äôt lock things down. 
---
I have a number of things at my camp open to anyone that wants to use or take so have at it.  I view it as a cost of doing business. 
---
I have an unwritten rule though that I don‚Äôt take water unless I buy something from said player vendor.
---
He didn't report the exploit himself was the issue, I thought. He mentioned he went to bed after doing it several times, then the next day found people talking about the exploit he was testing, and decided not to report it because someone else in the group already had. Pretty sure that was the mistake
---
The joke was the person in quotes is stealing his own stuff
---
Not gonna happen. This game won't get anything besides Atom Shop items until Wastelanders.
---
Case in point. Fixer plans.
---
The more players that know the plan means more legendary fixers to buy. Simple. Easy to follow logic. So sell those plans cheap.
---
This would be nice AFTER they finish the game
---
That‚Äôs very cool. You on PC?
---
* Increased camp budget, because I really want to use my giant Slocum Joe's neon sign, but can't justify deleting 55 objects to place it.
---
* For them to fix Damage Resistance while reloading, so the main modifier on a weapon isn't broken. RIP my vampire explosive weapons with it.
---
* Snow covered wasteland for the winter time.
---
* New weapon modifiers like ice or electrical damage.
---
* A quest... or a few mini quests with some neat cosmetic rewards or camp items.
---
* Quick switch presets for perk cards. I can't be bothered hacking a level 3 door, safe or computer... too lazy switching cards around, therefore I just move on. Maybe even make those passive effects instead of perk cards.
---
Given what I have seen here over the last 10 months, I suspect people will go crazy either way....
---
The motivation is making whatever playerbase remains believe they are acting on behalf of the community so people don't abandon the game and stop spending money. 
---
As long as people still think Bethesda is acting in their best interest people like you will keep defending them.
---
Yeah, I don't believe you.
---
They'll have to add respec for perks with the legendary perks coming. Well, you would think anyway.
---
As I just mentioned in my other comment, the incentive is not losing anymore players. They are most certainly profiting off people kept on the hook and still spending money.
---
Red One checking in.
---
A little like in Call Of Duty Ghosts? I think that would be awesome aslong as if a camp gets hit you don't need to repair it.
---
Thank you for explaining what I thought was obvious but in fact wasn't! Next time I'll make /s at the end.

The guy cheated and got banned. Was he 100% a "white hat" hacker who never did anything for his own profit? Possible. It's also possible he just made that up to cover his use fo exploits. We only have one side of the story. BGS had no motiviation to screw this guy over though - he was a paying customer with multiple accounts. A "whale" if you will. I can't see them cutting off a whale without good reason.
---
Agreed, I was just hoping maybe we can wake a few more people up and get them to see reality. Bethesda has been caught lying so many times recently - it's so absurd that people believe them and are literally claiming "but they have no incentive to lie now, they can't profit off this!"
---
So you admit they'll lie the next opportunity they see to make a buck? As if that's any better. 
---
I just don't understand people.
---
Right. Whatever my charisma is with hard bargain 3 serums equals 1350 caps from the vender. The last 50 is usually grenades and chems. Easy Peasy.
---
I would have opened up on his selfish ass with some nuka grenades and my trusty auto AAE handmade.
---
What happens if you nuke the entrance to 76 while someone a new character/player is still mucking about inside?
---
Do they just die upon leaving the vault?
---
Cause it's fun to play.
---
I am on PC. No signs that they are recycled. When I booted up mine to start leveling a new character, it was 100% pristine - nothing had been touched. Only time I've seen so much junk laying around in Flatwoods was when I played at launch and was the first one to get there.
---
Never thought of using Unyielding buffs for that. Nice.
---
I sell enough in my camp over time that I stopped caring about the vendor cap.  I will only offload things to vendors when I've accumulated too much stuff that won't sell in the machines (like excess purified water).
---
What mostly sells for me are relatively useful weapons, some cosmetics, stimpacks, and the occasional unusual recipe (which varies a lot).  Flux would also sell well, and ammo possibly (I sell neither of those usually).  If you have a decent collection of event items (fasnacht masks and plans, meat week stuff, etc.), that can be a good source of income, but most of my money comes from weapons.
---
The trick, of course, is knowing what weapons people will buy, and a reasonable but worthwhile price.  And also farming those weapons of course.  Searching out legendary mobs and managing your scrip are about the only activities needed for this part, and make up most of my gameplay.  That takes some understanding of the various meta builds (though not a lot), and an understanding of what items could be wanted.  I don't think I've ever tried to sell a berserkers or nocturnal weapon, for instance.  There's almost no point.
---
The rest of your drops go to scrip, or you can sell some weapons for cheap scrip fodder in your machines if you're running low on cash (though I don't do that much).
---
I make enough that I can afford to buy most of my ammo, unless a lot of SBQ fights pop up in a short period.  I frequently cap, burn down to about 10-15K caps buying ammo, and then capping again in a day or so.  I have to shut the machines off fairly regularly to stop going over the cap.
---
Clear West Tek or do Uranium Fever if you don't have a serum recipe, loot everything. Tons of weapons to sell, lots of scrap, etc.
---
MMOG Fails states that..
---
- DLC is pretty much playable now but they decided to not rushed and releases while they playing it now to catch bugs
---
 - this update May pushed back again ( another delay) 
---
- it‚Äôs spoused to come out in February 2020 but because they have very-well funded they could release it earlier than February
---
I wonder if you got that from me lol. I sold one out of my vender and im kind if regretting it now. If they get some mods the crossbow will be awesome.
---
Because of currency value, I would think. I‚Äôd have to check the euro/USD exchange rate to be sure.
---
Thanks for the details, I really appreciate it :)
---
ta :)
---
Agreed. He definitely should have, and after reading through the thread.. Apparently it seems even that the one that did report it was banned, which came from map guy. As said, he made a mistake and has a record that is known by Bethesda that he is part of said group. That he deserved some form of warning I'd definitely agree with, a ban, however, given the variables and history, is the wrong way of handling it. The fact he did it multiple times in that very specific time frame shouldn't matter, as that is literally what QA and testing means, even if Bethesda doesn't understand these very concepts. It's normal for these things to be extensively tested before a detailed report, not because he made a map, because he actually did the testing and presumably can pinpoint the way to reproduce it, maybe even tell them exactly what's wrong with what code. It's a matter of "Do you think someone that actively works with Bethesda as a volunteer to help fix and improve the game, with a proven record and history deserves to be punished for that very thing." Either answer is defensible, neither is wrong. However these things set dangerous precedent for anyone creating tools or anyone helping Bethesda hunt down exploits to try and help get it fixed.
---
It's a bugger :(
---
Facts.
---
Euro has more value than Dollar, the pric should be lower for us.
---
1:1.10, so yeah, because of the currency value.
---
Maybe all our accounts , passwords, credit card are hidden in the gamefiles :0
---
In my headcanon I‚Äôve always operated under the premise that the nukes we launch are slightly different than normal neutron bombs but are indeed neutron bombs instead of the usual fission bombs. Neutron bombs are used for conquest not defense or deterrence. They release less destructive power and are optimized to release much more neutron radiation - which is excellent at killing living creatures in many grotesque ways, but not great for destroying their stuff. With the story behind FO76 it fits pretty well. We wanted to kill the invaders but not necessarily destroy infrastructure and everything else. The invaders also wanted to invade and conquer, not destroy.
---
You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve got it backwards. Sorry, haven‚Äôt had my coffee yet. In that case, maybe regional server cost variation...?
---
Whitesprings on a private server is ideal. You don't even need 2 accounts anymore, since rejoining your private server within 5 minutes will keep the same server. Also, no competition. I have a route that I've used for ages. Takes me 8-10 minutes to full clear Whitesprings, which is just enough time for mobs to be eligible to respawn. Run route, scrap / store, exit, rejoin. Private nuked WS is a stable flux farmers dream.
---
Seeing as nuclear winter applies the effect everywhere *outside* a radius instead of inside, as well as having ~50 players instead of adventure's ~24
---
Yeah.
---
You get it wrong. With this price Bethesda make an extra profit because of the currency value. When we pay in Euro, Bethesda can change it with more Dollars.
---
Then I guess I need to start checking some vendors again then
---
I‚Äôve seen a mole rat open a door too.
---
be careful they might take your idea and charge you for the app to then charge you for atoms in the shop
---
Isn‚Äôt it in the safe zone that you can‚Äôt nuke
---
No one knows anyhing TFA. Not even Bethesda.
---
They‚Äôd go broke
---
You‚Äôre correct.
---
&gt;Euro has more value than Dollar, the pric should be lower for us.
---
Actually the Euro is lower than the Dollar - this morning it is at .91
---
Does a tax apply to things like that?  I know VAT is added to a lot of things, but honestly I have no idea what does and doesn't get taxed wherever you are.
---
This is what I do for the past 5 days. Somehow fell in love with the mode, because I don't have motivation to explore etc.
---
I thought you meant farming loot! lol, but yea, more crops to plant would be great, I'd want to be able to plant cranberries. And not just crops, but more options for planting beds, maybe hydroponics for increased yield, or "super" plants with increased benefits.
---
Imagine the amount of crashing the changing terrain would cause......
---
They've said that they're planning on adding it in the (near?) future.  What that translates to in RL terms is very hard to say.
---
I think you might be making the same mistake I did. Right now, 1 euro is worth 1.10 USD, making the euro more valuable.
---
This engine can't handle static building, one of its major features, properly and you're talking about dynamic environments.
---
Ive got a set of BOS shielded fatigues if you‚Äôre interested
---
I thought about that but i don't know a single game editors who makes this decision. The price is at least the same between euros and dollar...
---
I haven't nuked anything yet, only just finished *One of Us*.
---
I feel ya. Ive been playing since day 1 and ive never got a rare outfit drop. And the best asylum outfit I've found in the asylum is blue. Of course mr. "Ive found 9 sets of everything this week you just suck" guy will say its fine. It is not. Im in the asylum and doing events everyday. I know thats how rng works but they could tweak the numbers a bit. Ya know turn down limb damage and bashing and turn up fire rate maybe.
---
I don't think so.
---
I think it's bad luck.  I've been getting a ton of 3 stars lately
---
With Party Boy that beer is +3 Charisma üñí
---
I bought it way back when ever upwards dropped to do the crossbow challenge.  Bought it in a vending machine so it might have been you.
---
Usually the main difference is the eu price includes tax whereas the NA price doesn't.
---
It gets wishy washy when alot of places don't tax digital goods or subscription fees
---
Yup, exactly my point. 
---
I kinda pity the developers that started there. If they decide to switch jobs, having a only game that never saw light and 76 on the resume is, well, yeah..
---
Had that at my camp after 3 SBs attacked, I think I deleted some or all of the wires and re did them and it was sorted
---
How much budget space does your farm take up? I used to have numerous corn and razergrain though had to reduce the numbers in order to put other things in my camp.
---
Yeah, sat around and watched to see what would happen one day. Everything gets destroyed except the foundations.
---
They need to redo a lot of the simple things in this game to give more things to do for veteran players. The longevity on games like this revolve around players grinding for new stuff or meta stuff. It also revolves around players creating their own fun. Once the Wastelanders quests run out we will be in the same boat. These are some things I have been thinking about that expand on what we already have in the game.
---
\-Release new nuke bosses in each region.  They may need to add marked fissure sites for this.  Things like beefy Grafton monsters, fog crawlers, death claws, etc. Similar to the buffed varieties at Arktos.
---
\-Add more possum challenges.  They already have everything set up in game. We just need a new rank and new rewards.  Things like backpack plans that reduce gun weight, food, junk, etc would be pretty cool. Even if they don't add a new rank they could add a few new things to the machine that we can grind for.
---
\-Put some new cryptid hunts on the Lowe Taxidermy board. Just give us vague clues to it's whereabouts (no quest markers) and drop a named Snallygaster or something we can fight.  Heck they could add this feature to the queen of the hunt daily.
---
\-Add rewards for leveling up over 50.  Maybe a boost to stash space or camp budget (5pct more) for every 50 levels would be nice.  Also a machine similar to Borderlands that lets you respec for caps.
---
\-Add survival weapons and armor challenges to adventure mode.  I liked this aspect of survival and I would like to see it return to adventure.  Maybe each week release a new piece of armor in a matching set.  Or just create a few new named weapons.
---
\-Add drills, chainsaws, and other current non legendary weapons to the pool. This gives us more to work for.
---
\-Boost the drop rate for certain cosmetics and plans on less played events on a weekly basis.  Get us out grinding some of those forgotten ones. Heck they could sneak in a few new colors of asylum outfits or something into Fort Defiance.
---
\-Release some of the old atomic shop items that didn't sell very good as reward cosmetics for events.
---
\-Make some sort of glass display cooler that slows decay by 95 pct so we can sell food items.  While they are at it buff some of the more difficult food recipe's.  There is no reason to cook most of it when glowing meat steak is so good already.
---
\-More alcohol recipes.
---
\-Create a base for each faction in the game. Have a robot that can give out challenges similar to ever upwards or the enclave ones.  Let us earn commendations that we can use to purchase stuff just similar to ever upwards.  Things like camp cosmetics, weapon skins, armor skins, etc.  They could easily integrate wastelanders into this when it drops.
---
\-Redo the workshops to give us more materials and add a few machines and terminals to the various ones around the map that can give us more valuable stuff.  Things like springs, screws, gears, ballistic fiber, nuka products, etc. This would also encourage more organic pvp by making workshops valuable. 
---
\-New camp items like wall turrets, planter boxes, green house and log cabin walls. Ability to plant any of the harvest-able fruit and vegetables in the game. I would like to see pre-built houses and buildings that I can plop down and just decorate and fill with furniture. Add plans to create wall paint.
---
\-I would like to see all the legendary effects and perk cards looked at.  I love the synergy on bloodied stuff and I would like to see more builds that can work like that. This could be it's own thread but I want to have many of the crappy perks boosted and/or combined together to create viable cards.  Many of them are so underwhelming.  Combine things like woodchucker, butchers bounty, and green thumb on one card with multiple ranks that give something like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 pct more materials scavenged. Have strong back give you 5 pct more carry weight per rank on everything, this way you could combine all the carry weight cards into 1.  There are tons of cards that they could do this with.  I also would like to see legendary effects re-worked on many things.  Stuff like beserkers, mutants, enemy specific, nocturnal, etc.  
---
\-Ability to create card load outs. Why don't we have this yet?
---
\-Add a chance for legendary items in the treasure maps!  While they are at it they should add more treasure maps and locations.
---
\-Let us explore Vault 51 in adventure mode. I just want to read the lore. Maybe give us a couple little quests or something.
---
They haven't changed much.  Just alot more smooth and plenty of qol.
---
Generally speaking games don't change alot in a year especially with no paid dlc.
---
I came back because the game is very chill and relaxing.
---
Yea I can imagine! Fluxes are my nightmare anyway so I can see why a lot of people were annoyed they all disappeared. Gutting :(
---
After killing the Legendary Scorchbeast, it fell INTO the fissure site and I still didn't get the daily challenge. So no atom or legendary loot. :/
---
leveloution!
---
Honestly I just want the game to run smoothly
---
We're all very proud of you.
---
I can run Dead in the Water well... What time zone are you in? Im London time!
---
You need to look at this again, the U.S.dollar is worth $1.10 compared to one Euro.   Therefore the U.S. dollar is stronger than one Euro.
---
Come on. You can't seriously be suggesting fo76 is the same as other games out there.
---
The devs have been trash from inception.  Bgs austin has never made an online game before and they were handed the torch at the 11th hour to make it work.
---
That is not what the gaming industry shits on all the time.  Fo76 is an exception to the rule, not the rule
---
Oh, I've seen this one not too long ago (it's the red barn half-wall at the bow that sticks out in my memory). Definitely left the same impression; glad you shared it!
---
I can't tell for certain with the 3 minutes of googling I did, but it might be (most digital good are assessed a VAT).  The average is ~20%, so $13 * 1.2 = $15.6, which would be 14.17 Euro as of this morning.
---
The 20% could be higher (it often is), and the exchange rate obviously varies, so 14.99 doesn't seem out of line given the variables.
---
it never happens if you spend ¬Ω sec longer resurrecting, dont stop because the bar is full.
---
Should still be fixed though
---
Run Westek  and sell everything with hard bargain 3 and a beer or grape mentats pretty much hit the cap for me, I just sell off a few other things I gather along the way. I prefer to sell my serums in vendor and save the rest of the flux for ultracite ammo and shielded UA to vend.
---
I'm level 192...nope never launched one. I did get to the enter code bit...then the game crashed!
---
New photomode frames ? Free frames when you buy frames ? Free fallout frame fridays ?
---
Then you should be able to understand this if that is the case explaining how the anticheat works:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dtjrkd/bethesda_banning_data_miners_who_are_providing/f71kqnd/?context=3
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm on PS4. I‚Äôm actually a CAMP building consultant for the Wasteland Estates HOA &amp; we conduct live reviews on CAMP‚Äôs any builder‚Äôs looking to publicly show off!
---
I agree, I've put probably 2K hours in at this point. And you know what? I've never spent a dime besides initial purchase and getting 1 month of Fallout 1st to check it out. I'd say BGS probably lost money on me, what with server costs. They're probably glad I'm finally bored and gone.
---
This is my experience too. Any time you state it though some folks here downvote you to oblivion. I'll be in areas I've not been to in months and notice a PA frame not there. A lot of places missing their plan spawns and what not. I'm not sure if its recycled servers.its definitely something not the same as public.
---
They aren't the same model though...
---
On map76.com, he also says that the guy who DID report the exploit, was also permabanned.
---
Test servers
---
Thanks for this info, I'm trying to fit as much as I can into my new build, I use explosive weapons and 5 points into Demo Expert was REALLY cramping my style.
---
Lets just cut to the chase: How many cups of coffee do I need for this to make sense to me this morning?
---
? NW hackers get 72 hour bans, and map76 guy gets permed?
---
It's $17.99 in Canada where I'm at
---
Sometimes between now and intergalactic tourism.
---
You're correct, it's just about storage. It's nice for not having to go back to camp as often. I only visit my camp once every 3-5 hours sometimes, or less, so I have a ton of purifiers (10 I think) so that when I go there I can pick up 50 purified water, and it's always there if I need it for crafting. 
---
Placing purifiers down at a workshop is not gated like that, though I think it IS gated by the amount of "Water" you see when you hover over it. More water = higher possible production.
---
Has anyone tried collecting *all* the code pieces for each silo? I've always thought that simply picking up 3 individual code pieces was a bit easy for a weekly challenge and wondered if perhaps the challenge instructions are just really vague.  After all, the challenge does say 0/3 and there are 3 silos...
---
Taxes
---
damn you make this look easy, i still can't complete this, keep getting swarmed.. what is your claw?
---
This happened to me minus the legendaries when the game first released. I didn't know that things not marked stash box acted as the stash box. I was like this idiot put all his shit in a desk. Took me ten minutes to discover I was the idiot.
---
So this is why I have no problem offloading 5,000 rubber at a time to players. Nice.
---
It would save them so much more time in the long run, reducing alot of the whoopsies that come with each patch.
---
Was so let down when I found it the nukes didn't actually destroy anything.
---
I have played with 5 purifiers and with more than 10. The main difference is that 5 purifiers fill up faster. If you are someone who visits your camp about once an hour, you would need (60 per hour if I remember right) 12 purifiers to max out the potential. If you want to visit every 5 minutes, one purifier would max the potential. Either way you will only get 60 per hour.
---
If you play many hours a day you can drain the vendor of all his caps. If you can only play a few hours, another method should be better.
---
Wow! Why do you act so entitled to have access to something useful forever that you had been given access to FOR FREE?
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/buuyp8/how\_to\_max\_out\_your\_caps\_on\_an\_entire\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/buuyp8/how_to_max_out_your_caps_on_an_entire_account/) 
---
TL;DR - craft serums, use unyielding set at low HP to max charisma, use hard bargain, sell to vendor. The material cost to craft them is far lower than what vendors buy them for. It's honestly a little broken and I'm surprised it hasn't been nerfed yet. Other than duping, it's a big reason the economy is so inflated.
---
Should show your gear at the start so new players don't get mislead.
---
I'm not even new and that is not possible at all for me
---
And since crops already eat up a lot of camp budget, it would be self limiting. You'd either be able to have only a couple of each type, or a lot of a few types, so it's not like it would cause any balance issues. Especially since the re-grow rate is so slow. It would just solve a lot of inconvenience and grind in the game. And it creates a new incentive to seek out every plant in the game so you can take it home and plant it.
---
And let us raise chickens for eggs as someone else suggested not too long ago. And create some way of raising animals for meat. Have a rabbit pen or something and set a reproduction rate. Then you kill, cook, and eat.
---
Bethesda could fix this shit by rewarding all players in the event zone with legendary items upon legendary deaths or as part of the event reward. Relying on tagging an enemy when there are 20+ players capable of one shotting most enemies is poor game design imo.
---
Entitled is taking your ball and going home because you‚Äôre angry. Dude could have helped a lot of people, but no. He is selfish. It‚Äôs more important to take it down because he doesn‚Äôt like the game instead of helping thousands of people. It‚Äôs a bitch move.
---
I'm psn ResinYeti, I play evenings and weekends EST
---
Optimistic, but they might be able to meet that schedule ;-)
---
The forest and urban yes, I‚Äôm not sure if they can be applied to the vault raid armour though
---
Well they need more. They could share with the lever action. There has been some nice ones for that.
---
Report it on their website, tell them that a 1st member wasn't able to get the perk you're trying to share.  It will be patched in tomorrow.
---
Creation aka. GameBryo aka. NetImmerse was designed for MMOs...
---
Bethesda's use of it as a singleplayer engine is actually the outlier.
---
Lol you get downvoted, yet every one of these is true and there are still more
---
Well now that‚Äôs funny because it is true. 2 of my teammates are 1st membersüòÇ
---
Thats on purpose
---
Yep you can't nuke it

Imagine if Bethesda tried anything remotely interesting with 76
---
eastern standard time, its currently 10:06 am where I'm at

Can we start by making it so I can plant crops in the ground properly. Planting melons is damn near impossible even on flat ground.
---
They were from Valentine's Day, originally. From what I can tell anyway, I wasn't playing back then

Its easy to teach, you just have to prepare in advance and practice a set routine. If you need advice, I'll happily assist where I can
---
I dont Think I've ever made more than 500 granted I've only sold 4 of the different serums in the game so maybe one may be worth more
---
Have 1500 atoms?

"Man bethesda is just so fucking lazy, why dont they make a script that competly swaps out locations, even though that would require them making one the every single slightly different x y cordinate on the map, or make it so the nuke can only target specific locations"

---
Single player is the bread and butter of innovation. Every multiplayer game has watered down systems compared to a single player in that genre for the sake of balance, accounting for netcode and diversion of resources. Most of the "fun" comes from the multiplayer interaction. Shit, anyone still playing 10yo mmos will tell you theyre there for the social aspects more than the actual gameplay. 
---
I personally play mostly multiplayer games, but I'm also aware that: 
---
‚Ä¢no multiplayer game has melee combat as good as the DMC series, and they wont for a while 
---
‚Ä¢ no multiplayer rpg has a story, dialogue or level of elasticity that single player rpgs have
---
‚Ä¢PoE, DoS and other cRPGs are impossible multiplayer. Nobody even knows Dragon Age's multiplayer exist 
---
‚Ä¢a well known fact that Destiny is gutted for the sake of multiplayer balance. FO76's weapons and abilities have been gutten several times over for the sake of multiplayer, to the point where pvp has been minimized since launch because they just cant find the balance. 
---
Saying single players are a thing of the past and getting your panties in a knot over punctuation, jfc you have got to be a child
---
I kid (of course), but I don't recall having seen that bug mentioned anywhere, but I don't really run on teams so I tend to ignore those perks.

And, since magnetic personality seems to only affect you, and not your 1st buddies, you're out of luck :P

I saw the message appear elsewhere weird, but thats cool, you made a business helping people with the raids. If you run short on employees, I'll glady help out. Do you already have a map of the spawn codes for the 3rd raid? P.s, how did ya get that vault 94 tag next to your name?

Exactly. I can share the buff but it only for a minute then it unshares

&gt;Shortly before the release of *Fallout 4*, while Bethesda Game Studios began development of [*Starfield*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)) and downloadable content for *Fallout 4*, what is currently [Bethesda Game Studios Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin) (at the time BattleCry Studios) **was tasked with modifying the Creation Engine to support multiplayer content** in preparation for the development of [*Fallout 76*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76). 
---
What it was created for 2 decades ago is pretty much irrelevant, given previous modifications done by OG Bethesda.   
---
Yet again, Zenimax has a license for Hero engine, which already has several years of MMO polish in it (ESO).
---
Hmm! I'll have to check if it goes away. I just use it to buy mutation resippies
---
Filthy, Sneaky little Mole ratses. Wicked. Tricksy. False.
---
Running the vault, it does help for low cha level teammates
---
Thanks for pointing this out!
---
No need for a map. We took the time to learn it ourselves. If you look on the raid post you‚Äôll see a map, but it‚Äôs missing Alpha. The tag is flair. Do that on this subreddits home page on the right hand side I believe.
---
We will all have to work together to fill them!
---
I agree! I emote and run after I tag. It is a decent event that isn't hard to be cool about.
---
I saw a Chinese assault rifle skin for it datamined somewhere. Guess it's apart of a Chinese bundle or something coming up in the atomic shop.
---
Ah thanks for the reply, a friend of mine also confirmed that charisma caps at 15 for selling to npc vendors so 500 caps has always been the max selling price.  
---
Maybe the old 200 cap daily limit per faction is what confused me lol
---
Shouldn't have had so many donuts on free donut friday during your time in the vault fatty.
---
They drop tin if you don't tag Mm
---
I too was sad i couldn't have a halloween painted Fixer
---
I like the bit where my character tries to send a spell instead of doing an emote.
---
It would be great if the yellow hooded robes from Fallout 4 that are in the game worked like an outfit and went over your armor.
---
So, to piggyback off this thread, here's another question -
---
Let's say you clear out your 1,400 caps for the day, but you find something great at a player vendor and you're 500 caps short.  Time is of the essence.  How can you make 500 caps quickly if you've exhausted the vendors?
---
The closest thing I can think of are Public Events and Events in general, although some barely cover the Fast Travel expense of traveling to them.  You could probably make some Caps if you knew where the various Cap stashes were.
---
Did someone say penetration?
---
Nuking SBQ and flexing my huge damage / nearly invulnerable character on a public server is about the only thing I still enjoy with this game. Need more content that is challenging but not tedious. Vaults are just tedious. Tacking down 50 freaking cards is not fun, it's a time sink.
---
There's the Green Hood as mentioned previously, however it will make you bald.
---
That was actually pretty funny lol. " buy fallout first and win ten nw matches in a row".
---
Other than the fact said players are incredibly reputable and have done a few things in the past to help Bethesda. If evidence comes up that despite reporting the glitch they kept using it then banning them permanently still is far too much of a punishment. A temp suspension like all these actual hackers and cheaters are getting is what he shouldve gotten. 
---
If u want proof of Bethesda blundering time after time with bans then take to Twitter, not a day goes by I dont see people asking why they got banned. I mean for fucks sake their bug squashing team is so fucking bad that they ASKED people how they got into dev rooms after banning them. These arnt the bugs people should get banned for. These are things Bethesda should say "yeah this is our bad" and just delete all ill gotten goods and just go on with the game. Bethesda swings the ban hammer like China throws cops at citizens. Irresponsible company
---
Agree with you but also don't, they really have to knock out all the bugs they can before they get roasted online
---
time to nudge it back a little.
---
Red Five, standing by.
---
Please dont call it a potty as an adult.
---
This is an interesting tip. I'll give a try, thanks.
---
Can we VPN to a cheaper market and buy the service there? It's not like they're giving a different service from market to market.
---
well, you chose a console. you can'[t expect usable frame rates, now can you? ;)
---
A sweet. I have a question, for the second raid where do yall typically go to first, agriculture or engineering wing? I've run into different groups in the past who do different things so I'm just trying to get an idea on yall's play-style.
---
Hi yes stupid question, may I ask what is  the "Double" prefix effect?
---
Thank you for your time.
---
excellent :)
---
Really...my first post and the potty police are here? Get over it.
---
As it says above $12.99 = ‚Ç¨11.80. You are wrong!!
---
Yes they destroy camps I‚Äôve been living behind the pro shop for years and it gets nuked once a week and have to either server hop before the bomb lands. Or rebuild with a ton of mats. 
---
Sometimes best case scenario- I load into a server that has been nuked and my camp sets up perfectly intact and I can run around scrapping stuff and have a spawn point back inside the blast zone when I‚Äôm killed by the mob.
---
I think that‚Äôs a solid idea. The burned cinder damage would be a cool effect.
---
[See for yourself by watching one of our videos on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/504080041)
---
Absolutely not, it would be crash city, worse than it already is.
---
GTAV as well.
---
Did someone say huge hole?
---
such a smart boy
---
One of my first major disappointments with the game was when I discovered a nuked area was just a red tint light. I wish it was like NW with fire etc, but again server probably couldn't handle it.
---
 üëÄ
---
Myself and a pair of colleagues of mine (both of whom are mighty fine gentlemen who research plasma physics) hold this as our head-canon, as well. They‚Äôve played since the beta and we were all slightly disappointed that Bethesda missed the boat on this one. 
---
In any case, [we know what song to sing](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p--ofeHvUts) whenever we launch one of those bad boys.
---
Yeah ok, shows you how much I pay attention to those...of course if you're sharing it, they'd benefit from it as well.  Not sure where my head is at this morning :P
---
Lol potty police. I'm jk with you. I'd like those too.
---
Straight jackets from Fort Defiance, probably 15 in it and they sell 48 ea to vendors with max charisma, that‚Äôs half your daily limit alone
---
Sell some 5.56 on Reddit. I was 2K caps short on a bloodied fixer in a vendor and posted 5.56 for sale. Got a buyer quick.
---
My psn Chepo4721, I play anytime after 5 CST
---
Ok fine. They have like 1 different magazine. Doesn't mean the body couldn't have had that done. I'm not asking for much extra, but skins that are more varied and work on different guns is something this game is lacking
---
Do you have Unyielding gear? My Cha is 4 base, 4 pieces of Unyielding and I'm at 16 Cha and I can only share rank 1 things... Idk wtf their sharing criteria is, but I know how to do math and that's way off lol...
---
There might be slight differences. They are similar enough in their base forms and in terms of their bodies that I think it would be easily implemented. It's definitely less agregious then the ultracite thing tho
---
Yeah that's a confirmed bug
---
Isn‚Äôt this the place where the random earthquake can be triggered?
---
I assume if done it would be like the nightblade in ESO
---
Well from a development perspective - it‚Äôs dreadfully easier to change a settings cfg or ini file and increase the buffer distance than dredging up and re-engineering a *hopefully-optimized* fundamental system (building). 
---
One can be measured in minutes and the other in months. 
---
I won‚Äôt claim it‚Äôs the most effective choice but it‚Äôs definitely the most efficient in a pinch.
---
It actually wouldn't be that much of a technical hurdle. Most resources would be spent on artists designing and modeling an alternative map. They have the money. But why spend it if they don't have to?
---
I suppose the counter to that is how all of those activities are deliberate choice son your part.
---
The kill animations in melee happened randomly on their own.
---
I personally just want nuke zones to be dangerous again. I want enemies to spawn in and an air of danger around every corner no matter where you drop a nuke. Not just white springs or the SBQ area. Most other areas don‚Äôt spawn that much dangerous enemies. Just kinda meh. I remember first experiencing nuke zones and being legit afraid to enter them on account of getting my ass handed to me. And then as I gained levels I remember the feeling of getting to explore these nuked areas and have a good fight. Anywhere on the map could be changed in a moments notice. But now anywhere that isn‚Äôt NukeSprings or SBQ area hardly spawns enemies. I‚Äôm not really sure what *exactly* needs to change, but I do know that Nukes have a huge potential to be much **much** better
---
I'm considering nuking the bases of players who do this I've encountered a few but I been trying to be nice
---
worry about Thanksgiving it's November
---
Yes, it would be a technical hurdle, you would have to make one for every possible portion of the map
---
&gt; meaning they would have to make the microtransactions even worse in order to be able to afford the costs for this.
---
Or they could just make less money. It's not like they're struggling to keep the lights on. They already made their money back with 76 and are making profit from mtx + subscriptions.
---
chopping that meat
---
There is a bit / note in the VDSG about building camps in tight communities or at least *immediately* beside each other‚Äôs bounds. 
---
It‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs reasons for not having it that way. It would really give impetus for people to join things like the PKOA or other groups *(sorry other groups blanked on your acronyms)*
---
When I first started I dreamed of people setting up tight little towns like F4‚Äôs Covenant or the ones in the mire. Maybe one day
---
What fallout 76 needs is a clean slate, so many people hate this game based on its launch. Not me, js
---
Source 1 source 2 source 3
---
yawn
---
This is weird, I've never seen it happen at this event. Half the time I'm the only person at uranium fever... The Halloween event was ridiculous though, the sentry bot was dead before I was even aware he spawned. But who cares about 1*
---
I'm not one to cry about MTX so all I see is good news here.
---
Hum... I Usually play between your 01 - 02 PM all the way to your 8 PM
---
I was in a private server today where a door that usually locked was wide open.
---
Good question! I'd probably see if I can just ask a friend to borrow some. Ultimately other players are always your other source of caps.
---
&gt;in my opinion it is people with attitudes like your to people like me that are ruining it. 
---
And in my opinion you're like a victim with Stockholm's syndrome telling me to lay off your rapist because it's ruining your relationship.
---
It says patch note*s*
---
I moved mine (from that neat little cliff lake south of the asylum) when I got rad damage juuuust outside the boundary.  The wall was real!
---
&gt; i have to see this game is awesome posts
---
Well, there is a simple solution to that, just unsubscribe from the FO76 sub.
---
[source ](https://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/more-utility-items-coming-soon-to.html?m=1)
---
Sure but those things are still pointless. Trading is pointless same with brewing and the questlines.
---
What if the holes uncovered underground tunnels with bunkers or something?
---
Yes, in the Fallout universe atomic weapons are different than the real-life ones.  More radiation damage, less building damage.
---
Good stuff :) looking forward to the next ‚Äúoutside the basement‚Äù haha
---
You mean focus all their attention on how to extract more money from their fan base.
---
"Wastelanders
---
Nah."
---
I fucking lost it
---
Cap stash runs are the best, there's plenty around Poseidon, 2 Grafton monsters otw to Riverside Manor, hit WS and BW mine, ft up to Morgantown and get those. It's about 950-1100 caps with the cap collector perk.
---
Holy fuck good news wow. I thought all that guy reported on was bad news. EVERYONE will get the scrap box if they do a free trial of F1st, that not being available to everyone is the #1 complaint of F1st
---
Hey nice, I made that ship (not the broadsider idea that was his) but yea and it actually floats.
---
Worth mentioning, super duper in the luck perks, even at rank one, goes off like crazy when crafting. Consider getting it and swapping it on right before cooking. You can double your output. Same with ammo, armor, chems..
---
With that, carnivore mutation, and lots of boiled water I can always keep my speed demon self fed. And fed. And fed. And fed. And oops, I'm dehydrated again, guess I drank all 50 boiled water I had.
---
I don't know if I just stay in the dark on this stuff, but I feel like I haven't seen really and guilds in 76. I've seen a group of 3-4 players at a time on occasion but that's about it.
---
Turkey hunt with just black powder weapons. Recreate pioneering and mountain life with a trading camp. Deployable animal traps for hunting and craftable gear. Then have a meal with all the survivors getting together.
---
Well done.
---
Yes and a single patch has patch notes because multiple things change in every patch. It is rare for a game to update to fix 1 problem at a time. That usually isolated to individual instances of game breaking issues.
---
Red October, standing by
---
Honestly looks like good news. More money being thrown at the devs means they arent giving up. Talk of console cross play sounds promising.
---
lmao, "Thanksgiving Event" was top notch.
---
Spit first.
---
...is there a profit model that doesn't include maximizing profits while minimizing expenses that I am unaware of?
---
No, it wouldn't. You make one variant of the map and whenever a place gets nuked, swap the standard version for the variant.
---
They do that a lot, have unreleased items in promotional stills of other atom shop items. 
---
It is odd that it isn't in the datamine so I suppose it isn't going to be available until the next update (real one where data is actually downloaded) at the earliest.
---
those players are trying to get the progress bar as full as possible and probably don‚Äôt want to wait for you to figure out where the legendary is AND prance your overencumbered as over to miss your first couple shots all so u can get a piece of armor you‚Äôll never use.
---
So change the nukes so they effect the whole map, which would cause issues with fast traveling players and interior doors, and make it so lower level players just cant play.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs some big plains for Fallout First
---
WTF!  THERE ARE NO PLAINS IN WV!  WHAT IS BETHESDA PULLING HERE?  BULLSHIT GARBAGE DUMPSTER FIRE GAME CAN'T EVEN GET GEOGRAPHY RIGHT
---
loved it, but i think you made a mistake. the Thanksgiving event starts at nov 30
---
"...don't buy from Bethesda."
---
As someone in an a corporate art career, can attest to the fact that even people WORKING WITH ME have no idea how long a decent repeat pattern takes...euuuugh. Saying you just slap art on and apply an existing diffuse map are entirely missing the point.
---
Bethesda making a mistake!? That's unpossible!
---
But yes, I concur, that is a most definite oversight.
---
According to mmog fails the cross play was shot down due to issues with PC. A consoles only cross play was suggested but his source doesn't know what became of that suggestion. It also mentions that cross play won't happen without a huge push from the player base and even then it's very unlikely to happen due to the amount of work involved. I'd love console cross play though. I have several friends that play the game on Xbox and it would be nice to be able to play with them
---
I dont think so unfortunately, i tried to get a small candle in them, but no luck
---
I'd be interested in joining as well. I'm a also a newbie to the raids. I did try soloing the week two one with all the voting, but got frustrated with all the glitches and stopped trying. I'm about level 130 Junkies 2H melee and regularly do solo silo runs and Project Paradise. I've also got a private server if you need a place to run it lag free. I'm usually on from 9-11 p.m. EST.
---
Funny fact on that, you know the jack o lantern combat rifle skin that you could get in the NW challenge? Well the atom shop picture for it shows 2 combat shotguns, and one combat rifle with the paint even tho you can't apply it to shotguns.  
---
Sucks because the paint looked way better on the shotties.
---
Promising!
---
Of course Bethesda is lying.  
---
That's what corporations do when they get caught doing things that will anger their consumers.  
---
you go to the social media places where you were caught, and make up denials to deflect, and make the those who caught you look like the bad guys.  
---
This is why their explanation is very light on specifics and details.
---
That would be cool but it would be so laggy when someone does it and it probably wont load wepp for everyone
---
&gt;The vault 96 raids
---
This, we have it mentioned in chsllenges. They were on it, im sure content is like 75% done but the overwhelming negative feedback of the community fxked up tje develop of them raids. Thats just dad
---
I agree. I understand why dirty/broken versions are in the game, but it doesn't make sense that we'd build ourselves broken fixtures. I'd like to see these items have a "clean" skin option.
---
because they're offended and stingy üòÇ
---
Actually the guy spread some Good &amp; bad news i suggest to give some visits to his website
---
Got ya, that sucks, but thanks though.
---
I just read an article from mmog fails that said they discussed cross play but it got shot down due to issues with PC. It also mentioned some talk about console only cross play but his source doesn't know what happened with that suggestion. The article also said that cross play won't happen without a huge push from the player base and even then it's very unlikely because of the amount of work involved
---
Yeah not sure why your post got deleted, it's news if legit
---
Sure do. Easiest way to grow the playerbase. This forum would really come together if even only PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players could game together. 
---
Think of how much easier conducting trades would be when the platform we play on no longer matters.
---
Still hoping for a linked character storage or perhaps an off server bank of some sort.
---
Must not be a very good reader.
---
Praise be. Crossing fingers to this new cycle of raids.
---
Big fails can award even bigger comebacks
---
Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs coming. They‚Äôre just taking a little extra time to see if there‚Äôs any way to improve your experience through monetization.
---
That will be 2000 atoms sir, thank you.
---
I actually think you need to look at it again... 
---
If you get $1.10 for 1 Euro, then the Euro is the stronger currency.
---
Or at least add a boss like the SBQ in every region
---
I just want to be able to click on a map location and fast travel there... without having to open the map and click on it 3 more times. üòí
---
Yeah but if we keep requesting it, they'll probably continue working on it after Wastelanders drops
---
They always deleted my post .
---
I think they're ignorant to not attempt cross play. Imagine how many more games they'd sell. I know a few people that would buy the game today if they could play with friends on other consoles
---
ThE WeApOn ArE  DiFfReNt
---
Nah Nah we should be able to have The same skin for The same Guns they are identical ffs only diffrence is The NAME and The laser
---
And runs til New Years!
---
There's been so many times I accidentally commented on a WTB for another platform :(
---
Oh yeah
---
Red Six, standing by
---
If you're on PS4 I can lay down the ones from the atom bundle. For some reason we're allowed to do that
---
Now this would actually be a class war.
---
Yeah that's why I gave your post an upvote before I even read it lol
---
Lmfao. Love it
---
Can we please have this post again every three days
---
On pc if i alt tab out of the game and come back in it will sometimes adopt a lower resolution. Sometimes this can be fixed in the video settings as you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs set itself to windowed mode and a lower resolution, sometimes you just need to restart the game if that doesn‚Äôt work. If you‚Äôre not noticing a difference it could be the depth of field you‚Äôre complaining about as Bethesda use it to hide distant texture pop in even though it doesn‚Äôt really hide it at all. This can be disabled in the settings though I think. If you still have issues then I‚Äôm sorry to say sometimes this game just looks like shit due to the devs having to down scale certain parts just so ‚Äòit works‚Äô.
---
I had been meaning to try this but hadn't tried nor asked. Thanks!  In Fallout 4 I built on top of Red Rocket just outside of the community you start the game in. Was a beautiful place I miss. 
---
In F76 I am over along the riverbank to the west, just north of Hilfork's Hotdogs. I love it there though and the only enemies I see are low level scorched or mole rats. I tend to get neighbors just to my north which is nice and maybe only 1 out of every 20 log ins will I get the message of someone camping in my space.
---
Console vs. PC? THE TRADE CHANNELS WOULD BE RIOTIOUS! LET THE  DUPES DECIDE THE VICTOR
---
PC definitively needs it. I know this will never happen for competitive game modes due to performance and kb+m advantages, but it would be nice to have more people to play adventure mode with.
---
Too bad console players are afraid of PC cheaters, but I don't blame them.
---
I'm not afraid of PC cheaters, but I don't PvP much. PC players seem p chill
---
I'm sorry then. I've read them all.
---
I've read all of them. There is nothing worth farming still. Which is the main issue.
---
Bravo.
---
&gt; We know how much you all really like cool power armor and weapon skins, so we added a few mundane C.A.M.P. items and another set of wallpaper for you to spend your hard-earned Atoms on 
---
I lol'd out loud (to quote Monk)
---
Whatever platform you're on, find someone who bought the Halloween bundle, they'll be able to lay them down for you
---
This used to happen to me too, but I've noticed that it only happened when I tab-out while in a loading screen. So if you need to switch tabs, make sure the game is not loading something.
---
Oh dear.. Pigeon Syndrome üôÑ
---
Cool, good to know. Thanks
---
Or at least a sink and a good bathroom mirror. I don't care if it's cracked
---
I can give it a try, I‚Äôm in London time and play between 5-9 on weekdays and most of the day weekends
---
Can you even keep over 200fps most of the time?
---
I have an Rx 580 8gig and it sometimes struggles to keep an FPS of 60 at 1080p at certain parts of the map.
---
Maybe it looks blurry to you because it isn't even reaching an FPS of over 200.
---
I guess there are some real free states fans out there. I was surprised. I‚Äôd love some enclave stuff.
---
On my main character I had no problem maxing out vendor caps just running through a couple of areas in the cranberry bog &amp; collecing &amp; selling weapons.  I usually started by clearing out the NAR Repair yard, then head over to Big Bend Tunnel East - grab any guns (combat or assault rifles &amp; combat shotguns).  I'd then head back toward watoga - stop in one of the train cars - there's usually a submachine gun sitting on the ground that sells for a decent amount of money.  Sell @ watoga station (with hard bargain at the very least).  From there, head east to the flooded train yard &amp; clear that out - loot buildings, etc.  Head back to Watoga and sell again.  Honestly, that gets me pretty close at Charisma of 3 &amp; using the hard bargain perk (maxed out.)  I usually make up the difference with chems I don't use, gold or silver scrap, raw asbestos, etc.
---
Sometimes I do a fort defiance run for straight jackets - those I will sell with hard bargain and grape mentats and I have no problem maxing out caps when I decide to do that.
---
Sell chems found in ghouls.
---
Agreed, when Fallout 76 was first announced that was the first thing that came to mind. Being able to build a dope small town with friends. Was a real downer when the Stress Test came out and I found out I could only place my camp near a friend if I'm like 30 miles away from theirs.
---
Ah, cool and thanks for the tip.
---
The engine is usually locked at 60, need to modify the ini file to allow it to go higher
---
Clean toilets and sinks have been in the files for quite some time now:

---
WHY DID IT GET REMOVED
---
lol I like you.
---
It was a prefix effect that dropped closer to launch, it worked kind of like Quad but doubled your ammo capacity instead of quadrupling it.  It was removed a while ago so any existing weapons with it are legacy now, and worth a lot to collectors.
---
Follow the power lines...
---
Sounds like a great idea. I would love to build a neighborhood of sorts. Although I'd be interested in seeing how it would affect game performance.
---
Yes, and the picture frames move too...
---
I am level 171 and have never launched a nuke. Tried once failed haven't tried since.
---
Possum Badges for backpack mods to start.
---
Yeah the fact that their first bounce off the ground is like they're made out of rubber really irritates me.
---
Alpine River Cabins are haunted.
---
Thats outdated news, the fps limit went away in early 2019
---
I use the mirror I bought at the white springs vendor and place it over a marble table with a couple succulents on it lol
---
Get tactical marine mask plan and then craft craft craft....good for a little xp as well.  What i do anyways.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs promising for some people, but i have to ask my post is still appears on Fallout 76 sub ?
---
Yes you are correct. Once you learn it, it will no longer drop. Same with the decontamination shower.
---
Yeah, as far as I know that's the only mirror in the game. It just doesn't look much like a *bathroom mirror to me, but I'm glad it's working for you
---
... And then store the rug...
---
Thats actually one of the many things i enjoy from 76, kind of nostalgic.
---
PD mask?
---
Right thought as much, because when you are in the business of testing video games you just try it once and confirm. You dont try it out in every possible environment to see if you can create variants or reproduce the exploit in another manner. /s
---
I like the idea of fishing and houseboats, a lot. My current camp is built like a pier on the water, and I would love to fish off the pier.
---
Yeah, the atom shop image for the free states shotgun paint was misleading IMO. It shows 3 guns with the paint, and I totally thought one was a combat rifle when I bought it.
---
A cap-sink so i have a reason to farm caps again. I already suggested a slot machine like in borderlands 2 but I'll settle for anything similar
---
When those nukes go off its other players?
---
Here i am struggling to make .44 rounds.
---
Didnt they come from technical data mission?
---
Oh don‚Äôt be fooled, if you have a membership there are more items in the shop
---
Use either chameleon armor, and depending on how you like to play, use a bloodied or armor piercing rifle
---
Recommended level?
---
Pretty sure members have access to more items in the atomic shop, paywall behind a paywall
---
But he never reported the exploit either
---
As a 1st member on PC i didnt get anything extra except for icon
---
You know there are no dentists in WV and none have been trained since the great war? Think of your teeth man you only get one set!
---
lol not this week kid sorry
---
Very good way to describe gaming conveniences: "not going to play any more or less, just enjoy it more." I hope developers start thinking this way, don't make something longer, make it BETTER.
---
Fixer... i have a primed furious 33 vats one.  Thing rocks
---
Railway and Crossbow don't benefit from Concentrated Fire so 1/3 is all you'll need.
---
I don't see it if I sort by new
---
That's what they said was going to happen. And that the area would slowley come back to its normal self? Last time I checked it's just a fat fucking radiation cloud that doesn't do anything different besides level up enemies.
---
Nah, they would put them front and center, "only available for F1st members" to push the subscription
---
Thanks for the reply.  I noticed the same.  I'm going to keep trying.  If I find something, I'll message you back in case you're interested.
---
I have only had one instance where there were ash piles at V9. Given I don't use a Tesla,  and there were two other players with me who don't use Tesla's,  it was unusual. This has happened only once. The only thing I could figure is it was recycled or a Tesla firing robot horde spawned there,  but there were no robot piles.
---
That is a genuinely great idea
---
Is there a way to get a fixer at max level? I did that quest ages ago
---
I like aaffr25 rifles for my guy. I use stealth and vats on him and my aaffr25 assault rifle was so easy to get plus so good!
---
If you're on PC I can build u a few Jack O Lanterns.
---
I asked for this a long time ago. So up-vote for you!!
---
I agree completely. Not to mention the goodwill it would earn Bethesda amongst the gaming community for being one of the first AAA Online RPG‚Äôs to fully embrace Console Cross Platform gaming.
---
Nope, they're not.
---
Yeah once you have the plan you can craft them at lvl 50.  I get mine from purveyor though.  If you start trading with people and build trust just tell them what you need or want.  That way you have multiple people looking for specific weapon.
---
Because he hurt bethesdas feelings and they cant handle the truth
---
There might be something to this, my entire camp was built with contractor, I‚Äôll play around with it and see if it makes a difference.
---
Nah not pointless.. but you coming here to tell us you read some patch notes on a game you don't play a year later... that's worth a "point."  Smh.
---
Yes!!!
---
I would like to join. I've been playing since the open beta and my main character is I think 178 but I've been playing mostly solo and haven't done much in the way of raids, project paradise, the burrows, or the SBQ. Lately I've been thinking I'd like to get on a discord server and start doing those things. I've been waiting for some kind of looking for group feature but I guess we'll never get one
---
...... His initial post stated that he was leaving the game because his account got banned after reporting an exploit........
---
But it doesn‚Äôt run at 10 FPS?? I‚Äôm confused
---
I get the connection to the topic, but for me it's [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDsFKOrLWhU)....
---
You‚Äôre telling me. I don‚Äôt know how many decent trades I‚Äôve passed up because of a difference in platform.
---
Double Heavy weapons for everyone! üç∫üç∫
---
You haven‚Äôt played them...
---
That was the same collapse that really jumpstarted the legend of the sandhill crane right?
---
With reason.
---
That‚Äôs a thing in this game? Do they regain your health?
---
I'll screenshot and post from his website where he says he didn't report it
---
Dual TSE 20mm Autos....    Now that would be fun....
---
Same Engine = Same Content = Same Asset Content Creators = Same Assets = Same Company = Gamedesign. Gamedesign never changes
---
Strange..
---
Especially when you consider they never had a problem releasing buggy content before, goes to show how far a WL release actually is in terms of development.
---
I'm okay with the toilets we have, just wish we could sit on them, and open our pipboy and go through the inventory while sitting on them.
---
Maybe it comes to your mind, not mine. I do not support that player as they had zero evidence that supported their case. Looking at the bare facts, rather than listening to Yongyea and his like, it was pretty clear that even if the guy was innocent he could not prove it, and he had an absolutely ridiculous amount of ammo (especially the rare ultracite kind) not just some 'good loot'.
---
I stand by my statement, Bethesda has done nothing to make me cynical in this context.
---
How do you get the plan? I just got the gun as a reward ages ago
---
See why doesn‚Äôt the game give tutorials? All this really good feedback from the community and other players but yet the ACTUAL GAME doesn‚Äôt even tell you how to at least turn on your flash light üôÑüòêü§®

Let's not move the goal posts anymore, think the facts speak for themselves
---
Even if PC Cross Play was restricted to Private Worlds only; that would still be a big gain for everyone. Maybe even bar PC from Cross Play in Nuclear Winter. Until Bethesda had better control of the cheats on that platform. 
---
All sorts of friends and family play on different platforms. I would love to be able to play the Main Quest of Wastelanders on Xbox with my brother on PC. Even if that meant Private Worlds.
---
I mean, I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I like that about Bethesda. They reuse assets and engines to a degree that at the very least, every game feels familiar, if not nostalgic. And yeah, you're right, all plants are ALCH (alchemy) items, stealth boys do institute a chameleon spell actor effect, scorch beasts reuse the dragon skeleton nif, all additional damage types (bleed, burn, shock) are just spells firing off in the engine, etc. 
---
As a modder, it makes everything so much simpler going between say, Fallout 4 and Skyrim, and as a player, it makes everything more familiar while you're in it.
---
Sure.
---
Thanks for the guide, going to try this later!
---
Actually just link the site please.
---
What does aaffr25 mean?
---
I already sent the screenshot. But his admittance to not reporting it is still on his website. Here ya go, it's just map76.com
---
I mean, it wasn't intended as a shitpost, but rather an amusing satire of the Inside the Vault to channel my recent frustration with stuff.
---
If you can't laugh at yourself, you're probably doing something wrong. C'est le vie.
---
Is chameleon armour rare? I can't recall ever seeing any
---
It would even work if the plant died after you harvest it 5 times, so you need to have fresh plants at all times.
---
If you want 1 Star and only chameleon, not really, but a 3 star set is going to set you back at least 15k, or take days of grinding for it
---
What is this used for?
---
I gave you a Nuka Cola not because the entire game is a mistake but because you are dead on that they are not equipped to manage an online community. They don't even have the correct support tools or a gm staff to help. 
---
Of all the issues in this game this is the biggest problem, because they cannot effectively fix anything else without those tools and it totally destroys interest when something goes wrong and they cannot fix it.
---
Anti armor, faster fire rate, 25% less vats cost 
---
Awesome combo for a non bloodied and vats using character
---
in nuclear winter, first thing i do is strip nekkid, so i agree with this thread!
---
poo stained drawers are starting to get a bit stinky anyway
---
Here's the screenshot too, you can search for the text exactly if you want http://imgur.com/a/00N37KM
---
I hope they don't ban you for "exploitation".
---
I would like to see large areas of the map about the same size as the workshops be available to be made into towns.  They could have multiple locations that allow teams of 2 and teams of 4 people to build on the area. Each house is able to be blue printed to save your layout when you quit or get disconnected.  This would allow you and your friends to server hop until you find an open camp area. I don't think this would hurt the servers too much because the budget is the same.  It's basically a rework of the workshops. There are so many areas in the map that this would/should be easy to implement. Basically it would work like the Fallout 4 settlements except 4 players can contribute to the building and maintenance of the area.
---
\- A big barn/warehouse and 4 small houses or structures are pre-placed.  Each empty house only gives you 25 pct of your normal build budget which basically gives you the ability to decorate. 
---
\-Each barn has a spot for 1 vending machine per player and acts sort of like a player lounge.
---
\-Each barn has all the crafting stations and a fusion generator with wires already hooked up. House are already hooked to the grid for power. There could be a handful of water purifiers on hand to save budget on those as well.
---
\-Each "town" has defenses built into the design so budget isn't wasted on them. They still have to be repaired if destroyed though.
---
All the areas could have a theme.  Maybe a raider camp, BOS camp, Responder camp, Agricultural farm, Campground, Trailer park, Hunting Lodge, etc. Each town area could have certain resources collectors and benefits. 
---
\-Add a defend event every hour or so from approaching monsters.
---
This system would allow friends and even people that want to be in factions join up and play together more easily. It also would help with the lore of rebuilding Appalachia.  This is one of the mechanics that would really help with the longevity of the game in my opinion.
---
When they have a plan to monetize early access that may be a possibility. But for now it's best they make this something really good and not charge for it.
---
I like the game and it‚Äôs frustrating to just see people shitting on it constantly on here. I get it, you don‚Äôt like the game. Then don‚Äôt play it and leave the sub, let those enjoying it enjoy it.
---
We would pay $100 for this to be added, on top of Fallout1st, make it happen Bethesda.
---
I agree with ya, its true and they expect us to think nothing but the positive when all they have been giving us is the shitty end of the stick
---
Yeah I did the first modus mission..where u have to get uniform made but I think I have to go bk n do a scortchbeast mission ..kill 10 or something.do u start it in bunker?
---
Super stimpacks, basically if you do the death blossoms event you'll get 10 corpse flower seeds which are fuckin useless and everyone else on the server gets corpse flower stamen lol, kinda how like the mama dolces event used to reward everyone else but the participants
---
They shoot a green beam, that is the only difference.
---
I never said anything about paying for anything.
---
Have to use vats with an auto railway.  Recoil is not an issue then.
---
That MMOG Fails guy says there's two holiday events in the works, and a pre-launch event for Wastelanders. Willing to bet the two holiday events are related to Thanksgiving and Christmas, as it is most likely. We'll have to see though.
---
It would make them worth it. As it goes now people just don't make most things that use rare perishable ingredients. It's an aspect of the game that isn't open to most players right now
---
Its in the same place where not having your login name displayed in game is at.
---
Their security people are either asleep at the wheel or they don't exist.
---
That's how they become legendary....
---
I've been doing something along those lines with scout armour, got 2 pieces of chameleon but just even finding someone with a right arm and left leg piece is proving difficult.
---
Only 1 camp I went to last night had them and they were charging silly money for everything so I took a pass. The hunt continues!
---
Also, the post was probably removed for the wrong flair or something.
---
The technology just isn't there yet...
---
Atomic shop has light up variants. You can clip lights behind them though to give some sort of effect.
---
YES!!!!!!!! pissed me off!!!!!! I scrapped 2 things to build 2 different things, and now i can build anything more, its like the space disappeared!
---
Ahh cool thanks
---
Any special sales?
---
Unless it was patched if both hit both have a chance of becoming loot.  Problem is that second shot is not reliable at all unless it's got vats hit on the secondary legendary effect and then it's only in vats.
---
I never saw it for that price and I logged in with my alt to check right after servers were up.
---
Could you educate me a bit?  What platform are you using? PC?  I‚Äôm on XBox and have 2 -Factor for signing into my Xbox Live account, once signed in I just start playing F76. I figured I was protected that way. Are you having to manually sign-in to Bethesda.com or something  to play F76?
---
1st party the developer
---
2nd party the client
---
3rd party someone else
---
To Beth, my tools are 2nd party. To me they are 1st party.  To you they are 3rd party.
---
One cool thing they could do is: Nukes activate special events. Kinda like the scorched queen, but in other areas.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Skin underwear wanted.
---
Noone except Bethesda knows how the anti cheat works, stop guessing
---
Yeah, for this event you need a ranged weapon with explosive splash damage.   
---
I use a Level 5 Demolition Expert with a One-shot explosive handmade but take off the Commando perks.   I just want splash damage so that I get XP and the legendary items.  There are too many players who keep their max perks up during the event.  
---
Doing it once by accident is one thing, but when you see the same player doing it for all of the legendaries, then they are just being selfish idiots.
---
Console cross play would be amazing. Keep PC out of it. I no longer play on PC because of all the hackers and dupers. They need to keep them away from consoles.
---
Would be nice if they added something where you can set you‚Äôre buying things for a certain price and people can sell it to you as long as you have caps to pay it.
---
For example you use one of the 30 slots to su you‚Äôre buying waste acid for 4c per. If a player has some to sell he can sell you it via the vendor and it would go to your stash. You could also set a limit on how much. And when the seller gets the caps they can do the 10% minus fee thing. 
---
Maybe even a new machine to do this. To keep vending and buying separate
---
Agreed this would be a game changer
---
Yep, just lacking lately overall in the freebie department.
---
Pretty cool. How long ago was this? We can't build there anymore. üòï
---
Is it just me or does that sink look like a little face with a cute little quiff?!
---
I just sell guns from enemies i loot
---
Really hope they do something like this. I mean it's already bin game.
---
&gt; A "cheat engine" just reads *[ and writes ]* the memory on your computer.
---
In this case the map76 guy was modifying game memory as he was playing the game in order to trigger the "exploit".
---
I use Power armor and combat knife (vampire + swingspeed).
---
Not sure what to tell you. There were multiple threads about it and a lot of people bought it.
---
He got banned after using plenty of exploits constantly, and using 3rd party tools to do so commonly known as "hacking" not exploiting.  The guy is not innocent in the slightest.
---
Instigating or Anti Armor is good on the heavy hitter slow fire rate rifles (lever action, hunting rifle), Or bloodied or Junkies etc for those specific builds, use handmade, fixer or Gauss rifle. If you do a Bloodied character you want unyielding gear, it will buff your stats up so high you dont need Sneak perk, 1 piece of Chameleon armor is nice but not necessary.
---
I'll take a working game over anything else.
---
Downvoted for demonstrating numeracy.
---
Have you looked at r/PKOA ?
---
Lie by omission is still a lie.
---
How has it mostly ditched the 50s aesthetic? I still see CRTs and Nixie tubes everywhere. 
---
This games atomic shop and its wacky shit is the worst offender in the franchise.
---
That's all u could build? How much do u have in storage?
---
&gt;Spend 5 minutes using a little common sense 
---
Oh, the irony.
---
This, omg this
---
I prefer the Western Revolver. I have an AA +50% VATS Crit damage that I have had since last January that is my favorite side arm (I named it Betsy). I think the .44 has a bit faster fire rate, but not sure. The Single Action has a great sound when it fires, but takes too long to reload.
---
&gt;I never said that they are banning people who report exploits, nor do I support that statement.
---
Yes you did.  That is literally what you posted when you came here crying about being banned for exploiting and using 3rd party tools to "hack" the game.
---
You are a cheater and should be banned for life.  Good riddance.
---
Amen to that üôè
---
He has not done shit.  They all just use tools and exploits posted by cheaters in forums dedicated to cheating.
---
Not to mention those paint jobs are not even lore correct for the timeline. The rank structure they represent isn't around till east coast Maxson's BoS.
---
Sadly this is the whole reason behind the bundles.  Lock the coolest stuff in a bundle to make people spend more.
---
Using 3rd party tools to modify in game values is not exploiting... that is straight cheating and "hacking".
---
I think the weirdest thing is that the trees aren't affected by the nukes. Like... c'mon, how strong is a nuke if it doesn't even burn leaves lmfao.
---
Just bad luck...   
---
The other day I found a 3\* and had a couple of Luck Bobbleheads on me.  I used one and ended up getting a double barrel one-shot explosive with 50% ignore armour.  I used that bad boy with the enforcer perk at a White Springs Nuke and had over 20 ghouls down on the pavement crippled in no time.  
---
I became the scout, gathering up the ghouls and crippling them, while a bunch of other players trailed for cleanup.  We found 6 to 7 legendaries that run...  Everyone shared in XP and legendary items...
---
I've had a run where I have been getting 3\* legendary Shotguns and Pipe-Pistols (of all things).  The shotguns have been nice drops.  I've been giving the pipe pistols away to a buddy who is starting a pistol build, just for the fun of it.
---
Doesn't changed the fact it's still locked in config though.
---
Its limited by server side so we don't have the same effects we used to. Go unlimit it in any previous game &amp; try to lock pick.
---
Fully Support this.  i love executions and while i know there is that risk you can get killed while the execution plays out but they are still awesome.       also i wish they would add in player dismemberment back in.     i know in the original e3 video they showed that pvp encounter and when it showed the other playing getting downed he was missing his arm.
---
I was thinking about doing guides but I lost interest for the game, lol.
---
I don't really get why skins are so limited.  A paint style skin should work with any weapon/armor.  Obviously to milk more money, but still.
---
I just dumped 1k scrip on Murgh last night and didn't get any bashing effects.
---
What you're experiencing here is called confirmation bias. A sample size of 5 is pitifully small and proves nothing. Peronal and secondhand anecdotes are not a proper way to test anything.
---
This post contributes nothing to this subreddit.
---
No, i think he meant that with the budget the billboards take he can build all that
---
You just quoted me and said something else.
---
This is addressed in Nuclear Winter/Vault 51 terminals. The ring of fire in NW is caused by the constant nukes in Adventure :)
---
and their game allows it. there is a clich√© in web development that says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust the client‚Äú - clearly whatever is changing client side, the server just says ‚Äúyea sounds good‚Äù and that‚Äôs what happens.  Thats a cardinal sin of any kind of web development.
---
Oh ok
---
A 90% reduction in price in the Atomic Shop üòÅ
---
That is working as intended.
---
You **cannot** share a perk card that you do not have the appropriate base CHA to share. You cannot buff your CHA to share a higher tier perk card, just as it doesn't matter if your CHA is *debuffed*, you cannot be stopped from sharing something. Even mutations have no effect.
---
And the point of this post was?? Other than you basically complaining no one buys your stuff
---
There is one in game but you need to have access to dev room, lol ‚ÄùHunter‚Äôs hood‚Äù if I remember correctly. Never had it myself though, but it got removed.
---
What platform you on?
---
&gt; Routers will regularly cut the connection in the middle of the night (between 1 and 2 o'clock) and fetch a new IP-Address in the process.
---
That is very poor practice.
---
&gt; I'm also fairly sure that the ISP does not remember your IP. For legal reasons, yes, but not for technical reasons.
---
It is pretty standard for them to remember who had what IP last. Hell, literally every home router does this too. If the ISP has a nigh user base and limited IPs to give, your chance of being assigned the same IP again is low because need trumps history. But "if avalible, give old IP" is pretty common.
---
&gt; Maybe you had an ISP that assigned static IPs? 
---
Nope. You pay extra for that.
---
&gt; Reassigning the same IP over and over again within 6 years seems very unlikely to me.
---
Because it is on an as needed basis, and they don't typically force IP changes, that is dumb. As long as the modem is connected, you retain the same IP, and if you disconnect and reconnect it, if your previous IP is still avalible, it will assign the same one. There is little reason to not do this because it doesn't impact anything else at all.

i use to have 10 of each plant i could place.    eventually had to reduce everything down to 5 and then eventually got rid of the non essential ones for me like melons/carrots etc.    so i only have 5 of razorgrain/mutfruit/tato/corn.     pain in the ass but i wanted more stuff in my camp.    budget constraint irritates me but i also understand why they have it too.

"DLC"
---
Are vault dwellers ruining the player vending industry?
---
It's great for getting flyboy scorchbeasts to the ground.
---
üí™
---
your right, combat of clunky in all of them
---
I can't understand why they don't have those items in the game. A shower, toilet, sink, mirror, etc.  Make it a quest for clean versions or just have the vendor in Whitesprings sell them.
---
In The begining we didnt know what to expect...
---
It all started with a tale from The realm of twitch...
---
Until The festival know as e3 came where they promises us a game like no other... 16 Times The details, multiplayer, a massive world where no one lived but us The vault dwellers of 76..
---
After months of more tales from The promised game The art were beautiful, The game seemed next gen. On october 23 2018 we were on The verge of an experience like no other or so we thought.
---
When The break it early test application went live many of us got denied of The glory making us become frustrated but The god todd gave us more time to test The promised game and after some time The first dwellers left The vault in search of an adventures...
---
After a while The game didnt seem that gloryful and The treasures of The waste were few... It was said to have bugs and chaos like no other fallout but not in The good way...
---
After The break it early there were only 2 weeks left before we got to play it full time... People were discussing about The game mostly negativ many uninstalled The promised game never to return...
---
We question ed The god todd and his minions what there plan was but it was for nothing no response from The lord we all saw up to... 
---
After some time The first nukes were dropped since The Great war some went on The souther parts of appalachia to fight The sourse of a deadly plauge that took out The former residens of appalachia...
---
 others were sent to an automated hotel called whitespring to grind for legendary and this would be The way of The dwellers for quite some time
---
Months passed without new content except for The overpriced atomic shop until a new chapter begained in appalachias..
---
 
---
In Wild appalachia some of The old ones came back to see what treasure had been given to us by The lord... 
---
What The dwellers found were a monster called sheepsquatch but with it came an imposter so powerful The residens of 76 ultimatly gave up on it after a while of killing it... 
---
With the monster dead appalachia were once again free to Explorer and rebuild civilisation some keeped continue doing what they did before some started to make moonshine some joined The pioneer scout and those time a new face arived in appalachia The purverour... 
---
Once a again a chapter ended but where one chapter ends a new begins in The depths of vault 51... 
---
A vault with the experiment of finding the optimal way to find a leader the computor became so frustrated of The result of elections of finding a leader that it went to turn The dwellers against each other until one survived... 
---
After a while boxes started to apear with messages from The survior of 51 speaking of The evil of The computor know as zax
---
Even with the warnings vault 51 final got their overseer after surviving The nuclear storm and they other dwellers wanting to become overseer of vault 51... 
---
This is here The story ends with the player Base being small but friendly and cheerful with hope and faith of better Times for this promised game
---
Thank you all for listning to The tale
---
In Wild appalachia some of the old ones came back to see what treasures had been revealed tjey
---
I once showed up to a SQB nuke drop where the person who dropped the nuke didn't even show up. It was just me and her. Felt so ackward.
---
This gonna cause strippers and then more of a social class
---
this also i have yet to figure out how to actually delete your credit card information off their website.    like there is no option for it.   if you open the atom store it's always there.
---
For my first build, I didn't use contractor...don't think I even had it.  
---
FWIW, here'es some detail to help envision the before/after.
---
Before:
---
Floating camp off one foundation piece.  Footprint the same size as the base of a power transmission tower.  2nd floor about 1/2 that size.  All workbenches, 2 small purifiers, acid extractor, fusion generator.  2 heavy mg turrets, 2 standard turrets.  A small adhesive farms, 4 display cases, 2 magazine racks, 2 vendors, misc decorations.  no roof, and a couple of wall pieces around the generator
---
Some threads here state each item used a fixed budget amount, and it does not change.
---
Also saw a few threads here speculating budget might increase with character level.
---
Given my camp was built around 100 levels prior, figured rebuild wouldn't hurt, and while I was at it, use contractor.
---
Rebuilt on the ground, same 1st floor size.  2nd floor is now same size as the 1st floor.  same amenities.   But now I have brick walls all the way around.  Plus the roof, plus additional display cases, and still have what appears to be about 10% free budget space. 
---
End result seems to support :
---
Since contractor reduces the quantity of mats needed, items take less budget
---
and/or you get a budget increase as your level gets higher.
---
Ah ok then
---
Plus given how they are able to pull that off it would be nice to see an actual winter effect with snow.
---
you said you have a mountain of stuff but no one buys, go google a supply and demand curve and come back later, no one wants your 5k 2* stalkers
---
That was how the exploit worked though.  Which is insane because this is an online game and it's incredible that an action like this was handled client side and not server side and this was even possible.  
---
It was fucking up the economy because apparently if it worked, people were buying legendaries from the purveyor with caps.
---
This would be extremely helpful for pretty much everyone who plays adventure mode.
---
2FA free to all Fallout 1st members
---
In a patch some time around the end of summer they increased the budget cost of crops big time, and that would create serious problems if they were to expand on farming. So they would have to take a hard look at that. 
---
Otherwise I'd love to see agriculture become a more integrated and long-term part of this game.
---
Don't you need all pieces to have chameleon on for it to work?
---
Here you go. It‚Äôs not the best build ever imo but it‚Äôs a great start.  
---

Currently run an instigating lever, executioner‚Äôs 10mm pistol and vampires laser rifle. 
---
Only thing to watch out for is covert operative needs to come after mister sandman to get the 3.75x multipliers.
---
level 60 on pc and 120 on xbox and I've launched like 10 only because I think clearing the silos is fun other than that I wouldn't have bothered
---
I'm reading that it's a temp ban from your account being flagged from suspected duping, cheating, etc.
---
Pretty sure it's just 3 fetch quests and a few repeatable "kill some stuff" events anyway.
---
Damn. That's quite the find!
---
I actually got seven bashings, those five were consecutive, then after some 33 hit chance, more bashing. Yes you can say it‚Äôs an isolated incident because the sample size is small. But out of my tens of thousands of scrips this was the first time so many concentrated bashing. I can‚Äôt be happier if this was just my sheer luck. It should only get better from here right?
---
Coming soon to the Atom store only 20,000 atoms for the bundle! ;)
---
So if I ran this I'd just need to equip the  sandman perk before the covert operative?
---
Mission 3 is arguably easiest solo for novice. No boss at the end and manageable steps
---
Got teamed up with a couple 200s once, the proceeded to immediately leave
---
I don't know why you focused on this part and commented on it like you did.  This is not under contention and my statement doesn't challenge it, even ironically.  So I guess you're right?  I don't really know what else to say.
---
Not at all
---
The point was to get lovely comments from the lazy and broke such as yourself, what's the point of your comment? I don't need your crappy caps, I just want people like you to quit begging...its sad.
---
Encrypted event
---
What, specifically, are you asking for?
---
I think...i dont remember
---
Most to all battle royals have the ability to go with premade team. Hate to tell ya but that's probably never going to change.
---
Thanks for this long and useless list. Now I'm gonna go ahead and report this post so hopefully the mods can uphold the 'no rumours or leaks without verified evidence' rule... because that 'source' link leads us to nothing more than additional hearsay.
---
Btw, who is 'MMOG Fails' and why should anyone give even the smallest shit about this person? xD
---
It looks that way. It‚Äôs a simple swap when logging in. But yeah it cut out the multiplier that should be given. You‚Äôll hit for 2.65? Instead of the 3.75x that would be when in the night time.
---
You are saying you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed be allowed to play with friends? I don‚Äôt know what a premade is.
---
Sorry, I worded my post badly, you asked for DLC rather than an update, lots of other people have made suggestions for things they could charge us for (that should just be free)   
---
My post was expressing my opinion on both.   
---
I would like to see more free content updates.   
---
I dont understand why people in general want DLC (which would sperate the playerbase) rather than updates (which would keep us all playing the same version of the game)   
---
I also don't understand why people ask for content that is missing from the game to be added to the atom shop rather than just added to the game.
---
I saw something similar on PS4 the other night.. pretty cool.
---
Ahh cool all the rest are okay in the order they're in?
---
They would have to bar PC players from NW or any PVP or it will be unplayable. I‚Äôm totally down to do cross play with PS4 players but I enjoy NW and not having to deal with the crazy cheating happening for NW PC players.
---
Lol, assume whatever your broke ass wants, stalker guns get scripped as fast as I find them.
---
Yes. The others don‚Äôt seem to matter.

Read about this guy and you will know who is he

PC only, obviously

Some hacks are too easy, would be fun if they got mass publicity. They been since launch and are still in the game, tested them just a couple of days ago. They work both in Adventure and Nuclear winter and you need no knowledge in coding. (Ye, it‚Äôs that bad) Not to mention the stuff you can do without injections.
---
Let‚Äôs talk about your password hygiene instead!
---
1.	Use a password manager if you don‚Äôt already; Lastpass is great if you‚Äôre lazy, Bitwarden if you want to self-host or KeePass if you‚Äôre paranoid.
---
2.	Use the longest password possible for whatever account you have
---
3.	Don‚Äôt reuse passwords ever, 1 per account 
---
:)
---
I‚Äôve come across several ‚Äòdealer‚Äô kind of camps that sell nothing but stalker/suppressor/nocturnal stuff, everything was max level with ffr or explosive effects, priced at 15k to 25k, i suspect OP is one of them üí™
---
Order unclear, 10 big fucking holes incoming
---
You are of course welcome to sell your gear at whatever price you deem appropriate.  Ignore people who tell you otherwise.
---
If it's not selling though, you're doing yourself a disservice by not adjusting your prices, and people complaining might have a point.  But, you do you, handle it however you want to.
---
I've personally seen people selling weapons in particular at absolutely ridiculous prices, and I mean mediocre things *at beast*.  I just move on, it's not my job to educate people.
---
Know your market.  I regularly sell items at over 15K caps, though my inventory is a bit dry right now.  Good items will always sell at the proper price.
---
What I'm reading tells me this is some random internet dweller who claims to have leaks but can't verify any of their sources whatsoever.

It was a while ago, basically that was my first camp location from where I moved from just recently. I'll upload my other camps in a second. Why wouldnt they let you build there any more??
---
That‚Äôs quite understandable, in my purge I ended up getting rid of my turrets also and poor old bessy the cow. Of course in my capitalist agenda I had put up a large Nuka Cola sign and the red rocket sign to promote my store
---
No I haven't however the Moutaineers got back to me on Bethesda forums.  I'm waiting to get their Discord info.
---
Seriously, why the fuck did they make it like this?  The rug trick shows that it could obviously be different and more user friendly.  The placement restrictions on camp building can sometimes really suck the joy out of it when you can't do something you should quite obviously be able to do.  Who the fuck cares if she clips or floats??
---
It's great that you have all that stuff. Are you active in the trading community? I think there are two tiers of pricing: one for traders, people who are looking for a specific item or something awesome and are willing to pay a price for that specific item; the second is people who just play the game and are not exposed to the high prices of the first group. If you are vending to the second group you should set your expectations (and prices) accordingly. 
---
If you want to sell this awesome gear you've collected over all those mules, get busy in the trading groups. Gotta have some hustle.
---
&gt;Maybe if he knew a bunch of people at Bethesda and had a close working relationship with the devs and what he was doing was unofficially sanctioned, I could understand that thought.
---
From what I understand and have read, that actually was the case. Remember aten_ra? The guy who got invited to meet Bethesda and help with the direction of the game along with a bunch of other people? He's also a data miner, and I believe he's in the same data mining group as map76 guy. They have a direct line to the community managers, [as aten_ra mentions in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dvfup2/players_are_not_banned_for_reporting_issues_andor/f7cu3jl). They were requested to provide specific details and steps about exploits if they found any.
---
&gt;Did the guy who actually reported the exploit get banned too?
---
Apparently yes. That's what map76.com says.
---
You must be a real blast at parties.
---
Same here.  It let me toggle it in the store when I first got it, but it never actually showed up in game, and now I don't get the interface to equip options in the store.  Annoying that it was bugged out all halloween season.  :/
---
They look pretty interesting, thanks!
---
Thank you for the guide bud! Have you idea if they‚Äòve fixed the ‚Äúlose all your stuff‚Äù bug?
---
I have same issue as OP, and the option to equip it in the store is gone.
---
You can't buy much with caps. I don't even wire my machines up anymore because there's nothing to spend my max caps on. Sounds like you also have no need for caps, why take a moral stance on the cap value of your wares? These days I'm more likely to just give away things or trade for ammo or something I can actually use. Glhf
---
Hueh Hueh, ok Todd Howard
---
See the 'no rumors or leaks without verified evidence' rule. These types of posts should absolutely be removed immediately because they provide nothing of value, even if the poster means well.

2nd party to Bethesda
---
Ah thanks
---
I cook meat. 
---
I sell meat.
---
I get caps.
---
Meat comes from everything. 
---
You cant eat it all.
---
Grahm would be proud.  All the meats.
---
There were threds. I didn't see any proof it was actually in the shop, it was just listed on the atomic shop update news page on beth net.
---
I'll agree with that
---
Keep talking nub, and keep dreaming you could have what I do. You suspect and assume, those are traits of a complete Dumbass. Knowing things is all that matters Sherlock.
---
Unless it's highly desirable weapons really arent worth more than 3-6k. Even at those prices it's rare to find someone really interested in a specific roll.
---
Just cause you believe something's worth so much doesnt make it so.
---
It must had been my lucky day!
---
The incel is strong with this one.
---
Judging by your response you're either a troll, a immature child, or an emotionally unstable adult. Honestly no matter what response you get if it doesnt coincide with you want you're going to throw a fit and resort to foul language and belittlement to try to win other simpleminded people to your side
---
Probably when they figure out how to make it make them more money.
---
I keep a low level automatic on me just to tag things at Uranium fever / Whitespring / etc (vanilla Tesla‚Äôs are great for this)
---
You need to use it hundreds of times before you get flagged. Finding and then to pinpoint the trigger for the exploit can take hours depending on the process.
---
But yea, he could also just be using his position as known ‚Äùtester‚Äù to exploit for his own benefit.
---
I never said we need more pistols. I said we need an perkfor AP and also that dual wielding would be cool.
---
From the September 26 [Inside the Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again):
---
&gt; **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** ‚Äì Account security is very important to us, and we know it‚Äôs critical to you, as well. The wonderful Bethesda.net team has been working hard to get MFA implemented for Bethesda.net. They are very close and are planning to have this enabled by the end of this year.
---
Unless this feature is also delayed to next year, I would expect it in patch 15, assuming that is the last major patch before the end of 2019.
---
No, for the chameleon armor effect to work, you only need 1 peice. 
---
If you are looking for the chameleon mutation you need weightless armor, and will need a full set.
---
Legit LoL'd. Updoots for you.
---
Yep, I've brought this up numerous times since I bought the West Virginia billboard months ago. I have no idea why they cost so much compared to lighting, but they are ridiculously budget heavy and not at all worth the atoms. 
---
Frankly I felt ripped off after I bought it and they didn't even respond to criticism pointing out what a crappy purchase it is. It seems like they have no plans to change this item, or even tell people how much budget it uses before they buy it.
---
Yeah Fallout 1st has certainly soured a lot of good will towards Bethesda
---
You are missing the point. Other weapon categories have perks that allow them to Pierce DR. That makes them objectively better.
---
The phenomenon you are seeing is because of the order you equip the perk cards, one way yeilds the extra sneak attack damage with Mr sandman. Ninja stacks with covert operative on every unarmed weapon except the meat hook, another fun quirk of the game since the card says its only for ranged
---
On Pc me and my friends find people that do this all the time, my friend calls them "Bush Chickens". We are all almost 75-100, so we have been playing for a while and its surprising really how many there are. We hack terminals and hunt down people rather then waiting. So we find a lot of people just siting there. We will stab them, beat them with hammers and they just sit there staring blankly. Some even have loot, but just stop and freeze.  Oh well, more Xp and less risk for us I guess. Still weird though....Dang Bush Chickens.
---
Aww how cute...they didn't like what was said, truth hurts...downvotes are enough proof of striking that nerve I was aiming for.
---
Cheating, duping, and the ability to buy Scrip items for caps. 
---
PC can't be a part of this until Beth gets their act together.
---
If Bethesda suddenly wipes all duped bs, will your mules finally be able to sprint? üòÇ
---
wanna sell it lol
---
I main an Instigating Lever Action so I try to squeeze the most damage I can get out the perks. I have the 3 Rifleman perks (Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, Master Rifleman), Bloody Mess, and then Tank killer/Glow Sight switch out if I am/am not going to Uranium Fever/nuked White Springs and Cover Operative/Adrenaline if I am slowly sniping an area or run and gunning with the LA
---
Where there's a will, there's a way. I'll be trying it sometime.
---
I just go full on arms dealer when I‚Äôm a bit strapped. Go around killing higher level super mutants and selling their assault rifles. Not the most efficient, but the most fun for me.
---
Contractor perk does not affect budget. **Nothing** in this game affects budget, it cannot be increased by any means whatsoever. This has been tested repeatedly and there have been many posts about it, and it's unfortunate that some folks still think there are ways to increase it and spread misinformation (not to say you're doing it on purpose).
---
There is not a single shred of evidence out there to support budget increases and Bethesda has never confirmed the existence of a way to increase budget.
---
I like the idea behind FO1st.  I have it, it helps and i love the endless stash.
---
Im conflicted. I dont know if I would play NW without premades, as I play pretty much exclusively with friends. Yet I see your point if you dont have any who play NW. Mabe multiple lobbies? As if the community was not split already lol I just do not think that is viable.
---
STRAPLESS BRAS
---
They're impractical as FUCK but some of the [in-game](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/8/82/FO76_Swimsuit_Female.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/242?cb=20190119103336) and [Atom Shop outfits](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/fallout_gamepedia/9/91/Atx_apparel_outfit_flapperdress_c3.png) have bra straps sticking out mucking everything up and I hate it.
---
Also they should do a cute "branded" set, everyone loves Nuka branded stuff!
---
I've made 200k+ selling stimpaks for 15c, bulk junk for very little, and assorted flux for 100c, I used to trade valuable weapons and armor but the amount of time it took to find an interested buyer at my pricepoint wasn't worth it to me tbh.
---
It isn't hard to sell stuff to new and casual players. If you are not happy with your sales I would discount them 5% for every 2-3 days they do not sell. If it has been a month vault the item until you rotate stock. Finally, you can always sell at the fallout market (Discord works faster) to get a better cap for your item price (unless you are banned or something you should get set up there).
---
If this is just a complain/bragg then please disregard my info.
---
I have several camps and none of them have had the problem you're describing. If this was a real issue there would be countless threads getting upvoted.
---
It's likely you either experienced a bug or you had a specific item or two you placed awhile ago and whose budget was tweaked. But straight-up reduction of camp budget, definitely not.
---
I wish the Nukes would just nuke their servers and put the shit game out of its misery
---
Probably android
---
Necessary
---
Why was it removed?
---
Dunno.
---
More likely- Customer Service has been getting people filing tickets giving them shit about it and they had the CMs make a statement about it.
---
Everything Juice Head releases about 76 is straight up garbage.
---
the only time i ever touch the mode is when im premade with my friends.  why should i mot be allowed to team up with my friends, seems like a game mode killing move.
---
The outfit he's wearing. It's got a big fishbowl for a helmet and wouldn't look right without it.
---
Yeah after watching juices video I found I actually felt less sympathy for the f76 map guy. 
---
At the end of the day unless you are sanctioned to use cheating tools too test vulnerabilities then you're taking risks - especially if you aren't doing this on an alt. 
---
Bethesdas response that people are not being banned for one off uses of these cheats/exploits makes me wonder if the permanent ban came when they found there was actually more than just the testing use of the exploits but who knows?
---
I had no interest in Berzerkers weapons until I read your comment.
---
In the Halloween update they filled in the hole above the cave and made the top part the entrance to a vault. 76 or 79 or something. The passcode is 000000. You can't place a camp there anymore üòï
---
I wouldn't think the person who was banned would report the exploit if he/she was actively using it beyond testing, that wouldn't make sense.
---
So was that the problem with your damage decrease?  I couldn't figure out mine because I had moved some special points to accommodate my current build.
---
Yes basically, as a former WoW player, premades are groups who are made prior to an event rather then relying on random selection. Typically they attract better players as they are normally the ones who make them, this also make the groups far more deadly. In pvp on wow, going up against a premade was....pretty much a insta loss. Not always but it was always a fear when queuing into pvp. Then again a premade on wow could be as many as 40 players in one group so meh...
---
There is a youtube creator, gamermomover50, that has lots of camp videos with locations too.
---
Hey Comrad!  Bring your tank yet?
---
Are we still talking about Fallout 76?
---
Oh shit. Nah man it‚Äôs in the shop right now. Sorry for inconvenience :))
---
I had just started reading and my phone refreshed the page for some dumb reason and it was gone, just like a legendary corpse after you kill it
---
That‚Äôs the spirit!  I‚Äôll be trying as well.
---
It‚Äôs easy, just shoot the area around the Legendaries and the splash damage will tag them for you. If you use vats all the pellets will probably land on the mole bosses and they die fast.
---
Imagine if Bethesda stoped nerfing spots to nuke so we could actually nuke anywhere we want.
---
Let‚Äôs just clarify something: I‚Äôm belittling you because I referred to a mechanic as ‚Äúfucking garbage‚Äù? That‚Äôs ‚Äútoo inappropriate‚Äù for you?
---
But you‚Äôre not belittling me by telling me to go play another game if I have issues with these mechanics?
---
And you have the audacity to attack **my** character???
---
Sounds like you have some personal issues to resolve and took my response far too personally. I wish you all the best.
---
1 - Open "C:\\users\\&lt;Your Username&gt;\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout76\\Fallout76prefs.ini"
---
2 - Find (Ctrl+F to search) or Add the line under \[Display\] that starts with "iPresentInterval="
---
3 - to Unlock your FPS, change it from "iPresentInterval=1" to "iPresentInterval=0".
---
4 - Save the file and reload the game. You can also make this file "read only" by right clicking, going to properties, and checking that box to prevent future changes.
---
5 - Download a program like [RivaTuner](https://www.guru3d.com/content-page/rivatuner.html) and look up how to lock a program to a certain FPS. If you do not do this, your character will become locked into place randomly when your FPS gets too high (the game things you're cheating). I suggest 120hz as a good place to lock your FPS at.
---
Been doing this for ages, game runs buttery smooth at 120 fps.
---
Maybe he can use all that awesome loot he's sitting on to get a girl
---
Link works fine from my end.
---
I'm with you all up until the last bit. People buy crappy legendaries for scrip all the time on console. 
---
Having PC players engaging in any form of PvP against console players would be horrendously unfair though.
---
i feel its like the early dirty harry movies.  it's vigilante justice(/hacking) -- some ppl are cool with it and some aren't.  i personally am not sure as i can see the arguments from both sides.
---
the real test will be whether fo76 actually does fix its prob's with more speed and alacrity than it had until this point.  if they are using their (newfound) resources to go after ppl instead of fixing problems, then all the criticisms are justified.
---
I have enough points in cha to share MP with team. You CAN share a higher tier perk card if on team of three (1 or 2) higher depending on MP being shared. This is fact. The problem is that after 30 seconds this goes away. It use to stay at higher levels but no more. This is broken
---
No I‚Äôm not getting my sneak multipliers at all.
---
So this means people have found an actual use for the broadsider in the game!
---
Mate.. I'm all for wishful thinking but the game barely works as is regarding nukes, I don't think the engine could handle anything close to what you're saying
---
You ever co wider the window shoppers don‚Äôt buy anything because you don‚Äôt have anything that interest them?
---
I t works not but wasn't earlier...don't know why.
---
I think cross play with XB1 would be cool, especially from a trading perspective. Of course I don't want anything to do with PC players until Bethesda manages to at least ramp down the rampant cheating and exploits through cheat engines and other 3rd party software.
---
Battle of epic proportions....just not right now though.   Side note...im on PC and rarely get disconnected.  Desktop pops up every once in a while but thats because im too lazy to change my settings.  Arent you on PC?
---
You're probably thinking of the Chameleon mutation... you have to be unarmored or wearing Weightless armor only. 1 piece of Chameleon armor gives you that Predator invisible look when crouching, it adds a little bit to sneak bonus and players cant VATS you if you're doing pvp
---
Yessss!!! 
---
The assets exist (see fixtures in the Vault), give me a sink/shower/toilet that doesn't look like total garbage! :(
---
Ps4 mate
---
That would be bad ass
---
More world bosses that are fun, rewarding, and engaging. Give us a reason to do things.
---
I like it in agl for NW
---
Exactly. Im super close to crafting strangler heart, and im loving the raids so far. The nightly runs with a good group of friends is a blast. Problem is, when i craft strangler heart, im done. Im out. Im not gonna do another raid because whats the point? I really want 96 so i can have some more raid content.
---
It also has a super cool concept (an animal cryo facility) and i really want to see how it fleshes out. What a shame it hasnt been released yet.
---
True or not, the fact players are prepared to believe this shows very clearly how little trust remains in your company.  One-time fans of Bethesda would put nothing past you.  Rumours that the devil himself had been made CEO, or that the next Fallout 76 expansion would be a mechanism for harvesting gamers immortal souls, would probably be believed.  
---
In a world where companies can be crushed by a deluge of malicious fake news, consumer trust and confidence is your only defence; the hope that when you do a press release or post on Reddit saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not evil‚Äù, people will be prepared to believe you.  This is the precious commodity you have relentlessly chosen to sell off.
---
The good news is you can buy consumer confidence back; the bad news is my confidence as a consumer is switching to an exciting new premium live service model. I‚Äôm prepared to believe whatever you say for the low price of ¬£11.99 / $13 per month.
---
Stumped...sneak, sandman, then covert op?
---
I look at the 'supporter' bans this way: if you find a loophole in manslaughter laws and you murder someone just to prove the loophole exists, should you go to jail?
---
If you know something is exploitable and want to report it, do NOT test the exploit! Just report it.
---
I‚Äôve tested this with full set unyielding, grape mentats and 9 in Charisma, the sell price is capped at 500 and won‚Äôt go higher. So are other items, capped at 1/4 of the ‚Äòvalue‚Äô number. If there‚Äôs a way to sell higher I‚Äôd love to know.
---
Sharing perks using "temporary" buffs is sketchy.  Unyielding, Magnetic Personality, chems, etc are all temporary. Even the slightest change in whatever the criteria is (someone leaves/joins the team, you gain health, etc) can throw it off and cause it to reset.
---
Bullshit. As a long time modder I agree with everything he said in that video and the last. What used to be just friendly Beth interaction has become "cheating" because this is an online multiplayer game, and that has horribly soured the relaitonship that used to exist.
---
That could be, where did you find that out?
---
Ah, thats why then....i hate consoles, too limited
---
Well, they haven't been clear or direct with the playerbase at all.
---
**CANVAS BAGS!** ^not ^actually ^made ^of ^canvas
---
I‚Äôm not gonna argue for or against console / PC. I just feel at home on ps
---
Everyone was saying the scrap box deleted its contents. It didn't, it was a visual bug.
---
Everyone was saying private worlds were recycled servers. They aren't, loot just remains character bound and the a player's server stays up for 5 minutes after being emptied.
---
Everyone said Fallout First was $100. They frequently failed to mention any other price  point implying it was the only one. It's $13 a month, cheaper than ESO Plus.
---
Everyone said players were griefing First subscribers. You can't grief players since Survival mode is gone. They can only enter combat if you have a bounty, are in a workshop or you willingly engage them.
---
The Outrage‚Ñ¢ isn't meant to be right, it's meant to be righteous.

Just making the border visible in some way would be a huge QOL update imo
---
Yep
---
I want banana hammocks and open t-shirts and blue star tattoos so I can RP the pervert cyborg Frankie
---
You can change your displayed name every 3 months in Bethesda.net. I didn't know that either.
---
Juicehead takes 14 minutes to tell you something that could take 2. Often repeats what he has already said in previous videos. Other than that he is one of the better ones. If you like 76 I suggest Final Render. He wont talk about the more contentious issues with 76 but some of his builds and gameplay videos are excellent.
---
I killed a couple robots around there yesterday, And I wasnt noticing the xp bar increasing..? maybe something was just glitching though..?
---
Obviously you don‚Äôt run in teams. Let me try to explain this in layman‚Äôs terms. If i have 3+ cha i can share a perk card. If i share a level one MP in a team of three then everyone in that team can share one rank higher card because they too have The benefits of MP. If I share a level 2 MP everyone on team can share a two level higher card( as in a 5 level adren) with only 9 cha. This is how it was intended to be.  This does work like it should but only for 30 seconds or so. Don‚Äôt believe me, get some friends and try.
---
has anyone actually reported something they thought was an exploit? the typical response is to provide recreation steps, ie something you would only know if you actually did it
---
Controller is nice, ergonomic.
---
Tru
---
May do that. And if 1971 is your birth year, we're just a year apart. Middle-aged nuke droppers for the win!
---
My comment was directed more towards PVP. I would also agree that PVE exploits would have damaging affects when it comes to trading and the game economy if PC players were filtered into any potential cross play populace.
---
The defenders of Bethesda must subscribe to the Amy Wong school of getting fooled.  "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me 7 or more times, shame on me."
---
How many times does a company have to burn you before you realize they are shit?
---
The game released with a subscription (like WoW) which they later made into Eso+. Dlc‚Äôs are still included, they actually go under that name, and chapters are expansions. (Yes, people were not happy with this ‚Äùloophole‚Äù, but trust me it‚Äôs coming to fo76 aswell)
---
Gotta argue about something...c'mon man im bored.  I live off of caffeine and hate
---
I saw him to!! i took a photo of him (he also wears a pirate hat) with my prosnap!
---
Apparently the full story is the guy who got banned thinks he may have forgotten to drop a glitched gun, as well as his friend reported the bug(he felt he didn't also need to report it) meaning all they saw was a guy who used a glitch to acquire this gun, and thats why he was banned.
---
Double stacking with unarmed + 1h perk cards you mean? No, but the base damage and lack of armor pen is so much less than the base damage of a power fist or DC gaunt that it's still inferior.
---
This is why you use a burner account anyways lmao
---
Not saying they should always be trusted.    I'm just not okay with people having the attitude of "Hey, Bethesda lies all the time, so why do I have to be truthful in my reporting about them?"
---
That's an awesome advertisement for stimpacks üòÇ
---
I liked the music, but not the singing üòû
---
He's like MrBossFTW. Dude made a 12 minute video to talk about the legendary catfish saying that it's been found. 
---
In comparison, I read a two paragraph article that went over the same thing. Took maybe a minute and a half.
---
You had it worse than me then :(
---
It sounds like he made an assumption, which by his own admission is a trait of a dumbass.
---
Hate videos make money. Been that way since launch. Channels that usually get 6-10k views suddenly get hundreds of thousands for anti-FO76 vids. Just the casual capitalizing on outrage. It just so happens that FO76 outrage has lasted over a year, which is very odd for any supposedly hated game.
---
using your pizza example, most places will actually just give you your money back if you don‚Äôt like the pizza
---
..... Yes lets ignore all the surrounding context, HE CHEATED!!!! Only 1 fact matters, fuck the fact that he is a community resource tool in a human body for you guys!
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
Yep, it's a common practice. I'll notice it in a lot of games from the same company if you look for it.
---
Lmao try again. Playing since beta. Mules full of god rolls. 1,3 millions caps, 800k+ 556. Caps are useless no one wants them. Keep sitting on the dick you riding. You one of those people that everyone avoids dealing with since they think everything they have is worth everything another person has, but says all other have ‚Äújunk‚Äù.
---
It has been proven that it wasn't a visual bug. Many players reported that they couldn't mod or craft things.
---
You just proved that they are recycled. Where do you think that server goes after 5 minutes being empty? To another playerm it doesn't reset. 
---
It is $100. It is also $13 a month. What's your point?
---
I see it as justified outrage. If you prefer to hide your head in the sand and ignore all the negativ things in this game and Bethesda in general, that's your choice - but others are capable of seeing both rhe good and the bad.
---
There's a bunch near the cabins North East of there that do change. In front of the porches.
---
If you need true f76 news without opinions I go to some YouTubed called gamingmomover50 or something ( can‚Äôt remember the name but it‚Äôs similar )
---
You mark materials using z key when you go to build but don‚Äôt have enough
---
Agreed!  I was just talking to somebody else about this.  If they were smart, they would have done 1st and wastelanders a little differently:
---
1. Launch a new "Fallout Online Plus" service which includes everything that has been 76, but also new and separate worlds.
---
2. Both FO76 and FOP (hah) get the same game-play features (Scrapbox, tents, etc).  FOP gets access to new worlds, and maybe even additional player slots.
---
3. Start with a small map to begin for FOP--maybe port over Nuka world.  Then add to it over time, but leave 76 as the "both worlds" for either account type.
---
&gt;  Bethesda is a company which has to pay its devs and staff, if i have to pay 12.99 a month to help them out ill gladly do so.
---
I think more people would have had this attitude had they waited to release it with Wastelanders. In that case, it would be more like "here's the kind of great content we produce with subscription money."  The way Bethesda did it was more like "Hey, not substantial content in months, how about giving me some money?" 
---
I'm not against Fallout  1st, but I think Bethesda did a poor job of rolling it out.
---
Event: ‚ÄúOne Violent Night‚Äù, ‚ÄúGuided Meditation‚Äù, &amp; ‚ÄúMonster Mash‚Äù events great for farming legendaries.
---
The next time I visit your camp I'll make sure to window shop for an extra minute or so, just to get your hopes up and then leave without buying a thing... Oh, I'll also steal your crops and then use your crafting tables, while I laugh about all the caps I still have.
---
Actually not even that much as you just need to delete everything but ground in the area.
---
You know if you have enough materials by when you highlight what you want to build it will tell you on the right side of the screen what materials and how much are required. You are having trouble making floors probably because you need to build foundations first to put your floors on. As far as decorating with items you find in the world you can only put them in display cases.

The engineering principle of DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - applies to all corners of application and game development, including art and sound. If you have an asset that suits your needs, use it instead of spending additional resources to recreate it.
---
To me, the more negative press and low scores Bethesda receives, the better. Maybe one day they will realize that their actions have consequenced, and they will think twice about making stupid decisions.
---
Is it seperate from the account name??? My understanding was that was both. Also that is a relatively newish thing, took forever to get in.
---
I wish our character names would display.

yes but using exploits is strictly against the rules, regardless of why you claim to use it

You can tell OP is desperate for attention. Posted a few weeks back he was ‚Äúleaving‚Äù till WDLC. But is still in here crying and bitching. Did mom and dad not pay enough attention? Probably? Is he a old ass single man without a family who just lacks comfort and attention? Most likely.

In Uranium Fever I do the 'come here' emote first (with the buggy bloody wheel) then shoot it a bit with a .50 cal &amp; hope like hell it doesn't kill me before everyone comes running :D
---
Yep. Totally worth paying for.. I'm 95% sure I'm canceling my sub unless I hear of anything major within the next week..
---
I have not problem with negative press that is easily verified and unquestionable.  The bugs, the canvas bags, all of that was 100 percent verified and true. The "wrongful bans" are just people making claims that may or may not be true, but are being reported as fact.
---
That is going on because Bethesda is acting so strange, it is beyond stupid even by Bethesda standards. I know I sound harsh but that is not for bashing purpose, I promise, bear with me.  
---
You. Are. Bethesda.
---
You know some guys had been exploiting your game for a year, but you do not ban them.  
---
The guys send you a crucial exploit that possibly leads to account stealing (!!!), and you ban them the next day.  
---
They write you a message instantly, asking what has happened, but you ignore them.  
---
They mention they have worked with community moderators all the time and had reported many bugs and exploits to them. You ignore that.  
---
Community moderators write you a request confirming all that and asking what has happened. You ignore those too.  
---
You keep your silence for a month, giving no info, no explanation, nothing.  
---
Posts emerge on Reddit and bloggers like Yong Yeah and Juice Head start bringing your attention to those people and only then you come with a swift answer of "No, they all lie, we are the good guys".   
---
Now there is me looking at this sequence of decisions and I have to guess if it is just the incompetence alone, which they surely have enough, or is it incompetence with some ill will towards those guys too? And I think its the latter.
---
They're most likely in groups already.
---
A solo NW mode would be fun, but it will divide the NW community and result in even smaller matches.
---
It is still possible to win solo against groups, you just need to know their weaknesses.
---
If they're separated, take them out one-by-one and make sure to actually kill them so that they can't be revived. You can also throw a well-placed grenade when they're close enough to each other. Sometimes, you do want to keep a target down to lure their teammates to try and revive them so that they become easier to kill.
---
I have used all three methods before and they work pretty well depending on the situation.
---
You need to analyze the situation, choose your best option, and take action at the right moment.
---
I personally enjoy [this one](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) a lot.
---
How about a game that actually works?
---
How about something like the little booth thing the whitespring station vendor stands in?
---
No, they have been exaggerated so badly its hard to take it seriously anymore. 
---
You often see people point logical things out and if it isnt ‚Äúfuck bethesda‚Äù theres always comments like ‚Äú you just love to be abused like big bad bethesda is an abusive partner you cant get away from, you must be mentally handicapped if you still play fallout blah blah blah‚Äù
---
 I think the extreme hyperbole attached to all the negative posts has weakened some valid arguments and concerns.
---
I can understand where people are coming from, but theres some cult following out there obsessed with Bethesda Bashing.
---
Sadly it seems to be the max.  
---
Charisma seems to cap at 15 when selling to npc vendors, probably the same for buying too
---
Collect rare clothing. It's what I've been doing for awhile. It is a great cap sink and a fun collecting cycle to get into. On the high end certain outfits will run you 25k, so it'll be awhile before you get em all.
---
Totally agree, I thought it looked cool until I realised its totally useless. Also when I try to place a door on the 'baseless greenhouse dome' the door gets glitched half way up the doorframe, its so stupid but yet again just another mistake by Bethesda.
---
Because I look at the raw code of the exe and can see what they reference in the anti cheat.
---
They're also faster than regular laser guns, but they deal less damage. One of the ultracite mods is still bugged and makes ultracite guns shoot plasma projectiles for some reason.
---
If you look at the whole atom shop update for the last two weeks, there's nothing in general, so it's not surprising we've been getting icons. This week the only new items are a skin for turrets and a wallpaper. Hardly anything to write home about. Hopefully this is a lull after the Halloween push and not how it's going to be until Wastelanders.
---
That's not how it should be done. The assets are done twice, not the map. 
---
Each object and piece of terrain could have two textures, and load one accordingly when placed inside/outside a nuked zone. The secondary texture can be created automatically from the clean one by applying a carefully selected function to alter the colors...
---
No there is no armor pen by default.
---
If you want my thoughts on the topic, you can try reading the discussion rather than this diversion. You could have just downvoted and moved on. To think that blurting 'insane ego' 'puts me in my place' reveals your own inflated ego. Not surprised though, in a sub this fluffy an unpopular opinion passes for aggressive and combative.
---
But the model itself is the laser gun model recolored. Sorry, should have been more specific.
---
You saw Charleston in the trailer and thought that's how nuked zones would be? Me too.
---
Good idea. We only recently started trying to acquire the asylum outfits. I suppose you probably can get nearly all of the clothing for caps.
---
Actually, this happens if you're too far from your downed teammate. It was worse before they attempted to fix it.
---
It's been like this since the game was released. For some reason people on here prefer to gravitate towards the negative and would rather keep that train going vs. doing what a rational person would and just stop playing and stop supporting the company. I guess we all need a crusade.
---
You sill have to manually, by hand, copy all the terrain and edit it.
---
Yea i think buying is the same. Selling price is hard-capped at 1/4 of the value of the item, say purified water is valued at 20, i can never sell it for more than 5 caps. Serums have a value number of 2000, thus 500 is the limit no matter what i wear or eat üò´
---
Jokes on you, I actually wanted a BR mode and I enjoy playing NW.
---
I think sleeping extends your allowed idle time by a little bit
---
and an easy vault raid group finder using Radio.
---
I'd probably love my AAE 10mm SMG more if it had a decent sight and suppressor
---
Is it suppose to?
---
You are correct; if my post is misinformation, it's not on purpose.
---
  My method was by no means scientific, it is completely subjective.  The conclusion is based on the results of creating a similar sized structure in the same place with the same features.  The two major variables being character level and one perk which lowers the amount of materials needed to create a feature.
---
I'm just saying the conclusion is right or wrong, just that the end result ( I was able to build more and still have budget space) seems to contradict one line of thought, and support another.
---
But since it is subjective conclusion, perhaps I should have closed with YMMV and all the standard disclaimers.
---
That is true and excellent point...i think for me its just that im not able to play all the time or when i want so if Bethesda wants to delay Wastelanders until its ironed out more then so be it.  I just hope they dont fuck it up too much.
---
Rubber and R3 to the corner of the controller, pulling it down basically. Just plug it into the PS4/usb so it doesn‚Äôt die
---
Yeah that's what I essentially meant with the controller against a wall haha
---
Agreed.
---
Well truthfully there hasn't been much added. We have to wait for Wastelanders which was supposed to launch this month, but is now Q1 2020. Wastelanders is a relaunch of the game basically with NPC humans and new story.
---
I suggested this earlier this year as well. I think it also would be cool to have an 'inverted' ring of fire effect, similar to nuclear winter, that spreads out from the blast instead of collapsing in.
---
Nukes are so non-threatening and utterly non game changing that they're utterly pointless beyond farming certain items.
---
How do you not starve or thirst to death?
---
The bigger issue is that the exploit has been reported and nothing has come of it. That's the most irritating thing that's going on. Nothing. If they would have been patient and released all of the content they plan on, along with being relatively bug-free, I believe the community would be content with FO1. But after a broken launch, the merchandise fiasco, and now a subscription for a still incomplete game has pushed too much too quickly. 
---
TLDR; Lots of mistakes in a short time is very, very annoying.
---
There is actually a tutorial quest when you arrive Morgantown via main-story but it‚Äôs not the helpful. 
---
I would recommended a spot in the Forrest region where enemies aren‚Äôt that disturbing. There are ‚ÄûRessource deposits‚Äú all over the world. If you establish your camp in its vincinity, you are able to build a Ressource extractor to gather that resources. 
---
If you search reddit or google, you will find a map with all nodes.
---
So for the beginning, use a steel deposit with water nearby to purify. Wood and even concrete is easy to find in the world or in a workshop. 
---
Build a camp if you like it, evolve it or move to another spot later if you wish too. Or skip the whole feature. It‚Äôs up to you.
---
Nothing really new, it was similar a year ago with the stories about people getting banned for mods, or even for crafting or playing too much.
---
Last time this was brought up someone suggested a laser sight and now I really want one.
---
Welcome to fallout 76
---
7 chr and hard bargin leaves you with 50 caps left in vendor IIRC.
---
Have you got the backpack? The Pioneer scouts challenges will give you a very useful backpack that actually adds extra carry weight.
---
Other then that the endgame is extremely empty at times.
---
Yes scraping stuff gives you materials to build.
---
You can put your camp anywhere, but a flat place is probably better to start with.
---
Foundations have to be put down first, stairs will attach to foundations and upper floors will only attach to stairs.
---
Things found in the world are scrap. But you can find plans to build things out of scrap like furniture. Not everything comes from the atomic shop. Some world items can be put in display cases for fun.
---
Making and moving camps is part of the fun, play around with it. And maybe watch some simple building videos on YouTube.
---
You are not an intelligent person are you?
---
tortuga is the spanish for turtle xd
---
haha this is stupid i cant do the nw halloween thing
---
Then leave lol.
---
Same! I also have a Commando Stealth build and an AAE 10mm SMG but it‚Äôs impossible to hit anything accurately without going into VATS.
---
Yes, check out previous fallout games.
---
photo mode and something to keep a key pressed down (I use an old shell casing)
---
Happy go camper. Slows down hunger and thirst. Plus I don‚Äôt think you can actually die from it. I‚Äôve been afk for a day straight and I was starving and dehydrated. Very low health, but never died
---
I'd consider myself around average intelligence. Do you have any particular rebuttal, or is that all?
---
I guess bethesda burns people differently, because i dont feel that they burned me at all.  It is hard for me to jump on the hate wagon towards a game im highly addicted to.  To each their own though
---
Same Answer , Pal
---
And then walk over to the power station and get some adhesive from the anglers and check the train station bot stop to get some more super mutants, cash in any junk legendaries, get more junk legendaries, then walk up the road to Boomer and get some blast grenades and possibly some strangler blooms and a hermit crab. It's my daily routine lol.
---
I don't think they have the option, seems they were already banned because they can't even play a video game without cheating.
---
starve and thirst will only take you to 1 HP it will not kill you. Some creative wall/door placement will make it harder for griefers to pull mobs to you
---
Why?  when they can throw a extra paywall in .
---
What if I enjoy playing the game?
---
Try the green hood its a nice match
---
Lol doesn't sound like it.
---
{-}7
---
What did I omit?
---
So Bethesda is lying about Wastelanders, since they are omitting a lot about it. Have they be lying to us for the past 2 weeks since they omitted every thing (no contact).
---
What the hell are you talking about?
---
Instead of using a powerful tesla, just use a weak one and shoot everything at your heart's content. I do this and it still gives everyone in the event a good chance of tagging every mob. If everyone used this method, events like Uranium Fever would be going smoothly.
---
Other good weapons to use are weak explosive shotguns while using the Enforcer perk so that you can cripple everything and still let everyone get a chance to tag mobs.
---
I don't know what to say to someone who was caught cheating then attacks  a company because they were banned for cheating.
---
They're probably too busy working on Wastelanders to drop anything of significant size. 
---
I suggest playing Subnautica if you're bored with FO76 : D
---
You don't. You make a list of all textures, load them, apply a function, save the result as a new file with a *_charred* suffix to its name. I can write it for you in Python if you don't believe it. That's literally part of my job.
---
How does it not? Because I acknowledge that the game has critical flaws that need to be addressed?   
---
Do I need to insist that it is the greatest game ever made to be allowed to play it?
---
Right and I think the whole point he is upset is the fact that Bethesda is unwilling to unban him, even though he probably has ample proof he isn't just some random guy lieing through is teeth to get away with exploiting.
---
They enjoyed being able to cheat is all. And whining, OP like whining.
---
Juicehead seems to go back and forth. He had been posting some BS content a long while back that made me think he was a simpleton trying to get clicks like so many 'content creators', but then I saw a few videos in which he seemed to be taking reasonable positions. I ended up subscribing and liked what I saw. 
---
But now it seems like he's tipping again, because yesterday's video is accepting hearsay, oversimplifying what happened with Undefined by lumping him in as part of a 'group' that reported the exploit (no, the group as a whole did not report it, individuals did and Undefined was not one of them), and then we can see this new video has a very, VERY clickbait title/image. It looks just like something Yongyea would create and that guy is one of the absolute worst when it comes to investigative journalism, nuanced views, and analysis in general. He just regurgitates whatever he can quickly find, most of it coming from reddit and such.
---
Frankly, I think Juicehead has been upset since the FO1st sub released, and now he's back to catering to dullards who can't think for themselves with easymode outrage content. He made a few good points about the CS situation at Bethesda, but overall the video seems like a jerk-off. 
---
I just unsubscribed so thanks for the heads up, as I don't regularly check content like this.
---
Yep :)
---
Oh, fuck, you can't read. My bad dude.
---
They don't need to give stuff away now. After 1st, they probably think people will buy anything and everything from now on.
---
If it's a short time I play instruments.  If its a long time I rubber band the stick and run into a corner.
---
ah another Karma bandwagoner!
---
Yeah, in previous Fallout games it was literally your typical tactical suppressor capable smg. There‚Äôs even a unique variant in New Vegas called ‚ÄúSleepy Time‚Äù that comes stock with a suppressor.
---
Yeah I do think it should accept regular laser gun paints.
---
Dude you said it's a shit show and bethesda should burn, how can that be misinterpreted lol.
---
And it should be a pistol and not rifle spec item :)
---
You're absolutely right, I totally forgot about WoW which I've played with addons.  But that's still an outlier.  Even in the world of MMOs I think of GW2 or DDO or several others and they will ban you in a heartbeat if they detect you are modifying the game files or data stream.  Of note, WoW provides an API for the addons, but most of the other gaming companies do not.
---
After playing almost a year of fo76, I don‚Äôt really base anything off other fallout games.
---
Send a screenshot of the completed challenges and an explanation to Bethesda and they will give you the atoms for the bugged challenges. They did it for me last week.
---
What does this sentence mean?   
---
Slow down. Think about the words you're typing.
---
If you go to any train station, there should be a wall with several posters on it.  Interact with them and you can start several DLC questlines.
---
Aside from those, they've added several new events like Project Paradise, Encryptid, Campfire Tales, and Free Range.  There are also vault raids for higher level players, or Nuclear Winter if you're into battle royale.  
---
Not much else has really been added aside from quality of life features like vendors and the Purveyor, the endgame is mostly just legendary farming and trading.
---
Yup, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre hoping we don‚Äôt notice the silent guiding hand of shareholders wanting more return out of the investment to produce this game.
---
Every aspect of this game will now be focused on monetization and driving the playerbase to get F1st‚Äôed.
---
Realistically, absolutely since it fires a pistol caliber. But I‚Äôve dedicated too many points into Perception and Commando for them to change it now, lol.
---
I‚Äôm not saying they shouldn‚Äôt just pointing out the obvious dip shit
---
Idk what this persons issue is, attack a game, attack the company that made it but says they enjoy it and wants to be able to use tbird party cheats to play, this is a rather funny specimen.
---
That event ended already..
---
Funny thing is, I don't cheat, and I'm not banned, on any of my accounts.   
---
Are you alright?
---
oh
---
They literally are different guns they have the same models just different but they are different
---
Where are you getting that from? And who is "they all".
---
Please no. It HAS to come polished. This is the only chance they have to attract players who have left due to bugs or the fact that this is not Fallout 5.
---
Please, provide evidence to me expressing a desire to cheat, in any way, at all.   
---
How have you STILL not managed to read the title of this post?
---
I know I‚Äôm talking technically they literally different guns with the same model
---
3 star broadsiders with weight reduction are worth a good pile of caps to a CAMP person.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Preach on.  Should be a weapon like meat hook that can be impacted by both pistol and rifle perks!
---
It is a shit show. The game, as I said before, is plagued with issues, not to mention it's monetization/development/management/etc.   
---
That doesn't mean you can't have fun playing it. Does this make sense to you?
---
Prolly the best skin over just a boring solid gold haha
---
YES! this is why we take the loyalty oath. Pledge your allegiance or risk downvotes
---
They advertised it as such but it was just a disappointment as usual
---
Then what is the point of putting out a PSA of something that every knows and then ranting and trashing Bethesda immediately after?  What are you attempting to accomplish?
---
Recycled doesn‚Äôt quite mean what you think it does in this context.
---
They have some stupid checks and balances system, I'm sure they think it's clever. Devs, Zeni Management, and Beth Support. Each has their territory and final say over thier piece. Support banned the people, Devs can't save them.
---
Great analogy...  its that simple.
---
Fuck, I forgot.
---
I mean yeah, it kind of does. Its just how you worded it man. You come off really bad in that post.
---
i'm only here because it was cross posted to r/gaming
---
Whats happening?
---
I think it's the fact he exploited and didn't report the findings. They gave him plenty of time to do so. It was two days between him exploiting several times and him getting banned
---
To confuse you. That's the sole reason, to confuse the absolute fuck out of your apparently underdeveloped mind.   
---
I can rest easy now.
---
&gt; Everyone was saying the scrap box deleted its contents. It didn't, it was a visual bug.
---
&gt;Everyone was saying private worlds were recycled servers. They aren't, loot just remains character bound and the a player's server stays up for 5 minutes after being emptied.
---
That is a private instance, not private server. A private server is persistent.
---
&gt;Everyone said Fallout First was $100. They frequently failed to mention any other price point implying it was the only one. It's $13 a month, cheaper than ESO Plus.
---
Everyone stated that it was $100 **a year**, and the funny part? Its a LOT more expensive bought at $13 a month. Imagine buying a full priced triple A game, and being told quality of life updates from now on are going to be locked behind a paywall having you pay twice the original cost of the game per year.
---
&gt;Everyone said players were griefing First subscribers. You can't grief players since Survival mode is gone. They can only enter combat if you have a bounty, are in a workshop or you willingly engage them.
---
I haven't seen videos of it, but I saw more than one person at the start of the sub service claim they were being mobbed by others and unable to do much unless they server hopped.
---
The mental gymnastics I'm watching you guys perform is fascinating.
---
&gt;I'm sure your response will be "but Bethesda wasn't doing anything."
---
 But Bethesda wasn't doing anything. &lt;- just for fun
---
Re-releasing survival mode as a totally different mode that is similar to games such as DayZ, Ark, and Rust that has no permanent character progression and no legendary items would be nice.
---
Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen before Wastelanders because I believe the people who worked on NW are now working on Wastelanders.
---
the cooking and armor station noises are the exact same from Skyrim
---
How do you know its exploitable without testing it?
---
I drop in between. Clubhouse and hotel. Shouldn‚Äôt go farther than road between grounds and white springs station
---
People have mentioned that servers play a part in whether three stars actually drop three stars and I think the same is true of event drops- I‚Äôve managed to string One Violent Night out for 20 minutes twice in the last week and one was a legendary-palooza and the other was a snooze feat where nothing happened when the music was off and even when ghoul mobs struck I got no legendaries but the end one (which was at least actually three stars.
---
Hol' up.   
---
Are you implying that, even if I your interpretation of how I felt was accurate, that I am "bad", in a moral sense? It's a god damn video game, my guy.
---
Sleeping or sitting in a chair is supposed to make the time before DC longer.
---
He's not saying this in favor of map76 guy, he's saying it against him
---
I think it means you like whining.
---
Enlighten me.
---
&gt;No, they have been exaggerated so badly its hard to take it seriously anymore.
---
No, you are using it as an excuse as you would rather go back to your hidey hole not caring about the fact that you are supporting such a fucking terrible company now. But you can't because people won't shut up about it, and you are willing to go as far as to claim its hard to take it seriously so you can feel confident other people will agree with your reasoning for mentally dismissing the argument.
---
This. Some outrage is justified. Fallout First is clunky, underbaked at launch, doesn't have near the backlog as ESO DLCs/Crown Store, and was launched at the most tone deaf possible time.
---
But it's not the worst of the game industry. Not by a long shot. Current front runner; https://youtu.be/VPIw-REVbBY When Bethesda actively threatens the livelihood of 800 people for the sake of meeting shareholder quotas, I'll start throwing bricks.
---
Why Oogtar smash but Oogtar no smash?
---
Dude I can‚Äôt friggin wait! And the perks for energy weapons to come with it! :)
---
I was one of the players effected. The 4 of us are in a discord that includes the community managers and juicehead as well so he got the info straight from us. We do find and report exploits and the ways to perform them as well as info from the memory of the game to give the developers a better chance of finding what is broken. We've been doing this for months now and reporting everything to the bethesda community managers so Bethesda does know that our group is helping them. The customer support team is a seperate team that doesn't seem to want to give any care as to what we do to help them and during this process the community managers have been hard pressed to get any sort of info from them
---
Do the math bethesda has no good will with people who are positive of this game. Why would we trust them. They only thing i would trust them with is adding more RMTs for things that should be in the game.
---
Fallout 1st shattered a lot of the good faith people in the community had toward Bethesda. Because they went back on promises that were made and haven‚Äôt delivered on others in a year since launch, people are assuming the worst. They have repeatedly demonstrated complete ineptitude when it comes to making this game, setting expectations and communicating with the community. 
---
As a result, whenever anything controversial comes out, people will assume the worst and assume the worst motives possible. While I don‚Äôt think they are some evil corporation hellbent on preying on customers, their actions (or lack thereof) led to this. They made this bed, now they have to lie in it‚Äîor if they were smart, they‚Äôd clean up their mess.
---
Wastelanders adds new Gauss guns. Things like a gauss shotgun or gauss Gatling. They showed concept art at quakecon and discussed it a little bit
---
People believing bad things said about you is the price of a faltering reputation. A lot of criticism for 76 is pure BS, a lot of its totally valid. The problem is Bethesda have damaged their own reputation over time, so casual observers see those with an agenda, like generating clicks, posting rubbish and they think "oh the 2 dollar horse armour, server crashing, character deleting, famous for their bugs, canvas bag guys have fucked up again". A lot of these YouTube type are awful and inaccurate, but they are given plenty of ammo from Bethesda themselves.
---
Good way to equate video game testing to manslaughter, not.
---
What made you think the game would ever be anything but shareholders wanting more profit?
---
There's a bunch of code that exists in the exe to support it, it just looks like it's not totally finished yet
---
You're getting a little deep. Was just saying your post was worded poorly. Nice try turning it though. Never said you're some kind of evil villian lol. Just that you f'd up the wording. You come across as a guy who's in the closet about liking the game, but had to say something mean to fit in.
---
I build a camp in a satellite dish. That was fun.
---
Huh.
---
You don't need a tutorial, it just works.
---
&gt; why is everyone immediately taking the banned parties at their word   
---
Because bethesda is now a known liar and fallout 76 map maker is not a known liar.
---
Usually people that post announcements about getting banned for cheating got caught cheating.
---
Those of us that don't cheat understand that its against the rules, so we don't feel required to tell everyone what we all already know.  Cheating gets you banned.
---
It's not surprising that you saw things that seemed like they could influence budget. I went through the same thing last year, and I think it's partly because how budget works isn't exactly transparent, and partly because it seems intuitive that there would be some way to increase budget (and I still don't know why Bethesda didn't implement something gameplay-driven like level or perk cards to increase it).
---
But yea, at the end of the day it's a pursuit leading to disappointment. :P
---
The misinformation thing isn't something that makes me think less of you, like I said it happens to many of us. It's just a bit of a raw point for me because a lot of people used to absolutely *insist* that you could raise budget, and continued to willfully spread misinformation for months and months until Bethesda finally made a post that basically confirmed that budget did not increase. So whenever I spot new arguments cropping up that support the idea of budget increase I have to take a deep sigh haha.
---
As far as what you noticed with your budget, that is likely due to either bugs or something else that you didn't account for, like maybe you used fewer foundation pieces or lights or turrets or any of the other things that are higher budget. In my experience that will explain the majority of changes people see.
---
You call people lazy and broke like this is real life. Sounds like you're the one who is lazy if you have all this time to play a game.
---
There are sinks currently in the files for atom shop content
---
Do a chargeback on it.
---
Please don't project your insecurities onto me, if you don't mind. I have no desire to "fit in" with strangers from reddit.   
---
Also, I didn't try to turn anything. Words mean things. I suggest understanding what you're saying before you say it. It's an especially good habit to develop in real life communications. Try it out for a while, and you'll be surprised by the results.
---
Forgot to mention this. Yes, we did the tadpole challenges but, the 2nd tier of challenges seemed like such a grind. I guess it's worth getting done now prior to the launch of Wastelanders. Thanks for the response and the reminder.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
three weeklong holiday events with camp and cosmetic rewards (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
Comprehension of the english vernacular is required to engage in dictable debate with others over a text based social medium.
---
Except its been proven the stash is pointless and a money grab as junk can be infinitely stacked, as the stack is just 1 item in your inventory with a number attached allowing you to pull from it and "create" more.
---
I would be silent right now, but its the fact that they want you to pay $13 for such shitty services. If they were worth paying for the game over twice a year then cool beans. But they aren't.
---
I have 10 characters across 2 XB's, I have them strategically placed so I can fast travel for free ..  there are so many cool spots ..
---
Map76 had literally everything using datamined content from the files. Think mapallachia but as an interactive map
---
Why? Because they gave us a half made broken game and expect us to continue to fund it to make it do many things we would expect as responsible and common sense idea.
---
He's not kidding, it stinks. I thought at the very least, the smaller neon variants would take up less budget. No, they seem to eat the same amount as the larger variant. I'm refraining on using my Slocum Joe's one until they make an adjustment. Can't justify deleting so many things for one object... Would be really nice if we could preview budget cost for each item just to get an idea.
---
They eventually gave me a refund, but only after it escalated over their escalations department.
---
I use a handmade because of this. I been waiting for months for them to fix it. But we aren't getting fixes because everyone is working on Wastlanders. üòí
---
Can always count on a responders when your stuck at work
---
Sorry. I assumed that we were all adults here, and that at least the majority of us weren't suffering from developmental/cognitive disabilities. 
---
1. I don't cheat
---
2. I'm not banned
---
The title was a joke, at the expense of individuals who have been banned for using third party cheating software.
---
I just dont think we should be so sensitive about when it gets released.  This is a service that I have been waiting for and I am glad it is already out instead of waiting another season.  I dont understand why it would have been fine to release it with wastelanders but not ok to release it 4 months ahead.  Nothing against you at all, but generally speaking that seems petty.     
---
I was never under any delusion that this was going to be free service.  I never felt lied to.
---
Pick one: no cheats or masses of toxic kids
---
Great to hear.  :)
---
I have one that does bonus dmg to animals that is great for events, but yea no sights or other attachments keep it from being a favorite weapon
---
You are truly special.
---
Great post O.P.!
---
All this is the result of two things:
---
1. The fact that certain kinds of people *love* to see a car crash
---
2. The fact that certain kinds of people just feed off of other people's attention.  
---
The people in Group 2 will manufacture controversy for the people in group 1.
---
The fact that we have these kinds of people is why everyone's traffic slows down at any car crash on the other side of the road.  It's why the evening news is filled with car crashed and chases instead of actual news.  It's why TyrHard YouTubers can continue to exist.
---
And it's why this forum is filled with manufactured controversy about Bethesda.  This forum has 200K members.  The head mods *know* that controversy, manufactured or real, makes for page views.  So they create rules that purposefully look away from obvious bullshit and, in fact allow it to propagate here - and the forum grows - and so does the bullshit and the number of TryHards along with their alt accounts.No one ever lost money by pandering to the worst of human nature.
---
Now the other big forum , r/fo76FilthyCasuals/, had *only a tenth* of the subscribers of this one however it is filled with fun (and often goofy)  posts about people enjoying the game.  It grows much more slowly than this forum .  Why? Because the people that are in charge of that place have implemented some sensible no-griefing rules that cater to less people but provide much more fun content.
---
tl;dr: This place is this way because the person in charge *wants* it to be this way.
---
The Legendary vendor is AWESOME and something I wish more games would add (looking at you Borderland 3). 
---
I will have to check out more of the new events, I just wish there was a list of all of the stuff. We seem to randomly stumble on a few added quests but, want to make sure we have found all of them.
---
There is a large boat you can build in the Forrest. Underground in the cranberry bog/mire. A few abandoned train cars. The house where sickleman eventually ends up is buildable
---
I'm sure all the Fallout fans wanted a BR mode. Its totally what people expect from Fallout after all.
---
Who would want good dialog, interesting things to farm and so on.
---
Nope!
---
A functioning game and server stability....
---
Sure! $100 please!
---
If you were a developer as you say you would very easily be able to understand. At this point you're being combatative just because your statement is being proven wrong with actual evidence.
---
It is going to happen, but you will need to pay for the space upgrade.
---
I don't think you understand, I'm trying to help you. 
---
Words generally have specific definition/s. When you use a word, if you don't know what the definition of the word is, you might not be expressing the idea that you intend to.

I always liked the ones where people build camps attached to the metal electrical towers
---
Yes, and an edit option, so we can change the skin without having to store it and have to relist everything üôÅ
---
The scorchbeasts' animations are completely different from the dragons'. They don't even have the same number of legs. Everything else is correct though. Also, I'm pretty sure the feral mongrels use the same sound effect as the wolves in skyrim.
---
Edit for line 2. 'The guys send a crucial exploit report. One guy did not report it after one of them did. Said guy had been using the cheat engine and may have had duped items in inventory. That guy gets banned the next day'
---
When you speak on the legitimacy of someones cognitive disciplines you should look at your own vernacular first.
---
You created a post title not indicitive of the content of the post, which was regarding a different topic.
---
You attempted to spew hatred towards Bethesda regarding issues you have with the game, however you did not bring up any of said issues, nor provided any constructive advice on how to overcome said issues.
---
If you were trying to leave feedback like this, then no wonder you get ignored.   
---
"I hate this game its crap" does not fix anything.   Maybe next time you should do something like this: "Bethesda can you please fix the disconnect issue I have when logging into West Tek.  To correct his issue you can do the following:"
---
But instead you just sound like a meathead trying to act smart.
---
They even already have a set precedence of that with ESO. ESO is filled with incentives and price gouging, even the mobile games Blades and Fallout Shelter are like that in some regards. That's just what a Zenimax online game looks like, it's only a question of if you enjoy the games despite all of that
---
No psych fun fact, I skipped to the end like I usually do when someone posts this dudes bullshit and he's still going on about the game he doesn't play.
---
This is important. You can't prove intent, so having that as an acceptable defense gives all hackers a veil of plausible deniability.
---
If that guy can provide a strong case, Bethesda should hear him out, but otherwise it's a precident they should uphold.
---
I agree
---
Its like every game they make is just an newer alpha version of the same game. Some big brain moves there.
---
There would have been a pathway to China by now
---
that's what she said
---
I started again on PC after being level like 120 on Xbox, and now on PC with level 180+ I have never launched a nuke. I will eventually since the scouts require it... but.. meh.. the 'rewards' are not worth the effort  (much like everything else in this game)
---
Lol oh fuck, you're just a hyper-shill. I didn't realize that. 
---
Sorry I made fun of your video game. 
---
Also, "meathead", manlet cuck detected.
---
The thing is he was on an alt, which means he knew this was a possibility, which means people are galvanizing the community against something which was obviously a possibility
---
Wastelanders gives me hope for the future of the game as does the legendary player and major QOL improvement I hope the loadouts are. 
---
I guess looking at other games that bring out substantial DLC multiple times a year I was expecting more. 
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Key Domes, Encrypted (main and side-quests,  Tadpole (Tadpole and Possum), BIV brewing, Raids. Not sure if I missed anything
---
If your metric was the previous state of TSE before the "balance pass/nerf/f\*ckening" of Two-Shot, Explosive, and Explosive Affix (Shotgun-specific,) then sure. You're gonna be dissappointed. They work fine now, but they work *differently*. Up to you if you want to respec or adapt. Both choices are viable, and whatever helps you enjoy your time, I'd go for that.
---
Get the meat perk and the double crafting perk, can't remember the names. Go kill some animals and get the exta meat, then craft for food with chance to double quantity. Glowing meat gives a lot, its not hard to find animals and get lot of caps easily
---
&gt;Theres probably events you havent done, and perhaps a few places you havent discovered 
---
I agree with big time...I try not to FT at all now, walk everywhere. Yeah, it takes time but at all I have is time and I still find the occasional thing that I haven't seen before...or I blew by in my haste!
---
Seems to describe a "WTB" (item and offer price) machine as a compliment the want to sell/vending machines.
---
  I understand the principle.  When I was still trying to make calibrated shocks for  multiple sets of PA, I had a sign posted at my front door stating "I need violet flux"  
---
Had the hope that someone passing through would have extra, find me on the map, and we could work out a deal.   Never happened.
---
A "WTB" machine in camp, if utilized and offer price was agreeable, might reduce grind time for harder to find items.  
---
Conceptually, it would also eliminate the need to hang around your camp waiting for people to visit, and  asking if they have (list) they want to sell, then trying to work something out (potentially difficult if the other person isn't mic'ed), ditto with random encounters in the wastelands.  and avoids exposing your entire inventory to another player, etc.
---
I hope this game goes from 0/10 to 9/10 quality then.
---
I think we can't because if you can farm in your camp you will never go to search and your gameplay can be drastically reduced.. Anyway I want other crops too, yes, but maybe with a secondary long and good quest for unlock them
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had that too. I‚Äôve heard a lot of things: you have to let it fully regen, you need a high luck perk stat, depends on RNG, have to wait for the glowy stuff to go away. I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôll ever know what it is that works best haha.
---
Not like the video is entirely sound in its logic and premises. 
---
Is the only point of this video to try and discredit the voice of those angry?
---
Nice.
---
You dont have to pay for the shitty services though.
---
&gt;In the video he even admits that the guy who was banned performed an exploit (which was bannable). But he was performing the exploit with good intentions, supposedly (good intentions being to make Bethesda aware of it). I'm not dismissing this as a possibility, but why is everyone immediately taking the banned parties at their word?
---
Uhm, the guy who complained about being banned for reporting that exploit had made it clear that he used the exploit to confirm its existence (along with a few others in his group).  
---
He didn't just go and say 'they banned me for reporting'.  
---
So I'm not sure what you're complaining about here.  That the dude was righteously banned?  Except that he wasn't.  There's this thing called 'mens rea'.  And 'zero tolerance' doesn't work in real life - it just leads to bizzare outcomes.
---
Also, they banned this guy *because he reported the exploit*.  How do we know this?  Because other players are using exploits maliciously and getting away with it.  NW is rife with cheaters on PC - cheaters that don't make it easy on Bethesda by pointing out their exploits so they can be patched.
---
He wasn't banned because he used an exploit.  He was banned because when he brought the exploit to BGS' attention he was an an easy target.
---
Your world frightens and confuses me. Ladies and Gentleman of the jury, I'm just a Caveman. I fell in some ice and later got thawed out by your scientists. Your world frightens and confuses me. Sometimes the honking horns of your traffic make me want to get out of my BMW and run off into the hills or whatever. Sometimes when I get a message on my fax machine, did little demons get inside and type it? I don't know. My primitive mind can't grasp these concepts.
---
I dunno why it's so hard to look at facts my guy lol
---
I'm really enjoying you trying to come off as an intellectual. Just a bad post man, it's not a big deal.
---
Throw down a porter potty hop inside and tie ur sticks in opposite directions that's worked for me before.
---
Hopefully they feed us the smaller features like loadouts and Legendary player cards before wastelanders releases to keep us going.
---
No if i break the fucking law to show that it can be broken, i go to jail ! Its justifed, end of story, but hey clickbait get the views and hatemongers keep on hating on a game they dont even fucking care or play !
---
Ok, yeah this I can't argue with. I do agree that the product should at least be stable for all, I'm with you on that point. I too pre-ordered and it's been hard to ignore the stability issue. It's a reason I'm going to try FO1st too. I know atm there's a lot of subs speaking of private world glitches, I'm hoping that it may be easier for devs to isolate problems on these private servers, and then xfer the results into FO76. Hopefully more stable for all.
---
PREACH!!! Take a silver!

When you get downvoted on your cakeday

I've lost hope, 2/10 would be awesome to me üòÇ
---
My first medal...thanks brother, Ad Victoriam!
---
Your repeated attempts to "win" have shown that when you do not understand a thing, you attack it. 
---
I am sorry that you lack the acuity to understand the more elequent side of the English language.  But please, continue to prove my point.
---
So it was a visual bug - still a bug.  
---
And you couldn't get the contents back out.
---
On PC, logging in is handled by the Bethesda.net launcher which saves your login details for a period of time. You login with your Bethesda.net account which does not have 2FA - which is the issue.
---
That's sad, but tru!
---
Seems like there are about 6-8 people whenever it's dropped, it's pretty quick with good rewards so that's keeping it popular
---
Bethesda generally giving a shit about their previous fallout games, mainly.
---
I found a max level junkie‚Äôs, ffr, faster reload handmade in a player‚Äôs vendor for 1700 caps. Thank you, good sir!!
---
Only happens when people don‚Äôt know the market, though.
---
Juice Head's videos can irritate me so much. From the gameplay footage in the background to literally every piece of news,he has a complaint gets so annoying, but he's also the only youtuber I found that posts fallout news. Especially when he goes on rants about cosmetics from Fallout 4 appearing the atomic shop. 
---
Honestly if someone has a better youtuber let me know.
---
eloquent*
---
it be like that
---
It's 13 a month, but people are assuming it literally costs 100 dollars upfront. I can vouch that it happens.
---
Great, you're a Messiah for digital security.
---
Damm you rock op ! You are my hero
---
Or just one that holds the equivalent of four.
---
"You can't have two conflicting feelings at the same time!" 
---
"Lmao, what do you think you are, some kind of intellectual?"
---
Good thing I refuse to save it there.
---
me too, usually ru nsolo, but want to start doing raids, and havent been able to solo them just yet.
---
Mine is not locked at 60 FPS and I didn't change any settings in the ini. I have the framerate in the upper left corner at all times and it fluctuates between the mid 20's to 160.
---
You can say that again.
---
Someone get that shovel museum player we have a lot of shoveling to do.
---
If you found the loophole - then you wouldn't be going to jail.  Because you exploited a loophole.  That's how loopholes in the law work.  They prevent the law from applying in certain situations.  Making it *legal* to do that thing in those situations.
---
You could say that 'if you found a flaw in the President's security and you killed him, should you not go to jail even if you reported that flaw first?'
---
This.  Don‚Äôt try and do something noble if you aren‚Äôt needed to do it in the first place. 
---
Also we just don‚Äôt know how many times the exploit was used per person. Someone can say it but that‚Äôs heresy and doesn‚Äôt hold any water. BGSA knows but they aren‚Äôt going release that info to the public.
---
Just came to say I still can't put gold paint on The Action Hero. Because I guess it's a different weapon than a .50 cal
---
My first bad feeling from this game came with the repair kits, and I tried to ignore the feeling 
---
Then the fridge and robot came out and I saw most of this sub supported it and I knew then the game was done 
---
Then first came out and ended all doubt 
---
The only thing stopping me from liking this game is Bethesda
---
Except its stated multiple times he didn't care about the initial ban, its normal for people in those circles to get dinged for a few days because of their work in the game. They each have paid for multiple accounts, probably so they can keep working and let the automated system do its thing.
---
What they are up in arms about is the fact that they are getting permanently banned. When they have had an intimate relationship with Bethesda for a long time now, helping them smooth out their games.
---
Bethesda is throwing that to the wind, and all of you guys can only keep repeating "BUT HE CHEATED!!!!".
---
My favorite camp I've built so far was in the honeybeast cave in north Mire
---
I thought topics started by bgs always got pinned..
---
You mean the Piper coat from 4? I wouldn't be surprised if they do. I'm pretty sure we've seen screenshots of Cait's outfit in game too.
---
My 2070 drops into the 20s if I visit a camp built at Whitespring.
---
like the pipe revolver and bolt action pipe pistol with a stock on them?
---
In your original post you never had two conflicting feelings. You just spouted the same stuff the past 300 posts under you have. You wanted to be included and maybe get some upvotes I suppose.
---
‚ÄúWhy is everyone taking the banned party at his word?‚Äù
---
Every time someone told me that Bethesda did something abysmally egregious relating to this game, my first thought was ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs too ridiculous‚Äù. That was from the first stirring of crap about this game until Fallout 1st. So, I can say definitively, no one is being gullible about believing this guy. You‚Äôre being gullible for thinking there‚Äôs a chance Bethesda DIDN‚ÄôT do this.
---
They could just have a cool down for nukes (which I think they already do). Have the nuke cool down match the nuke region duration, so each silo can only create one nuke zone at a time.
---
It would mean nuke zones are more common, and new players would likely have to play around them some times, but that sounds like a neat mechanic. So long as there's a limit it shouldn't be too bad for new players.
---
Cool so you agree that the dataminers in this sub are more trustworthy than Bethesda at this point.
---
Eh, not quite. It's more showing that you can operate in an unintended manner within a set framework of systems. I'd place it akin to tax fraud to point out tax loopholes.
---
I get all this, but it's clear that you could take that exact same gun, add a rifle stock, and take tank killer to obtain an objectively better result.  There's no debate on this - it's just a simple fact.
---
No matter how well a pistol build, especially a bloodied build can perform in the game it will always fall short of what another weapon that has an AP perk can accomplish.
---
I think you mean your son..üòÇ
---
I put my machines behind a the powered garage door, on the same power supply. I put a switch in a locked part of my camp. When i'm near max i flip the switch. Machines go off and the door closes, but the rest of my camp (other than the small room where the generator and switch are) is still accessible. Keeps me from having to restock all the machines.
---
they will figure it out once they realize everyone else in their lobby is cheating anyway.
---
Thats pretty exciting hopefully they aren't weak guns.
---
So, I was trying to farm karma by shitting on cheaters AND Bethesda at the same time? 
---
I dare you to attempt to fucking explain your rationale.
---
Totally get that part, it's the rest that I thought was odd.
---
Just sent you a request
---
I like to think I hit them so hard the game is unable to register my raw strength.
---
Well look what happened, now he changes his story and admits someone else (who supposedly didn't know what he was working on) made the report to Bethesda.
---
This is the problem when players, who know exactly what they are doing when using CE to manipulate the memory data, are able to get away with this multiple times due to the lack of proper anti-cheat measures.
---
Yes, but when you have virtually unlimited chances to get the item you want...
---
Look into it yourself. PC is fucked. The hacking is next level nonsense, and easily accomplished... Simply put, we would be injecting countless hacked and duped items into our economy, as well as people that can walk clip, fly, and one shot kill.
---
Congratulations, you want a cookie?
---
fair enough assessment.
---
I remember pre-release, I was really hoping that nukes would leave behind scorched terrain, and even temporarily destroy certain structures.  But most of all I was hoping that nuking a place would also unlock temporary new dungeons that are hidden beneath the area.
---
Unfortunately none of those were the case and nukes only really function like a radstorm on demand that maxes the encounter level of NPCs in the area.
---
That's exactly what OP is suggesting.
---
Yes it's a separate thing, they Just put the same as default. I changed my password multiple times and never noticed the two fields...
---
You don't see the irony of spelling words wrong while you're lecturing someone about how they don't understand the intricacies of language?
---
thats a nice story from your imagination.  
---
I wonder how often you try to tell others how THEY are feeling or what THEY think.
---
I-can support whoever I want and I have no problem with Bethesda, it seems you and your crybaby friends cant handle that the majority of players just keep playing because they don‚Äôt don‚Äôt agree or feel the same way as you.
---
Most of us bought a game, and now are enjoying that game, regardless of how much you wish against it. As far as Im concerned Bethesda has killed two birds with one stone. They‚Äôve forced out the extreme haters and (as a company in a capitalist society) they have charged 13$ a month for premium(optional) content. 
---
But I assume you‚Äôll just keep trying to tell people what they think and feel instead of listening to what they say. See how far it gets you.
---
I'd pay for the lack of underwear; Fallout 76 is a mature game for mature people.
---
There‚Äôs a subreddit called falloutsettlements that is amazing with great builds and tips you should check out
---
Did you happen to find their discord info?
---
Launch is a go
---
Not necessarily, no XP gain is too obvious
---
Doesn't seem like it's any more or less FUD then has been spewed since it was released.
---
Looks like you're losing on all fronts here. Cake day disappointment. Your title was fine, I just questioned the need to add the rest. It screams accept me please. Then afterwards saying that you like the game lol. I've never once felt strongly enough to call a game was a shit show and also loved it. It's odd, that's all I'm getting at. I'll agree with one of the comments above mine. You seem to be trying really hard, just not quite reaching it though.
---
We need that double xp at least one weekend per month. There‚Äôs something fun about it. Gets people online. Not that I want to spend more money, but more new atomic shop items always keep things fresh. They could bring back something like mothman week. Except do it for something else, like the flatwoods monster. They could make all of the mountable heads, that aren‚Äôt available yet, available through more of those random bounties. Maybe a new TNT Dome key hunt.
---
Uffff
---
No? Lol come on üòÇ
---
Oh cool I didn't know there were two different chameleon bonuses that makes this a little less daunting I was thinking I'd have to find a full set
---
Oh, fixing jet packs would be enough to make me happy until Wastelanders comes out.
---
That's because when a nuclear bomb detonates it doesn't blow up the ground. Nukes detonate mid-air to maximize the damage it causes. It normally blows down a lot of buildings, and causes outright destruction. On top of that, the nukes we launch in-game aren't very strong as far as nukes can go.
---
If you landed one in the ground..it wouldn't do much.
---
Edited:
---
People don't like having parts of their mentality exposed its okay. Look at your response, you are lashing out, I wonder why.
---
BUSTED. üòÇüòÇ
---
Why are you pretending to not be aware that common anti-76 rhetoric is to imply that anyone who supports it or any decision bethesda makes is some kind of shill or fanboy? 
---
Commonly, there's two things you never have to do in any kind of debate or argument if you're right: feign ignorance, or lie.
---

---
Fun Fact: Cait's outfit and the Vault-Tec Rep's outfit are the only outfits that were shown in promo screens for unrelated Atom Shop items but have yet to appear in the shop itself (Elite Ranger doesn't count since that was a recent datamine for Fo1st)
---
They use the force
---
? you trolling or just stupid and bitter? go grief somewhere else
---
Good question actually. Somewhere in the bog?
---
&lt;3 relax im only mocking about it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs bad. Not sure if it was ever better.
---
Ok cool, I‚Äôve been running harper‚Äôs ferry for 2 days, and I manage, but I‚Äôm running out of ammo haha.

---
He never reported it because a friend did and he kept the glitched shit in his inventory, using a cheat engine will get you problems, just play the game and don‚Äôt try searching for exploits.
---
This was the impression I got before release, such as destroyed buildings being further destroyed, trees blown apart, fires burning from rubble etc etc
---
Queens have been large gatherings in my recent experience
---
I was a FQA on multiple AAA titles. Usually you at least try to replicate  the bug 10 times, and give an x/10 probability. Unless it happens every time, in which case 5 would suffice. I need more information. Did they use the exploit under 30 times? they were prolly trying to replicate it. Did they try it hundreds of times? well there's no point for that much detail in the data, even a 3/10 bug the repeatable will have sufficient data.
---
Imagine if the game functioned properly in the first place?
---
I wish I had kept track of the number of atoms we‚Äôve missed from them being broken. It has to be in the $30 range by now.
---
You are very special indeed. You just refuse to see it dont you lol.
---
IMHO, don't really need it.  It's not a long range weapon.
---
I hip fire an executioners in events like uranium fever.  great for tagging.
---
Nuclear Winter used to complete the Adventure challenges without giving the rewards. Most people I played with did their dailies before playing NW.
---
Or have the ability to plant region specific plants in that region only
---
Player: Release DLC as is, I'm bored
---
Bethesda: Ok, we will move our focus back to money grubbing in the atom stop. *DLC released broken, unpolished and completely unplayable*
---
Players: *SurprisedPikachu.jpeg*
---
Few major disappointments? So all the bugs, glitches, server issues, game crashing, server crashing, lag, latency, poor hit detection, lack of significant updates, etc, aren't a big deal to you? But the fact that nukes don't leave a hole is major?
---
Shows how little effort Bethesda puts forth.
---
Oddly enough, it seems like every time I raise a point that you seem incapable of responding to, you just say I'm "special". 
---
It's almost like you're *an actual fucking moron*.
---
Completely agreed.
---
I had a camp inside the Wilson Brother's Autoshop, very cool, and it saved on my camp budget since an armor table and power armor stand were already present.
---
My current camp is on a moutain with a stone arch. It's cool, but it's held back by the fact that I've maxed out my camp budget.
---
swag cya in game
---
He's on about the AI being the Skyrim dragons, which is true
---
Spreading the word does not equal defaming others. 
---
I agree Bethesda has a tough road ahead of them. Hopefully they improve their anti-cheat software. The problem will still exist for however long BRs stay in fashion. Every BR I‚Äôve played I‚Äôve run into some type of cheater. We are lying to ourselves if we think Bethesda is at the forefront of cyber security.
---
PC. I thought this was crossplay ahahha sry

Actually, this is what I got out of the first few trailers of the game. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't pan out this way. TBH, i don't see any point to the nukes if it doesn't change the landscape. Big deal, it changes ferals into glowing... Yawn!
---
The whitespring? Oh, what‚Äôs that?
---
On of my first major disappointments was paying for a glorified beta. But to each their own.
---
The server can barely handle current nukes. It can barely handle just running the game without nukes. So, you're probably right.
---
i wanted to make my vendors halloween  themed but decided against it. Not worth Resorting and relisting all my  stuff. I find it more boring to do that than make alt's  to have more custom houses. Hell once a week i spend a night making an entire house/hotel or small town. Rather farm mats to do that than  redo inventory for my vendors.
---
Imo. Sony/Microsoft and BGSA need to do what Sony does with CoD and make a one year exclusive deal. We get one full calendar year of crossplay. However it only affects consoles. In that one year BGSA MUST clean up the PC port of the game. Along with banning and controlling the cheating. They don‚Äôt both companies can pull out end of story. And we go back to the old way. 
---
This puts a fire to BGSA to clean up. And gives the cheaters an ultimatum. Stop or take your ban. 
---
People will, can and are going to cry. But we all ‚Äúread‚Äù and accepted the ToS. Don‚Äôt like it or want your money too bad. You broke that when you started on this path. 
---
Want to feel godlike and have the rules not apply to you. Wait for modded servers and mod only characters to become a thing.
---
The sight would be icing on the cake. I run a Commando Stealth build so not having a suppressor on my main Weapon is kind of counterproductive.
---
&gt;Imagine buying a full priced triple A game
---
76 isn't even anywhere near $60 in alot of places nowadays...
---
&gt;and being told quality of life updates from now on are going to be locked behind a paywall having you pay twice the original cost of the game per year
---
They have literally never said patches and updates will be locked behind Fo1st. Not only that, we got 2 patches (one was a hotfix but still) since Fo1st and they were for *everybody,* not "for Fo1st members only"
---
And how about planting in rows, raised planters, pots, and hydroponics?
---
Use the destruction on the wall like camp and the nuclear winter effect.
---
I think it‚Äôs great.  When‚Äôs the You Tube version of this thread coming out?  I‚Äôll have my popcorn ready
---
sure, you can get lucky and take out a 4 premade.
---
But in 9 out of 10 times, you might down 1 or 2, and then get killed yourself, only for them to ress the downed.
---
I still think a pure random group lobby would work for the best, and might promote this game mode to those that have already given up on it.
---
Main thing I try to farm is lead. Other than that, my activities are garden variety map roaming, hoarding, and breaking down everything in sight that's not nailed down. Since scrapboxes, i've taken to breaking down weapon drops in mass as well
---
Sure sure, whatever keeps you from having to deal with looking inward right?
---
This guy gets it. When people are buying microtransactions and 1st subscriptions, for a broken game that is almost a year old, why would Bethesda change what they're doing?
---
Two ranks that require 3 base Charisma. 
---
The build I described uses a base Charisma of 1. Only thing I run there is Strength in Numbers.
---
Well that‚Äôs like your opinion, man. 
---
Pass me another Caucasian cause this mofo is out of his got damn mind
---
Well so far your 0/2 on your mystic readings.
---
No issues here. Xbox. What's your playform?
---
If its ongoing make a ticket with Bethesda
---
let's see these wares then, what do you have? I will judge weather or not youre selling overpriced crap or serious guns at a fair price
---
I thought it was pretty pointless. I liked the Grace character but otherwise it was just a rehash of T2. Added nothing really new.
---
It‚Äôs bad. Making IF a public event didn‚Äôt make it worst. It was already a bad sight before that. Tbh it‚Äôs best to just leave the event altogether. Save your ammo/durability and go farm elsewhere. 
---
The worst I‚Äôve seen are the PA blockades. It‚Äôs stupid and petty.
---
You mean in F1st?  Yes, I‚Äôve addressed that, and my concerns that it should have been a quest and not part of the membership. Or at the least, a version without the Scrap Box should be available as a quest.
---
You lost me at ‚ÄúI thought we were all adults‚Äù 
---
Carry on brah!
---
This is the correct answer. To expound:
---
* Be attractive *(high charisma via Unyielding armor)*  
---
* Don't be unattractive  
---
* Kill everyone in Harper's Ferry and take their stuff  
---
* Kill everyone in the Glassed Cavern and take their stuff  
---
* Kill everyone in Big Bend Tunnel and take their stuff  
---
* Kill everyone in Lewisburg and take their stuff  
---
* Kill everyone at Westek Research Center and take their stuff  
---
* Sell that shit and scrap the rest for parts
---
They call his ramblings a ‚Äúparadox‚Äù
---
I've never seen so many people hang on to something and just hate on it as if they are obsessed.
---
It's almost like a jealous ex boyfriend making up lies and exaggerating truths to tell the new boyfriend so he won't date her.
---
Clear out black water mine. And UF. If done correctly you clear the vendor and have far more scrap than you need. Plus change for legendaries
---
"Everyone Liked That"
---
Perhaps I didn't realize that a comment thread was supposed to be a back and forth between only two people about only one specific aspect of a topic vs a group discussion which could encompass other aspects.
---
Is that true? I wasn't aware of that!
---
Interpretation - best of the worst or worst of the best?
---
I was just either getting my Charisma to 25 to minimize purchase prices and then buying low level gear to repair for the Atom Challenges or plans the character didn‚Äôt have that to put 1/4 of the purchase price back into the vendor pot caps pool.
---
A friend of mine build his ship next to Harpers Ferry a good while ago and started running around in a pirate hat and hunter's longcoat, and sometimes in the pirate costume now that he got one in the Halloween event: [https://imgur.com/a/HP48tws](https://imgur.com/a/HP48tws)
---
I recently build my camp next to it and started dressing up as a pirate as well, it's been fun entertaining the random people who come for a visit, some even put on pirate costumes of their own :D
---
Add scrapper to the mix and all those dead scorched weapons are a pile of steel just waiting to come into being. Steel in my books is one of the most prevalent materials. Prior to 1st, it was the resource, alongside Cloth, Leather, and fert that I commonly bulked for sale to balance my resource counts out
---
I would say ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù but wasn‚Äôt listed as an option?
---
I remember those arguments.  People were digging their heels in over that shit, and wrong as the day is long.  Idjits.
---
&gt;He's like MrBossFTW
---
MrBossFTW?
---
(blows cigarette)
---
Now that's a name I haven't heard in a *loooong* time...
---
Yup, that‚Äôs correct.
---
Bethesda knows about this one. Send them a screenshot of the completed challenges in a support ticket and they‚Äôll award you the atoms for those challenges. They just did it for me. Takes about a day.
---
I've started running a 1 star quad tesla for this, does enough damage to tag and get me out of trouble if needed but also has the ability to wipe everything out if someones being an idiot.
---
Release price was, now it isn't, doesn't change how much a lot of people paid for a broken game. At launch it was worse than a hot mess, games are expected to have bugs at launch when releasing massive games like this, not so many that Youtubers can make 20-30 minutes just talking about different bugs that are breaking the game.
---
"Quality of life" I said.
---
The tents make farming resources an absolute fuck ton easier, all the extra storage does too even though the whole ability to store infinite junk is monetized even though its been proven it wouldn't affect server stability as stacked items are simply 1 item with a number attached telling the game how many you actually have in that slot. Ranger armor whatever, emotes whatever, but most of the stuff you get from Fo1st makes things much much smoother when they should have been incorporated from the start. 
---
I get a subscription service to help keep the game going with quality updates, but not releasing a game in a broken state then charging for fixes to help the broken state.
---
On the scale of CD Projeckt Red to EA, Bethesda has aggressively worked over the past two or three years to get closer to EA's side of the reputational spectrum than CD Projeckt Red's.  It has always been in their DNA, however... let us not forget 'horse armor' ( https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/horse-armor ).  
---
The recent Fallout 1st thing was notable only in so much as it was particularly ballsy brazenness on their part to exploit the faithful that stuck with them through Fallout 76's rough launch.  However, I don't think it was particularly surprising to those who've been following Bethesda free of rose-tinted glasses.  More specifically, things took a sharp turn for the worse around the time of Fallout Shelter's release.
---
Oof missed that thanks for the clarification
---
Right? I like all the ideas but they were ripped from almost every terminator movie at some point. I'm glad we got another terminator but I expected more universe building if that makes sense?
---
So easy to tell people they are wrong when you refuse to actually see if they are right.
---
Grenade guy?
---
They should use the NW maps. They have two already generated. Those would be good, just spawn in the glowing plants and enemies.
---
Yeah, they could have gone in a new direction but played it safe and trotted out the same old story line.
---
I leave my private server up for friends/keep workshops running by using a rubber band on a controller, so my character just spins around.
---
Someone on the official boards had said they believe that 1 of the ranger outfits had like a 30 day time limit on it. So it does sound like some stuff now/going forward requires regular logging to not miss out on.
---
People are fucking stupid, it's West Virginia.
---
Those are both are non subscription games. Look at runescape another major online game, they have literal 3rd party clients such as runelite, OSbuddy, etc.
---
Eve another subscription based game allows add-ons just like Wow. It is actually pretty rare for subscription based games to not allow modifying the client.
---
Spoiler
---
They killed my boi John and I am sad.   
---
When I was a little girl I had such a crush on John Connor.
---
&gt;...so?
---
Shit this is a good idea. This will keep me from killing myself for sure.
---
I don't refuse. I considered your position, analyzed it and concluded your assessment to be false. Nothing you tried to tell me that  I thought or felt was actually what I thought or felt. So 0/2.
---
I'd quite like to see Cosmetic Mods added to the various outfits. An example being adding belts/body armor to say, military fatigues
---
Umm this doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs from fallout.
---
Im on PC, havent had those problems.  Sucks though
---
See the first problem is listening to what a Youtuber has to say about anything.
---
Now you're angry lol, breathe buddy. Just chalk it up as a loss and move on. No one is in agreement with you here.
---
76 &amp; dark fate have the same issue - they're the weak ones of the franchise.
---
You pay less for FO 1ST than for other games premium subscriptions.  You get a monthly atom allowance, so if you used to buy atoms points on a regular basis then its üíØ worth it. You get the scrap box, the survival tent and the outfit. All in all it is well worth it to me. I enjoy the game. My friends enjoy the game. We also enjoy watching people get their panties in a wad when they dont get their own way and complain about the fact that people will pay for extras even though it in no way affects their own game.
---
Except they admitted it was deleting some people's scrap, 
---
‚ÄúOur initial investigation indicated that this was a display issue, and that no items had gone missing,‚Äù a Bethesda representative told Polygon. ‚ÄúHowever, we have since found that a small number of players have in fact experienced a loss of scrap items after placing them into the Scrap Box and then loading into a world.
---
Nowhere did he say he modified memory with CE. That is where you're getting confused. The TOS zenimax nhad us agree to right before e3 states it is only against The rules to MODIFY the game files, having CE running while you play the game isn't against the TOS.
---
Your looking for validation now, over a year later?
---
&gt;Caps are useless no one wants them
---
Ehhhh not exactly...
---
He also used cheat engine and conveniently can't remember if he used it on the banned account. Don't leave that part out. It's important.
---
Thus is what I thought nuked were when the were first announced at E3 I was really glad there was gonna be something that cool but, NOPE
---
OMG yes. I am leaving my Halloween vending machines up because I really don't want to change them all over. So sorry guys, spooky music through Christmas.
---
I was thinking the same thing earlier.
---
I would argue they're already done. I don't think Wastelanders is going to to fix this game. Personally, they've lost my respect and I'll never play this game again. I keep up with this sub in hopes something drastic happens like Zenimax and Bethesda splitting or big changes in leadership. If someone still plays this game and is having fun, that's freaking awesome for you and I'm happy for you.
---
Your god damned right I am. Saw someone in another subreddit tryna say country roads is about Western Virginia and remembered all the shit from the prelaunch days.
---
If you put your vendors in your greenhouse or the new camper thing then your items will stay put as well as anything else you have in it. You just have to set it back down the same way when you move.
---
Shielded, yes. As soon as one learned protective
---
You can change direction mid jump so even autos have a hard time hitting that. Try a scoped lever, that's one hit with the perks. Don't finish wait for the rez, down them again and again. You can rack up some xp if they keep rezzing. A good team will go right after you, if that's the thing then finish the downed and switch to auto. You'll probably lose as a solo but at least you cripple them.
---
give me farm animals or give me death
---
I would love this
---
This game had it's chance and I think this 1st thing was their Hail Mary. I don't think they did well with this game. Like at this point they've realized that it was a failure and this is damage control.
---
The same company that doesn't ban NW hackers but banned dataminers from this sub and then 2weeks later reversed the decision. Lol yeah sure sounds like they know whats going on...
---
Lolololol then my mashup is fitting
---
If you go around in 4, you may hear raiders and super mutants talk of a guy who throws rocks and makes grenade noises, they were so baffled they let him run away, jumping on an imaginary motorcycle and making the sounds.
---
I have a F 25% FFR one and it wrecks face. I don‚Äôt really think it needs a sight but a suppressor and laser sight would be nice.
---
I know :/ amazing scene visually but so much disappointment
---
YOU GET A DOUBLE HEAVY AND *YOU* GET A DOUBLE HEAVY AND *YOU* GET A DOUBLE HEAVY
---
***EVERYBODY GETS A DOUBLE HEAVY!!***
---
great efforts but take a look from my perspective. you are a random group of people on the web hounding bethesda about problems in their game. bethesda does not think their game is broken and they are already paying people salaries of $60,000 to do this. they are a company and work internally. they owe you nothing. to bethesda you guys are just a nagging group of critics
---
signed on last night. Spawned me into Angler? horde I say OK lets see full melee. I got thru most of them ok - lots of stutter Then I see one I killed had a 2 shot handmade. I think I better kill the last 2 or I'm gonna lose the rifle *******(that 10 second buzz sound)freeze back to xbox screen. DOH. I don't know what stars the handmade had but would have liked to find out. Oh well I guess they didn't get to it on this maintenance.
---
Not a known liar? So he heard about the bug elsewhere but he also discovered it. He reported it but he also didn't. He used cheat engine but just not necessarily on that account. He may or may not have, "forgotten," to drop illicitly obtained weapons and that may or may not be why he's banned.
---
You have strange standards for what encompasses lying.
---
across the road in the forest where the farm WS is there is a house and a shed that you can build in and have a free garden and a tinkers bench, but there are enemies that spawn in the house. So free carrot, some tatos and BB's, rose blossom, and the WS had like 100 rasorgrain. Sorry I can not remember the name of the WS but im sure the 100 rasorgrain that was mentioned was a good enough detail.
---
9 times out of 10, people who say pay to win have no idea what they are on about. 'this repair kit that allows you to fix your gun in the field is pay to win!' When repairs as is are easy, trivial, and an occasional routine at camp. Meanwhile, you can't use Atom to buy guns stronger than non-atom guns. A Gold Tank in World of Tanks and Gold ammo is pay to win. I can't go into the Atom shop and buy a whole high-tier legendary weapon for immediate usage. People trying to call the scrap box pay to win has me in hysterics, how are they paying to win the game? by not keeping a cap for each scrap type? They fast traveled to a tent and didn't pay 10-20 cap drop in the hat, outrageous. A real pay to win item, like a suit of Power-armor with a built in complimentary Mini-nuke chucker and DR higher than all other power armor, would end up getting most of that crowd committed
---
Same Answer, Pal
---
Country roads. Duh. ;)
---
preach
---
Yes but by making a big deal out of all the false reports, and by not supporting their bans on people using Cheat Engines, and then to go and complain about cheating being rampant.. What do you really want them to do? They can't investigate every ban individually? Every cheater will claim they are not cheating..
---
Technically those emotes are in the atomic shop
---
Launched my first at 150, started quests at 180 lol. Im used to braindead grinding, I hate it but still it‚Äôs the main thing I do in games.
---
Have to mention that from launch and several months in, someone els always nuked so no need for it. I started when it seemed to be ‚Äùless‚Äù popular and incase of people stop playing lol
---
Honestly with games LoL, dota, hearthstone doing their mini game thing. It‚Äôs kinda off putting that we don‚Äôt have something. Yes Sure NW is cool. But the direct odds of having a good game or not in a lobby with a known cheater is too much to enjoy it. 
---
I‚Äôd be completely cool with a stripped down TDM. No perks, no legendary item, no mutations.  Just guns and players. Maybe the odds be ever in your favour.
---
He IS one of the best for Fallout 76 because he's fair. He represents both the good &amp; bad aspects as they are. It's just Bethesda has done nothing to warrant bad press.
---
However, if you're really biased against juicehead, try out MrMattyPlays.
---
That‚Äôs true but you need to do it on standard to get plans
---
Search it up on youtube
---
He bought virtual currency and spent it. That's no ground for a refund. How hard is that to understand? You people are the most entitled, spoiled morons.
---
Me too! I'm level 69
---
That's the only revolver I've seen in the game
---
And the worst part is clickbait has just become so accepted that in most cases, a healthy channel needs clickbait to compete. Tough times.
---
Advanced and Elite both feature shoulder pads. The markings on the shoulders vary and one has a canteen on the belt while the other doesn't. Think there are a couple more differences, but i'd need to see the image again to refresh my meory
---
Thanks for the screenshot tips!
---
It‚Äôs happened, in my case, on three occasions over the last few weeks. Only when I‚Äôm in NW prior to going on adventure mode. Today‚Äôs case was being in NW when the dailies reset this morning...grrrrr.
---
They are on the rotation next week will be melt down and then wash out.
---
if that was the case then we wouldnt have direct contacts at bethesda the way we do. quite a few of the people in the group have contacts with people who arent community managers.
---
Keep using the world "entitled" and supporting this shit companies, dumbass
---
Welcome to the internet.  Pick any subject, and you'll find crusaders for any possible interpretation of that information.

Oof. Must be tough to live your life without evidence or facts.

You mean for vault raids?
---
I'd be happy with just the items in that machine and unassigned items showing instead of having to scroll past all the items in every machine, fridge, and display I have when adding new stuff. A 'designated shopper level' on machines would be nice too. Being able to set a machine so that only shoppers of a certain level range could access it would be great (1-15, 16-30, 30-50 for example)  I used to put all my .38 ammo in my vendor for free for the low.levels... Till the day a lvl 112 came along and took it all and put it in their vendor for 1cap.  To me that's like stealing clothes from the salvation army so you can sell them in your thrift store. Now I just carry that ammo around and give it to people as I find them
---
Build it.
---
You can build all kinds of stuff in your camp. Turn it into a minigame.
---
I once ran my camp as an arcade and threw nuka tapper tournaments. Don't wait for Bethesda to do what they have already given you tools to do yourself.
---
NO YOU WON'T!
---
Longest I got it to stay online was about 15 hrs I think with a defended area.
---
I saw them as a featured set yesterday, on pc.
---
It‚Äôs a deathclaw gauntlet, bloodied with swing speed and +1 strength... do you know where i got it? From the V94 trunk as a reward couple weeks ago üòÅ
---
I have a related question: can you not store bulk junk in them?
---
I think a workable solution involving dual-wielding pistols would be to both double all damage output but to eliminate VATS from being able to be used since you can't easily use a pip boy on your wrist if you are holding two pistols. This would provide balance and boost pistol usage without being too OP since you couldn't CRIT.
---
xD
---
Charisma does not cap at 15 for selling. It caps at 20 for selling and 25 for buying. 
---
For a low cost item, it may *seem* to cap out at 15, though. 
---
At Cha 15, you get 22.5% of an item‚Äôs base value. 
---
At Cha 20+, you get 25.0% of an item‚Äôs base value. 
---
So for a item with base value of 10, you‚Äôll get 2 caps either way.  *(I‚Äôll have to double check; I think .5 caps rounds down)*
---
But for an item with a base value of 2000, you‚Äôll get 450 caps at Cha 15 but 500 caps at Cha 20+. 
---

---
Whoever you got that from got screwed
---
Honestly not everywhere but popular or huge locations should change
---
With whiskey or bourbon
---
It is possible with much weaker gear, the important part is two armour pieces with poison resist, any explosive shotgun to cripple ghouls and something that can do dmg to the heart like any explosive heavy guns (not legacy, it need to be ballistic)
---
I have a feeling a lot more cool stuff is going to be a Fallout 1st exclusive instead of an atom shop purchase. Due to the fact that it entices people to purchase a membership and atom shop purchases don‚Äôt make them much money because they give so many away for free
---
VATS is a must in sneaky commando, much crit damage in head is just op
---
That‚Äôs the max for selling (20 Cha). 
---
For purchasing, it‚Äôs 25 Cha. 
---
But "the obvious" has no bearing on this and you have no reason to call him that.
---
Caps at 20 for selling, 25 for buying. 
---
North of the Ammo Factory there's a series of boardwalks, viewing platforms, stairways and other wooden structures. It appears buildable, but I've never seen a camp there.
---
South of Sunnytop on the tracks is a gigantic coal station and other train related structures; seen some really cool camps there.
---
There is a pretty nice cave, and some large buildable trees generally NE of Freddy's.
---
Near Fort Defiance is a monorail tower folks like to build in.
---
There are camps that use elevated monorail trains; not sure how you get the camp box to include them, but super inventive.
---
The cliffs overlooking WS to the east; nw of WS is a lead deposit with a nice view of the forest.
---
You wont be able to kill more then maybe specific ones, if even that.
---
So stuff dies in one hit instead of two? I've never been too into VATS.  And it always seems buggy for me but I'll hear you out.  What do I need to swap around?
---
"Officer, the tax laws are flawed. Here is how I broke it just to show you where it's wrong. This, this &amp; this needs to be ammended".
---
"You are sentences with the death penalty. May God have mercy on your soul".
---
How about a proportion response. Perhaps one with a warning to not do it again? That would seem reasonable.
---
Just being able to race people through the athletic courses would be cool.
---
I would but I love my camp too much to just tear it up for a mini game. 
---
Fan made mini games are great but having dev made games just makes far more sense. Plus the assets already exist from FO4 with the nukacade like I said.
---
No never
---
You need full build and all necessary perks plus some decent gear, I will say 70-100.
---
Mothman Eggs. Cool them into Omelets and they can sell for up to 10, IIRC. 
---
Also it‚Äôs a food buff that gives +2 Charisma if you need to get up to Cha 20 for selling. Stacks with Beer but not Sweet Rolls.
---
The guy admitted to never reporting it because someone else did. He also admitted to using a third party program to test exploits but can't say, for sure, it was on that account.
---
You people have to stop taking the words of people at face value. The story has changed at least 3 times, now. That's indication, enough, of lying. You don't have to trust Bethesda but you sure as hell shouldn't trust the map guy, either.
---
900 hrs guy was clearly duping. Don't be revisionist with history.
---
Cool so you agres with me on this as well. Good job!
---
Lay in bed and make sure map button is activated from time to time.
---
It would. Plus the foundation is there. We do it in the fire breathers quest and the tadpole quests too.
---
OK, I stand corrected.
---
No, wait, this is the internet, I need to creep you post history and find some 8 year old, out of context combination of words to make you look like...hmm, maybe a cross-dressing badger cosplay fan.
---
(We really need a [BOFH-style](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eballard/bofh/bofhserver.pl)  random shaming app so I don't have to work for these things)
---
It's just turrets right now but the water purifier and the small generator were there through Halloween.
---
No worries. I crunched the numbers a while ago trying to see how low I could keep my Charisma and still get up to 25 solo. It was a pleasant surprise that I could stay at Cha 1.
---
Yes they did fix it
---
Your friend is a comedy genius.
---
It's probably going to take a little while for them to cycle back through
---
Guy changed his story multiple times now. He found it elsewhere but he also discovered and he reported it but he also didn't because someone else did. Also he didn't do anything wrong but can't confirm if he used cheat engine on that account and he isn't sure if he still had illicitly obtained weapons on that character.
---
You're the gullible one for not reading what the accusing party has freely admitted to.
---
My friend? This is an actual thing in Fallout 4
---
Blue print your machine and then place from blueprint at your new camp.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted there to be a event to where you and a small group transport a nuke into the glass caverns and after successfully nuking it inside you went back in a could venture down further to hunt down the source of the scorch beast
---
Interesting, I don't much care for VATS either and here is my build. I'm not saying mine is better or anything, but it works. I run Blocker instead of Barbarian, and I run some more Endurance perks and I don't know how optimized those are.

---
In the Scrap Box?  No. Bulk items are like regular junk. Doesn‚Äôt count as scrap. 
---
Currently I only bulk junk to sell to a vendor or in my own machines, and for that last one only for scrap that wouldn‚Äôt sell at 1 cap per.
---
Maybe consider not next time. This could have been about the more innocent days of the sub but now we know it's just all about you.
---
Bulk junk can you put in your stash box but the scrap box breaks down objects first. Bulk items are on the list of 'do not auto-scrap' you have to break them down manually before you can put them in the scrap box.
---
Yeah. I have a build where I use the diagonal pieces to build exterior walls and I can use wallpapers on it no problem.
---
I haven't had that issue on PC either.
---
I always assumed I could switch blocker out with barbarian depending on what I was fighting. Supermutants and robots for barbarian, blocker for whitesprings farming.
---
Using freesync monitor, it's nice. Matches the refresh rate. Nvidia it's gsync.
---
I hate Christmas music....big pass....
---
This‚Äôll shred everything before it can see you - pair it with bloodied FFR handmade and GG game has no challenge at all.

---
^ solid dude right here
---
This was suggested like crazy last year.
---
Unfortunately, it warrants much of the same response. While it's a great idea and would be awesome to see implemented, songs, classic Christmas songs especially, have *huge* licensing fees. It's unlikely Bethesda will shoulder that burden.
---
The issue was corrected.   
---
For those who lost anything because of the issue I am unsure if they have had their scrap "restored". It was said they would be giving scrap to those who lost it but it wouldn't necessarily be what they had lost.
---
Video proof please. Someone reported the same thing last week then claimed they were quiting the game even though the title said they were switching to commando. I main melee and during extreme lag it can be difficult to land a hit and when the thing being attacked goes from white to red sometimes its does not register. But far to many bears have been one shot at dolly sods for this to be a common issue.
---
I like the idea. If someone where to put a playlist on spotify and share it that would be great.
---
It‚Äôs nice to find common ground at least. Im probably never going to get 1st because I see it as a waste of money for a game that I play for about a week and then go to other games. Ive played since the stress test so I‚Äôve watched the game grow and I have to say, the game felt more stable a few months after launch than it does now. I just hope the devs can turn this game around
---
I think Piper's coat was released in the atom store once ages ago? Unless I was told wrong.
---
I have my ‚ÄúJohn Henry‚Äù build which uses a VE auto-rail rifle and sledgehammer. I run Life-saving armor and a Mysterious Stranger and Revenant with it and it‚Äôs hilarious. Definitely use VATS with an auto-rail rifle though.
---
I only used one Halloween vending machine for this very reason. Listing 120 items is tedious, especially when it jumps back to the top of the list each time you've added something. Endless very slow scrolling makes it a huge chore.
---
What??? That's like people who dont like cheese.
---
No, it doesn't. I play minecraft with a hacked client for 2b2t but play legit on normal servers.
---
10? Wow, consoles have really stepped up their game these days.
---
That's actually a good point I haven't considered, and I might steal that idea from you. Radicool will probably give Barbarian a boost depending on how many unyielding pieces I carry. Also, I like dodgy but I didn't have room for it in my build.
---
Also what would be the in cannon reason broken buildings turn back into not being as broken lol
---
I'm lactose intolerant....    :c
---
Fun fact; nukes don't actually leave large craters unless detonated below the ground - particularly the low yield ones used in Fallout.
---
The Trinity Test left a crater that was only 30 ft wide and 5 ft deep. A 500lb "regular bomb" like the Mk 82 can leave a crater 35 ft wide and 14 ft deep.
---
I have just built a ramshackle crazy cat lady camp behind a billboard near Top of the World. I have 4 cats. But they are often dead, which is slightly depressing. I once found them lifeless in a pile of green goo. Murdered! üôÄ
---
Lol I think he‚Äôs fine. He talks in circles a lot but he‚Äôs the best youtuber for this game (IMO).
---
He‚Äôs definitely been more negative after Fallout 1st came out but he usually balances out his praise and criticism pretty well.
---
Shouldnt have been removed.
---
For main accounts, always get the key strait from bethesda. Then there's no jackassery with used keys. Be nice to have 2 factor through mobile phones.
---
Umm reduced weapon weights, more attachments, more caliber choices. 
---
A revamp of how "end game" works but this will never happen.
---
You know that you just seem like a complete asshole right
---
Well the Fallout 4 thing is genius, but your friend moreso for remembering about it and actually bringing that character to life! Sounds like a lot of fun. I'd like to meet them in-game!
---
Yeah, as long as you do not scrap after you move. 
---
What I found is blue print vending machines and blue print display cases and mounts and scrap the rest. 
---
Then just plant the blue prints.
---
Use paypal. You can change the password to the paypal account and they can't auto charge again. I don't like that either.

I completed mine by killing a queen, could try that. More then likely will work.
---
Thanks brother üëç
---
Interesting. I'll keep messing around with VATS and see what I think. Thanks man
---
"patently" no less.
---
Well, goodness, if it's *patently* false, I'll just fly off on my Pegasus and bid you fond farewell. xD
---
Nuclear winter or just out and about
---
more bugs

Deathmatch and Team deathmatch can be done at a workshop. You cab also build your minigame course there. I have seen many workshops built up into RP locations.
---
And yes, native support would be better, but not entirely necessary.
---
:-) don't know how to go about getting it reinstated or permission to repost it though.
---
Imagine if nukes actually destroyed structures! I was bummed when I realized the pics of Charleston from the teasers weren't depicting what the nukes do in game.
---
NPCs won't come until some point in 2020, Wastelanders was delayed.
---
Honestly, there's nothing new that's worth mentioning.
---
When is Wastelanders dropping?
---
sniff it's beautiful
---
I was able to do that from the start
---
and you believe that, based on what?
---
These are the main reasons why I believe the data miners over Bethesda. That and the fact the data miners at one point in time cared enough about the community to provide **free** community tools. Clearly they do give some level of shit about this game. 
---
Also with the way they shutdown their website not being the politest thing in the world + all the bad press generated from YouTube, etc, makes me think it was easier for Bethesda to simply double down on denying them then admit fault.
---
this is great info - side question.  Do you happen to know at what point radicool maxes out at +5 str?  is it also at 80% of your health bar, or at some different point (i.e. a certain number of rads)?
---
That will keep the items assigned?
---
This sub was never innocent it always had arguments bud same with just about every subreddit. Don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt participate.
---
a whole lot of reading
---
My team tries to make sure everyone gets a hit.  The bummer is this event rarely gives anything higher than a level 35 or 40 now. Its a scrip event and a place to farm steel and glowing meat lol.
---
Gotcha I was about to ask. Do you have a copy?
---
I've never noticed it... I've had my chassis in my stash for a long time and always scrolling through displaying my helmets and hats...
---
Yeah
---
Here‚Äôs a quote from Bethesda:  ‚Äú...‚Äù
---
This is been going on faaarrrr too long.
---
I have too but. It would be far better for an official mini game section. Less troubles and all that.
---
This whole thing reeks of deja-vu.  Not too long ago 900 Hours Guy got banned and made a post about how he was banned for no reason.  There was a huge community outcry that BGS was banning people who were actually beneficial to the community.  Story is picked up by Youtubers, PC Gamer, etc.  Then it comes out that 900 Hours Guy wasn't exactly upfront with all the details.
---
Quarter 1 of 2020 so any time from January to April
---
I do, sort of. What's weird is i can still see it.
---
True, but it really feels like an RPG. I'd pay full price all over again for FO4's game mechanics and world, with the story, character interactions, and dialogue all handled by whomever wrote TOW. Integrating some of the numerous modded improvements would be nice, but I no longer associate *nice* with BGS's vault wheel at the start of a game.
---
I thought is was this month. 
---
Damn.
---
The issue was fixed the day after it was reported.  
---
Which pissed people off that it got fixed that fast.
---
might wanna check the r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
Make a copy and paste it if possible
---
I am interested, but play on and off. I wouldn‚Äôt want to take up a spot and not be on for X amount of time.
---
Am I still welcome to join in this case?
---
I'm diabetic. I feel your pain.
---
I can't say he isn't or wasn't the best. He really provided lots of information since ive been subscribed before NW. It's just I feel like all he does is complain anymore and it's less about updates. Which I get Bethesda isn't helping in that point but i just get incredibly annoyed by the "this was in fallout 4 for free why isnt it in the atomic shop for free???" complaints.
---
I'll check out that youtuber btw, thank you for the recommendation.
---
Was tentatively set for November until A few weeks ago when fallout 1st dropped they officially pushed it back
---
Why are you acting like I made the video based off of rumors? I had talking to the banned users for weeks now and waited a full 10 days to even cover it to see if Bethesda would resolve things on their own. 
---
If you look at my coverage of other leaks like the MMOG stuff I am way more skeptical and make that pretty clear when I talk about it. I feel differently about the banned players specifically because of all the stuff I have seen around the situation (from the users and Bethesda).
---
Needs more dev time they said. Hopefully to prevent the buggy problems they‚Äôve had with other content drops so far
---
OUCH
---
Ohh wait, I‚Äôm not the OP, just saw people questioning what he meant and I knew so I thought I‚Äôd clarify
---
Huh? Why would they be pissed about it?
---
I would say it's great that it got fixed that fast. 
---
Do you also know what happened to the missing scraps? I remember players saying they lost it back then. Did they got it back?
---
That would require Bethesda to actually do work though
---
I'm all for it as long as we don't mix with PC players. Sorry, but you folks have hacker issues that many of us just don't want to deal with.
---
don't worry you'll b3 bored of them first day.
---
Gets downvoted bc everyone is in denial and doesn't like facts
---
I use one as my major damage dealer and I'm definitely ready for at least a glow sight at this point

**OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT ‚Äì BUGS, FIXES, AND MORE!**
---
With Mischief Night‚Äôs statistics in our rearview mirror, we look to either side of us to see what‚Äôs currently happening and if we remember to we‚Äôll look ahead to avoid any avoidable crashes as we cruise through Appalachia! Just kidding on that last part, we won‚Äôt be looking ahead for any reason. So grab a Nuka-Cola and soak in the sort-of updates!
---
**NUCLEAR WINTER STUFF**
---
We heard you all didn‚Äôt like how high the bar was set for the glowing skeleton jammies, so we did you all a favor and reduced the challenges overall. But rather than reducing the required experience for each challenge, we reduced the time it could take to accomplish them by at least 12 hours. So, when November 12th rolled around in Sri Lanka, you didn‚Äôt have to worry about those limited time challenges anymore! You can thank us later.
---
Speaking of thanking us, we also heard you hated playing against cheaters in Nuclear Winter. We went ahead and applied a fix during the latest maintenance to improve the overall gameplay and stability of Nuclear Winter by making the minimum and maximum number of players per match significantly smaller. This means you won‚Äôt have to play against cheaters anymore! Or really play against anyone, because it‚Äôll just be your squad. Again, you‚Äôre welcome for this amazing fix to a long standing problem.
---
Additionally, we also understand from our perfect understanding of your feedback that you adore our statistics bit! So, here are some statistics from the Nuclear Winter Limited Time Event! 
---
Number of Cheaters Banned: 0.  
---
Number of Players Missing the Jammies By 1,000 EXP or Less: 937,298.  
---
Average Overseer Exp Gained Per Match: 5.  
---
Total Minutes Spent Naked in Bushes: 3,677,736,462.   
---
Total Bullets Legitimately Fired: 88. Percentage of Matches with AFKers: 100%.
---
**THANKSGIVING EVENT**
---
Yes, we‚Äôd like to take a moment to announce our next event. Since we know how much everyone likes really random things, we thought having you all help The Purveyor host a Thanksgiving Dinner would be an exciting addition to our event line-up. Between maybe November 15th and an end time to be determined by Murmrgh, the event ‚ÄúLets Give Thanks‚Äù will spawn randomly about the map in place of ‚ÄúThe Messenger.‚Äù Once you get there, maybe the event will fire as we coded it, but we don‚Äôt really know since we didn‚Äôt test it. Murmrgh will ask you to do a variety of random tasks, from subscribing to Fallout 1st to winning 10 games of Nuclear Winter in a row. Completing the tasks before the event timer ends will earn you some great limited time rewards! Maybe. So be on the lookout for Murmrgh‚Äôs pop-up Thanksgiving restaurant for a truly random amount of time and get some random limited time rewards before some time that we can‚Äôt actually figure out passes! Good luck!
---
**WASTELANDERS**
---
Nah.
---
**ATOMIC SHOP UPDATES**
---
We know how much you all really like cool power armor and weapon skins, so we added a few mundane C.A.M.P. items and another set of wallpaper for you to spend your hard-earned Atoms on. We‚Äôre listening to your feedback, we promise! For our Ultra-Elite Fallout 1st Members, you can re-unlock the Ranger Armor Paint we tried to sell you last week but then gave out for free. We thought giving you the experience of unlocking it a second time would be a great way for us to say ‚ÄòThanks for bolstering out Christmas Bonus!‚Äô
---
That‚Äôs it for us this week! Check back next time for even more statistics, less information about what you want to know about and more about what you don‚Äôt! See you in Appalachia!
---
just like WOWs carnival they had a few years back
---
Exactly. I made this same mistake. I couldn't believe how many things I needed to scrap to make room for it. In the end I decided it wasn't worth sacrificing all the other things for. Money down the drain.
---
The combat really is trash, even compared to unmodded FO4. I never use VATS in FO4, but TOW is basically unplayable without space-VATS. Lengthwise, it's only short if you're skipping all the side quests and fast traveling everywhere. Playing through the first time on supernova and following through on all quest threads, I got a solid couple weeks out of the game with an appetite to play a different style and see what changed.
---
His psn is super_combat I think or supercombat or super-combat
---
I haven‚Äôt kept up with wow in almost 10 years. Enlightenment me.
---
I sell serums on my characters during days when I have little time to play.  Uranium Fever and selling shotguns and mole miner gauntlets and glowing steaks is a great way to do daily caps if you see the event.
---
when I'm looking for background noise at home i search unique camp locations on youtube.  it makes for some interesting stuff sometimes when i'm kinda not paying attention then have to go back and see where the camp actually is if one catches my eye to see if i want to build near there.  I like my spot right above the mountain bed and breakfast there is an overlook on top of the hill with a dead body from the mistress of mystery and a few other neat things.
---
nice and centrally located too
---
If Bethesda started paying people for reporting bugs in their game they'd go bankrupt in days.
---
Thanks, time to spam
---
This guy probably camps out at Whitesprings train station selling 1 star legendary junk weapons for 5K each and locks up all his shit and of course blames others.
---
While they're at it on this idea, they should allow us to adjust prices without canceling and re-listing them.
---
Nah, I just want an emote that lets my dude take a giant shit in your clean bathroom or on your bed. üòÇ
---
I would recommend dumping Action Boy and grabbing Mister Sandman. You'd want the 3.75x night time sneak attacks over a little more AP regen. With lone wanderer and Rejuvenated, you should be fine. I managed to get my AP costs to zero, so AP regen gear is worthless for me now.
---
You know people can be subscribed or visit the sub without playing the game, right? I haven't played in months and I've stayed subscribed hoping for good news (like Wastelanders - but unfortunately that has been delayed and in the meantime they've decided to add an overpriced subscription and start banning people because they tested a bug they found online before reporting it).
---
They can downvote me as much as they like I wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt anyone I‚Äôm just stating the truth. I want bethesda to do better. I want YOUR game to be better. And sitting around politely asking for them to change things won‚Äôt do a thing.
---
If you listen to the raiders outside of the paint store you can hear them talk about a person they tried to mug that in a panic started throwing rocks and making Grenade sounds. Apparently this worked and scared the raiders so he could run away
---
We used to leave bags of spoiled food on people's beds lol
---
You can't actually be that dumb, can you?
---
Exactly
---
I mostly agree with that, he fucked up in not reporting it. But what about the other user? They have been regularly reporting bugs and actually just got that security exploit fixed, but then perma'd. 
---
Regardless of your stance on the Map76 guy (which I agree is a bit of a stickier situation) the users who have been in regular correspondence with Bethedsa to report bugs getting banned for that seems silly to me. Especially when you consider they use a strike system for NW hackers. Like based off of everything I've read and seen, they don't have a 0 tolerance policy for hacking in NW - you get a 3 day, then perma. So why on the other side of things are they handing out immediate permas? Like in the case of the Map76 and other dataminer bans it seems like a simple: "hey stop doing this stuff even if your intentions were initially good, next time is a perma."
---
I tried it but 3.75x is total overkill - you can kill legendary scorchbeast in 2 seconds with 3 precise crits
---
Brewery, player vendors, vault raid and battle royal.. and a couple of new "boss" events with new legendaries.. oh and legendary vendor
---
Aw, yiss
---
Agreed the initial ban is not the issue; BGS persisting in it after the situation was clarified is indefensible.
---
The lies they told are for profit
---
I'd make a farming route and work on it until time efficient. If everyone had the same route, be stripped =\] If you do queens with your time, the serums are fast. I rather sell them though. Anything you sell in your vending machine is added on top of the vendors daily.
---
Also why it's not good to buy cheap stuff from players to flip at the stations, you're boning yourself. Better to flip those at your machine.
---
I‚Äôm surprised though 5 people downvoted me on this. Seriously guys?
---
it was probably that far back.  they had a carnival area.  almost like the one we have.  you played games like shoot the target, catch the pig, ring toss etc.  it was built around it being a set of daily quests.  you beat the game, you earn a ticket.  turned tickets in for legendary gear and such.
---
Without undoing it? That makes no sense
---
Seriously? You can add this, but not a Jumbo Mr. Fuzzy Plush from the Camden Park store?

Still using the Enclave uniform after a year
---
I'm gonna find that guy. Or maybe he'll find me first. Ka-boooom!
---
oh absolutely.  There are plenty of people who get on when they can.  Best thing about joining a group like this is we will have people on at all times whenever you are free to play.  
---
There is no real obligation to join in on what someone else is doing or to have them join you unless you are looking for help,  but getting into a world with someone else allows you access to a few fast travel points for free once you get on their friends list and their camps once you are on a team if that is all you wanted out of it.  I would bet you'd get much more though.
---
Is that a fucking rainbow reference?
---
Less about updates? What objective update could you do now that isn't negative?
---
I got my hands on a Bloodied explosive 10mm smg and was in love but then I tried to modify it and was met with this disappointment
---
And that's possible although I think it would be easy to unban them. But I don't know. 
---
Doubling down on it though is nonsensical logically
---
point taken.
---
I'm neanderthal melee build; stealth is not my specialty :)
---
I like that idea too. üëç
---
There are only a handful of weapons worth more than 5-6K.  And I have some of them and I‚Äôve sold some of them. 
---
The best items to sell are certain types of apparel or certain types of ammo.  If you price .556 or .45 ammo at 1 cap each you will sell them all day long.  Ultracite ammo at 2 caps each will sell all day long.   Stable Flux for 200 each or bulk ballistic fiber for 150 each will sell all day long.  Med-x at 10 caps each will sell all day long.  Most bobble heads at 50-75 caps each will sell all day long.
---
He could have easily reported the issue, BGS is probably peeved he didn't. Sure you can say "Someone in his group already reported it" but that doesn't mean he couldn't have also reported it. Bethesda wants multiple sources of feedback and patches things quicker if multiple people are reporting issues, they're suspicious of why he did not. The story has changed a good bit, for example at first he said he reported it, and then he later adds that he didn't do the actual reporting
---
One can only speculate. They either know more than we do and someone is lying and there is a lot more to it or they genuinely just dgaf, which I don't believe.
---
I get the impression that support runs like it's own "studio" and didn't care about the games themselves (sometimes). 
---
PS avid listener to the channel , I find your commentary mostly neutral and pleasantly non vitrioloic.
---
The level of denial here is insane.
---
I use a mule account. You can run 2 instances on the same pc, join and fast travel to account 1, buy it.
---
This totally mischaracterizes the relationship though? If these people were reaching out to Bethesda with bugs and Bethesda said "hey thank you, but we have a team for that so please stop doing it" then I would get your point. 
---
Rather Bethesda has thanked them and fixed many of the issues brought up by this group, maintaining consistent correspondence throughout. Earlier this year one member (not banned) was even invited to BGS to give feedback and look at NW early due to them maintaining a consistent bug list on this subreddit.
---
They have different job titles. Bethesda is a single entity since an entity is multiple parts as one object, such as Bethesda. They communicate and work as one. No way would a statement be made without all knowing about it
---
Mostly limited time events
---
So if you come back now, it will appear not a great deal has been added (barring crafting things)
---
What seems to be missed here is that some people enjoy figuring out the *WHY* behind an exploit, as opposed to abusing an exploit. I don't know the map76 creator personally, nor have I spoken with him, but I grew up with a performance engineer father that enjoyed taking games apart and learning why things (especially game bugs) happened the way they did. Yes, using CE in game is against TOS, and therefor there isn't really anything wrong with the ban per the rules, but it seems strange to make an example of someone who wasn't malicious.
---
Bethesda/Zenimax are about as confusing as EA when it comes to decisions, but Bethesda will do as Bethesda does, I guess.
---
But why double down instead of silence? There's no logic
---
I guess I‚Äôm out of the loop, did something else happen after the post a few days ago about the bans? What posts are you referring to towards the end of your comment?
---
So, what happened to the other thread?
---
I saw this guy build his up on the monorail down south, pretty cool but a bitch to get into.
---
Can you give me the discord server
---
The highest priced single item I‚Äôve sold was a 3 star bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with FSS and reduced weight with extra claw mod for 8K.  
---
Like I said in another thread there are only (probably) about 8-10 weapons in this game that are worth that kind of money.
---
you're kidding right? have you seen the amount of statements that have been made that have either been ignored or had to be retracted because of the fact the person saying it didnt have the ability to enforce what was said. i have conversations with the community managers that show the situation. the fact that ive been outright told by a cm that they were unable to get any response from CS about what was going on shows that this is NOT true one bit.
---
thx :)
---
Bethesda, we hear you request for smaller vending machines and we're excited to tell you that we added it in the Atom shop for a small fee of $19.99. But wait you will need to be a FO1st member to buy it plus you get it at a reduced price. You only pay $19.65!!! What a steal.
---
So they ban someone to further upset them and then double down on it? To make the community think they're acting on behalf on them? Makes no sense
---
Yea these events make it seem pretty clear that Bethesda support is disconnected to some degree. I think that part of the company certainly needs improvement and has for a while now 
---
Happy to hear you watch, I try to stay pretty objective on what is happening. I don't think its really my job to convince you what to think or not think about this stuff
---
You can‚Äôt have an Bloodied explosive handmade with FFR.
---
Now that's just crazy talk.
---
He has been using the cheat engine to monitor the memory stream
---
In which according to Bethesda own EULA it's okay to use it as long as you didn't use the cheat engine for the purpose of modifying the game.
---
Btw you are talking about 2 totally different persons here. The dupe tester guy got banned after his friend reported the exploit. And the second guy tested an exploit that could lead to your account being stolen and then he got banned the next day for reporting it.
---
Not everyone appreciates my humor. This does not distress me.
---
And you're saying that they did that by banning a player and pissing off a community to not lose players and keep people on the hook. It makes no sense. Every other lie they did made sense
---
It's been a while, so I watched the whole thing. Awesome.
---
They didn‚Äôt return lost junk
---
They generated a replacement list. Bye bye hundreds of flux
---
Yeah, I discussed it with him elsewhere in this post yesterday. He confirmed the initial report was by someone who didn't even know he was also working on identifying what the exploit was and thus could not have informed BGS of his role in testing for it. So his not reporting just because of that initial report was sloppy. Still a stupid reason to persist as BGS chose to do.
---
To me it just sounds like you don't like negative-76 content. Which is fine, but I feel like I have just been covering what has been happening with the game. None of what I just talked about is "hearsay" imo
---
Burning a house is a terrible example though, the house didn't burn, the game wasn't ruined for anyone else. 
---
It's more like poking at a specific loose panel and being like "yeah, that wasn't put on right, you should fix that".
---
I feel your pain, I was so excited for my Bloodied smg...till I got to a work bench
---
Check out decoys dungeon on YouTube. He has a unique camp location series
---
No, Bethesda needs your money and dont give a damn about a bounty bug program!
---
I don't play 76 much, but I am active in several of the communities and follow the game pretty closely?
---
Ah. That totally makes sense for ghoulish briefcase fishers in the early part of the map. It didn't occur to me that Rad Resist would slow the ghoulish healing. (i've never run ghoulish myself). 
---
My Rad X comment was mostly what we see in the late game Nuke Zones, which now that I re-read isn't really what OP was talking about... ;)
---
The best are the jet pack plans that are listed at 5000 caps retail!!
---
Yes, and those aren't public statements on a board. That would require much more approval than a single ticket reply
---
It's like the people making FO76 had never played Fallout before and it's frustrating.
---
I just think Bethesda has been doing a lot of dumb stuff lately
---
That's a really cool and interesting idea. I hope they take notice of posts like these.
---
And you know I know it, and I know that you know that I know it, but are you aware that I know that you know that I know it?
---
Twisted muscles melee.

"Why don't you carry a gun?"

Because when I shoot, I hit everything except what I aim at.

Also cant do mothman wing, really killed my whole mothman cult look i was going for.
---
Thing is, you don't trust a liar. People lied about lots of things they would do or not do in Fallout 76. If People don't know say one thing and another one whom I know that he actually lied says another thing I would always trust the person I don't know more.
---
Give it an upvote and they just might. ;)
---
you break em, you buy em.
---
It was deleted by the mods, I asked for permission to repost.
---
Just did lol
---
Well being I haven't stayed too updated with Fallout I cannot give an answer on an update that isn't negative nor a positive update. In fact I recently joined reddit to see more and learn more about updates since the "inside the vaults" have seemed lackluster in information.
---
All I'm trying to say is he does/says some things that can just irritate me because of how minute the issue is. As I keep mentioning the atomic shop complaints. Plus instead of sitting here and calling Juicehead bad, I said he wasn't and wanted to expand my reach for information on fallout. I didn't expect voicing my opinion and asking to be less ignorant to be a bad thing.
---
Do you want to kill legendary sheepsquatches in 2 seconds?
---
One big bloody hole is all you need plus a bulldozer, use the Dozer to fill the hole after first depositing Bethesda in it.
---
Uh... I mean isn't that fair?
---
How could you not be mad from seeing the same as jacket that could be obtained from a random corpse in Fallout 4 be sold as a cosmetic in FO76 that you could only buy after grinding or spending some money.
---
It depends on what‚Äôs being hoarded 
---
When they did the legendary weapon events I was able to pick up a few of them including Action Hero that I paid 1500 caps for at a vendor. I still have a Sole Survivor I bought months ago for about 2000 caps.  I would imagine I could fetch a decent price for each of them now.
---
Short, controlled bursts
---
Sounds like a good way to get epic camp vs camp artillery duel's
---
That plus a cash register.
---
That's so smart! Cripple so new ones don't repsawn.
---
Full set of sneak armor?
---
This is hilarious oh my gawd gj üòÇ
---
I believe Yong Yea and Skill-Up are far worse at it than JuiceHead is, those are far larger culprits who abuses the hate on F76 for their own monetary gain.
---
Its frankly disgusting to watch the so called "Gaming Journalists" spew so much inaccuracy, all because they hate a company with such burning rage.
---
There is a ton of flash ferns by the fissure everyone nukes down south in the northeast area there that is always nuked, just look for violet in clumps that are in the patches of forest
---
My PSN is Bobbyfnshaffer. 
---
I just sent you a request. 
---
I play the same schedule.
---
Yes. I don't even blueprint, just make sure it has any other item sitting onit, frog har plushie whatever. When I move camp they are stored because of the stacking I guess, and when I put them back up everything is still assigned.
---
wait waa it doesn‚Äôt have a suppresser
---
Full set unyielding weight reduction - you don‚Äôt need anything but utility with such setup
---
&gt;falloutsettlements 
---
Isn't that sub for Fallout 4?
---
To me it didn't come in the base, Vanilla game and Bethesda does need money to keep the lights on while also giving almost 70-100 atoms a day for challenges. Yes some things can be overpriced but if I have to complete several challenges  in a week or give Bethesda $5, I dont really care what fallout game it came from and was free in. 
---
So I can understand how he can be annoyed by it. We all get bothered by different things but to me,any atomic shop complaint usually just makes me skip ahead a minute or two.
---
&gt; I believe Yong Yea and Skill-Up are far worse at it than JuiceHead is, those are far larger culprits who abuses the hate on F76 for their own monetary gain.
---
There's a ton of them.  Juice head was just one example that came to mind. I just used him as an example.
---
discord.gg/5y3tBBC
---
thank you for your interest
---
They're not bad, but i wouldnt say they are game breakingly good either. Just make sure to come back often and empty it as once their internal inventory fills up it completely stops production.
---
Out of the other ones you can use I wouldn‚Äôt say so I use a lead then have my robot collect junk
---
They banned someone who didn't deserve to be banned and want to mislead the community into thinking they did deserve it. 
---
&gt; "There have been cases where players have used third-party software to take advantage of an exploit usually in excess of hundreds of times."
---
This sentence right here is a deliberate misdirection, read between the lines man, that means there are instances people have been banned without repeatedly taking advantage of it.
---
They do not directly address the specific person or even the details of the specific circumstance. Just "some people have been banned for repeatedly using an exploit" - not "the situation in question involved someone who repeatedly used an exploit".
---
Meh... they‚Äôre ok. I‚Äôve stopped looking for resource spots like that because it‚Äôs faster just to go out and get the things you need
---
Your right it‚Äôs /fallout76settlements I don‚Äôt know how to tag sorry
---
This just makes you seem like even more of an asshole. Get off your high horse, if it was a joke than it was shit and in bad taste. If it wasnt than youre an asshat
---
My PsN is Bobbyfnshaffer. I usually just event hop.
---
They're not publically traded
---
I find that using an automatic weapon greatly helps me with my storage problems. Whenever my stash gets full, I just make ammo for my 10mm. ;)
---
I would've liked this, but discord ain't my thing.
---
Read the lines above it or under it
---
Thanks guys. Blue screening a million times was awesomely mischievous alright. Well played! üòÇ
---
I think the issue, in my opinion, is that an exploit, any exploit, should not be a bannable offense from Bethesda, but should be treated as a cheese, or a big that should simply be prioritized as a fix that needs to be done from the devs.
---
I play a lot of Borderlands, and in 2, you could duplicate weapons. None of the players were banned for doing such and the devs took it upon themselves to not police their player base, but instead fix the exploit in BL3.
---
Take a note from a better dev and stop criminalizing your playerbase because they aren‚Äôt playing the game the way you intend to, instead just fix your game.
---
Don‚Äôt shoot back that‚Äôs a good start!
---
What would you say is the best resource deposit then? Also how good is the scrap bot? Saw it was very cheap to get.
---
It's really odd how there's a number of items you just can't display. They even forgot the Mr. Jangles doll that you can find almost anywhere.
---
GW2 is non subscription, it's true.  DDO has a premium subscription.  SWTOR also is an MMO that doesnt allow this stuff and has a premium subscription.
---
Fallout 76 is technically not a pure subscription game.  It does have (an very recent) premium subscription, sort of.  
---
Another thing common to all of these games is they all have cash shops with utility (i.e. non-cosmetic) items.
---
It still seems like it isn't most games that allow this.  Some small fraction of games maybe do.  But it's not the general rule, at all.
---
Murgle's house in the ash heap's because Murgle! You can do the same thing with the one dog in the Mire. Buried train cars in the mire are cool to. The one house south of nuka cola plant with the radroach sitting on the toilet, lol.
---
At least give it something, even the lonely rear sight is terrible. It's basically just a folded piece of metal with a tiny hole in it, strangely reminiscent of WW2 grease guns I guess.
---
They really need to post in the atom store how much camp budget items take up.
---
[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dvfup2/players_are_not_banned_for_reporting_issues_andor/f7dtdjq/?context=3) with the original map76 guy and his comments in that thread mostly.
---
I can't argue that. I was excited for wastelanders only to hear it get pushed back and replaced with Fallout 1st. Though some of my opinions differ and maybe it's because I'm on console and I have a different experience than PC users, so hackers aren't as prominent, but your opinions are justified, I just can't agree on a few of the things.
---
People were pissed because it was a Fallout 1st subscriber issue that got fixed quickly, and some other bugs are still out there.
---
I agree, your titles are a bit too cb for me but you honestly try to explain all sides.  Keep up the great work.
---
If you‚Äôre using guns lead or iron then the scarp bot isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs better then anything else in the atomic shop
---
You don‚Äôt get detected without any Sneak perks and armor?  Maybe I can save some perk points and use them for something else then.
---
Coming soon to an Atom Shop and FO1st near you. Buy your very own indoor planter in the atom shop, and FO1st subs no longer have to worry about crops taking up their camp budget!
---
They still have shareholders but randoms like me and you can't buy a part of Bethesda. Its the people who invested/founded the company owning a certain stake. Think of people investing on that show shark tank, they would become shareholders
---
I've run into this bug numerous times myself.  After you're bugged the only way to kill anything coming at you is with a melee weapon.  Thanks for posting!  Did you send a service ticket to Beth as well?
---
I'd rather pay for something that useful than a $10 power armor skin, or a $8 table, tbh
---
How much does it actually collect and how fast?
---
Maybe if there was a larger build able space for farming crops. Maybe that can be a future selling point for private servers(grow large farms worth of crops etc)
---
Make it like the SMG from Halo ODST üòâ
---
I know never happen unless it‚Äôs a mod.
---
Several raiders tell stories about him if you sneak up on them, including the pair out behind the hardware store and the two guys in the parking garage west of the Church/Tower with Radio Guy in it.   
---
"By the way, this guys got nothing on him... A DESK FAN? Who carries around a DESK FAN?" LOL
---
Honestly, this is what I imagined at the beginning of launch. I thought nuking areas, would open up unique events and insane boss encounters. I know we have the Queen, but I was hoping for more bosses depending on the region that gets nuked.
---
No, because u use suppressor, wallhack with vats and absurd amount of damage even without sneak - 2-3k per crit on head. It‚Äôs broken - trust me.
---
And then you decided to add a user flair for pure bants
---
I feel for your situation but this is essentially "grey hat" hacking and there should never be an expectation that a company will not ban you (or worse) indiscriminately, regardless of your other contributions. Penetration/exploit testing is a sticky area and there may be many legal and other precedents that won't allow for an appeal. The testing you were doing is also different than simple NW cheating, the same way smoking meth is different than cooking it. Doing this testing on the same game client your account used was also sloppy, you should have done it in a VM or a completely separate "throw away" PC with no tangible relations. I say this as someone who's done this for a living and also "as a hobby" and learned firsthand how little it is appreciated - particularly when it was not sanctioned by anything but my own hubris. Ultimately your passion and ingenuity has (and will continue) to lead you to great things but can also be your undoing. I don't blame you for your insatiable curiosity though. I'm sure you will find another game if you don't return to this one. You are Batman but always remember Batman wears a mask and is neither a criminal or a sanctioned agent of the state.
---
I don‚Äôt really know I just collect it all and then if I need that junk I put it in my stash and I normally go to my camp every 30 minutes or so and it seems to get full pretty fast
---
So this is regular stash box not the fallout first junk one. It just started happening after fallout first was released so I was thinking they could be related (or they could be completely separate issues) and since it is happening on private server I figure it‚Äôs not server overload related.
---
It's good for crystal shards and screws.
---
Wow.  Did they give a reason?
---
If you wear the bathrobe it flaps open all the time when you run around.
---
I‚Äôm on the Xbox
---
Building in 76 is pretty much trial and error. 
---
First off, scrap everything. Weapons, armor, junk, everything. You get plans to build weapons/armor their mods, from scrapping them. Once you've scrapped stuff, THEN put it in your stash. If you die, you lose any junk you have on you. It's best to stash as often as you can without totally ruining your flow. 
---
Second, in regards to CAMP building; every single building piece (walls, floors, roofs) HAS to have a foundation. You can't just build "floors" on the ground. They should rename those "second story floors", but once you figure that out I guess it doesn't need to be repeated. 
---
The "easiest" way to build is what people are calling "floating" camps. You put down a single foundation, then a stair up, and build from there. This helps early on when you decide you want to move around a bit before settling down. Once you get a hang of how building works, or find that perfect spot you love, then build a more complex structure.
---
The items people have in their CAMPS come from Plans. You need Plans to build everything, except stuff from the Atom Shop. There are a LOT of plans. Easy ways to get starter plans are taking workshops and defending them from mobs. If another player takes your workshop, just run away. Workshops are the only PvP left in the game, so if someone contests your workshop, they're out to kill you. It's not worth it early on to try and take them on, you'll most likely be super outmatched. You can place junk items in the "Display" cases, but not place them on shelves or tables, or whatevs.
---
Junk extractors are good.
---
There used to be a detailed map which showed markers for resources, ore, everything you could ever need. But Bethesda kicked the one guy's butt up over his head whom managed the map.
---
Now we don't have anything to help make sense of this dumpster fire train wreck of a game.
---
Someone at Xbox once said "that game you think is dead isn't actually dead". Bethesda had lower expectations for this game than something like Fallout 4. I think most of the franchise's fans want something from this game that it was never supposed to deliver. There's a community for a game like this. So long as Wastelanders satisfies that base, it doesn't need to go to new heights to attract EVERYONE.
---
Which is totally fine imo. I try to position my videos in a way where they inform first and give my opinion after. Like if you think Fallout 1st is the best thing to get added to this game and these dataminers deserve bans I am not here to say you're wrong, I just don't agree (not saying you think that just an example)
---
Or just one vending machine that doesn't have a limit on storage. I have plans to sell, weapons to sell,ammo, scrap,but the 30 limit really pushes things back if I'm in a lobby with people who aren't buying anything.
---
Honestly never thought of that. I really like the idea, especially if it decreases VATS cost per shot like some of the mods that increase hip-fire.
---
Don't know, but this is annoying, half my garden area is made of the most "earthy" looking water I have ever seen!
---
Apparently no
---
i actually have a statement from the CM saying that she posted that because the CS gave that to her to post. If you don't believe me message me on discord Eckserah#0001
---
No, you find more junk to scrap just by walking around. Assuming there's no specific junk you're looking for you can also just kill ghouls, since they'll often have anything on them. Certain enemy types carry specific junk items as well: super mutants can have loose screws, yao guai can carry springs, mole miners have junk that can scrap into black titanium, etc. The only real use for them is roleplaying a junk baron, or pretending you got a factory or something.
---
Not cheat engines. Just Cheat Engine. It's the most popular cheating platform on PC, and Bethesda was stupid enough to ignore it.
---
And it would have worked too, if not for you meddling kids!
---
Actually there is still [fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com) which I use.
---
Believe what you want, the motivation is damage control and it's absolutely ridiculous saying "well there's no reason for it this time".
---
Even if there wasn't that means you understand and fully accept they can and most likely will lie again to make money and you're defending them? That's laughably sad.
---
faction TDM would be wonderful. Based on datamines it seemed like they tested it at some point (probably before NW). There is also effectively TDM with that fort event, but you lose items
---
I thought they let him go because they were confused
---
The sound is from Serendipity.
---
You know that's going to happen. Name one game changing addon that was free and not in the Atom shop.
---
woosh?
---
Tag checks out
---
To me the solution still seems as simple as others have suggested : a test server that has no connection to the adventure mode where you are allowed to exploit, cheat and test to your hearts content (so long as you report it) without fear of punishment. This is where new builds would go for a time before being published to production.
---
I think starting work at a workbench will work indefinitely, only ever left it for like 15min.
---
Nerd Rage does it too I'm certain. Thought Dodgy and Cav did it as well, but hey I've been wrong before. :)
---
Wasn‚Äôt that Event pulled from the available event pool? 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as faction. Just player v player, killfest. Strip it down to barebones. That way new ideas can be added down the road.
---
I think the list might be more manageable if someone just marked up all the non-buildable areas, and maybe highlight some of the sweet spots.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking!!
---
Can you explain your statement first though?
---
A Cat??
---
Most of the placement rules dont make sense. If the object is green, I should be able to fucking place it!
---
So what would you say is the most useful resource deposit to camp?
---
Acid probably because it‚Äôs used to smelt lead and make gun powder
---
Someone is oversensitive about their purchasing habits.
---
Oh was it? I haven't played it in months so most likely. I would love even just as a somewhat jank limited time event a FFA/TDM in the morgantown NW map. Give us something to hold over until Wastelanders
---
Wait the meathook stacks with multiple perks?
---
FC is da place to be brotha
---
Why didn't the data miners use a alternate that they don't care about to do the bug testing?
---
I did a feedback ticket with a link to this video. Hit them up on Twitter, too. 
---
By the way, grenades still work with this bug.  You can shoot them with vats after the bug happens, too.  Killed a lot of them with panic plasmas in this video. And myself. ;)
---
Bethesda is getting all the bad press they deserve. Fuck them. They keep that middle finger up to their player base, and we are giving it back a hundred fold.
---
Atoms cat power armor mabye?
---
I think they means Atom Cat?
---
Oh yea I hadn't even considered a cheating allowed PTS, but you're right that sounds like an excellent solution. 
---
I think a test server would fix a lot of the games lingering problems
---
Federal law and normal Terms of service are a big difference buddy.
---
F1st doesn't equal atomic shop. Atomic shop takes atoms. F1st is a cash only endeavor
---
Those channels are irrelevant if bugthesda dosnt feed there mindless fire of rage !
---
I likes to spam them at people who are being jerk
---
As far as know it was. Map swapping on NW would be a good start.  
---
But having ffa in the WS would be cool. 
---
I pitched an infected mode a while back that has stalled out. But imo anything to break up the base game would be a godsend.
---
And you've done an excellent job at that may I add. I've been subscribed for a long time and if I need Fallout news I know where to go. I'm just voicing my opinion to yours and maybe I'm being a bit harsh and I apologize if I am. There's a lot of stuff that Bethesda has done which has been awful. I kind of wished Fallout 1st was to have access to a PTR and private servers were free. Like I've said, maybe it's the console/PC difference since I dont experience all these issues or hackers that PC players experience. I cant go through several NW matches and never meet a hacker. The only real problem we have is griefers and people who dupe so much it crashes the server. So I can guess you/PC players may be more frustrated with Bethesda than i would be, and I'm not taking that into account.
---
Indeed. Fallout 1st should include a feature allowing you to hold as much junk as yoh want or ammo or chems, something... maybe you have to pick a perk?
---
Don't expect this would be a solution but have you attempted removing and replacing the stash box?  
---
Hows your internet bandwidth?
---
or are those channels feeding the mindless fire of rage?
---
true true !
---
Stay Filthy !!
---
They did and still do, the person in question had 6 accounts. They were just confused on the ban and tried to appeal it because the issue was something they reported to Betehsda. Being banned in the first place made no sense.
---
They are literally accessed in the atomic shop.
---
I like the idea a lot, I‚Äôd definitely love to have that aspect of roleplay! It would get me to invest in a second toon and the whole RobCo vs General Atomics sounds intriguing, like RobCo has their pip-boys and pip-pads and then general atomics could have their own PDA system with VATS just being re-acronymed the Vision-Assisted-Targeting-System instead 
---
I love your idea and have got an upvote from me üòµ
---
Yes Nerd Rage does whenever you hit 20% health, I believe Dodgy and Cav doesn't make any sound.
---
I have a ton of stuff in my normal stash and have mad lag when interacting with it. I play on Xbox but I doubt platform matters.
---
Mine idea too
---
Damage control when they're lying is nonsensical. There isn't a logical reason and you haven't provided one. 
---
Yeah probably, I never denied they lie to make money. They're scummy and do that often which I said in my post. They make no money off of this. You're blinded by rage and ignoring logical thought. Every other lie was awful but I don't think this was a lie. 
---
Unless you can tell me a concrete logical motivation as to why they would lie that makes sense, I don't know what else to tell ya
---
Okay you got me there. Where else are they gonna put them, though?
---
There shouldnt even be placement rules who the fuck cares if i have tatos in the lake it doesnt affect anyone
---
Back packs?
---
What?
---
I would have given him some spoiled meat/veggies.
---
Thank you1 I definitely think it would bring a lot more depth to the Fallout universe, and agree that it would bring a great new aspect of RP into the game.
---
Bethesda dosent care what you want
---
They know about this one, but just don't care enough to fix it. It's very annoying.
---
Funny you choose him, lol, he usually try to be positive about the game... But then again, everyone are either a hater or a fanboy. Both fanatic sides are pretty tiersome. But in my opinion the ‚Äùnothing is wrong‚Äù are the worse.
---
I only sell 556 bc it‚Äôs kind of a meta rn with the explosive handmades
---
Yes which wouldn't happen if it wasn't true because no company would do that. It makes no sense. I don't doubt that happened but I cannot see why they would intentionally double down on a lie for damage control. It doesn't make sense.
---
I still haven't been able to complete one of these. My partner hates the 94 missions, so we've only tried a couple times. My char is over 150, but I'm a Char/int support build, so soloing it won't happen. I try to find PUGs when I'm on by myself, but haven't found anything yet.
---
If you can't tell the difference between Hellfire Armor and a cat, there's simply no possible way that you can tell the difference between Whizzo butter and a dead crab.
---
This response amused me so much that I went to seek out your videos (I hadn't seen them), pretty good stuff man!
---
I myself haven't had to rely on extractors for material needs. Personally I would avoid relying on a resource deposit and instead find a wide open space to build a lot of water purifiers (the ground type). For those that I have encountered that do use extractors they tended to prioritize acid and lead deposits, for ammo production.    Aluminum might be a good one as well, since I can't think of any specific enemy (besides your random ghoul) that could drop it as loot .
---
Because people either have tons of them or have to be specific builds to use the ammo.
---
You knowingly exploited the game repeatedly and used 3rd party tools to cheat.  Stop trying to appeal to the masses with this unrelated bs.
---
it has cat ears....... right
---
I am a human.  
---
Humans sometimes make mistakes.
---
What I didn't do was revert profane kid-slang to try to prove I am smarter than everyone else. 
---
You should take the advice of the other posters in this thread, tally your loss and move on.  Unless you are trying to sink your Karma to 0.
---
lmaooo boy if you don‚Äôt
---
It‚Äôs a Power Armour Skin you can apply to all variants of suits, when you earn it (I think it‚Äôs level 100 in NW). It‚Äôs a skin of the Enclave Hellfire armour from Fallout 3‚Äôs Broken Steel DLC
---
well yeah but, me and my friend argued that it was either horns, or ears, on the helmet haha. that‚Äôs what i meant.
---
It hasn't been released *yet*, but I mean. Stay tuned.
---
It'll come.
---
What content check?
---
Yeah about 3 serums with full unyielding or close will give you like 1300 caps
---
Am adult, but don't think adult. Much immature, much childishness. Same same...but implicitly differential.
---
Ah that makes sense, but no horns or ears. A full skin model like the Liberty Prime Power Armour skin
---
Oh, so you thought it *looks* like a Cat?
---
It's not based on anything besides itself. The Hellfire Power Armor in Fallout 76 (And it's Creation Club template from Fallout 4) is an "HD" version of the Hellfire Power Armor from Fallout 3.
---
It's simply a suit of High Tech Armor, drawing no more aesthetic inspiration from anything than any of the T or X models.
---
Nobody uses those guns seems like the obvious answer
---
Damb
---
No one uses them hardly, plus they drop so frequently or are so easy to make, no one wants to pay for them.
---
I wonder if number of items matter.
---
okay, yeah that‚Äôs what i was wondering haha. could‚Äôve sworn this whole time that it was supposed to look like a cat!
---
This would be nice, cause I'd like a good reason to make one of my characters look like Danny Devito.
---
Being afraid of something and not wanting anything to do with something are 2 completely different things.
---
If you look around all ammo sells for 1cap so if someone's paying they wont waste it on weaker ammo they'll just pay for the stronger rounds
---
I buy SG shells all the time but most Shotgunners have moved on since the nerf honestly
---
You can find the plans for like 7.5k on xbox they‚Äôre heavily duped. People got like 70 speed demon recipes in there stash.
---
I smell a fallout 1st exclusive!
---
The underground train cars are super cool. Had my camp there for a few weeks. Level 3 safe, cap stash, med containers. Some good stuff to scrap, including a full Giddyup.
---
It would be nice if we got a Vending Machine that was designed to look like the Fallout 3 or New Vegas Nuka Cola Machine. I would honestly love to have one. Probably would sell Nuka Colas out of it at fair prices, but still.
---
Railway spikes are not in demand.  Very few people use railway rifles.  Even less people use harpoon guns.
---
.38 is the most common ammo in the game, everything drops it.  Also, people rarely use pipe guns past level 20 with the exception of a few people running the rifleman/pipegun tree (which is lackluster at best because the guns are shit)
---
10mm is just as common as .38.  There is no demand for it because its all over the place.
---
.44s, well, its a slow low capacity gun that is outperformed by every other pistol in the game.  I would rather have a pipe pistol for the extra capacity than a .44.
---
All of these ammo types to have a chance of selling should be sold for 1:1.  If you are trying for more than 1 cap per ammo, then noone will buy it.
---
Except that I have PROOF that this is not the case. I have conversations with the community managers as well as all my tickets to prove that I did not use any sort of exploit but was still suspended for a total of 13 days. Customer service wants to make themselves seem like they are actually doing something, but as in the case of the Map76 guy it was over a month that they received no replies. Also players who are getting permanently banned are having all access to the account revoked even though they have the RIGHT according to bethesda's ToS to appeal the decision. There are definite issues with the CS team that are trying to be covered up by them.
---
It‚Äôs not F1st causing it, I‚Äôm on PS4 and had the issue before 1st launched. It‚Äôs a scripting delay after adding/removing an item which makes it look really slow when navigating
---
Boy you are in here talking shit about console players for no reason are you sure it isnt you that overly sensitive about what they bought
---
At the end of the day, we see the things we want to see, I suppose.
---
...I kind of want to see a Cat themed Power Armor Set now. Or at least a Helmet.
---
I forgot about the back packs. Anything else?
---
This happens at both camp and train stations. Not sure about item count. It could be a lot... especially since I no longer store junk in the stash box
---
Yup. The sound is serendipity proccing. The other effects don't make a sound.
---
Any idea of a good wide open area in the starting region or that black region south? I like to stick around there.
---

ok, I don't have that mutation - so maybe I'm only cro-magnon.

Spastic SBs and erratic strategic cargobots are hard enough to hit in the air as it is....
---
Usually we do. In my case I don't have characters that are leveled to 50 other than on my main so in order to test some exploits I HAVE to use my main because the amount of time it takes to level to 50 is quite a large amount. At least in my case
---
Brew stations/Fermenters.
---
Neat
---
They are $40 a piece. If it gets banned every time, you are now paying Beth $40 to fix a bug for them. But, I think somehow this is their intention with the bans. Here is the ban email, for those of you who haven't got one.  Notice half of it is to make sure to let you know, that YOU are not banned. But you account it and you are absolutely free to buy another one.
---
 Greetings,  
---
Due to the extent and scale of the violation, it has been decided that the ban on this account will remain in place, and that all services related to this account shall remain deactivated permanently.  
---
**Please note that we only ban an account, not a player. That is to say, you are still free to play our game. But this account will not be eligible to return. You can create a new account and play on that one, but it will be subject to all the same rules and regulations this one is.**  
---
This decision was not made lightly, and it is final.

I want to be able to get the vault tec sink, toilet, hell maybe even a 1x1 shower that could snap into place. Would also be nice to get some more tile floors, given that so many have been shown in the datamined atom shop files.
---
I honestly don't even want mod status in the game. I just want this to be a game people will come back to because things are actually being done and worked on. A lot of people leave because of the rampant bugs and exploits and I think that a lot would come back if those things were fixed to a  large degree.
---
we use that as more of a home page and way for us to keep together easier than the xbox messages.  We don't use it in game for anything at this point.  more so used to ask for help and see what others are up to.
---
But thank you for checking out the post,  feel free to DM me if you change your mind and want the link
---
I usually sell shotgun shells @ 1C per. Other ammo I list for 0
---
- .44 is honestly the most useless ammo in the game. It is only used by 2 revolvers. Most people dont use pistols because theyre underpowered, and if they do, theyre running full auto pistols. 
---
- Idk why the 10mm isnt selling, i buy it all the time. 
---
- 2mm is only used by gauss rifles, its super heavy so people tend not to carry a lot. 
---
- .38 ammo is super easy to come by, and only used by maybe 2 weapons the pipe pistol/rifle, and if someone decides to mod their combat rifle to .38. Its not worth 1 cap per bullet is the main reason no one buys them. 
---
- harpoons are pointless to sell. People only tend to use a harpoon gun if its explosive, and they mod it a flechette. When this is done, you always loot more ammo from bodies then you spend killing them. Its basically infinite ammo.
---
If you check the comment section of MMO Fails, the author mentions his sources informed him that the Map76 guy did actually hack using Cheat Engine. He also never reported any of his exploits and was apparently caught with multiple exploited items in his inventory. Take that as you will, but just remember there‚Äôs always two sides to a story.

The discord is our community area to chat about grouping up, selling/trading, and all sorts of neighborly tips. But the Xbox club is what‚Äôs necessary to play with the collective. If you have a specific aversion to discord, we can‚Äôt help with that. It is a very useful app.

Wasn‚Äôt there a dupping  bug about moving items back and forth really fast? Could a slow down been part of a ‚Äúfix‚Äù
---
The weight limit is the key problem you have to pick just a couple of weapons I like the shotgun so I did buy some ammo from one person but it lasts for a while as I pick up from the Dead, I wish I could keep one of every weapon on me then every ammo would be useful but fast travel would not be possible

Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
They'd need to ban the account, the IP address, mac address, etc. Even that isn't enough - those things can be changed / spoofed by knowledgeable players.
---
Character is obviously not a good boi. Have you tried giving him treats?

Is this from yesterday?

We are all here to have fun, childishness is often encouraged
---
I forgot to mention that it is a lvl 45
---
And... just list them all. Im wanting to see if the base game is worth the full price or has the game fallen to a pay to win. Also note the sarcasm in the above post. Apparently some people don't get it.
---
This is really cool! To bad Bethesda will probably make being a waistlander a fallout 1st thing
---
Sole Survivor/The Resident: üëÄ
---
I can move some shotgun cells for 1c each, not as fast as the 5.56, but every once in a while someone just buys all of them, but the other ones I just drop it as soon as possible because they're just a waste of space and I can't move them even for 0c each.
---
I don't do this event anymore but in their defense they probably don't have a weaker weapon on them.
---
 The 3 guns I carry around will one shot a mole miner no matter what.  I don't care enough to carry around a lower tiered weapon hogging up my weight.
---
Ok thanks I missed this post. I saw the one the was posted by someone else after that was on at the top for a couple days.
---
Not sure what you mean
---
Well, as the others have explained it is from Fallout, but I feel it should also be said that it's exactly the sort of thing you should expect from Fallout.
---
Ideally, it'd be free. We can only hope.
---
&gt; Buried train cars in the mire are cool to.
---
This is one of my favorite little spots in Appalachia so far and I don't remember seeing a CAMP there yet...
---
I‚Äôm not sure if that might‚Äôve been the case or not as I bury my head in the sand when it comes to exploits but the slowed storage menu happened same time they removed the ability to scroll through without actually entering it directly in exchange for server stability so I assumed it was that but could‚Äôve been both
---
Take my upvote too
---
That isn't my job.  And your sarcasm lands more like poorly executed/hacky humor.  Have a good day.
---
Item has been changed on the server. Previous transaction has been terminated. üòñüòñüòñüòñ
---
It's not a repost it if you watched it happen yourself OP
---
The exploit itself may have been reported before. I didn't think I had to explain that. :D
---
I had a theory that the bans were a means of Bethesda to resell copies of this game to diehard fans. There are stores selling it for as low as $5 I believe so they gotta clear out those warehouses and push those sale numbers somehow.
---
We adults in the Collective, playing a video game, are also childish at times. Yet we have a great community of FO76 enthusiasts that get to be a bit immature without the presence of impressionable youths.
---
Yes, thank you good sir.
---
Shhh...don‚Äôt give em‚Äô any ideas.
---
I think the issue is that person has credibility in the eyes of the community and has in the past, with others and up until the ban actively let people and Bethesda know what they were doing.
---
If he were kung midas sitting on a pile of gold in game sure, but people do bug hunting, others do technical bug hunting to stop malicious  people. Companies with poor security need public reporters or they will be compromised to some bad homies.
---
True. If MMO Fails is to be believed, the Map76 guy is just upset he got caught. He isn‚Äôt as innocent as he wants people to believe he is.

Never going to happen with this engine.

You don't, but it's also not your job to test it.
---
My main characters camp (which is predominantly purifiers) is actually located south of Flatwoods. There's a fair amount of open space along the area underneath the New River Gorge Bridge, east of the Cow Spots Creamery. I hardly encounter a world instance where someone else's camp conflicts with mine, plus there's minimal enemy attacks (no spawn nearby, and turrets target relatively fast since its flat terrain)
---
The Ash Heap region has a lot of open space as well, but I wouldn't really recommend it due to the constant air hazard, unless you're always wearing a mask. Its not really deadly, but more of an annoyance.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is a good idea or not but people who care to make these posts with detailed ideas need to get involved in the game development industry. It could use passionate people.
---
I almost feel sorry for him...   naaaaaa.
---
Spot on here
---
Were the exploits done hundreds of times as Bethesda alleged?
---
I got one! NewtGingrinch on PC. I get many compliments. It's a mining themed camp.
---
I‚Äôve got it from fly swatter and either tea time or sweet waters honey quest.  I did them both back to back and noticed I had another in inventory soon after.
---
I actually saved the video of me getting it from fly swatter in case people claim it won‚Äôt drop from that.  I about fell off my chair when I got it.
---
Well, I'm getting a bachelors degree in Game Art - so, kinda?   
---
I really want to get into creative writing as well.
---
I bet you did! Fingers crossed on this pursuit.
---
NICE, all y'all have the gold icon and it seems yall run the agriculture strategy. Welp, I gotta craft all the pieces of the power armor and thorn, so can we work out a deal since I gotta do the raids alot for the steel,  If I'd tried to pay with caps, I'd go into the negatives, maybe I can farm fluxes for y'all or something?
---
My wife isn‚Äôt too much into raids either but she‚Äôs fine with this one as you can rather quickly master it and reliably complete on all difficulties as a team of 2.
---
I was a bit annoyed that they had such a large footprint when they released,
---
it's mainly the little 'for sale' type sign hanging off the side that's an issue, without that it would have about the same footprint as crafting tables.
---
So Vat kills still work after the bug if I seeing this correctly?
---
Do you know how many bases would get nuked by trolls. Pretty much all of them, really.
---
Maybe I can convince her to try it tonight on novice. We'll see how it goes.
---
&gt; But hey I'm sure I'll get downvoted by those "brand reputation" accounts for speaking out against Bethesda, pretty sure I'm on a watch list or something at this point. 
---
This, is not discussed enough. Everyone is saying Beth has been silent on here, they have not. They have dozens or more of these  "brand reputation"  or "brand ambassador" accounts that are talking on here, and they are talking a lot.
---
It took me a good while to figure this one out when I started. Great you got some help :).
---
Whitespring kitchen usually sells it, sometimes "he" doesn't have it though
---
Just the two items were added into the game for free?
---
Uh-huh. Then, on the other hand: motherfucking Bethesda. 
---
Please stop pretending that you‚Äôre this stupid.
---
It was a joke üò¨
---
Jump some player vendors, buy armour pieces with poison resist, reduced dmg from bugs or ghouls and then you should have fun, just don‚Äôt give up if you mess up in reactor room, first couple times it feels difficult.
---
Send me a dm! Are you above 18?
---
So we should report any possible exploit without first checking that it is an exploit.   
---
So basically just keep reporting everything and anything, in case once tested by professionals, it turns out to be an exploit?   
---
Sounds like thats going to waste a lot of peoples time and get bethesda to start ignoring reports.
---
Uh-huh. Then, on the other hand, motherfucking Bethesda.
---
Please stop pretending that you are this stupid.
---
That's another thing I did on my third character, I just picked up any and all ammo (bullets, not bolts and cannon balls etc), set up vending machine to sell the ammo I don't use and use the money to buy the ammo I do need at other players vendors.
---
You can't argue against the issue of proportionality so I guess it makes sense that you'd deflect. Shows how weak you're original point is.
---
Thanks so much for this
---
If I remember correctly they were banned for attempting an account stealing exploit to test it. If they did it even once I understand the choice to ban them. Yet if they did an account stealing exploit "hundreds of times" shouldn't the people's whose account were at risk (Implying that the person using the exploit did so with malicious intentions) be notified of any account security flaw? Shouldn't there be a player-wide notification to change passwords? If the bug in question broke out and hundreds of people's accounts were at risk shouldn't Bethesda notify legitimately anyone? Yet the only people bringing this bug in question to the communities attention was the data miners after it was patched and they were banned for retesting it. The bug was much more serious than any duping exploit, yet the reward for reporting it was a big fat ban.
---
Give us something like the galactic terminals in No Mans Sky (I forget the exact name). They snap onto the wall and let you do your trading there
---
And that's exactly what makes them even worse.
---
I'm pretty sure they don't do this to make your camp placement strategic. You want a lot of lead? Find a lead vein or a good source of it and farm away. Want firecracker berries? Place your camp in an area or in a region with a lot of them.
---
I'm not saying I totally disagree with you. Just some food for thought.
---
You don't (and won't) have enough information to speak with authority on the issue of the person who got banned.  You don't know what all of the activities were that took place, or how they were done.  You have the word of one person, who you're assuming won't lie or even skew the story to put himself in a better light, or if the place you're getting your second-hand information has correctly reported it (where that applies).
---
I don't have an opinion of note on the subject, but it should be pointed out that you're advocating the innocence of someone you don't know without the luxury of knowing what actually happened.
---
Oh please, bugger of 
---
Superiority complex. Go troll of other people !
---
Am fascinated, will considerate joining maturely Collection
---
I didn‚Äôt think you could even place/play instruments in NW?
---
Yep to me this is the crux of the problem - Bethesda's incompetent communications.  If they spoke to the guy instead of banning him, or after banning him, or explained what happened after the fact, or did anything except stick their damn head in the sand since day 1... 
---
the problem with the YT coverage I've seen is that the white-hat wannabe exploit/bug finding team are treated as community heroes doing nothing but good and a lot of us can see some fault in hacking away at the game till it breaks then complaining when the company hands your ass to you.  Like you might want to arrange that with the company before hand.  And if they say no, at least you know to expect a ban, and also that they're jerks ..
---
Yes they are. At no point did I defend the other lies or the company as a whole. This specific instance has no clear motivation in my opinion.
---
So what I'm getting from this is you and your teammates need to get good...
---
Nor I. I tested other instruments, they'd don't work. This individual places it facing outward. When playing it, they moved through the wall. Stop playing and you're in. We heard foot steps inside a closed off building.. they proceeded to fire at us killing the squad.
---
Ok "brand ambassador". It is weird the dozens of post that bring up the same 2 things over and over that I have responded to over and over, and they all twist what I have said, in the exact same way. It is really sad that there is some script that apparently is being handed to the brand ambassadors that says "Just keep saying he lied, used third party cheat tools, and that you are happy he is banned"
---
Tell them to refresh your script, it needs an update.
---
Reporting it here does next to nothing.  Reporting it to BGS at least has a chance of getting noticed.
---
If 1 person reports an exploit, there's not a lot of reason to believe it will get acted on, but if a lot of people do, they'll take it seriously.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Don't get me wrong, i disagree with these bans
---
But, im sure in the fine print of the agreement we agree to by playing the game, there'll be something about using 3rd party software to view or modifying game files. By being a data miner, using a cheat engine to find the cause for bugs/exoits is breaking this agreement, whatever your intentions.
---
Now, while i understand why Bethesda are doing it, and they have every right to, its one hell of a dick move. They should create some kind of bug-finders agreement, allowing some people to do this to help, report what they find to Bethesda. In return, Bethesda gets to keep a closer eye on their game files, ensuring they arnt exploiting this, and if they are found to be doing so, a ban would be fair
---
The master race says yes, but the master brain keeps saying no.
---
I feel upping the allowable map population would be better, if the overall goal is to make the wasteland less bare.
---
That would be evil as hell, letting them beta test for a month would certainly be predictable
---
This would be the most inefficient distribution campaign in existence. Sorry
---
Fookin' lasah soights
---
Let's request both!
---
I do know Bethesda's statement which was "If you find an exploit, you should absolutely report it to us but do not continue use of it" directly implies that the account in question **did in fact report the very same issue they were banned for** and I also know that people who bug test for this game **often retest bugs/exploits that were previously fix as a means of making sure they remain fixed.** 
---
So 2 + 2 = 4. Its a logical conclusion not a stretch in the slightest. 
---
lets not even talk about Bethesda support's competence level.

Interesting. Why didn‚Äôt you kill them when they were out in the open playing?

Field Scribe's Hat looks really good with the Plague Mask imo, used to wear that with the Hunter's Long Coat, and it was a Look
---
It certainly is a good thing that you're trying to be less ignorant. However, given your current ignorance, I should point out that there is some significance to Juicehead's point regarding the Fallout 4 thing.
---
It pretty much points to 3 very disappointing attributes of Bethesda of late:
---
1. Doing the absolute bare minimum of effort
---
2. Taking other people's work or ideas and making it their own
---
3. Profiteering, not just making money
---
One additional thing that ties into the above is that they're double-dipping, especially for items that were previously sold through the Creation Club. They already made money on it once. They then bring it into this game with little to no modification and then look to profiteer of it again.
---
As for point 2, I get it's all Bethesda but BGS Austin are taking BGS Marylands work. Maybe you can write off this point and consider it a none issue but you cannot with the other two. That's a lot of the reason why Juicehead goes on about it seemingly more than any other content creator.
---
I'm not asking you to be any less annoyed by this. I'm just saying that there is a good reason for it.
---
TL:DR - ACID
---
I've had acid, lead and junk nodes. I built my first camp at the junk node near the food processing plant. As a new player, I really wanted a junk node, because I was in short supply of things like screws, gears, the stuff you need to make your first set of Excavator, and the stuff needed build turrets and other camp items. 
---
Once I had that taken care of though, I found that I didn't have much use for junk unless I was building and scrapping weapons. Now I collect junk, but pretty much sell bulk every day, so the idea of collecting it in my camp seems kind of redundant.
---
Before I discovered Lucky Hole, I was always short of lead, scouring the hotel weight room, the fire station and Camp McClintock so,  I built a camp at the lead node NW of WS, lots of folks still camp there. However, now with Lucky Hole, I can get a 1000 units or so of lead in about 20 minutes.
---
Which leads me to acid. I used to always be short of acid, and would be routinely capturing Hemlock Holes for the three acid nodes. Now every 15 minutes or so I can pop back to my camp and find ten acid. Kill a few yao guai's, a cave cricket or five, and I'm pretty much always able to smelt whatever I bring home, whether it be from Lode Bearing, B and C, or Lucky Hole.
---
Since I run a melee build, I've got a pretty steady supply of ammo I can sell. I probably make 1-2k a day just selling .556.
---
Oh my
---
Thank you so much! Some hard work ahead.
---
Multiple radio stations would be helpful make it a quest fix radio station server
---
No
---
We approached their position (team of two) I flanked his buddy as my squad sniped for cover. We walked around the building as we heard foot steps thinking we were doing a cat and mouse thing. We realized that wasn't the case after seeing the theremin. I played it to see if it was the reason. As I started to I seen from the camera angle he was in there and he shot me dead and my team.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
oh, no. i played 76 a ton, for about 6 months. i'm just surprised its still doing things
---
you're welcome! good luck!
---
But if they did that then people might not buy the item
---
I think a fair trade would be that atom shop items shouldn't take any camp budget.  They could still limit how many number of times we build a specific item just not charge our budget for doing so.
---
Seems reasonable that if we pay for it we shouldn't have to be penalized and it might increase sales to some degree.
---
Issue is hackers still seem to have no trouble though right :)
---
Referencing a meme
---
I got a portable toilet built with a locked ground water purifier directly behind it, along with vending machine next to the setup that only has dirty water stocked.
---
Meme reference
---
Lol well guess theres the hardcore mode people asked for
---
&gt; There have been cases where players have used third-party software to take advantage of an exploit usually in excess of hundreds of times. 
---
So there is a ban wave. A lot of people got banned. I would suspect up in the 100s or more, and out of those, "there have been cases". I mean if Beth is actually trying to call out one or two people publicly, that would be way more messed up than just banning people trying to help and ignoring them. They are going to kick them in the nuts publicly afterwards too? We can only hope that statement is referring to some of the cases and not directed to specific people.
---
Oof buddy. I just feel sorry for you now. Seems very clear that you can't argue the point so now it's name-calling.
---
You should just cut your losses and move on. This is just embarrassing now.
---
I don't dislike negative (i.e. critical) 76 content. I criticize this game and Bethesda frequently, often with a hard edge, and I was also strongly critical of FO1st when it came out.
---
But what I saw in your last video was a *very* clickbait headline and image. You don't attempt to nuance the situation at all, it's very cut and dry 'Bethesda is banning community supporters'. If you don't stop for a minute to think about how a headline like that would be received, then I don't know what to tell you.

But I figured I'd give it a try anyway. When I watched the video what I saw was a person believing everything the banned people say, and getting some details wrong (such as when you describe the people who reported the exploit as a group, instead of pointing out that not all of them reported and thus some of them were hit with a ban; Undefined himself has admitted that he found the exploit and used it and then went to sleep and then continued to investigate the next day, all without making a report.. OF COURSE a Bethesda rep will see that badly, and he doesn't really have a good case to support his argument that he was just fishing around to help them). 
---
So yea, I think you engaged with a lot of hearsay by believing things you were told without considering alternate perspectives with the same amount of belief or respect.
---
I also took a look at your video history over the last while. I watched your video when FO1st came out and thought you were obviously bothered by it but reasonably so. But since then it seems like all you make are clickbait headline videos that are inherently negative and obviously going to be met with massive derision toward the game and Bethesda, and you don't seem to be concerned with the comment section of your videos being overwhelmingly cynical about the game or Bethesda.
---
Really the game hasn't changed much (for good or bad) over the last 6 months, so I have a hard time understanding how your videos went from fairly neutral, sometimes negative or positive, to almost exclusively negative coverage with oversimplifying headlines in the weeks since FO1st.
---
Did that too but sometimes having a bit of redundancy (while educating players to this possibility) can put the situation on notice. If you see a theremin against a house, destroy it and just leave the area.
---
&gt;So we should report any possible exploit without first checking that it is an exploit.
---
Yes, you should. If you suspect something is an exploit you report it, but you don't test it over and over to try to find out what causes it. That's Bethesda's job.
---
&gt; So basically just keep reporting everything and anything, in case once tested by professionals, it turns out to be an exploit? 
---
Not everything and anything, but if you run in to something you suspect to be an exploit, you report it. If you accidentally managed to dupe a gun by, say, dropping it and picking it up really quickly you say what you did and then move on. You don't test it to see if that was what actually caused it, that's Bethesda's job.
---
&gt; Sounds like thats going to waste a lot of peoples time and get bethesda to start ignoring reports. 
---
It won't. Again, this is literally Bethesda's job. You aren't wasting their time, and they won't start ignoring reports.
---
Bring the stealthboy changes from NW to the main game
---
would pair well with the most inefficent rollout of a game in existence.
---
Yeah sure whatever fanboy nobody fuck off yourself!
---
Fixed long time ago and even then ultra ultra rare and difficult to replicate.
---
That statement makes no such implication.
---
I don't know what specifically happened there.  Neither do you.  You can guess all you want, but go back and look at 900 hour guy.  People did the same things for him, and he was shown to have lied.
---
I don't think anyone's guilty of anything nefarious here either, but with no evidence either way, you're just picking the side that suits you.
---
Yep I've wanted clean bathrooms for ages.
---
They used to take 2% budget then they bumped it up to like 5%. Mothman an Nuka signs take up 10%.
---
I would not disagree with any of that at all.
---
I'm not the one going back and down voting all my posts, so no.
---
Yea, cause hackers dont report what there doing, and one or two people reporting a hacker isn't reliable, just imagine all the hackers/tryhards reporting normal player just cause their getting their ass kicked (more of a gta/rdr online thing, but still holds)
---
It's almost like you haven't played this game before.
---
I won't reiterate what the other commenters have said but those are the reasons.
---
Want a better experience for us all. I enjoy the game (all modes) and love playing against a fair enemy :)
---
I mostly craft ammo, but when I do buy it I buy shotgun shells, .556, .308, and occasionally .44.
---
I've never seen anyone buy .38 rounds, and I've had thousands in my vending machine for months lol. It's a very weak caliber and is mainly used in crappy pipe weapons, so I understand why it's not a hot item.
---
Ah nice, thanks for clarification üëç
---
I have two shotguns that are still valid, both double-barrel.  The first has a faster fire rate and quad capacity.  The second is an explosive with 50% anti-armour (great for crippling mobs at White Springs) .
---
I used to buy SG shells but I've been farming Westek and there seems to be more energy weapons yielding a bunch of plastic.   So I've been making them when I do large batches of 5.56 and 50 cal.   I go through them slower so even minimal crafting keeps me fully stocked.
---
Cool thanks for clarifying üëç
---
I just did a wee-wee hehehe
---
I need something with less recoil and less vats cost for my 10mm smg.
---
No. You can explode grenades with VATS but you cannot deal damage to mobs with your ranged weapons in VATS.
---
Yeah its really hard to tell if someone is hacking when there is video evidence of them flying around the map shooting the floor and getting 20+ kill games every game. 3 suspension is fine, either that or "lack of evidence" :)
---
Haven‚Äôt launched a nuke yet but have a keycard
---
I've been hoarding 2mm EC because of the new weapons releasing with Wastelanders. That gauss minigun looks sweet.
---
In case you didn‚Äôt know, certain weapon mods reduce AP cost in VATS. Mods that increase hip-fire tend to work this way, I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs never mentioned in the game.
---
Yes, but it depends how often you go back to camp. If it's not very frequently then it's better to just farm for the stuff you need at the moment.
---
So True barrel mods and anything that says increases hip-fire accuracy actually reduces ap cost in vats for it??
---
I just don't understand why Bethesda would make a game that they expect less from when they promoted it on stage as being bigger and better than F04. What happened is some of you heard the comments Todd said after the fact and you actually believed them. This game was promoted and hyped like crazy. That was moving the goal posts somewhere else after the fact.
---
How do you do v 94 solo it says I need a team of 3
---
Super common. Railway, harpoon and shotgun should sell, but for cheap.
---
*pay good caps
---
Its important because real money for virtual items will cause you to be in violation of tos.
---
What kind of build do you have currently. Think I've got a few furious combat shotguns laying around if youd be interested.
---
That there, is jist Bethesda being bloody lazy/useless
---
They should yes
---
The statement clearly makes the implication. 
---
You smell like a PR account, no one brought up the 900H guy but nice use of deflection. 
---
I think Bethesda is using more than sub par business practices as they've been doing since the release of fo76. Yet I'm not picking a side I want Bethesda to be better, not to continue they're own rampage to destroy their beloved series.
---
Sounds like you only want to play anything that you can be an OP god, wrecking all in your path. 
---
No not a child by telling you to punctuate. When it‚Äôs a giant long sentence it‚Äôs incredibly confusing for anyone to read. You just sound uneducated, how can someone take you or your thoughts seriously if you can‚Äôt write properly...
---
Having a full team is recommended as raids were design for 4 people cooperating but you can go in by yourself and try anyway. Fallout was always quite open game in most cases up to you if you want to go there or there do this or that.
---
Hmm...That's why people call reddit a giant circlejerk I think.
---
I‚Äôll like to join I got a rifle build at 20 but I‚Äôm. Currently working on a heavy weapons build if that‚Äôs ok
---
They have such poor 3rd party detection it really makes me question how they would even know what the data miners were doing without the data miners telling them directly... 
---
Just fallout 1st? My good will with them soured when they launched the buggy game and ignored any complaints. Then you add in their finicky refund policy, the duffle kerfuffle, them doxing everyone who requested the canvas bag they paid for, the stealth nerfs, the patches that further broke the game, missing items in events like the "rare" masks in fasnacht or the empty rack recently in the mischief event, and their overall stance of ignore the issue till it goes away. Bethesda's good will and trust died a year ago and they have just been pissing people off more and more since.
---
The one million dollar wuestion is:
---
Since the map76 person didn't report the exploit, but member of his group did. Is that member ban ed?
---
The answer will swing the situation in a whole another direction.
---
I sell my .38 at 0 caps for the newbies that stop by.  
---
I cant justify charging for it, but I also dont want to just drop it.
---
I managed to get it either during the beta or very soon after the game released.  
---
Wouldn't have been doing much more than the forest events back then, although I did do guided meditation with a few friends (barely managed to finish it lol)  
---
I didn't even know it was rare till a trader friend of mine spotted it on his photo mode images when he was looking through them.
---
Totally, and there customer support is useless. Rockstar has better customer support, and they are pretty much known for just wanting your money
---
Gj keep them coming!
---
I'm a 2h melee unyielding bloodied build that uses a bloodied smg and a normal lever action with twisted muscles.
---
You're not wrong at long ranges, my lever action fires as if it's a twoshot legendary with only one projectile.  I miss often compared to my other character without twisted muscles.
---
But at midrange that extra spread makes my smg (not 10mm) shred wherever I aim at down the sight.  Pros and cons.
---
Funnily enough, I think it actually has a mod slot for sights in the game files. It's equipped with "standard ironsights" for the rear sight and has small/large front sights available for the front (iirc)
---
I do want to add, that the person who did report it was permabanned as well, so really, in hindsight, I don't think it really would have made a difference, it didn't for them.
---
I totally agree that they're fucking this (and a lot of other things) up, the guy you're talking about probably got swept up in a zero tolerance kind of situation (and the people doing the banning and the people he was working with on bugs are likely in 2 completely different groups).  But you should avoid advocating about things you're hearing second hand, since that frequently doesn't end well.
---
Again, I don't have an opinion about the guy, but I know there's a lot going on there that I *don't* know the details of, and I'm pretty sure you don't either.
---
The age old don't pray and spray, short controlled bursts.  Master Chief, I miss you.
---
I just want a supressor.  Sights wold be awesome, but supressor makes it viable as stealth/VATS weapon.
---
I am not revisionist, I did not say anything about the stories being true or not, only that similar rumors were not uncommon in the past, and in those cases many people (including popular YouTubers) also believed the story told by the allegedly banned person without much thought.
---
That's because 9/10 it turns out to be true. It's unprecedented; I've never seen a videogame company fuck up so much, and so consistently.
---
SleepyThyme
---
Do you have the Tesla coils for ultracite?
---
The Scorch Beast Archqueen and her King.
---
The Queen was actually just the princess.
---
I feel more strongly about this particular one because I had been regularly interacting with the group of banned individuals for months now. I believe what they were saying because I saw it, the chat logs, message history between them and Bethesda, actively bug hunting for months now. For a lot of the stuff I cover I recap myself after the fact, but for this one I was very much aware of the situation for a while (well before it was public) and even before the bans occurred. 
---
I don't think I actually got any details wrong per-say, but I may have explained some things poorly. Although undefined used one exploit as an example for his ban the rest of the group had found and reported numerous others prior to this (also got banned for it). I just say exploit in the video because I don't want to give too much attention to those things, but in reality I am referencing a variety of different things from security flaws, dupes (multiple methods), legendary bypassing, getting unobtainable items, etc. But like I mention in the video I don't really see anything wrong with the suspensions, like yea they used an exploit they should get caught in the first wave if it is working correctly. Rather the response after the fact is where the issue lies. 
---
I think you're calling it hearsay because I didn't show the proof, which is fair but that is solely to protect the privacy of people involved. The fact of the matter is for at least one of these users right now (outside of undefined) they had been in consistent contact with Bethesda reporting bugs, getting those bugs fixed, and then got banned for that very thing. To give even more credence to the idea that these bans were unjust is one of the guys already was unbanned for it. The actions of the perma-banned person and unbanned person are basically identical. The undefined case is the outlier in that he was only really involved in the 1 major exploit report. 
---
At the notion of my videos being overwhelmingly cynical..what am I not covering? I covered 1st, then 1st breaking, then Wastelanders leaks, then 1st breaking again and a potential explanation, then the Halloween event, then the ban wave, etc. Is there something I didn't cover that happened around this game that was positive? I don't think I am being overly cynical its just a plethora of bad stuff has been happening in regards to Fallout 76 (1st release, 1st scrapbox bug, 1st users losing access, dataminers banned, dataminers perma banned, Bethesda not addressing the 1st backlash.) I am not just making this stuff up, it is occurring and I think I have been covering the good and bad - there has just been more bad lately
---
I agree. Same way I think shotguns should have an aoe radius the way shotgun do in almost every other game lol.
---
Pete Hines explained that they would've had to have known about crossplay early in development to begin implementing it, the network architecture was too far down the line by the time Sony signed off that they can't put it in post facto. At least without a huge investment in system engineers. Given Wastelanders, I'm unsure about it in the short term. Have to wait and see long term
---
Bikini Bottom would like a word with you about this 'wouldn't do much' business you speak of.
---
I will check soon I‚Äôll be home in a about 30
---
I got mine from Project Beanstalk.
---
I think the railway operates in such a manner as you described. The gauss is meant to have pure concussive power, not penetrating power. It actually had a aoe burst effect in other titles. It would be a nice addition to AP weapons, though, for sure.
---
If you're not a revisionist, please name the thing you were referring to when you said "or even for crafting or playing too much".
---
I think we can both count out the 900hrs guy from this. Is there some other situation regarding this that we as the sub aren't aware of?
---
Juicehead is one of the worst youtubers. He shitted on Fallout76 for all the likes only to try and back track and say it's "alright " and play the game. After all the damage was done and he rode the bandwagon. At least stick your word.
---
10mm my biggest seller and I always buy shotty myself. Guess different experiences tho!
---
I like your use of agreement to imply some level of change in your viewpoint. 
---
I've also noted your complete ignorance of me calling your a PR account. Neither confirming or denying. Good choice. 
---
But you lose points on continuation of your forced narrative of "lack of information." 
---
its a good stand point mind you but from a consumer standpoint why would anyone argue for a "we don't know" narrative? 
---
Overall I rate it 6/8 room for improvement. You might get a management position yet :)
---
Can you put a power armor helmet in the case?  That might look cool.
---
yeah its bloody annoying they remove a metrick fuck tonn of shit every week from the atom shop
---
If you're on PC I'll sell you a crap ton of shells lol
---
I love using 38 ammo on a bffr combat rifle, cheap and nasty, but I wouldn't pay 1per for it. Will never sell
---
I happen to have a suppressed 10mm SMG, it's called Perfect Storm. Incendiary rounds.
---
charlie uniform charlie kilol
---
That's a great idea, I'll save them and start looking for a B FFR combat rifle lol
---
If you dropped 23 nuclear bombs of varying strength on an island, you'd have a crater regardless.
---
They are useful to get some extra screws, gears, oil, and springs from. You don't need the plan to build the extractor, so go for it.
---
Not mine but the owner said I could repost
---
Seems solid, if you were desperate to min max, you might consider moving a point or from int to charistma for the tenderiser perk. Also, as others have mentioned, consider blocker instead of barbarian as % damage tends to be better than dr but that's about it.
---
It should change based on what stock (or grip) is installed.
---
looks decent, basically same as mine but I use the Vats perks
---
I have heard of people just creating numerous characters,  running from the vault,  and completing Thirst Things First. It's a quick turnaround to repeat it multiple times.
---
Forgot the point or just didn't read it? 
---
No matter if he lied now or not, he's still not known for lying at all.
---
That isn't suppressed it just has the short barrel which looks like a suppressor.
---
Congrats! I'm in the same boat, just need to keep grinding
---
I would love to have a cash register in my camp
---
Great looking camp. Consider posting to the settlement sub, too.
---
This is hilarious dude thank you. Anyone who downvoted this is delusional about the state of this game.
---
I want an assultron army
---
Ironically this is the though process behind burst-fire rifles. They‚Äôre more controllable but still allow more rounds per minute to be thrown down range. 
---
After learning this I‚Äôve used the tactic in every game and my accuracy has gone waaaaay up.
---
Damn straight, Hicks
---
Thats pretty rare. I've done maybe 25 queens and quickest I've seen it go down was about 5 minutes.
---
Sounds like a cool idea. I could go for that.
---
I got it from the first 2 quests on a new character. The water prep stuff in Flatwoods.
---
Got both it and the VT cap from the same quests.
---
Console peasant lol
---
I'd love for my vending machines to be able to have a smaller footprint, this is a wonderful idea
---
or harem? ü§î
---
Ha just have 40 all lined up outside . No bitch touching my camp.
---
Takin this a little seriously for Vets of "Failout 76 we dont give a shit if it ever works". Right?
---
i sure will! i wanna be able to blast her like that
---
yeah no problem,  build style doesn't matter much to us if you send me a DM I can get you the link to the discord group and we can go from there
---
might have been more than one guy doing in though, there was 3 other guys who were over lvl 200 and 300 even. i really wonder what monstrous of a weapon they were packing
---
Hmm maybe. But still, if left untouched several planks could have been getting loose over time. I rather see one or a few guys find and test the planks to fix them before someone or several baddies come and abuse it for own ill benefits.
---
Yeah, it changed last week I believe. Possibly before then.
---
I get all my junk from other people. Death would have zero meaning in this game if people didn't drop SOMETHING. How about you just stash your junk? It isn't hard.
---
Same, I guess better chances on a fresh toon than an oldie. Seems like level-ism ;)
---
Its not about being an OP god. Have you never played a single player game before? Theres systems and mechanics you just can include because you have to consider their interaction with other live players. And you completely ignored every other point, like not being able to make world-impacting decisions in a game with thousands of other players occupying that same world. 
---
No, youre a child because you think that just because you prefer multiplayer that singleplayer is inherently inferior, and dropping a few commas doesnt make a sentence impossible to read. You're exaggerating to make a silly point. "You sound uneducated" lmao seriously, either youre a child or just childish. Idk why I'm even trying with you
---
somebody toucha your spaghet
---
It say at the bottom of your screen in it's in that machine or another one. Liked the original way better.
---
Yeah I think it would be good as you won't have to use turrets anymore as you'd have the sentry bots and assultrons and you can have the protectrons selling things so no vending machines
---
Why ? Did you think Bethesda would just give up on the game ? Seems kind of ignorant to think the game is a failure because of clickbaity Youtubers making 20 negative videos every time Bethesda do anything tbf.
---
And fishing
---
I mean, it does technically violate rule 9. 
---
&gt; do not accuse players of cheating 
---
They are basically saying that the banned players were cheating.
---
I haven't been downvoting your posts lol
---
I got it once at project beanstalk... And on my second run of it.... But not in the subsequent 80 tries :/
---
Cobalt, Violet, and Fluorescent we always need. I see you posted on the other post. I'll continue the convo there :)
---
Im sure eventually they will as skins in atom shop and maybe eventually u will have to get the shower plan, sink plan and mirror plan like we did for the toilet and tub. The camp budget would have to be raised tho, im thinking about trying to find a location already set up so i can have more camp budget.
---
yeah I mean 5 minutes with groups of 8 or more. For it to be killed in seconds is exceptional even if the whole server came lol.
---
Stay back Thatchman, go back to your game
---
Oh, really? I never noticed it. Thanks. Better than nothing I guess but why change what wasn't broken?
---
lol i said i played it a lot for 6 months. my opinions arent rooted in youtube videos and i was an advocate for this game when i played it. after the NW mode came out i assumed hackers would ruin it, and they did. this was also round 5 or 6 of them trying to stop dupes and failing. the last i heard was they introduced an awful subscription service that was broken as fuck. i wasnt trying to be edgy when i dissed the game, i was genuinely surprised people still played at all
---
Railway spikes - are cheap to craft and reusable, they are usually only used on large targets which is seldom via game play.
---
Harpoons - with fletchetts you literally shoot one shot and loot 5 back, they are effectively infinite ammo so no need to buy. 
---
Shotguns - are glitched and heal enemies, and they are majorly nerfed since their former days so no one uses them.
---
10mm - pistols are garbage in general. That leaves the SMG which doesn't have sights and can't be suppressed so it's not popular
---
. 44 - pistols are weak, and six shots doesn't compare to 30
---
. 38 - literally rains from the sky and pipe guns are the weakest end game option
---
2mm emc - gauss is slow, heavy, VATS is glitched and poor overall dps. The ammo is heavy too.
---
So far, a few folks have mentioned project beanstalk. That‚Äôs promising for events to begin with. I‚Äôll assume you aren‚Äôt on xbox, and if you are, wouldn‚Äôt consider making this gals evening? üòÅ
---
Keep being unreasonable and entitled to shit you aren't owed. If he didn't spend the currency he bought, they'd have refunded him. He spent the atoms. 
---
You kids are funny little weirdos.
---
A knife never loses reception
---
Yeah. Especially ballistic heavy weapons.
---
Keep being a tool, idiot
---
Reading this response, I think that your relationship with the banned people is a key element, and I understand your view a bit better, but since (at least as far as I saw) that wasn't in the video, what stood out to me was this guy is championing the banned people the same way that Yongyea mindlessly championed the 900 hours guy, even though all most Youtubers had at the time was the dude's word that he did no wrong.
---
As far as your videos, I'm not trying to argue or imply that you're not covering positives. I get that the game has been going through a rough patch and I think Bethesda needs to be held accountable for the problems that are less opinion and more obvious. But to me this has been a pattern with Bethesda for damn near the entire life of this game, and I don't recall seeing you producing a stream of videos like this before. As I mentioned, the headlines strike me as 'oh look another Bethesda fuck up' with the negative stuff usually jumping out in red-- it feels sensationalized. I don't watch any other Youtubers so maybe this is 'normal', but at that point what differentiates you from people like Jim Sterling or Yongyea? They do the same kind of thing and basically don't seem to give a shit about this game or its community beyond what they can milk from it by exploiting bad press and simplistic views.
---
And then I look at your comment section, as I mentioned before, and it's full of the same people that poke fun at this game every chance they can, regardless of how much accurate information they have about it. Even if you were trying to be neutral and just reporting messes Bethesda themselves made, how long are you going to keep doing that before you realize that you're just shoveling shit for bored people who have no stake in this game and merely want to confirm their biases? (that's a big opinion/judgement on my part, but that's how I feel)
---
I mean I'm sure there are plenty of people like me who play the game and are critical of it, but I highly doubt they're the core audience that've been responding to your videos from the past 3 weeks. I've seen a big spike in reddit numbers here since FO1st (though it's slowing down) and I think a lot of that is just hate brigade bringing their nonsense here... and in the end that actually makes it harder to be genuinely and constructively critical of the game and Bethesda, because a lot of people just don't want to hear *any* negativity, or think you're as stupid as the others.
---
Anyway, if I was a bit harsh in my earlier post then I'm sorry. But I do stand by the unsub for now; I don't like seeing people profiting from the destruction of something else, even if its problems are ultimately the fault of its creators. Hopefully Bethesda will get their act together soon though, and you'll have more positive things to give your opinion on. My top preference is to get news from someone who's going to be critical while maintaining accurate and effective language (I'm an Orwell fan, what can I say).
---
Yeah, theres like a Sort-type option at the bottom of the screen
---
Sounds cool but budget :(
---
***Cough*** sinks are in the files ***Cough***
---
Didn't think of that..
---
Beat me too it lol
---
I am on Xbox. However I do not know if I'll be on this evening or not (currently 3:33pm where I am). But I don't mind running it with you when schedules coincide. ^_^
---
I believe that out of everyone mentioned in this thread Bethesda is the worst. They use the good will of their fans for their own monetary gains through a product that shouldn't even be released until 2020.

I‚Äôm not saying one is better than the other. I am just arguing your point of you saying ‚Äúwe will never get another good single player‚Äù not everyone wants one. Not everyone wants a dialogue in game that‚Äôs lasts 10 minutes, not everyone wants a huge drawn out story line. What you‚Äôre saying is what you prefer, not everyone cares or feels that way. 
---
So you complaining people subscribed and perhaps that is making you not get a single player experience game someday, your opinion, most people don‚Äôt care.
---
No, not a child or a childish person, just one that wants to be able to read something and not feel like I lost brain cells doing so.
---
You are just an hour behind me(central time). I wouldn‚Äôt mind that at all. If nothing else, a new travel friend.
---
Yeah, the function is still there, under something like "Show Marked Only."  It's just that, for whatever reason, it defaults to the other way that shows you the contents of all machines now.
---
Friendly reminder the lmg literally doesn't have a single mod
---
This must be on console. On PC they just fly around, through the walls, ground, and kill everyone on the map from across the map. 
---
It must be nice to have a theremin wall breach be a concern. Meanwhile we have indestructible supermen raining merciless death on everyone..
---
I buy .38s if I can get them super cheap.
---
Yea if I could
---
Immediately find a bug, know what the bug is how to replicate it and document it fully with just stumbling over it once....I‚Äôd be the highest paid software QA around. 
---
Hell I would love for my QAs to just be able to document accurate detailed steps to replicate a bug in 50% of tickets.
---
&gt;im not saying one is better than the other 
---
&gt;single player will never be as fun as a multiplayer can 
---
...
---
&gt;what youre saying is what you prefer/your opinion
---
&gt;most people dont care
---
Maybe you should stop reading my comments then, idt you can afford to lose anymore of those brain cells. Also try to learn some empathy. *I* play mostly multiplayer games. That doesnt mean im gonna say "fuck everyone that likes single player games".
---
and Fallout First stuff, my dude
---
Thanks! I will be home in 1h30
---
Thanks. I didn‚Äôt make it but was allowed to repost because the original got deleted.  I‚Äôve defended this game for so long and I‚Äôm still a massive fan but the communication and recent actions are so obvious.
---
Yeah - it just happens to work especially well in Harper's Ferry because you've got the Vendor Bot right there.  Lewisburg is the same way.
---
It would totally buy them more copies from people that already have the game. I‚Äôd buy it for my pc but don‚Äôt want to lose all my accounts.
---
On ps4 I still crash everyday, but I hear it's the worst
---
That what she said... I‚Äôll see myself out.

Bethesda: We don‚Äôt need free QA personal. We have a full staff who has found and documented almost all the bugs. With such a shortage of bugs in our software these free QA volunteers are taking bugs away from our hardworking QA team.
---
Agreed, though considering a pound of tnt creates a crater, a nuclear bomb exponentially stronger would make a bigger crater, destroy buildings, scorch biological matter.
---
A single modern bomb can take out a building.  A nuke can take out a city.
---
In Fo76 nukes detonate at ground level, watch one land on you at ground zero, that isn't an aerial detonation.  They don't do anything but explode cars, ignite gas spills, transform enemies in the blast zone and flora.
---
Also my bikini bottom comment was a joke referencing how Spongebob's world exists thanks to the US testing 67 nuclear bombs at Bikini Atoll, in the water, underwater, and still managed to irradiated several ships' worth of military crew overseeing the detonations and turn the local indigenous people homeless after irradiating their lands, from detonations in the waters nearby.
---
'Dirty' or radiation buffed bombs still have an explosive power behind them.  You'd think they'd do more damage in game, the reason they don't is performance, not physics as far as I can guess.
---
&gt; But hey I'm sure I'll get downvoted by those "brand reputation" accounts  for speaking out against Bethesda, pretty sure I'm on a watch list or  something at this point. 
---
No, I just don't take kindly to "If you disagree me, you must be a shill!" logic.
---
Boohoo cry me a river, did I hurt your feelings with my opinion? Empathy... hahaha the fuck? You have done the same as I have. But anyways later man, I‚Äôm over this conversation with you.
---
B kuwl sta n skuwl 2 lern inglish gramr :)
---
I like the ideas here. Maybe to simplify it the first quest would involve killing an npc vault dweller (raider) and stealing a pip boy or alternatively finding a dying vault dweller who gifts you a pip boy (settler).
---
Can someone make a Spotify Playlist haha
---
There is a decent one from last year that I really enjoyed using, but it only had like 25 songs
---
By this logic, wouldnt mole miner gauntlets and death claw gauntlets also fall into this spec with meat hook?
---
A protectron cleaning bot.
---
They can name it Sam.
---
&gt;Everything Juice Head releases ~~about 76~~ is straight up garbage.
---
FTFY
---
Can't say I've noticed any difference.

Sometimes it's hard to tell that Dodgy is working, but trust me, you know it if your AP runs out.

[deleted]
---
Yep. The broken window theory thing.
---
&gt; .38, .44, 2mm EC
---
nobody really uses these that i have seen outside of the very rare pistol builds and low levels. as far as 2mm, gauss isnt very high on the popular weapon chain
---
&gt; 10mm, Railway Spikes
---
very easy to craft rounds, i got 10k from hitting forest events,
---
&gt;  Harpoons
---
hit the search bar for this one, after you get 1-2 harpoons you never need them again
---
&gt; Shotgun Shells
---
this is an ok seller, it wont fly off the shelves like .45, 5.56, or .50 but it will eventually sell reliably at the right price. (il normally sell mine in "bulk" 5k shell packages)
---
I only saw a Gauss pistol and that isn't "new" really, it was in Fallout 2. Where'd you get your info buddy?
---
Holy shit haha
---
Bethesda no longer gets benefit of the doubt due to their own behavior, so makes sense.
---
Maybe they could clean up tyler co fairground and introduce a bunch of these games. Maybe include some card tables to play poker, cribbage, liars dice, etc.  Shooting galleries, baseball toss, etc.
---
The ticket idea is awesome. Let us redeem them for stuff the way Pioneer scouts works.
---
Haven't changed my view at all.  If you'd bother creeping the posts of people you call shills, at least in my case, you'd see you are way off base.
---
Same with the PR account thing, wasn't worth following up on, but if you bother to check, I'm pretty open about what I actually do.  Higher ed, if you care.  And I have a management position, and trust me, middle management isn't all it's cracked up to be.
---
But feel free to keep changing the subject.  All I've said is you're working on speculation, which obviously carries over to a lot of the things you post.  So far your batting average is pretty low there.
---
Dont worry that's an upcoming 1st feature just grab your wallet and let utopia come one patch at a time
---
&gt;  Meanwhile we have indestructible supermen raining merciless death on everyone..
---
Otherwise known as "Friday Night" in Metropolis.
---
Could we do a weekly reminder for all the things that this game still fucks up? (Invisible ghouls, crashing, etc)
---
I bought a lot of 10mm before I went exclusively 556.
---
That's fine. I am a shotgun build but I also like the big gun build. I just need a decent gun with good perks. And yeah, I meant good caps thanks.
---
&gt; A very high IQ yet ....
---
... and that's where I stopped reading.
---
I pm'd you.
---
Yeah, something narrow like an actual vending machine. I'd pay for that, could have a couple options for the front "ad" space.
---
Yeah there needs to be more variety for all weapons. And they need to actually scale to end game. Or, at the very least, allow to mod the appearance in different ways. Damn near every gun has been around since Fallout 3 with very little changes.
---
I'm sure they'll show up in the atom shop sooner or later.
---
Revolvers need to benefit more from the Quick Hands perk. With single action revolvers suffering because their slow reload speed. Add a Armor Piercing perk and they should be better. I think Black Powder weapons are kinda fine because they are a niche gun and fulfill a high damage role. I love revolvers and we should have a few more mods to change up how we can use them.
---
I believe there‚Äôs another big empty dlc coming into view
---
Same here. Logging in, doing daily. Sell out the merchant, killing some legendary and turning in technical data. Well, what do you know 3-4 hours just passed.
---
I don't care about 1st those emotes are annoying though.  I have to mute the whole game in events or nw because 8 people are spamming them out of sync.
---
Yeah I hate the look/area that takes up to, I've taken to wedging a locker in front of it...plus then people have super convenient STASH access too.
---
SAMs more of a sentry bot tho eh?
---
Imo I‚Äôd rather a separate world selection like we have now. That way you have a choice and aren‚Äôt affected by gear. 
---
But yes. Those games would be cool. I‚Äôve also wanted to see some of the board games we have in game become real. Always wanted to play Catch the Commie.
---
Robots can drop aluminum, fwiw.
---
A farmhand to harvest your crops
---
I would like this. A bunch of different ones for different purposes.
---
Understandable and respectable
---
Why were you all downvoted. Upvoted to try and level it out
---
Tbh just wait and see what goes down. My caps are on a ban wave coming. No warnings, no tells just people waking up and seeing that code on login.
---
The board games would be awesome!! An arcade with the pipboy games would rock
---
I‚Äôd like a mr. handy or maybe, nanny in place of my vendors.
---
No need, already a hundreds of other threads on the topic posted almost daily.
---
Double penetrating unkempt harold
---
We just need one comprehensive weekly list to remind Bethesda üòÇ
---
Yeah they'd all have a job to do
---
üëçüëç
---
Not a bad idea
---
I think so but it will probably cost 12 pounds in your stash
---
I have been in a quite a few Queen fights that have only lasted 2 mins. My team of 5 takes her down in about 7 minutes, provided we remember to bring the right guns....
---
It is fun to try and take her down as fast as we can with as few people as we can.
---
 Public servers shouldnt be "one shotting" her though, spread her wealth. Let everyone else get to have a chance at her.
---
Yeah they'd take up less room and look cooler
---
They were confused, they thought he was batshit insane from what I recall and even the SUPER MUTANTS, thought the same, the guy seemed to have just snapped.
---
The TL;dr of that is people are bored and need something to curve the tide of that. So many of them do what ever it takes to one shot just about anything. I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes someone kill her within seconds of her first landing.
---
I saw someone on this sub saying that it must be the true Vault 51 experiment. Put 52 people, tell them to kill each others for a reward, and see what happens. That soldiers that was assigned at training ZAX even described to him a leader as someone that would come out of the mass and put an end to a crisis, so perhaps ZAX created a crisis to have someone solving it, and to find the true overseer of Vault 51 that way. This wouldnt surprise me from Vault Tec, or ZAX. 
---
Idk, just making a fan theory there.
---
No, hes more of a housekeeper who sometimes gets to play with a flamethrower.  But mainly he's the maid.
---
Ok. I believe you. It is just a weird coincidence that you get all pissy, and my posts for a few hours before this all suddenly drop a point.
---
Total coincidence. No reason to think that was you.
---
I‚Äôd even welcome of healthy lore reason to play caravan again. But pip boy games would be cool.
---
Completed at Fissure near North edge of Bog (south of Camp Venture, east of Anti-aircraft missile battery.) (actually got 2 legendaries to spawn there, of total 3 SBs... )
---
And talk.
---
Sorry to hear that, man! Don't take life too seriously!
---
Anyone have FO1st that you play with?
---
 Cool story,  bro.
---
You do understand that this post is online and that other people can see and downvote you right
---
Yeah they would have conversations with each other
---
That‚Äôs funny. Take a vote.
---
It has two; prime reciever and the muzzle break.
---
Might be too taxing on the server but yeah.
---
If that's the case, then you didn't get for free, you got it for 10 bucks.
---
There's no sights on several laser like guns too. 10mm smg needs a front sight. The grenade launcher needs a trajectory line showing when you aim in third person or an elevator shifter for short to long distances.
---
Shotguns should show their spread and have slugs as an option.
---
Yeah the lag
---
Lol! Do you know what you just wrote. What the hell are doing here in this sub(trolling) wasting your time, when there is so much else to play.
---
Throw in some ghouls too
---
That author has a real love/hate relationship with punctuation huh
---
I dont really count prime since every weapon has a prime , didn't know about the muzzle break, that being said 2 is still not enough , and if any guns needs mod its the lmg, could use some magazine, stocks, barrels, and scope, oh and a skin that didn't make the gun look like someone whipped their ass with the thing üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Gotta get that ultracite somewhere
---
I run with a group of guys and we are lvl 200+ and we take her down in about 2 minutes every time. The first time she lands she is toast, so keep on grinding its worth it lol
---
Using commas a interrupters, or for parentheticals, is perfectly acceptable in my book :)
---
I‚Äôve already thought of some non Fallout 1st emote dances. Like the Dancin‚Äô Deathclaw, Groovy Ghoul, Marching Megasloth and the Whirling Wendigo.
---
I sometimes go to Freddy Fear's House of Scares now, just to listen to the shenanigans JES-3R (who lives there now) keeps playing.
---
eeeeeeeehehehehee I just joshin' ya friend :)
---
That‚Äôs not my point. Some sentences are sooo long and unpunctuated. Then she punctuates the shit out of the next sentence.
---
Despite the tone this Sub can sometimes take, that event is honestly the best showcase for this community's worst behavior. I have not take quit a video game in almost 15 years, this event has had me close.
---
There‚Äôs accidental one-shots and then there‚Äôs being a selfish prick. Accidental one-shots are pretty easy to spot like when a legendary is shot before it has a chance to mutate...
---
Probably a good place to ask if shotguns still have recon sites like FO4
---
Given the tide of posts i wanna bet yes
---
12 perception All three rifle damage up perks and Tank Buster.
---
Were you ever able to block the enemy spawn right in the middle the area
---
I already kinda RP that my dude survived and took his Pipboy from a vault dweller. I mean, there's a ton of dead ones around Appalachia.
---
Get yourself explosive heavy gun like lmg or 50cal even without perks for that you will be able to kill cargo bot
---
I shoot them down and sell the cards. If you're near when others shoot them down you can loot them too. Check player venders.
---
Meathook's ability to stack with gladiator perks and iron fist is just a bug like being able to stack gunslinger perks and rifleman perks with the bolt action pipe rifle and revolver.
---
Okay thanks how much do you think a decent one is worth
---
Just pick any rifle or smg and shoot the thing down. Don't need to be a specialist: it will take you longer, that's all.
---
I also want random sour grapes from people looking for places to grind down their axes.
---
Thanks for filling that niche.
---
a part of the map needs to be like the glowing sea. a nuked crater is what a fallout game needs
---
That'd be great, then I could visit FloopWood
---
Actually, I would love to see all those cheaters fighting on one server 2b2t style. Not that I like them tho, but the fight would definitly be something either terrible, or absolutely epic.
---
try it and tell me I'm wrong. intelligence at 6 , luck 15 charisma 9. test it yourself.
---
Literally just enforcer it so it cant move and then whittling it down with a minigun
---
Ok boomer
---
C.A.M.P. consoles
---
You have a few options here to get yourself some nuke cards.
---
1: Find a group of friends who use guns to help you farm them.
---
2: Get a gun of your own 
---
3: Player Vendors.
---
I can't, I'm having too much fun posting in a thread about a game I hate cause no one will go out with me and I have no life or job.
---
Yesterday a guy constantly 1 shot the legendary without giving others a chance to run over n tag the legendary...
---
It happened in pretty much every industry OP. Many projects labelled under the Atom for Peace initiative was a cover for the US government to continue research into atomic weapons, which was banned under treaty at the time. This was part of a worldwide campaign titled, "Operation Candor" which was meant to encourage the average citizen to experiment with atomic research, and which the US supplied many other countries with their own nuclear reactors. Overall this was a propaganda campaign albeit an altruistic one if such a thing exists. Atomic gardening is one of my favorite uses of this program
---
‚ÄúTruth‚Äù   
---
The scrapbox was fixed almost a month ago. I realize you have an agenda to push and that‚Äôs your top priority, but you could at least either choose something truthful to say to push your agenda (there are still legitimate issues with which to push for change), or not get defensive and start talking about ‚Äútruth‚Äù when people downvote your lie.    
---
Additionally saying ‚Äúyour game‚Äù gives the impression you‚Äôre just another troll in a subreddit for a game you don‚Äôt play. You do play the game in its current state, right? Because I‚Äôd be so embarrassed if someone caught me trolling a subreddit for a game I don‚Äôt play. Like rethink-why-I-do-all-the-embarrassing-things-I-do-and-cry-under-the-covers embarrassed. That might be more embarrassing than hanging out in the parking lot of your old highschool, never moving on. Oh boy. I would feel so bad for that guy.
---
I downvoted him because his whiny rant had nothing to do with the topic of this thread.
---
I just got home from work and have read all of your suggestions. I'm going to give them all a try and see which solution I like best. I appreciate your suggestions and I hope each and every one of you have a great rest of your day. 
---
Onwards and upwards Wastelanders!
---
Thanks I think I will try player vendors it seems to tedious to try myself and my friends stopped playing recently
---
Buy from player vendor
---
I‚Äôll give this a go if I pick up a good minigun
---
I'm interested
---
If you will be lucky to find like troubleshooter explosive you will get it for cheap like 3k caps
---
Cheers just did it thanks for the feedback :)
---
Are you on rn?
---
If ur on ps4 i will give u one, i am a melee build and i just use my AAE laser rifle to shoot it down....let me know if u want one....
---
Keep an eye on this discord: https://discord.gg/WRn2ry
---
It‚Äôs were I‚Äôm doing my shoppings üòÖ
---
At quakecon they showed a few new guass guns.
---
Its apart of the weekly reminder: the game is broken and Bethesda is doing nothing about it
---
Do you know which game has a 10mm smg with a suppressor? 
---
I'll give you a hint. 
---
It's the one they took their Fallout 1st Armour from.
---
I think this is a great Idea!
---
I would also like to see the enclave do random launches from time to time, to spice up the the game a bit. 
---
As I mentioned yesterday, it would also be great if there was a random nuke launch on S.B Queen, as a daily quest, maybe every 4 hours or so. I get it, it is a mission objective. But at this point who cares. 
---
I would also like to see the blast radius expanded to twice the size. It is way too small of an area. 
---
There are so many possibilities, they are endless. 
---
Mind you, I highly doubt Bethesda will do anything to justify this as what they want from the game. 
---
Because personally I don't think that the servers will be able to handle it.
---
 I have done several nuke launches over the last few months, and 9 out of 10 times the game crashed, before I leave the silo, or minutes after the launch, XBOX platform. 
---
Go figure! 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
This game will never be bug free. I never played a bug free BGS game. And this game is the worst because of several major reason. But there are no other games out there that feel and plays like this Creation Engine game world. For that reasons I'm sticking around. Hopefully next generation of the engine will be more reliable.
---
Yikes
---
My favorite is the protection selling things. That would be awesome.
---
Thanks I am on Xbox tho :(
---
Too risky. Good use of the terminal at our camps but someone will die from not paying attention and it‚Äôll be a problem.
---
Have u not seen the progress of 76!? Nothing they're doing makes ANY sense. People are pissed about almost everything going on, and Bethesda just keeps pushing it.
---
It‚Äôs deals both at the same time.
---
Ur welcome, it looked like u got some good advice on here so good luck
---
Always carry 10mm pistol.
---
Same. Though my AAE Submachine Gun has been rather fun for me. It has a reflex and suppressor on it. Except it doesn't have any AP mags.
---
I think I'm seeing it as a different perspective,and possibly because I've grown numb since games like Fortnite with their overpriced and bare minimum skins being upwards to almost $20 and it's not even in a bundle with their axes or backpacks . So I guess I'm writing it off as "guys it's only $5, chill." 
---
Not to mention the refrigerator being called pay to win mechanics by many people baffles me since I don't think paying $8 to make food last a bit longer will help me defeat the Queen. Just some complaints sound like overreactions to me.
---
Plus I kind of see it as it's a whole new game so I don't think I should get free skins from Fallout 4 because they were in Fallout 4. Though this doesn't excuse content that wasn't made by them to repurpose it as their own. Creators deserve acknowledgement and maybe some profit for their content even if the content is a slightly different shade of orange
---
Fucking wild!
---
Yeah I feel like an idiot tho did the run earlier as I haven‚Äôt played the game in a long time and had completely forgotten about it and couldn‚Äôt launch the nuke
---
Basic combat sniper rifle is all you need. Large mag pops the engines real quick and then you just plink it to death.
---
Yes well that would be nice.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Oh that sucks, hopefully being melee u got a lot of xp....i have never launched a nuke yet i have about 30 or so nuke cards, saving for end game now all i do is join any nuke zone. Some day when i get board with quests i guess
---
Oh yeah, forgot about them.
---
Another good quality-of-life suggestion! Which means it's 0.00001% likely Bethesda will ever do it.
---
I tried doing this with an ultracite PA and the jetpack on the arm(s) wasn't working. Am I doing something wrong?
---
Yeh I levelled up, I am just gonna buy one off a player now and then do it all over again woo
---
I defo heard someone else say the same thing, whether they spent anything on it I don't know. It kinda makes sense to let you keep it as you said someone who buys cosmetics will probably do so again, as the game was so cheap anyway during that period they can only make gains and love atom shop spenders.
---
If youre still interested I have a f csg and a f 50cal. That i could get rid of
---
Gamebryo has been used for multiplayer games and even MMOs in the past. It isnt on the engine, its on Bethesda's inexperience.
---
What kind of Marine Armor? What perk cards are you using? Lots of variables.
---
True
---
&gt;Neutron bombs are used for conquest not defense or deterrence.
---
Not quite. If memory serves, neutron bombs were developed as a means to counter Soviet heavy tank designs that could easily withstand the radiation from regular nuclear weapons. Neutron bombs are still nuclear weapons and as such cause terrible damage anywhere they land; the image of a bomb that kills living things but leaves infrastructure intact is largely ma myth, if I remember correctly.
---
BRB, fact-checking myself.
---
Almost all current storied media has basis in fact that's really encouraging I think. There's extraordinary things hiding in the mundane. You just gotta use your imagination to stretch it out
---
It reads a bit better in her voice.  Maddow is a political commentator on TV who tends to open every program with a lengthy, but casual monologue on the day's events.  It doesn't come across as surprising to me that her book be written in a similar laissez-faire style.
---
Well good luck
---
There are armor and weapons specifically for PvP.
---
 I don't partake in pvp myself but I know there are some.
---
Yeah same
---
I‚Äôve a bs in sec Ed. History/s.s. Playin rpgs and shooters for 30+ years, I see well thought out ideas on here by people who should be makin games not just playin.  Creative writing goes hand in hand with a good game,  rdr2 one example.
---
I was attacked and this dick is able to kill me
---
Caravan would be cool.  But, in this day and age, they'd probably turn it into an mtx CCG, just for the $.
---
I hope the devs don't read this. . .
---
Well if you don't want to fight others you can turn pacifist on in don't attack back.
---
  PVP is really broken in this game I don't understand why people even attempt it.
---
Pacifist is on and yes pvp is broken
---
Naturally ;)
---
&gt;Plus I kind of see it as it's a whole new game so I don't think I should get free skins from Fallout 4 because they were in Fallout 4.
---
Well let's put it into a context you're probably more familiar with.
---
Let's say Fortnite does an Overwatch and creates Fortnite 2.0, with engine and graphics upgrades, new game mechanics etc. Whatever. Totally new game.
---
They then sell the same skins that came with the last game as a microtransaction, with some you'd already purchased in the last version of the game. Would you be happy respending that money to get the same skin again, given that little to no effort was put in to bring that skin across to the new game?
---
If you're totally fine with that, then ok. Juicehead's point wouldn't resonate with you.
---
Maybe it's just me but I'd hate to pay for the same thing twice or for someone to profiteer of other people's work.
---
I won't bother going into the fridge thing too much but it is definitely pay2win. You just assume pay2win means a lot more than what it actually does.
---
The Bethesda fallouts have always annoyed me a bit that everything is dirty so far after the Great War.  Especially in fallout 4, where people have just left piles of rubbles and dead bodies lying around in the places they live.
---
What floor
---
mtx ccg? And what could they possibly do to it for making cash. It‚Äôs literally just a party game mode.
---
So if ballistic is 200 and energy is 180 it will probably only deal 200 damage as long as they enemy isn‚Äôt armoured/ resistant?
---
Probably just yet another bug or incompetence on bethesdas end. Knowing them they couldn't figure out to disable mtx on just trial accounts and buying something on the shop basically made it so the system didn't recognize your account as a trial.  You can get keys for less than $5 pretty easy though so not like you really got one over on them or anything.
---
When they first introduced survival i made pvp focused character from scratch and stopped lvling at 35, to limit caps lost on death, with optimised build i was able to quite easily kill lvl 200 players
---
It‚Äôs hitting for both sources of damage and then resistances are checked for actual damage.
---
You get a gun. üòâ
---
But seriously, the Gatling Gun is a pretty great general-purpose weapon that's compatible with melee builds and deals a lot of damage without requiring you to craft ammo constantly.
---
Another way to deal with them is to take the Enforcer perk and use a shotgun.  The shotgun will do minimal damage, but each pellet has a chance to proc Enforcer, which cripples the Cargo Bot's engines and forces it to hold still, so you can finish it off with something else.
---
a spy
---
Yep there are a few with the ptw tent, but honestly we are on public servers more.  Expect a dm
---
Oh that‚Äôs a decent method thanks
---
That's a shame, FO76 is based off the other ones and it's still relevant.
---
Yeah no one seems to remember that sony first announced that they would start allowing crossplay one week before beta went live and at that time BSG had already re-assigned the original net developers elsewhere.
---
haha ,ppl reporting it like good boyz and still abusing it like hell,  and then complain,some got no brains left.
---
This is great! I actually had this very same idea in my head, except not as detailed as you‚Äôve gone here lmao. The idea as such reminds me of what ESO does when a new expansion comes out; new characters made with said expansion installed are created in that setting instead of the default original location from  the base game. Although, in my own thought version, there was no choice. Any created character after Wastelanders, was a wastelander and that‚Äôs that; with the privilege of being from the Vault,  being only for pre Wastelanders players for immersion and realism and all that. 
---
I really do hope this idea does come to fruition, as it really would be pretty awesome and it‚Äôs good to see that others too think it‚Äôll be awesome too. Thanks you for sharing it for all to see, thoughüôÇ. Fingers crossed it happensü§ûüèª
---
Sounds great I will send you a link
---
Micro transaction, collectible card game.  Like Magic: the gathering and hearth stone's digital games.  PAy money to get special cards and whatnot.  
---
Caravan, as it was, was good enough.  As long as they keep it the same.  Meaning you can find cards in game.  I can see them adding the game and only giving us a starter deck and paying atoms for extras and unique cards.  Don't get me wrong.  It's an idea I think they would try to do, but I wouldn't want it if you had to "buy" the extras.
---

Not the top floor. The one down from it. I found a brown in there once. Green too I think.

I have been sorted out now.

Thanks though for offering to help.

Please explain this, do you put up a sign or something? How does this work with a vendor? Or are you just trading on discord or elsewhere?

In the build menu there‚Äôs now a section for displays, build one, leave the build menu, and interact with it to add items from aid, junk, misc, etc.

And I have an alt, but that character hasn't been used hardly ever and therefore doesn't have squat. Lol.

Ah good to know, sorry wasn't able to help you.

Like how doc mitchell gave you his pipboy in FNV during the intro?

.50 cal is your friend, just keep one handy if you want to take one down, takes longer but works fine .. else buy them.

It was fun happened for me on ps4

I don‚Äôt think so for cards. It‚Äôs best to just have an automated dealer deal out random cards. No player based interaction on card/deck choice.
---
Obviously, not every Fallout fan wanted a BR mode. But there is no harm in adding more things to do. NW brought a considerable amount of new people to the game. Heck, I even know people who exclusively play NW. Sure, there could be ignorant people who quit the game just because there is something new that they don't like to do even though it's completely optional, but the amount of new people brought by the new mode outweighs them.
---
Also, why do people think that the devs would stop supporting adventure mode just because of NW? NW might have brought new people to the game, but the devs know that the game mode is not played by everyone who has the game.

You don't need a decent one, a regular 50 cal will get the job done, just longer, else wait until you get one during a raid .. keep it in your stash until you need it. I used to use a 1 star 50 cal vampire and worked fine .. also you might get at trading in scripts ..

If you really do hate the bang bangs, player vendors will be the best option. 
---
No hassle, other than the caps cost of fast traveling all over the map.  I recommend slotting travel agent when looking.
---
That'd work.  I can already see a securitron wearing the faded visor as the dealer.
---
PC. We have those issues too and I've recorded and reported.
---
Yeh I just bought 5 of them
---
How greedy they are? You got the game for $10 lol
---
Thanks again friend for sorting me out with those Plans.I really appreciated it.
---
Hope you like the Shotgun.

2 Nukes were launched on SBQ today.I managed to get more hardened Mass/Stable Violet Flux to build the second  calibrated [shock.Now](https://shock.Now) there is no stopping me.Makes a difference arriving at SBQ already in power Armour with the right Perks.Buzzing.

I wish there was a way to ‚Äúparty up‚Äù so you could choose to stick with the same group for subsequent games easily
---
Last patch
---
I can do it for you you have to have learned the plan before they patched it
---
Very good and detailed instructions. Thanks I appreciate it.
---
Do you have textures on Ultra? I have a feeling that is the culprit. Not even 8gigs of VRam can properly run Ultra textures in this game.
---
normally on the trade sub or xbox's lfg system is where il post it
---
Yup, happiness is doing this event all by yourself lol. It makes the sub worth it on its own.
---
if only
---
I see what you did there.
---
Thanks to all who have offered to help.
---
