A L40 prepared for PVP will absolutely destroy a L500 player who isn't expecting to PVP. They'll be dead before they've even switched off pacifist, let alone gotten a shot off at the PVPer. If you don't already know this, no wonder the PVP server isn't working out for you...
---
---
---
Been looking for something like this. You absolutely rock.
---
Maybe one a week, maybe a couple new ones added each week, something like that.
---

---
Or maybe it'll just stock everything people have turned in at the Exchange Machines is my second theory, which would be super disappointing lol
---
It is. You can clearly see some leather armor on top of it ,in one of the pictures.
---
Lol it was a joke.
---
I know right, it is like buying a car and the dealership keeps coming by the house taking shit like the radio, ac, and navigation.  WTF.
---
My point is that Bethesda needs to raise the cap limits now we have the vending machines or something. I welcome any other suggestions.
---
Yeah, I agree. The people visiting me got stuck under my porch
---
Had to resort to removing that piece and adding a staircase
---
There were pet sloths in cages at the Hornwright Estate. After the bombs, they must have escaped and reproduced.
---
Kinda obvious it would be, considering how much 1 star legendaries there are versus 3 star.
---
i will help Username:Smedleydude
---
This!    It appears you fast travel to a different spot then guests do? I show up at the northwest corner, guests seem to arrive in the middle?
---
Kinda like 19k for a mutation recipe.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yes, they can. And I have noticed a large increase in the spawn rate near my camp. I'm pretty sure that players coming to shop at my camp trigger it.
---
"Dear Vault-Tec Diaries... I never thought this would happen to me, but..."
---
Now I have much problems in pvp and pve. Sometimes I do in pve 5% damage with one shot, sometimes up to 50%. In pvp I also do 3-5% damage from 10-15 meters. My build is broken due to random damage, starting from 72 distance my damage is 0. I have bloody explosive shotgun
---
Happened to me earlier, and for some reason dude had all his doors locked so I couldn‚Äôt use his vending machine outside. Still see no purpose in locked doors.
---
It literally takes one click of your camp module to repair lol. You act like it's destroyed and you have to start from scratch. Don't forget, my camp is vulnerable to revenge as well.
---
Can you show us on the doll where Bethesda hurt you?
---
I fully support this because I tried rping as a raider to make the wasteland have a bad side instead if all sunshine and rainbows. But this update honestly made it seem like nothing bad ever happens which honestly is kinda sad. They could have reduced the damage done to structures down to 1%. But ya I think they need to do a rework of survival mode before I head to that game mode.
---
request sent!
---
What‚Äôs the point of player vending and trading if everything is available now though lol like really, having rare plans and mod, made it easier to trade for rare weapons and armour.
---
Nobody with rare weapons and armour trades for caps lol soooo that was kind of pointless
---
Back of the ammo shop in clarksbug
---
Yep, some guy lost 300c as I was trying to buy some goods... (Correction, 270c)
---
You're right.
---
The only Fallout 3+ DLC I haven't and won't finish.
---
That shit just wasn't fun for me.
---
I appreciate your help very much.
---
How did you do the first part? i can‚Äôt seem to progress through the Clean up [insert location] or Kill bugs at [insert location].
---
The in-game value for my 5.56 rounds is 2 caps so I kept them at that, don‚Äôt see why they have to be 1
---
Let me know  if you hear about a fix or a solution to it
---
As with every other post regarding this today: READ THE PATCH NOTES. it answers that question at the very end. Even answered it in the preview notes released a few days ago.
---
Short answer: No.
---
I love your former Brahmins name
---
I named mine ‚Äúmilk and hamburger machine‚Äù
---
They should add a military cache with ghouls and at the end you gain the anti-material rifle.
---
There's obviously a reason I target much higher levels, üôÑ.
---
It is. And best of all, it looks that not too much broke with this patch.
---
Found an AA Lever Rifle in one of the player shops, what a fantastic idea.
---
Lololol just go in survival hahahahaha!!!!1!! 
---
Feels like people in this thread have the IQ of a ghoul. Sorry to see that one of your favourite parts of the game has been removed for you. I‚Äôve never really been one for PvP because of how imbalanced it is and survival just amps that up 1000%. I occasionally got into scuffles with players and it was a lot of fun. But because of a mixture of how most PvP‚Äôrs play and the rest of the community throwing a tantrum were now here
---
P.S. You can initiate PvP and base destruction by lockpicking player locked doors/containers ;)
---
It is in the back below my hips above my knees.  The don't even use lubricant.
---
Ok, if we are going to be able to sell stuff now, and it's stored in our stash, we need our stash space increased. I'm at 799/800 selling just the junk I have on me right now; I'm planning on selling produced crops/drinks/food as well as any weapons/loot I don't need from my adventures, and clearly I am going to be going over that amount.
---
I found two earlier one was in the toolbox where you pick up the new quest, so it seems they can show up as random loot.
---
This is why we need access to full perk/special resets and when they change/nerf weapons or combat to give out a free one like ever other online game .. ima shotgunner too but I use VATS and a VAT shotty so I'm still fine .. maybe just pick up some VATS cards and go crit build it's fun too .. I take alot of drugs you should too!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
yay narcotics!!
---
Once you've found the camera,  it becomes available at vendors for purchase.  So, go hit up Whitesprings and you'll be good to go.  :)
---
This. It's kind of annoying. I've sold several 3 star melee weapons that had faster swing displayed and the mods trash/hidden for several 1000 caps
---
Except serums sell for big caps to vendors, and they're honestly pretty easy to craft, depending on which flux is needed.
---
It's not a nerd if it was never intended to he that OP.
---
It did more damage than it said.
---
A fix is not a Nerf
---
It‚Äôs indefinite until another player kills you
---
No one who can follow that explanation needs this post.
---
I would actually suspect Bethesda not remembering those things give odd stars. But then again, 4 star doesn't exits on the table so you might get nothing :)
---
No you just get wanted for ten caps. Odds are they will not initiate pvp. Once they do initiate, you no longer gain wanted for destroying stuff.
---
This update has so many awesome stuff!!
---
That's a lot of resources.. I was thinking to just wait for ultracite
---
Were you able to get a backpack? That's all I want. I hope we don't have to wait for future quests
---
Straight on edge of that camp. If i remember spawn correctly :D
---
Add me. IGN: Murderbones
---
Quick question. Is it worth selling Mini Nukes (if so, what price would be fair?) or should I not bother with them and just throw out? I don‚Äôt use them.
---
Until someone claims it. Store your junk and head to whitesprings, there's usually someone there who'll take it off you.
---
Hey it‚Äôs something at least.
---
If I could upvote numerous times I would!
---
I don't like meeting up with people to trade for that reason. I don't mind a 10% cut as long as I can avoid the unnecessary stress. It's so nice just exploring the wasteland and constantly hearing that sale noise. I like to look at the different items they buy and try to figure out something about them. Somebody bought my plans for excavator rusty knuckles and ultracite explosive vents - I thought it was a new player, because those are imo relatively easy to find plans. I was surprised to see the player was level 127
---
The ability to move SPECIAL points around seems to address this already. 
---
Was there some reason a mass special reset is needed?
---
Same here. Though I think all the other items are plans so going to get them on my alt and try switching them over.
---
When all of your competitors are selling for 1each and you realize you are selling 0, you‚Äôll understand.
---
That‚Äôs not really the way I thought it would work. I figured it would be a set it and forget it kind of affair
---
Is it as boring as I think it is? Because I just spent like an hour doing the stupid tests and I only completed one
---
Thank you! Finally someone who isn't an asshat who gets it.  I like the game, but I dont want to constantly have to redistribute my damn perk point to rebuild after every nerfing.
---
Hmmm interesting thanks

Same here
---
A lot of people want the cap limits raised, but that will inadvertently drive prices up.
---
More cap sinks are healthier for the economy than just a higher cap limit.
---
Its happened to me on and off, have never been able to suss out why. 
---
Seems some patches improve/degrade the situation, I think like patch 7 was the only one where my client actually shut down properly. Mostly it hangs, maybe kind of force closes itself for the most part, but occasionally I've got to alt - tab and close it off the bar. Handful of times its locked up too badly for ctrl-alt-del to even respond.
---
Maybe the extra caps could help Bethesda upgrade their servers.
---
If youre on pc, its a mods/ini file issue
---
No kidding. Popping around like a madman, tossing caps at every CAMP I visit, selling a few extra things on teh side, unloading a ton of stash ... just the best, yo.
---
Well, crap. That's going to put people right under my porch floor (where I used to show up when I ft'd before I moved the camp unit).
---
You got it. It might be little bit better but RGN is so huge in the game.
---
It's not how I like to play, simple as that.
---
At the pioneer scout camp, there‚Äôs a knowledge exam cabin right next to the scout gutsy.
---
Got it, thanks guys!
---
When I've joined the server my quest log had disappeared,then a went to the scout camp...then the quest poped up again.dunno what can fix for you.
---
The knowledge test is at the spot you first start the quest
---
Enclave quest line gets you the X-01. I've built up the others in bits in pieces during my travels.
---
West tek since my camp is there and some random encounter
---
Where do you get scrip form legendary gear?
---
More than one ezmode builds in the game. Just move on to the next and pour one out for the homies who ain't here.
---
I'm having a problem with high radiation fluids.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the good news!
---
People will quickly realize that products are worth only what people are willing to pay for them. If something is overpriced, especially if I can craft it myself, I won‚Äôt buy it. But if I have caps to spare (I do) I‚Äôd likely just buy for convenience sake.
---
Legendaries don't spawn there anymore.
---
It sounds like you can get the plans from the Enclave Vendor: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bj8pqy/shielded_operative_plans_no_longer_farmable/
---
They used to be farmable. You may also find another player willing to sell the plans or the underarmor.
---
You guys never fail. Is there a way to search these threads to make sure I‚Äôm not making duplicate questions? Semi new to reddit thanks
---
I got it from a cranberry bog treasure map yesterday
---
Maybe you had the chance between 3* and a drill or syringer...
---
Thanks - as least I can fix that myself.

What‚Äôs the carry weight!?
---
will give this a try
---
Yea but I doubt we will be able to unlock backpack without finishing this quest
---
Seriously....and the scrip machine didn't make a dent...but I hope to be fully mobile by this weekend.
---
Where did the Vendor Bot in the Artisan's Corner go...
---
The backpack looks like a plan in the vending machine
---
So players like you ruined the "economy" and now we should all be taxed for it? Seems fair.
---
I‚Äôm on at a shop right now, can‚Äôt inspect.
---
you need it too? if so ill just add as I am looking too
---
Ah yeah that‚Äôs a bug. You‚Äôre suppose to be able to.
---
Well, I've suggested several times this for ammo and junk on the trading sub, that people need to tell Bethesda we need a way to sell stuff for below 1 caps a piece.
---
There was, overall, very little intrest.
---
I would prefer ability to go by 0.1 digits for the price. If we are to bulk ammo, it's likely going to use plastic. I already need all my plastic for shotgun shells. Surely others too?
---
I have been kicked off more times than I care to count but never once frozen. That's why it kinda worried me. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Want to make a profit on that? Ive been trying to find one for 2 months
---
I was able to inspect the stuff of others
---
What you do is go to workshops initiate pvp while their not looking and sneakattack crit them and run off with their junk! This junkyard is a war zone.
---
How did I ruin the economy? I played within the rules, never exploited. Just because I play a lot and trade on the market places I ruined it? Lol okay.
---
Hmmm well I'm stuck at work all day let me know please if you get anything to progress or if you unlock backpack
---
I actually had just planned to get X-01 since I'm so gone with my excavator. I'm going to do it now.
---
It‚Äôs happens to me a dozen times today.
---
What will I do with all my nuka grenades and orbital strikes?  F U Bethesda!
---
I agree but don‚Äôt upvote me for publicity, there are much better people out there than me
---
I need help too
---
Will do.
---
New character played full time yesterday  Went from lvl 2 to 11 and without PA it's not too bad. Nuke Events, etc. are all unplayable due to the amount of radaway you need.  I still use PA for nuke zones (original character) and with my lvl 11  I have to watch rad levels constantly. Used resistant under Armor and am just waiting for rad perk cards to start showing up I use Sun Kissed on my other player which really makes a difference in building up RadAway because you only use it in nuke zones or highly radiated areas.
---
I was a heavy gunner now trying a stealth sniper/light mele (one handed) build which is like being a wizard in an RPG... More fragile, but excellent ranged damage.  I have to always have an escape plan, but it's fun.  I just have to learn how to play the character and know what I can and can't do.  
---
I take my time on perk cards now and wait for the new card packs to show up before picking any new perk cards.  So far everything is neat and necessary (no dupes!). Currently building the base cards for weight reduction (junk weight, ammo, meds) all help with carrying capacity and will be needed later anyways.  The battle perk cards come later on, if I recall correctly.
---
Since we don't have to start from scratch I had some stuff saved for this moment.  I have a HUGE leg up having a lvl 1 chameleon right arm (didn't know there was such a thing as a lvl 1 legendary) and a lvl 5 anti-armor .44 pistol and a lvl 1 - exterminator's hunting rifle .  Just picked up some lvl 5 10mm pistols (mutant slayer's and quad (this one is nice)) from a Whitesprings run last night. 
---
Can't wait for lvl 30 for starched genes and class freak.  Once they arrive I'll be super fun (marsupial, speed demon, herbivore, maybe electrically charged, eagle eyes).
---
It works like 30ish% of the time for me, PC. Completely random, at least from what I've seen.
---
Now that bases can't be griefes, I do plan on moving my Devon arch down to my welcome platform! The missile turrets should keep the mobs off of it!
---
I was able to only once today
---
The pool by the golfers club
---
Have you tried it? I was entirely disappointed. I wouldn't have called it OP at all
---
Yeah no.
---
I can't remember if furious is a primary or not but it's good on fast melee and auto guns.
---
YOU'RE IN LUCK! They have added a FROG HABITAT. Now to find the plans...
---
Pool at whitesprings
---
This is a weird post. Like something you'd see in the Star Citizen subreddit.  
---
I don't see what the point of this post is.
---
grafton bot sells them
---
Also... Play as a raider but don't be rude about it to people? That's extremely contradictory. Raiders are ruthless scum of the wasteland types. That's the entire point.
---
Thank you, its a pain going through perma on doors, my knees crippling out from under me as my radiation powered super strength is taken from me like I were captured by a super villain!
---
Thank you
---
If you're a 'raider', I take it you've never done any quests that empower opposing factions to a far greater extent than benefits you. Hang on, you can drop nukes? So you 'roleplayed' your way though a quest line which literally brought the Enclave faction to life, and somehow managed to 'roleplay' away reasons why enabling an enemy nuclear power was a bad idea... I bet you've handed over entire arsenals to arm your enemies in every faction in return for a few bottle caps  
---
There's no 'roleplaying' here. It's just a pathetic attempt to try and weasel out of your actions. Why not just own it. You want to be a toxic player, and impose your gameplay onto others, whether they want it or not. You trick them into engaging in combat, knowing full well you have the upper hand as they blunder into accidental pvp. Sure, once in a blue moon, someone who knows what they're doing fights back, but mostly its just shooting pacifist fish in a PVE barrel. All reward, negligible risk. Scorched usually fought back more than your targets, so it's not wonder your brief attempts on the PVP servers weren't to your taste.   
---
It basically comes down to the fact that 100s of us can enjoy our games simultaneously without detracting from each other, whereas for you to enjoy your game, lots of other people have to have their game play violated just to accommodate you and what you feel you're entitled to. Go try Rust or something.
---
Which pool? Sorry I don‚Äôt visit there often tbh
---
Yeah that's a staple.. But still it's not the same.
---
ign: dickenstein
---
I play survival for the pvp. I think BGS even advertised survival mode as a pvp mode as the primary feature. Only ppl with full sets of sentinal assassins armor give me any real challenge
---
Did you talk to the robots at the cabins and dolly sods? Each robot gives you a secondary quest.
---
At the cabins, you have to collect toxic waste and deposit it in a container. At dolly sods, you get sent on a quest to loot pieces of insects off of various insects.
---
Ah, more specific thank you! It‚Äôs the only one I have left lol
---
She's cheating on you with a mega-sloth.  At least you can sell all her stuff now.
---
By the golf club
---
How would it being on power armor make it any different than not? You can't craft in PA, so that would negate that part. The rest of it would be exactly the same.
---
You don‚Äôt lose any caps, you just won‚Äôt earn any more above 25k. The player buying an item is still charged the same amount, however, that means there‚Äôs a bit of a cap sink to balance the economy.
---
Is it possible they did it on purpose so there would be at least one item in their vendor at all times so it would stay active, or is that not a criteria for a fast travel to stay live?
---
Seems the player who owns the machine has to be close to it to see the other stats
---
i forgot to mention its on pc, is that a pc ign?
---
But- but. The Youtube algorithm says fo76 bad. So we need to identify the bad 5% of this patch, then repeat it over b-roll footage of people with dying GPUs playing the game
---
I get spawned in locked camps and I ain‚Äôt about to get a bounty so I can buy overpriced items. The weird part is they don‚Äôt have anything inside the camp that would give them a reason to lock it
---
It's meant to be. Trust this is a bug.
---
Awww.... are people 'raiding' your post against your will?  
---
How ironic...   
---
:D
---
Now that I found them, it seems way obvious. I was just unlucky that I knew of the ropes course new the bridge. If I'd have gone to any of the other sites first I would have found the courses right away.
---
Thanks!
---
An upvote from me
---
99% of the community is overwhelming happy, but your incel ass isn't so oh yeah, games gunna die. Lmao.
---
heh yeah I hope it's just a bug and that it will get hot-fixed really quickly :P
---
Very. I keep spawning into the stilts under peoples camps. Lol. It‚Äôs the real sales tax.
---
are you on pc?
---
can i have your loot?
---
I might try selling few for 1 cap each, as I have a lot. Maybe few other ammo types. Definetely not shotgun shells though, and I don't know how to value heavy gun ammo, I'd need to do math for that and can't be bothered to.
---
If prices on discord are goint to remain lower than in vending, I could buy there like so far, and resell ingame. I don't think my camp is in danger and my crops, few water purifers and lead extractors are free to use anyway.
---
Hopefully in long run the prices would even up and we would have digit vending prices.
---
Thats dumb. Mostly if a legendary has 3 stars
---
Oh boi do I have the mods on sale for you!
---
Yeah I don't roleplay bud it's just a play style. Sorry for the misconception. No, you can't shoot pacifist unless they change their game mode or shoot back. They want to fight, it's on them.
---
Oh god PA will basically become Meta
---
Hi I killed a frog and searched it but can't find anything frog related at the tinkers bench?
---
Hmm I expect now people won't sell legendaries anymore to vendors. Wouldn't that be silly?
---
I sell ammo for 1 cap each all the time. Any less isn't worth it. And 5.56 goes for 2 because it's in such high demand. Some people are cheap and expect 2 for 1 because one of their friends did it for them at launch. Other than that, no one complains. We all have 5 characters at max caps by now.
---
Nothing a bloodied lmg cant fix
---
I tossed a 1000c mutt chop in to test if things spoiled
---
Just because you‚Äôre unhappy about the game, doesn‚Äôt automatically mean the game is gonna die you dense fuck.
---
Wow, I knew saving up 7600 atom is gonna finally pay off. Pump action skin and a black powder rifle skin? Awesome!
---
got ya joining now, where should we go to do this?
---
I didn't even see the challenges. I got the 4 part starting mission, saw the first part was to revive someone, and went back to the weekly atom challenges. I play completely solo so scouting is on hold for me until I run across encrypted or a SBQ fight since those are the only times I've revived anybody.
---
I save a lot of stuff just to vendor scrap. Hopefully it pops out good stuff.
---
My post seems to have triggered you. Please try to calm down and come back when you have constructive input. Toodles!
---
I had the same issue. Was able to view the star stats, backed out and decided not to buy it, but changed my mind and when I went back a minute later I couldn‚Äôt view the stats anymore.
---
yep, wanna come my way, got a good place
---
train stations have a new vending machine.
---
You can use the camera just like a weapon, way better than going through the map.
---
The imposter requires other players, the real one just has a huge health pool.
---
Power armor isn't endgame, its more of a play style.
---
cant find in any vendor :(
---
Same effects don't stack, but you can have as many different effects as you want.
---
99% of the remaining community is like 10% of the potential player base.
---
And believe me, I'm not incel and you can suck my dick.
---
Yeah you made a whole post about it
---
This is weird, i could inspect items at first, after fast traveling, i couldnt. rebooting the client made me able to inspect vendor items for a while, but then i couldnt. clicking inspect did nothing. third relog, i could inspect 2star items but not 3star items. i have no clue whats going on
---
on PC. this is wonky yo.
---
They left after the major nerfs early this year.  The move around just isnt feasible given we all have families and do not play enough.  We were major supporters through all the early release issues but the nerfs was a proverbial bridge too far.  I get that my request and our feeling that the perk system to change every 2 levels is subjective and a minority POV but it ended up being the line in the sand for 2 of us 4.  
---
I dont blame Bethesda for feeling like they did enough as it seemed to help the vast majority of players.  For us it wasnt enough.  We're not entitled and we certainly dont expect it but the line is the line.  People in this sub get really mad at me for this take but it is what it is.
---
If you're on PS4, I'll take your stuff
---
Got it, thank you!
---
Yep. Looks like it's not a survival challenge this week. Pretty sure it's a bug but I don't mind
---
[deleted]
---
Aye, I got it
---
By having max caps on multiple accounts thats how. Your words. Just because you have the time and energy to do that doesnt mean those that dont should be penalized because players like you made caps worthless. Not everyones on reddit and trades but everyone has to lose caps cause of it.
---
Well he was.
---
They're not shredded they go to the happy next place to live peacefully forever among the mutants combat armor left legs and assassins rolling pins.
---
Later this month supposedly
---
Why not just implement something super costly that players would want to blow caps on? Ya know. Like how people spend money of new innovations..?
---
Sorry, was using logic.
---
Every loot bag I find is resource for my faction of wasteland scum. How I make these loot bags is thru reg . game at mechanics a.k.a PVP ;)
---
Really? You speak to the Mr Handys at the locations, do what they want then return
---
I didnt say it was going to die. People like you will continue playing.
---
The big thing in this update is player vending and it doesnt even work. Enough is enough.
---
Why am I getting a big New Vegas vibe from this
---
Confirmed as per-character. I ran two of my characters to the vendors, one turned in 147 Scrip worth of Legendaries, the other still had the full 150 available when I logged into them.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt mind either, not big on survival but I‚Äôll take it. Not too bad of prefixes either. Might end up keeping it.
---
Unsure about the achievements
---
The locations I can confirm, made two characters and fast traveled with the help of a friend
---
Still busted
---
Didn‚Äôt get a 3star after taking down the queen, just now ..
---
Killed the queen 15 minutes ago, drill dropped.
---
Why are these exams so hard üòÇ
---
Today I visited several camps and loaded into people's walls/foundations four times.
---
It would be great if you traveled to the spot where there vendor is a couple times I had to hunt around to find them.
---
Other than that I'm really loving it, interesting to see what people are pricing things for.
---
Sounds like bs. You just want to have the protection of 'pvp agreement'.
---
You can be a raider in Survival. Kill people, take their stuff, trash their camps witnout restriction. But as you made it clear, you're not after that.
---
I know right, I got to see some very inspiring camp designs today for the first time since launch really.
---
Didn't you threaten to unsub and have a temper tantrum about not being able to trade here anymore? Guess the filthy sub wasn't what you expected? 
---
Anyway glad your back and still talking shit to anyone who has a different opinion than you
---
So chainsaws are registering damage differently post patch...
---
I can't decide if this was intentional or not. It has the little atom shop symbol as if it were purchased which is odd
---
If you're on XBox, can I have your stuff?
---
Workshop related activities
---
I'm literally wanted every second I'm in that game. I have zero protections.
---
Too many of them, let the herd pass
---
Let me know what happens, please?
---
Oh no! That sucks! Thanks for posting this. Hopefully the welcome mats will come soon so we're not transported inside a locked house.
---
Only reason I can think of to have a locked camp is to keep npc enemies from entering and destroying what's inside. Idk if that's even a thing though... 
---
Most of the time (and very rarely) Mutants will shoot down a wall or door first and then proceed to destroy my furniture, etc. 
---
In the words of Joker from Next Friday "No locked doors! No locked doors!" XD
---
The armor and shotguns aside, something you could do is called *ask the vendor*
---
Can't say I'm surprised people are upset they nerfed the OP armor set that people were deciding to pay 20-100k caps for.
---
Dumb of those folks to jump on that bandwagon, it was OP as hell and just screaming to be nerfed.
---
They nerfed a bug causing explosive shotguns to deal double damage instead of the 25% flat bonus, that was something people exploited and also needed to be nerfed.
---
Player vending, yes that's a valid point. I haven't tried to buy legendaries of other players so I don't know for sure, but I'm assuming you still cannot inspect the item to see other effects? They fixed it for the vendor robots, I don't see why they can't fix it for player to player trading.
---
All in all though, no reason to quit, you do you, but the game is by no means "not gonna make it". IMO it's improving every week.
---
Someone needs a nap
---
What platform are you on? I'll try to find one and I'll just hook you up
---
Oh bollox, there's plenty of flat land. I don't believe for one second that you didn't have turrets if you had it right by the clubhouse.
---
The cooldown wouldn't stop people. Having repeatable permanent boosts, or permanent boosts based on RNG in this sort of game is just poor design. In games such as Slay The Spire, it works because the style is fundamentally different. In an action FPS RPG with PvP and other elements, this RNG is absurd.
---
I survive by staying hidden and get most of my kills with non AA/E/TSE weapons. Most weapons are overpowered it seems and kills happen  fast(to me too). Its ok da about who sees who first or wheres the asshole in chameleon armor(I'm one of them).  some good tactics and chems help alot too. Its doable and I do well without anything OP
---
Sooo because you play this game obsessively and have multiple accounts with max caps, everyone else should be taxed?...
---
Perfect sense there buddy.
---
Beautiful image.
---
idk if u can hear me, but i have fast hp regen and bird bones so i take less fall dmg. maybe i need to get an enemy here or something to kill me in water?
---
Tse shotguns haven't been good since they destroyed the demolition perk
---
Honestly just troll people like you.
---
pc
---
Good to know.
---
That is the whole point of this line. Take your tedious time... it is just Mike a real life DMV....lol
---
The plans are expensive but I caught the vendor selling the jetpack mod for 450 caps. It's honestly easier that way to just use the mod.
---
I already have a two shot +fire rate one, but I don't want to get rid of this one because it has great effects
---
Oh boy, I‚Äôm getting a strong cardio workout and an existential crisis all in one sitting!
---
The concept is just dumb thought. Who buys a game to go to a DMV or take exams? Like really.
---
Then what's the difference between playing Adventure or Survival? Fast travel? Not wanting to lose caps/aid items? 
---
If you've got no protections either way then you mught aswell play survival. The game gives you a mode for your playstyle but choose to play Adventure instead...
---
I bought atoms this morning pre patch. Hopefully they just see today's sales as one.
---
Again, we have a camera, why add a convoluted equipment one? Then add shit daily missions for it.
---
I didn't know there was a real one, and I didnt know I required help. Not like anyone came to help, not like they explained it, not like I can do it again anyway.
---
And does normal armour compare to PA in terms of both DR AND rad resist now? I didn't see any regular gear offering much rad resist.
---
It's becoming something really special.  The devs are definitely listening and improving it drastically.
---
That's...  really sad.  Hope you find a way to get better soon!
---
Just add a Keleven to compensate for the tax
---
Can I have the leftover stuff you don't want?
---
Hmm...allow another point of view.
---
Players who play 4 hours a day, or 30 mins a day, both get same 1400 caps from vendors. It might be a bit difficult to get enough stuff in that 30 mins, to sell it all, but then, maybe realistic examples would be more like 8 hours and 2 hours.
---
If you play a lot, you can't afford to pay a lot for ammo. If you play significantly less, you can pay more.
---
200 is a problem for you?! Once I had to clear around 700 on me with my stash already full
---
Then don't play.
---
Shhhiiiittttt. Sorry, dude. Can't help you then :(
---
I have zero idea how mine disappeared, but yeah, shot myself in the foot here too.
---
That's one of the most amazing things I've ever heard of, totally trying this
---
Yes, exactly. I'm glad you see it my way.
---
What really??? Only 450? That‚Äôs incredibly cheap, did they shrink the price of the other jet pack mods too?
---
It's a tiny increase, but it does increase your camp budget. I just tried to add some bulk acid to a vending machine (27/30 slots used, so it should be fine), but when I went to put it into the machine I got a message saying "MY CAMP is full" and wouldn't let me sell it.
---
That's a hell of a prison pocket you got.
---
I just don't know what to do atm, because I don't want to be labeled as though I'm intentionally being a dick, I REALLY don't want to get rid of my CAMP. Guess I'm just stuck not utilizing it for the time being until either a change is made or I suck it up and move. Otherwise every player who shows up not in power armor will fall, die, and think I'm a dick. üòî
---
What should Mini Nukes be priced at? Any ideas? Or is there no point in selling those?
---
Ah. It's you that has my precious junk node.
---
How original.
---
30 pounds
---
I'd really like to see twenty camps worth of missles vs a scorchbeast.
---
I have to remind myself to get it for my heavy weapons character. He's only level 25 so this will be a nice middle levels weapon for him to use until he can get a max level weapon.
---
No no, I'm further up that same line, right next to the workshop!
---
is my body too deep in water to press f on? is the water getting in the way because the genious at bethesda made revive same button as drink?
---
No, sadly it's true. Paying with stash space AND camp budget. Must be a bug, can't be intentional?
---
Happened to me too.
---
No doubt..... if you are from NJ you would completely get it.... complete pain in the  ass....
---
Went to the Tyler County Dirt Track in adventure mode (because it‚Äôs got low level ghouls) and was going to swap over to survival until I just shrugged and decided to take it over to get a random plan. Turns out I got it easily there! Hooray, more encumbrance!
---
Relogging fixed it for me
---
I didnt find either to be op. An anti armor shotgun should feel like the high end weapon that it is. I found it in a nukezone many levels backs and respec'd my character around it. 
---
I know they said they were fixing a glitch, but the difference is power is too much. Theres no way it wasnt nerfed.
---
I didnt find ass/cav armor to be op, considering you could still be one shotted from 75 yards away while sprinting in it.
---
Both of these take power away while chameleon vats snipers/auto rifles are unstoppable in PvP. Theres no hope for that mode after this one.
---
[removed]
---
Ok, so this is a lot of trouble, BUT if you blueprint everything else, then move your CAMP just far enough that it packs everything up and then put it back you should be able to delete the two spare pieces that way. (I had this problem yesterday with two floating wall pieces. Very frustrating.)
---
You get one right after you finish the quest for a reward. Adds an extra 30 pounds of carry weight
---
Ah okay. I had to move down by fort defiance. Thankfully my 50 cal does about 280 per bullet so the scorchbeasts don't last long but still. Aggravating.
---
Were you built for heavy weapons? I‚Äôm comparing it to other heavy weapons as a heavy user.
---
It‚Äôs other weakness is being energy damage based. No armor piercing.
---
Is 1v1 an option in survival? No. Is the whole server sitting at ws shooting each other in adventure? No.
---
As stated I don't want to play battle Royale. That's what pubg is for. There's more to adventure than just all out shooting each other mindlessly at a train station.
---
ehm yeah but idk why this is related to Fallout:
---
- put one behind the transparent back of your water bottle
---
- backside of your rubber
---
- stick one behind the transparent part of a pack of cotton tissues
---
Where do you start it? I'm looking for the courses, but no luck.
---
Inspect item at vendors works on and off tho.
---
Ok, so not just changing world?
---
To be fair, you would be a dick if you just sat in a chair and collected their junk after they splatter at your feet. For now it's just the cost of doing business üòÇ
---
50
---
Guy is definitely an angry virgin.
---
Does that matter while you're actively participating? No. No it doesn't.
---
The new score system sucks for survival mode. My first game had 3 level 200's just hunting anyone who got into the top 3. Because of that you got into the top 3 super easily for just exploring. Then they came and hunt you and one shot you. Its not fun at all so i had to quit and go to adventure mode.
---
Me too. Ign esimpson212
---
Mothman?
---
Good for you? I'm not at a stage within the game where that's something that would happen... **my worries are not yours**
---
You ded. If you're in a set of cabins in the Forest, it's a fake haunting, there's a holotape or letter you can find about it
---
What is the gun
---
Except now it's actually generated items instead of rerolling existing ones.
---
Sent friend request
---
I get potshots from whatever mob holds the workshop at the time, but they never hit!
---
Not sure, I just saw it when I stopped by the bunker. Modus was actually selling the X01 jetpack mod for 450 caps. Or you could buy the plan for 7000 caps and have to spend all your flux to make it.
---
Alot anti PVP talk on here bums me out. Be warned I will kill all players I come across as I would anyway to help everyone remember what survival mode is.
---
Ye teleportation to my camp you end up in a rock
---
Right here with ya! I got 30 minutes left!
---
Did they fix the bug of non-cosmetic items being sold in the Atom Shop? I coulda sworn that they said that would never happen...
---
No thanks.
---
I like that u think that. üòÄ
---
My, not good sir, i would suggest fucking yourself
---
Maybe I should put a rocking chair down at the bottom ü§î
---
You don't _need_ repair kits. Nobody _needs_ repair kits. You _can_ buy them from the atom shop, if you want, but you don't _have_ to. You _can_ get them from certain events like the SBQ fight and (goddammit) they're nice to have sometimes in the wild, on the fly. But you can always repair your gear the old fashioned way: at a workbench, with the sufficient quantity and type of components, like god intended.

DELETE THIS

If someone else is at the terminal aim at thw keyboard and u can take it on your pipboy

Except DayZ. I‚Äôm not 100% on the rest, but DayZ stand alone is 100% online. Yes, you can play a private server, and. It give anyone access, but you still have to be connected to the internet to access the said server, so...why do you keep moving the bar when I prove you wrong? Keep going though, it‚Äôs fun to make you look bad.
---
You need a full stimpack diluted doesn't work
---
That sounds like a very good way to keep players from ever using player vending machines.
---
Also noticed since new patch camps getting attacked more frequently
---
LoL! Perhaps a banjo as well

This...üòÇüòÇ
---
No
---
Just stop crying already.
---
Platform?
---
Oh ok thanks
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME THAT SKELETON'S GENDER?!?  
---
What... so you just figure that a big sunhat and a women's bathing suit is indicative of it being a female? Men can wear those things too, you know!
---
\[/s\] :P
---
I have a quad ammo capacity crossbow. I approve buffs for crossbows. I want to use it more
---
Beaned
---
Amen to that
---
Agreed
---
I plopped down there when I first found Whitesprings and liked the green grass view, some peace of mind with the robot defense and close vendors.  The central location was nice for fast traveling as well.  Didn't ever have a lot of turrets to cheese the system, sometimes we just can't have nice things...
---
Classy.
---
Can I have the wood and cloth scraps
---
Thanx
---
It's like they want us to be too busy with each other to be mad at them lol.
---
Wixon Farm is a good place to get pics of frogs and cats. both seem to spawn in the garden/field.
---
Not all of those who wander are lost, friend.
---
same this was a really good patch
---
Thanks friend
---
I dnt use diliteds. Only stimps and super stimps üòï
---
Got one, why? It's pretty low damage and loading 4 shots takes just as long as loading 4 individual shots would.
---
brb going to....... experiment.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, diein' time's here.¬†
---
Mine is 30
---
My character is bugged since few days yet
---
*explosive* shotguns went from dealing double damage to 1.25x damage. My critical shotgun build is still doing just fine. As far as PvP goes, it's not the best, but what do you expect when the meta has been bloodied automatic explosive guns from users wearing assassins/sentinel armor.
---
Sent/ass and cav/ass were definitely OP. There is little to counter against them, and definitely no way to counter unless you were able to find trades or had 2-3 mule characters maxed out on caps. 
---
If the balance doesn't make total sense, think of how unbalanced the economy got with that meta floating around. I'm super happy about it.
---
I'm right there with you. Close vendors and a nice view. Was a quaint little spot.
---
Then you're not a "raider", just a weak opportunist when things are in your favor.
---
Roleplaying as a raider, you should enjoy the thrill of the hunt, theres no thrill in a non-combatant unless you're a bully.
---
You're not a bully are you?
---
Ah yes, I see you are a coniesseur of the finer things.
---
Xbox, Wouldn't let me flair it for some reason
---
"Being a cat burgalar in the wastes, robbing vending machines, I couldn't help but laugh at the cat shrub next to it"
---
I sold almost 9000 rounds of ammo within 10 minutes of making my vending machine so... I dont believe you. We on reddit only make up 1% so alot of other players think 1 cap for 1 bullet is a steal compared to vendors or crafting it yourself
---
My unyielding armor with rad resist works.
---
You might just have the bugged pieces. Those pieces don't show the rad symbol with 25 in the stat box, it just lists it as a legendary effect. It's actually a poisoners piece, but it doesn't apply that either... it's messed up.
---
I'm willing to bet your chameleon piece shows the correct info in the stat box.
---
&gt; Weekly: Corrected a Weekly Challenge timer that would have outlasted the inevitable heat death of our universe.
---
ha!
---
Was willing to pay up to 35k per piece yesterday, glad no one sold me any:)
---
Honestly, the way the quest is designed it‚Äôs asking you to run a Nuke Silo. You‚Äôll be able to hit every level terminal on the way to launch.
---
"Hey Farva...whats that place with all the goofy shit on the walls?"
---
Yes hopefully! For now we just have to remember to fast travel to the nearest location instead.
---
No, fast travel itself tends to spawn enemies when you appear in a cell. But for some reason planted crops draw their attention first, above anything else.
---
They fixed it i believe in this patch
---
Nobody needs repair kits. Just go to a weapon bench, and see what materials it takes to repair.
---
This snapshot looks awesome! Though I can just imagine hordes of zombies headbutting state-of-the-art armor plate and losing plenty of teeth and skin in a futile and pathetic show of offense while you just stand there unaffected.
---
i wouldnt sell for less than 100c
---
Yeah, cause this game needs less players.
---
You mean shenanigans?
---
Yes, that was the inspiration
---
Raiders are opportunists, plain and simple. I play the cards so they're in my favor.
---
Bounty hunters enjoy the thrill of the hunt, you have it backward.
---
Yes, yes I am a bully. That's what a raider does. You can fight or run.. That's your call.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Ignore my previous reply. I just realized that it was my STASH that was full. I'm not sure why the pop up said "camp", but I just spent 10 minutes deleting shit to free up space.
---
I think you mean ‚ÄúProtect *AND* serve‚Äù. Don‚Äôt forget the emphasis on the ‚Äúand‚Äù.
---
[Use this interactive map to find a resource near a spot you're interested in.](https://fo76map.com) Then build on that.
---
Same here, I just never left.
---
Yeah.... dont play survival mode...
---
Same issue, saw that stats on one item then it stopped working.
---
This, but people who come to mine end up under seneca rocks
---
If there is going to be a 10% tax then we should get 10% of the cost when people fast travel to our house
---
Any idea on why you can't sell weapons and amor above your players level?
---
And a rad removing arch plan dropped, so I‚Äôm now wondering- is anyone on PS4 selling the supplies to build that at their vendor CAMPS?
---
When you fast travel to white spring golf club, the building to your left has a high wall and a swimming pool, four frogs spawn there always. You can go around the building or hop over the red truck and scale the wall.
---
Someone said the owned had to be nearby to be able to inspect
---
Again, very original.
---
Go make one level 50 and it actually givese +60
---
So it‚Äôs not that bad?! Relief! I‚Äôll try again later...
---
Thanks man!
---
I got my answer.Only regular stimps can revive somebody.(i recently started use s.stimps as well) My bad..Thanks
---
Taxes usually get applied from totals.
---
How about legendary packpacks?  The duper \*\*\* OP backback has 1000 carry weight and -30% to all items placed in it.
---
Yeah. They made them random high level spawns now. So no more hoping for a new player to spawn them.
---
My coworker just happens to be listening to the Farva &amp; Mac podcast right now :p
---
My aae pump went from killing a level 68 supermutant in 2-3 shots with no adrenaline, to 4-5. That is a pretty major nerf for something that wasnt op. Even if thats how it is, crafting requirements for shells need to be cut in half, at least. 
---
Ass/cav didnt do much for me. I was still getting one shotted while sprinting from 75 yards away. 
---
Nothing has really been done to nerf the "meta" and anything else just keeps getting farther away. Makes no sense.
---
wait, how did you get 3/4 pioneer scouts? I think I can only found 2/4
---
Talking to the robot in toxic waste; he wants me to clean the lake from the toxic goo
---
Talking to the robot in the mire; he wants me to collect insect parts
---
Did I miss something like another robot?
---
That really is the best part of this new system. Even if a lot of players end up just trying to sell complete junk for insane prices, it's awesome that we can now see camps on the map, go to them, and really get that feeling that there's other survivors who have set up a base and made the wasteland their home.
---
Why fight the queen?
---
My life story today
---
Yes fully vulnerable, no wanted level to be gained
---
I've got some high radiation fluid for you heuhheuhheuh. Seriously though, I did say nuked WA run and got maybe 3 total from the 20+ ghouls
---
Comparing an op gun you got with fake money to a real life car.
---
Go cry somewhere else, my dude.
---
You're not entitled to anything staying the same, balance-wise, in an online game.
---
Can you equip and unequip?
---
**Auditing Intensifies**
---
This is my favorite patch to date as well spend an hour going to every vendor and picking up missing plans from players. Just hope they make selling ammo easier by bulking it soon. Backpacks, legendary script to not feel back about getting 3 caps for a legendary. List goes on. So good.
---
So would you argue that junkie addictions and mutations are mandatory? They offer a permanent boost which easily negate other options by far? Honestly a .5% chance drop pie with cool down on machines no stacking for a 5 or 10% exp boost and 25 health and rad resist is so underwhelming to design choices already in the game. This is not a fair argument.
---
Damn I think i just seen you too
---
* I did a nuked WS run. Thanks auto correct
---
I spawned inside a guy's house today and started cooking.  I think I confused the hell out of him.
---
I‚Äôve know heavy a while now , it‚Äôs Dense I took a capture at a work bench if your Xbox my Gt is same as here you can view recent captures
---
My shop was there but no biggie there are plenty of other spots to do business
---
I found the one at camp venture, it's just outside the camp to the east. I'm just gonna look for stuff like that around. And the instructor is hilarious!
---
Done something similar. I have a shop outside Watoga station, beds, corn, purified water, all benches and a decontamination arch for people to use, plus instruments and radios to keep them entertained :)
---
Look after your customers and they will look after you!
---
You can trade in a Lvl 5 piece of 1star armor for 3 mole-man-money, or a lvl5 1star weapon for 5.  You can trade in a lvl 45 3star pickaxe for 40 mole-man-money.    i think thats about the range, a lvl50 weapon might be 45 or 50 but i din't want to risk looking at that, and then accidentally blowing up my good stuff somehow.
---
Yeah, I spawned in at a couple of super weird spots myself. Keeps things interesting anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Thanks.
---
I play survival mode for the pvp it was said to be geared for;)
---
Very nice!
---
 My camp is called Camp Shenanigan because it is right on the shenanigan ski trail at the top of the world.
---
Small world!
---
Thank you.
---
How does it work? I killed two frogs and searched their bodies but there was nothing to craft at the tinkers bench that is frog related?
---
Thank you!
---
Powering it on just broadcasts your location on the map
---
Ty
---
Do you have a Wooden Desks Plan for sale?
---
Tested this earlier. The sacrificial blade and scorch killer mods are not recognized by the vending machine.
---
I've been having some real bad server stability. Crashed 7 times today already
---
Oh no, I did the bugged Achievements right away, thankfully, but I was procrastinating on loading my again to unlock those locations. Good to know that‚Äôs busted before I tried and it ended in failure.
---
Yeah, I didn't think about the pvp side of it. I don't play survival. I guess on the side it is game breaking when every shot counts.
---
Yes.
---
My favorite is spawning inside their locked camp lol
---
I have a base there but is because it‚Äôs convenient no walls or floors everything is open to the public to use and I don‚Äôt ever have turrets any more I hope it‚Äôs still there
---
You need to craft a frog jar at the chem bench
---
Right now the load location for my base is not ideal for visitors. I can‚Äôt change it without redoing my base entirely. We need welcome mats that determine where people load in.
---
In other words, some people can‚Äôt help it yet.
---
If memory serves its down in the western part of the Ash Heap.
---
Me too. After this update Bethesda certainly earned some of my money. I purchased 2000 atoms.
---
Probably to maintain the value of those items. People have been talking about hoarding tons of 3* legendaries for weeks now. We still don't know how much things will cost, but the only ways of balancing it if they let us cash legendaries in for scrip early is to either limit how much we can get or make anything decent cost upwards of 3000 scrip
---
Don't think that's a solution to his problem as he clearly is choosing to play on survival
---
Nah, the servers are hella buggy today.. I can't even scroll through my inventory
---
Do you know where the swimming challenge is?
---
Lv doesnt make a difference from what i can tell
---
People have said fast traveling to Vault 76 fixes it. I haven't had this happen yet, to test if it works.
---
Ok Thanks :)
---
Never thought i‚Äôd see a application to join a group on here, shame you‚Äôre on X1 and not PS4 lol
---
Ya you on PC I can help
---
\+karma
---
Heavy is pleased!  Now just need Sandvich!
---
It‚Äôs not dumb.  Not at all.  This game has helped me in similar ways.
---
They talked all about that.
---
All powering it does is broadcast your location.
---
No on XBOX but where exactly is it at Spruce Knob Lake?
---
yes, it's like a normal item but you can't drop it or sell it, kinda like a weapon/armor with a atomic shop skin
---
Just opened this for the first time today. What happened?
---
No lol
---
Looks great dude!
---
You literally said and I quote ‚ÄúI‚Äôve given up on this game. It‚Äôs not going to make it. RIP.‚Äù End quote. 
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs saying you think it‚Äôs going to die. I for one disagree with you, I think Bethesda is making great strides in fixing this game that was very bugged and glitched at launch.  Player vending seems to work quite fine, I have heard both sides of people saying they can and can‚Äôt inspect legendary weapons or armor. I‚Äôm sure they will fix it. 
---
Is your temper tantrum over?
---
The issue is there are some of us that haven't been apart of player trading before, so knowing prices is next to impossible. Bullets and aid should be pretty self explanatory for pricing. The plans, for example, are so much harder. The game gives you a Value, but IMO quite a few of them are actually worth much more. Without having a guide for that kind of information it's tough. A simple "going price" list for high ticket items would be pretty dope.
---
I think you can do the three in any order.  Look for the yellow flags.
---
The Camp Venture course is on the Northern side of the camp.  The Sunnytop Ski Lanes course is also on the Northern side of the Lanes, and heads down the hill towards the base lodge.  The Gorge course starts on top of the bridge on the Eastern side.
---
I only saw the patch notes. Where did they say this was intentional?
---
Was following around low levels hoping to get to revive them but no luck yet. Will save this post though, definitely want a backpack.
---
Maybe it's attached by accident to the pioneer scout poster or the personal terminal?
---
Instead of being broken 100% of the time as a static effect happening all times, in battle you now have a 75% chance of the effects occurring. Meaning that all those armor effects have a 25% chance of being useless.
---
Mostly they were just griefing by denying other people those kills. Then if they were home at their camp, they could shoot the ghouls once or twice each and let the turrets finish them off to get credit.
---
The 3-star legendary that dropped for this week is worth 40 scrip...
---
I think you can place a campfire on top of the border of the foundation you want to keep and the one you don‚Äôt, and then remove the offending one
---
Sounds like it would take strategic placement of turrets, unfortunately. 
---
I'd make a little box near the edge of your camp circle, safe from turret view.
---
So if it clashes with your outfit you can unequip it?   Yes, I just asked that question.   (Shakes head).
---
Since me and a friend deal with power armor a lot, I use locked doors for an "airlock" to keep players out if we're dropping chassis to trade sets. Other than that I dont see a purpose either
---
 [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) 
---
Its kind of South East of Whitesprings, Spruce Knob itself is a Workshop (looks like a green Top of the World)
---
Yeah the third one is revive an ally
---
What I did was tell them I'll pay them 100 caps it took a few but one helped me also do it in water it will also do a challenge
---
Hope they make tactical skins for the backpacks.  I look ridiculous with a Jansport backback on my stealth sniper.  I was hoping for an Oakley or 5.11 style backpack skin that would look awesome.  I'd pay 500 caps for that!
---
Can confirm. Got kill a human like creature and I wasn't in survival.
---
Are you sure?  I jumped servers and had to reload my vending machine and re price everything
---
It mentions a 15 second timer after picking a location, as long as you don't take damage.
---
Juice is not food. Food xp bonus overrides prior food XP bonus. Food XP stacks with anything else.
---
Cobbler is food.

I'm checking rn thanks for the info!!

It‚Äôs the jar, right?
---
I jumped servers three times and everything was there
---
This is getting upvoted? That's hilariou, holy shit.
---
Gnomed!
---
Xbox here, no issues at all.
---
I was just referring to the main theme of the narrative of letting go, not being stuck in the past lol
---
Definitely a mistake. I don't know if it's something they'd punish us for or not. I'm really tempted to place them because they go nicely with the Whitespring grass
---
Thanks for the tip, will try when I get back on.
---
This has happened to me for a long time. I pick some other spot, just to get the option to pop up, then close the map, then go back into the map and try my CAMP again. It works after I do that one or two times.
---
It‚Äôs quicker than the time it would take to FT to another location like 76 and then to my CAMP.
---
I was a good guy at the clubhouse :(
---
Two kids. Happy family. Things you will never have.
---
It's the camp floor decor thing
---
Yep got the weapon in my preferred mode :)
---
Damn. Don‚Äôt have any but it looks like I have some reading to do because that just raises more questions.
---
I'm surprised that I haven't heard of anyone arriving in a death pit yet.
---
Don‚Äôt know how much scrip is worth
---
You'd like that, wouldn't you.
---
I'll have to check again after the hockey game. Wasn't there for me.
---
Well, when you want things like this, there is the problem of abusing it.
---
No I meant the swimming challenge, it says complete the swimming challenge at Spruce Knob Lake but I‚Äôve been walking around it for literally ever and can‚Äôt find it.
---
yea, it still works but you won't see your backpack model
---
Pretty sure a comfy pillow in the apocalypse is going to make me a millionaire (well 25grandiare).  I‚Äôm pretty sure in a similar scenario I would kill people for these without a second thought.
---
The the description before you built it..
---
I don't have the pioneer scouts poster unlocked, but can still biluild the topiaries.
---
Oh sorry, my bad
---
There's a specific location that constantly spawns ghouls, usually high-level ones with frequent Legendaries. People were making CAMPs nearby so their turrets would constantly mow down all those ghouls. They wouldn't get XP for it, but could loot the bodies, and just generally made it difficult for anyone else to kill those ghouls.
---
This patch made it so no one can place a CAMP in that particular spot.
---
I sell them for 10
---
What do you have to do?
---
No thank you. They can have that on the survival servers.
---
I just did the same after reading this. I told myself if they'd buck up and listen I'd reward them. In other news visit my bar C.A.M.P. on Xbox @ hiimalexnt.
---
You need to spend some caps or store the machine
---
If you unpower it, players can only buy if they bumble across your camp location
---
In the meantime, I read that if you use your camera to sweep the area, it‚Äôll show up as a description so you can find the body.    I haven‚Äôt tried it myself, but hopefully it helps.
---
Thats awesome, I'm glad you can relate :)
---
The Sentinel worked by negating damage while standing still by 15%, Cavalier works the same but sprinting. Assassin reduced damage I wanna say by 8%. But Assassin and Sent/ Cav were in different categories so they could stack up. It was a super OP meta with very stupid work arounds. I feel this is now more fair in combat overall.
---
Should definitely be periodic updates to the music playlists.
---
I can finally unload all the shit legendaries I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to discard for 20 caps. Man my stash weight is gonna drop like 300 pounds
---
The vending is the coolest thing ever
---
To test this theory that it was "fixed." Also to see if they added serum recipes back. Doesn't seem like it but it is a small sample size.
---
yeah I still cant find it lmao
---
I said the chameleon piece worked so, yes it works. Lol üòÇüòÇ bugged pieces? Is it the BoS mod that bugs it maybe?
---
Oh great. Then 2 moths later we hear people were duping with something like this. 
---
I hope not, but I've got the impression dupers really try all means whenever their old means were fixed.
---
Claim a workshop 
---
Build a turret in a camp/workshop
---
Kill a humanlike creature...
---
Yea i wish they were a but tougher but hey its a free weapon
---
I see, it's a decent setup to fight ghouls but with the way xp/loot works it's a dick move.
---
I wish Bethesda would share xp within a party and share xp for events,nuke zones, and any other special zones.
---
It would be sweet if there were so many ghouls that you had to setup camps with turrets around an area as a strategy to deal with it.  I could see people designing sweet turret towers for just such an event.
---
Sticky Meat!
---
The xbow can be similar to the syringer. It can have poison tips, explosive tips, cryo tips, napalm tips, but what it really needs is an automatic receiver.
---
running three by myself right now everyone is messing with their vendors.
---
In what plattaform are you on?
---
WHY ARE YOU YELLING? ARE WE REALLY FAR APART? MAYBE A LONG HALLWAY?
---
That's the same nerf that was already applied to other explosive legendaries, apparently it wasn't applied properly to shotguns. Now it is /shrug  
---
And now shotguns aren't vastly out of step with every other explosive weapon in the game.
---
Honestly, I give away spare bulk materials in the whitesprings crafting register. I cannot possibly sell it all, so I hit my caps limit and then give the rest away. Saving stash space through altruism ;).
---
Buy a broken camera from a vendor and use that to craft a new Deluxe ProSnap
---
Ya it's pretty fun
---
Not at this time
---
That's amazing. Really is. Brings co-operation and helping random players back again.
---
Nvm it was south west not south east
---
Ahh thank you. Yeah I stopped fighting her awhile back because of the terrible loot.
---
Chia pets. I'm glad I stuck it out.
---
Why didn't you just try the market subs earlier?
---
Didnt work for me. But opening the map up multiple times does. Worked on the third try just now
---
Yes please. At a certain point I can't take it and just wander around in silence.
---
I agree with sentinel being OP but assassin's is a joke  actually needs a buff. Only thing I don't really like about the update is my quaint little base behind the club house (not a floating turret pad) got nuked. It was even built along the fence not on the green with no turrets. Way to ruin it for the rest of us douche hammers! Or should I say douche turrets. I'm sure the same guys crying about sentinel
---
Ohhh. Gotcha
---
Yes, defend event is completely seperate. Workshop can be contested anytime it has an owner.
---
Yeah it popped for me and I had to check if I was in survival lol
---
What would this proposed Matt do? Like an NPC?
---
Ya
---
Just tried it and IT DOES WORK THANKS!!
---
I'm sorry
---
You're totally right, as far as I had seen, they had not said that much until the patch hit and was not aware.
---
Definitely, I had some higher level buy plans from me as well. I had the tomahawk plan which I was surprised to find out it was so rare lol.
---
What kind of savage are you, you eat it out of the can? Jesus, next you'll tell me you eat dog food too!
---
Lol how so?
---
Just spawned in a guy's water farm.  He had it walled off with the super high concrete slabs so I had to jump on the water purifiers, then his roof, then jump down to his front door to get to the machine.  
---
 If I didn't have marsupial I would have had to fast travel to escape.  I guess I'll have to test spawn points before putting out my machine.
---
I put them down for 25, but if that doesn‚Äôt do it, 10 it is. Thanksüòä
---
I'm not missing SBQ (Scorchbeast Queen) events when someone doing in my server. There are valuable plans and legendary items. And, I'm acquiring improved repairing kits as plus. This repair kits really convenied my gameplay but simple version of repair kits are really useless for me. So I suggest you to don't waste your earned atoms on repair kits. :)
---
That seems nice. Especially with the vendor stations
---
To be blunt, those will never go away, so I'd rather encourage the ones that aren't little shits.
---
That would be fucking stupid.
---
Depending on the type of player you are. For me today was a absolute nightmare for many reasons
---
Wait, middle school math is getting upvoted?
---
Holy shit guys, you're better than this.
---
Literally just multiply the desired income by 10/9...
---
I got lucky to be able to inspect that assassins/sentinel/+end leather left leg before buying it for 270 caps. Guess two other guys that checked the store before me couldn't, why else wouldn't they buy it before me? Gotta visit more shops in a search for gems like this.
---
Still have to encounter this issue once. Hope it's not that severe on pc.
---
Challenges -&gt; Scroll Down To Tadpole  
---
Pick 3 of those and complete them.
---
Even before the vending machines, I found that if someone fast travels to your CAMP, they can drag an enemy along with them somehow. When I‚Äôve met someone at my CAMP in the past for a trade, when they arrive, a scorchbeast or something shows up also. Maybe that‚Äôs it.
---
I think most people who look for them only want a few, so 25 isn't bad.
---
Probably just a miss.
---
They probably meant for them to sell for 980 like the deep pocketed ones.
---
They'll likely fix that
---
 Been on 9/10 for months. Finnaly
---
I'd sell for 10 caps per 1% XP bonus (cant recall what that bonus is just now, but I am assuming it's %5.) But that's me.
---
Can you spare a moth man wing by any chance? (Xbox?)
---
&gt; "good husband points"
---
Is that when the wifey literally points at other husbands to show you which good ones YOU should be like? ;)
---
Honestly I had no idea they existed till a couple weeks ago.
---
The bushes are free rn!!
---
Sure, if you‚Äôll give it back.
---
I did. Now I‚Äôm not getting anything
---
Could be, never been this bad before. I wonder if they know that I have stuff :-)
---
the Rider skins are applicable to all types of power armor and result in the same appearance. It will make whatever armor you apply it to look like T51-b.
---
Its currently bugged. But you need to catch a frog and make the jar under Science Projects in the Chem Bench. After that its under the floor items in the camp build menu.
---
People that still argue f76 is bad but haven‚Äôt played it-‚ÄúBuT THerE aRE nO NpcS!‚Äù
---
PVP yal so I can fill my vending machines
---
Oh ok, thx man
---
It's hit or miss. Last nuke run (today, post patch)I was getting 3 Hardened Mass every other kill. Other nuke runs I've gotten 1 the whole session I was there.
---
Word on the street was something to do with getting into the dev room.
---
I wouldn't be playing the game if I didn't like it and understand that they are improving the game and i'm thankful for that. However, like I said. They're capable of being much better, they should not get praise for fixing mistakes when they charged full price for a product that shouldn't of been full price. If they needed more time, extend the launch. Everyone just gets upset the moment someone says anything negative about this game and It's dumb, live in reality. The game is great right now, but my point was that it should of been before.
---
So far, I've only sold shotgun shells. I listed them at 1c since I didn't know they were in such high demand. I might need to change that...
---
All you have to do is multiply the desired income by 10/9 to find the price you should set...
---
I love how everyone is praising OP when they just made it seem complicated for no reason. This is middle school shit.
---
Dont worry...
---
It just works ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Make sure you updated your Fallout76Custom.ini with the new text under \[Archive\] in Fallout76.ini. Copy the whole big paragraph after sResourceArchive2List.
---
I also just had this problem with the Pip-Boy - any time there's a big patch we need to change the Custom ini.
---
If that doesn't work, try removing all the mods and adding them back one by one.
---
My PC is probably worth about 150 dollars, mainly becaue of 500 GB SSD. People who can afford latest gen consoles put more money into them than I into PC.
---
You need to talk to the robot inside. He'll send you off on an annoying quest to get a bunch of bug parts.
---
Same here! Bought a TSE handmade now I‚Äôm down to 1k left of my caps.
---
Not at the workshop at the buildings next to the workshop where the bear is. .... just down the road there are a couple of cabins
---
Nice!! Working my way through it now lol.
---
Its if the seller is nearby you can inspect, if not you cant
---
Ahh ok thank u
---
Yes, middle school math is mindblowing.
---
All you have to do is multiply by 10/9... you kidding me?
---
Ik, but I wanna use the skins like tricentennial and nuka cola on the ultracite and I want the ultracite too still look like ultracite. Not modified t-60 or X0-1
---
I know my came flying off my shelf in a heartbeat. Gonna post them for 2c each next time
---
Update your ini
---
On one hand we pay real money for virtual skins etc that exist only here BUT you can also look at the value you get (pleasure, enjoyment) for relatively little cost. Better than a bar!
---
You should watch tidying up with marie kondo
---
Yeah I ended up going athlete, archer and codebreaker, just launched the nuke to finish everything off! Now to grind the possum challenges haha
---
Like the DMV quest but hilariously worse.
---
This is legit middle school math. All you have to do is multiply the desired income by 10/9 to find the price you should set. I swear, man...
---
Interesting. I probably opened my map at least three times trying a solve.
---
It‚Äôs right at the East spawn, you‚Äôll see a table on the beginning of the bridge!  Any chance you know where swimming challenge is?
---
To encourage you to log in day after day after day to get all your limits. This is not unusual, all grindy games do this. They want you playing every day for a couple hrs not 10 hrs once a week. This looks better for numbers as well as gets more people in the atom shop every day. Also it will help regulate the in game economy if they feel this lint is too low or high they will adjust it I‚Äôm sure.
---
I wish those ellipsis were not just an indication of more text, but the official line.  Would be a lovely, ominous patch note.
---
Honestly, no one who passed 8th grade should need this post.
---
Says I need to earn scout world challenge badges. How do I start those? Sorry if I seem dense but neither me or my friend can figure this out lol.
---
I‚Äôm running a non-explosive shotgun build. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to update yet. Do I have anything to worry about?
---
 If you grinder for 4 weeks that's 4200 in scrip or 1050 per week. Think on people...think on..
---
Consoles would always be at disadvantage.
---
What if I can't see the challenges? 
---
[This is all I see for all the new content](https://i.imgur.com/yZvuC0e.jpg). The new outfit, new items, challenges etc all show up this way.
---
Same here, I've been playing all day since the servers went back online and not a single crash
---
The +25 Rad Resist prefix never worked on any armor I had.
---
No, because that isn't correct...
---
However, OP *did* make it too complicated. All you have to do is multiply by 10/9.
---
I would really like some songs from the Mojave Wastleland too.
---
I'm just glad to hear that it's not people experiencing glitches affecting CAMP budget. We all make mistakes.
---
Cooking - 
---
Coating in breadcrumbs first - Dredging
---
About to eat raw meat - All of the above
---
Bread ingredients - Yeast
---
Cranberry sauce - cranberry, carrot flower, water, sugar
---
(cant remember what my 5th question was sorry)
---
I killed a level 76 glowing legendary Yao Guai tonight.
---
It has happened to me a lot...usually when I spawn into somebody‚Äôs camp I would jump up and away from where ever I was spawned at before everything loads in.
---
Seems inaccurate information
---
I'm disappointed with how difficult it is to actually see the letters. I would have skipped getting it.
---
I know you're joking, but it's middle school math. You literally just multiply the desired income by 10/9 to find the price you should set... OP was unnecessarily complicated.
---
I accidentally injured another player‚Äôs Brahmin because I have Plague Walker and apparently got too close. Luckily that didn‚Äôt count as enough of an offense to get a bounty on my head, but it was still damn near mortifying for this casual/pacifist that just wants to explore other peoples camps lol
---
I sold 2 of them today for 25c each. It will likely take a while for people to figure out where things should be  priced to sell.
---
Ah, aiight thanks for the info. Just haven't found anyone to revive lol was hoping to revive someone during encryptid event &gt;\_&lt;
---
It's at the camp where you begin the quest line to the west and up a hill.
---
I just finished and didn‚Äôt get a quest for possum, where do you get it?
---
Good just wanted to know someone saw me joking.
---
Not sure. Thats all i know that theyre there. Instead of showing the anount of atom when completing the challenge it shows the badges you could earn instead.
---
XP gaining time
---
If you are Xbox and are on later tonight I will gladly die for you lmao
---
I know you're joking, but OP is being *way* too complicated. It's middle school math, all you do is multiply the desired income by 10/9 to find the price you should set.
---
What do you have to do for the growth section?
---
You suggest that like this is supposed to be a wasteland survival game instead of the camp decorating carebearfest it has become.
---
Right next to my socks lost when I do laundry.
---
Yep. Figures one of the easiest tadpole challenge to do would be the one thats bugged. Lol
---
Mostly this is referring to people asking 10k for a weapon or really high prices for things that will definitely sell for 1/3 of what they are asking. With the 25000 cap limit, it will also make people like me more likely to price low because I have no plan or need for an alternate character to hoard caps. It will take a while for "going prices" to be established most likely.
---
Hey man, can you help me out with the revive while swimming one???
---
No possum quest I think because I didn‚Äôt get one either. Go look at your challenges though and you‚Äôll see new ones to earn tokens for backpack upgrades at the vendor.
---
I never realized that you couldn't see what you were drinking and at least 4 nukashine has been served at my camp. However since my camp is near flatwoods there's a good chance I've sent low level new players off on dangerous adventures.
---
ok so what am i doing wrong? There is nothing about frog jar at my chem bench!
---
Google is your best friend...
---
Thanks
---
My friend, don't even get me started lol
---
If you want to be a violent wasteland marauder in a video game, you're a bad person in real life,  according to many.
---
Hey question where‚Äôd you go to do the terminals? I did Abbie‚Äôs bunker for the zero skill terminals but got no clue for the others. Just found out herpetologist is bugged after doing everything besides the frog habitat so now I have to do an entire other one.
---
I disagree.   Well, not with the part where you saved ages and ages.   But with the rest.
---
Upvote simply because you referenced Monty Python
---
I got stuck in the ground and fell through the world because of it.
---
McClintock isn't one of the obstacle courses?  Unless it's random by person.  Mine were Sunnytop, Gorge Bridge, and Venture.
---
Did he get a bounty for it?
---
There‚Äôs a new tab, science projects
---
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?

the bos graveyard in front of hunterville always has wolves i think
---
Of course! GT: DieTotenjaeger
---
Hey there, I'm always triying to help someone or each other if I need too. Even they are helping me. I met really nice people when triying to complete this challenges. So I liked new challenges with full respect to your opinions.
---
And, If you need any help for challenge or quest, you can message me on reddit, or try to talk with me in game. IGN:emreyigit93
---
Same issue, just no way to progress. Hopefully theyll patch it fast
---
No, multiply by 10/9 instead. It's 100% accurate, while, a never ending decimal never truly is.
---
All you ever have to do to counter a percent reduction is apply the inverse. 10% off means multiplying by 9/10, or 90% income, so you just multiply that by 10/9 to counteract that.
---
OP was just being unnecessarily complicated.
---
at my base down in the south they wont stop biting my door (just south east of lake eloise)
---
The swimming one was the bane of my fucking existence.. just try to remember which ones you believe are correct &amp; also google.. Abraham Lincoln is the wrestling president, pull ups is the non part of the army fitness test (some pointers)
---
Holy crap so that's how it was supposed to work.  I got so used to eyeballing things I think I'm better WITHOUT the sight...
---
I'm right there with you. Never been big into multiplayer games, so play mostly on my own. That's disappointing to hear that I'm going to have to find people to help me get through the quest. I'd help you out but I'm on PS4.
---
Mine are McClintock, New River Gorge Bride, and Sunnytop Ski Lanes. So yep its random.
---
i got the 3 ima do for the quest. athlete/medic/archer is prob the fastest/easiest to do in terms of challenges
---
Google can‚Äôt tell me why Lizzie should be scared to swim at a local pool

happened to me. spawned into dudes wall. couldnt move until he came and removed the wall.

Open map, open challenges, go to world, scroll to the bottom

May I borrow a moth fragment? I‚Äôll also give it back :-/ just found out herpetoligist is bugged after doing the entire thing so I gotta change directions

Yes you‚Äôre right, thanks!

Wavu Willard's Water Park
---
I‚Äôm doing it rn... if I figure it out I‚Äôll let you know the answers...
---
Ok we figured it out. Thanks for your help!
---
For middle school math? You're joking right? OP was being unnecessarily complicated.
---
Since you earn 9/10 income, you literally just multiply desired income by the inverse of that, 10/9, to find the price you should set.
---
Screensaver worthyüëå
---
in bog usualy has some I would stick near water
---
I'd be down to do it with you, if you can return the favor
---
Good luck dude
---
Sure!
---
Hi, just a quick note to say that my brother was informed by Microsoft to do a complete reinstall of windows and the sound has fixed itself somehow. Not sure how or why but we ain‚Äôt gonna question it haha :) Thank you so much though for taking the time to help us with our inquiry!
---
We should all get entomologist badges. As Bethesda fans, we are very familiar with working around bugs.
---
lol okay
---
Whitesprings!
---
5Gb if stuff in there, must be something good.
---
The sheepsqautch event, and probably savage divide in general
---
The Order of the Tadpole quest disappeared for me after I logged out. I had to go back to the train station and click the poster to get it in my quest list again. Fortunately it did save my progress.
---
OP is being unnecessarily complicated. This is middle school math.
---
You earn 9/10 of the income, so just multiply desired income by the inverse of that, 10/9 to find the price you should set.
---
Refresh me which side of the is huntersville, cant seem to find it
---
Wasn‚Äôt aware of whitespring being a location, where at exactly?
---
I'm sure
---
Tyvm friend!
---
No, that's not 100% accurate. Literally all you have to do is multiply by 10/9, it's middle school math. OP is being unnecessarily complicated.
---
The camera is for fast mid action pictures and also can be equipped from the quick select menu making it ideal for snapping pictures of deathclaws aliens ect that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise stand still for a picture the old fashion way. 
---
The imposter event is a 4 man endgame event you cannot do it solo or at a low level. This is why it completes the mission without you actually having he event start.  And you can buy more key cards to do the event over and over once your high enough level.  And backpacks do work in PA  if they are not working then that is a bug. It is in the patch notes that backpacks should definitely work while wearing PA.
---
Does it spawn I. The parking lot? Or inside park itself?
---
Sure, I think I saw you earlier. Xbox right?
---
Doh. I forgot to say they were in the World section. But glad you figured it out.
---
Sure, Xbox right?
---
Nevermind...im a derp.
---
Sent you an invite
---
LMFAOOO that cheered me up tbh it sucks I spent all day finding a damn frog just to find out I can‚Äôt do the badgeüòû it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll go for codebreaker now as it‚Äôs the shortest one. I just need one more badge for the damn backpack
---
I actually had my own recently! I‚Äôm level 34, no complete set of power armor, but I just joined for fun/rewards, and it was worth it! So fun, and so much exp!
---
It's middle school math. OP is being unnecessarily complicated.
---
Since you're earning 9/10 of the income, you multiply the desired income by the inverse of that, 10/9, to find the price you should set.
---
My I interest you in the Brotherhood of Steel discord? It is an honest group who are very committed to helping their members and others. They have a camp section where they share buildings and every person has a very high level of integrity.
---
They‚Äôre usually the first thing that attacks in Free Range.
---
Yep, GT Vulpes Lanius. Near the Boy Scout camp lake
---
It's created a new problem: I have too much money. I'm still overencumbered, so I can't fast travel to my camp or to a vendor. I reached max caps (I had 8k this morning!) when some guy bought my 3* bloodied handmade. Before that, I already sold like 30 something plans and a few rare outfits. I'm rushing over to the whitesprings bunker to spend these caps on a mutation serum before somebody puts me at max again by buying my swing speed super sledge
---
No, it's just the way some pieces roll, they get this one bugged roll that says +25 rad resist, but you don't actually get any type of effect. Data miners said it was actually trying to apply a poisoner effect but the script is messed up so it's labled wrong and doesn't apply anything.
---
Yes, want me to join you? What‚Äôs your GT?
---
Ok well, I‚Äôm an idiot. I didn‚Äôt realize you have to turn them on to broadcast your camp position, and I was SO BUMMED that I got zero visitors in like 6 hours. So. Thank you.
---
And I understand completely why you like the new form of challenges, its fun meeting new people :) I'm just not that kind of player, if that makes sense. 
---
And I would love to get your help completing this, but I am logged off the game for today. If your offer is still up tomorrow, I would love to take you up on it. Thank you very much!
---
It‚Äôs amazing. Doesn‚Äôt get enough credit. This latest patch is AMAZING. Just scroll through some of the posts this morning: community was/is ecstatic.
---
So far even jumping, and trying to run out or away hasnt worked for me. I love the fact that they did allow fast travel, but like just now I ended up inside their base behind locked doors. lol, which wasnt too bad, atleast I wasnt stuck in the wall. I was able to FT to my camp and back to theirs, thankfully outside looking at their pet Mirelurk King. lol
---
Come laugh with me brother!
---
HAHA HA HAAAAHAHAAHAHA!
---
HA!
---
Interesting.  The pioneer courses look different, are you sure it's the same one as when you join the military?
---
Well at least this post helped someone. üòÇ
---
I thought I saw something skimming through the comments today that you can build a frog habitat at your camp. I haven‚Äôt been able to get on yet though so I don‚Äôt have any firsthand knowledge of this.
---
It doesn't necessarily COUNT toward the budget but it does act as if it does.
---
Xwolfpackleader
---
Couple of guys jumped servers just as I showed up or immediately after I looked at their machine.  Why?  They weren't ready for people showing up yet?  I can't think of a reason to fear customers with the indestructable CAMPS out now.
---
wtf ..that is really strange..i think your very lucky because i play with a group of.about 6 of us and to my knowledge none of us ever did get a mutation recipe..are you lucky in other areas? like do you get really good 3 star drops and rare apparel from.completing events?
---
Atlas for level 1 and 3 terminals, Clarksburg for level 2, and level 0 is everywhere haha
---
awesome
---
Do your bessst!
---
Good....job.
---
Your complaint is about a pose?
---
I don't understand how it acts as if it does? It doesn't add any tricks on the bar nor does adding items to your stock prevent you from placing any additional items. So I'm confused.
---
You make the patch notes? Just so you know, Cryolator is misspelled as "cryolater" in the notes, when talking about ammo crafting increases.
---
Same.  I also don‚Äôt have a mic, so communicating with other players is difficult at the best of times.
---
All I could think of was maybe triggering Encryptid.  That usually has a pretty high body count.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of bugs and glitches and the endgame is kinda questionable. Very grindy. You should probably wait before picking this game up.
---
What‚Äôs ur GT?
---
Awesome, thanks! Honestly I didn‚Äôt even know there was a swimming challenge üòÆ
---
I‚Äôve heard that!  
---
How are you not in prison by now?  Wait...Or.... they let you play games in prison?
---
Yeah, same thing happened to me.
---
You can actually repair stuff even if it isn't your CAMP, you just can't do the "repair all" function and have to directly interact with the broken thing
---
That said, that explains why I found ghouls in my house :O
---
Dun dun duuun!
---
Cool, then bully, go to survival beta and bully there.
---
You can raid or run there. That's your call.
---
I messaged you it says you‚Äôre offline!
---
Check the lighthouse got it yesterday.
---
BSS weapons are always worth keeping and selling. I sold my last one (BSS rolling pen) for 23k.
---
What did thy screw up? Were these plans not available previously?
---
I'm in the same boat and been trying to do that exact quest, what's your username?
---
I thought I did too but I saw one saying it‚Äôs in the chemistry bench &amp; when I built the one in there it doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúfrog jar‚Äù or something like that
---
Not so much. Lol. Ive only ever had one good drop, and that was my TSE gatling plasma.
---
Spruce knob campground, if you haven't found out already
---
Parking lot
---
I actually jumped to that event 2 times while it was active, but I was super unlucky, as the events just finishes both times as I arrived. Good idea though!
---
Damn they go for that much I maight have to try it before I sell it.
---
I just took this test. It was hilarious!
---
Def gonna roleplay as a mailman now.
---
Kates Grind house
---
someone killed them recently, change servers and they will spawn
---
It took me TWO CHARACTERS to get calibrated shocks for both legs.  I've only seen it once on my main, once on an alt, and transferred it to main.   The jet pack I saw three times in one week months ago and have not seen it since.   The RNG is ridiculous with the X01 mods.     I don't think it should be easy to get, but for a while there, I had legit reason to doubt that the mods existed at all.
---
It seems  to be a hit or miss with me sometimes I can but other times I cannot.
---
Oh it makes sense indeed, as I said, I totally respect your opinion. :)
---
Yeah sure thing, when you need help for this type quests, don't hastitate to ask for! Tomorrow, next week, death of our universe, no matter. :P
---
Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse, which is on the road between Charleston and Whitesprings, always spawns a few.
---
This guy is miserable if you look through his post history. Dont listen to him.
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind when I decide to do it. Honestly, I‚Äôm probably going to be screwing around with getting vending set up at my place tonight.
---
Ditto.
---
Did you happen to notice if the owner was nearby when it worked? I saw a post saying that might be how it works but I haven't tested it yet
---
Sent you an invite!
---
Ok kind stranger. I'll send you a personal note asap
---
Seems to be intermittent as sometimes you can and sometimes you can't. I'm not sure if this is a bug with some players or if it is some stats on gear that triggers it, but a few folks have mentioned it.
---
How long have you been playing? I got most of mine from in November of last year. Met a streamer that only did nuke drops, so i just kinda rode on their coattails power leveling.
---
No the complaint isnt the pose, just the general game. Yeah i understand bug fixing's not as simple as flicking a switch but tt shouldnt have really been released yet, theres so much potential for a brilliant game.
---
The pose makes me giggle more than anything, its pretty funny when a ghoul asserts his dominance and floats across the map
---
The owner is nearby and it's working. That could be it.
---
You get them at the pioneer camp, there are vending machines
---
I‚Äôve run into it directly in front of the spawn location for the front door, look for a person laying on a car hood in a shirt and pants.
---
In game name is the same as on here; cashiimo.
---
But I am logged off fo76 for tonight, it's almost half past 3 in the morning here, and I need to get up early. If you are still interested in helping me tomorrow, it would be greatly appreciated. I of course understand if you don't want to wait.
---
I don't have any new tabs!
---
Is it? I‚Äôve got one in my CAMP without much fuss
---
hmm well i have a few good drops..get a lot of sentinel and cavalier drops ..explosive weapon..i too got a tse laser before they were patched..maybe the game allocates this type of thing when the character is created..i just wasnt blessed with good recipe/plan drops..lost count of how many times iv put technical data in and still havent got a bos paint
---
Leader of the pack event in the forest
---
Oh the irony.
---
Yeah I just sold a level 50 T51 jetpack torso for 1200 caps.   Might try for 1500 next time.  I can build both the torso itself and the jetpack .
---
Do you need a dead frog to craft it?
---
Did you put it in the machine beside the computer. Then use the computer?
---
1 and 2 BoS armory and closet in fort defiance and a level 0 in nuka plant

I might have to do that. Wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world but I would rather my customers won‚Äôt have to be careful about using my shop for fear of death. 
---
Hopefully Bethesda figures something out for scenarios like these.
---
If you are on PS4 I'm interested in helping each other do hat?  My buddies all gave up on this game so blah
---
It‚Äôs awesome is what it is.
---
Likewise, I've seen so many cool CAMPs today, I'm jealous!
---
Most fun I‚Äôve had in a long time.
---
True enough
---
i been playing since launch..im lvl 320..but i must admit i didnt really start farming the queen until around mid january
---
Link?
---
Yup, that‚Äôs what I said!
---
Oh right, weird design choice I don't understand what there is to be gained from that.
---
I remember they talked about it before launch but said sense Sony doesn't to cross platform they weren't going to do it. (Before Sony went cross platform for fortnight) I think know though there was no possibility it happened at launch just because of the state of the game. That being said I'd love it I have a few friends on console who just started playing and I wish I could help them out lol.
---
Absolfugginlutely. I SUK at math but apparently, not as hard as some. Plus, I can show this hot mess to my 15yo son who, thinks that he need not ever have to think about, anything
---
It doesnt count toward the challenge.
---
Do challenges under the World section. They‚Äôre at the bottom
---
Do you get a plan or automatically learn it
---
As noted in another comment, you may be able to build it already. It was in my camp selections today as of 20 min ago.
---
Ah awesome, im glad someone was able to catch them. When I first started i was exploring and came upon them, hidden I watched as they took out some protectrons and an eyebot, then slowly made their way back up the mountain. I was too low level, under geared and didn't know what I was doing to take a picture, or kill them. I thought it was odd, like maybe they thought they were going to work (it was morning) walking in an line up the mountain to the machine up top, saw the robots (didnt want them to take their job like in the past) and wiped them out.
---
I finally did!
---
Oh yeah I remember you! Love your camp!
---
You have to have the name of the thing show up in the corner when taking the picture.  Also they often are near the dirt track
---
Oh but you can still make one?
---
Not ideal, but try fast traveling to your camp and then back. The impostor body showed up for me when I did that.
---
As someone with major anxiety today is the very first day I've "traded" with other players. This patch has been great!
---
Can anyone flip the switch, though?
---
Pretty sure that's a glitch as I have not experienced this and have hopped servers a few times.
---
Well done. Well done.
---
Tyre armor and garbage bag jacket
---
Love it
---
What we finally got the T-Pose in photomode?
---
Glad someone said this...
---
oof
---
Happened to me too. I was shocked, I logged on to adventure mode to set up my vending machine, and started the pioneer scouts quest. A half hour later, Took dolly sods for the challenge and to do the pioneer quest..boom I got my brand new legendary.
---
Totally agreed. So far everything they've done is to make everything easier for casual players and punish those who put too much time in it.
---
I think you mean "PLEASE BUFF DEATHCLAWS".
---
Nuke silo's. Room where you first start ripping out mainframes. Takes approx 5 minutes to reach per silo.
---
Ive not tried to catch it in photomode but "ill give it a shot"
---
It‚Äôs in a nice bowl!

It would make up for all those atoms we missed from the undoable challenges.
---
Gee im really sorry about that one
---
That too
---
This is like, the most generic 00s internet trash talk. Youre basic, probably mad at your own life, and live vicariously through video games. Sad.
---
This is the forth patch I've seen that has said it would fix explosive legendarys. Can safely say it still has not. Same guy I've seen for weeks still one shotting everyone doing it again today. Raider_legends had 30 kills when I logged off. I've seen him as high as 75 kills before. Love all the other content. But man I wish they could get that pvp balanced better.
---
Aww, that's adorable!
---
FUUUUUUUUUCK no
---
Bought 4000. Again.
---
Tommorow is good for me as its half 2 here üëç
---
east side of the bridge theres an intercom to activate.
---
They were extremely rare. After patch 5 I believe. If you search this sub or the market subs for BoS Combat Armor you'll find a bunch of posts from people asking how to get it.
---
Items in the comes don't take camp budget, but if your stash is full you get a very confusing pop up message saying "my CAMP is full."
---
Well those who bought those 'never die' dupe armors now has only 25% chance to die, not too bad still.
---
I cant remember, but i feel like there was a nerf to the drop rates of the recipes in december or January. Idk. My RNG tends to be drills and syringers level of drops. Lol. I so cant wait for the legendary vendor. I dont expect to find too many amazing items, i just like the increase in the odds of finding something worth usuing.
---
What platform?
---
But theirs has sentimental value!
---
What about 4:8:2000?
---
Yes I did.
---
Pretty sure its just abug, thats what causes it tho
---
yeh..everybody looking forward to the legend vendor..hope he doesnt turn out to be useless lol
---
You were about to kick the hornet‚Äôs nest again, yikes.
---
Why do you think that we all know what you like and don't like about video games?
---
Well good to know they can finally be bought.
---
Even if it wasn't on Adventure by mistake, this one would still be ridiculously easy to get. Kill a humanoid creature. Claim a workshop. Build a turret in a workshop or camp.  Seeing as how the "clear enemies from the workshop" portion of claiming one often involves Scorched or Super Mutants, this one can be done in five minutes or less.
---
No he did not, just killed it and jumped on the camp fire and started cooking.
---
It's a weird intermittent bug. I just hopped around the map looking at people's camps, sometimes it would let me inspect and other times it didn't.
---
White spring station 345 caps prolly less with hard barg.
---
I had to retool my camp a good bit because my first patron got stuck in my floor. My friends never port to me for that exact reason. Oh well. I fixed it and my camp is open for business.
---
A ft mat would be tremendous, though.
---
I remember posting similar before release and got downvoted for it. Would like to see vertibirds added as well, but maybe without the mounted guns. Also maybe requiring some sort of fuel to keep them from being abused.
---
J'ai mis adn dans la machine
---
Mais l'ordinateur demande un mot de passe

I was sorely disappointed in that one as well.  Too much investment with too little payoff.

---
I think you'd have to play quite a bit to hit the 150 cap *daily*.
---
Contact u/WanderingMac he will get you fully enrolled
---
Thats awesome! Thanks!
---
Add me: siestafied
---
I need it too lol
---
You're welcome. If you let it eat for a little bit, you can milk it and get Brahmin milk. Just don't do it too soon, it gets mad and won't give you any.
---
People can pay to FT to your camp, so you‚Äôre good. Unless you feel the urge to create an entirely new camp like I did this morning. (Still off the beaten path though.)
---
Obligatory ‚Äú your mother was a hamster‚Äù, and so forth
---
Also small change but very very happy that the gunner sight on the Gatling gun actually lines up now!
---
All camps that have a powered vending machine become fast travel points. So it shouldn‚Äôt stop you from getting business. However it may discourage some players who care about fast travel caps.
---
You can put 30 different things in each one, and they're only available from that machine, so if you have multiples people have to check them all. I have 3 machines right now: weapons and armor, aid and chems, and a "misc" machine with ammo, mods, maps, and junk.
---
Still needs endgame content and loot. 
---
Im loving the updates i see ,but there still isnt alot to bring me back. 
---
We need endgame power armor sets to farm from bosses, zones etc. Other wise I just log in farm some ammo vounce around and log out. The new qussts they add take 30 minutes and your done. 
---
They made a online service game....make online service game content.
---
You can put badges on backpacks?
---
Same here. It really surprises me how easy most of these "challenges" are.  I have a harder time with stuff like "take a pic of a player in Responder Gear hiding in the bathroom while Graham and Chally the Moo Moo cook mirelurk meat on a grill"
---
As a person who has been playing since the beta, in other words, paid full price, you shouldn't have to pay $60. Don't get me wrong, I love the game and play it everyday but you should be able to find the game fairly cheap.
---
Does the CAMP module have anything to do with where people spawn in? It seems as though visitors to my CAMP always spawn in under my windmill which is right next to my module.
---
Weird I had the best most unlaggy session i months.
---
Yes, please!  Don't make me hunt around for the vending machine.  And if you have more than one, put them together.
---
Lights, the marquee arrows, pointing Pip-Boy standees, Fasnacht balloons - it all helps.
---
Yea. Like i said. Its going to be nice just for an extra chance to find something. But im not getting my hopes up for anything too amazing. Ive been disappointed too many times.
---
There are two legendary effects with the name "+25 rad resist". One is rad resistance, the other is actually disease resistance.
---
I don't need the camera but are you doing the order of the tadpole quest for the backpack? You need to revive an ally. You wanna revive each other?
---
I've already done it but I'll help you if you need too.
---
You can catch live ones. Check the pool next to the golf course.
---
Same thing happened to me. Remove your mods then it'll show up. Also if you have ratmonkeys item tagging enabled you won't be able to interact properly with the new poster. Or at least I couldn't.
---
I can if you want to add me.  psn: awheaton65

or just tell people ffs

Is he? I got him on my first try lol
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs still a big issue, and you saying ‚ÄúI can only use repair kits now‚Äù might have been misinterpreted.
---
Anyway, they‚Äôre worth the investment. When you run into a horde of supermutants and your rifle breaks, nothing like running for your life, hiding and doing a quick repair.
---
Thanks man! I'll add you in a minute
---
same here lol
---
Duping most likely
---
Same here lol
---
Haven‚Äôt heard the name before; describe?
---
They have added new random encounters with several of the patches lately.
---
Dudeeee just got it. So cool lol
---
It‚Äôs honestly the best to be out in the wastes and see caps pop up on screen and a message saying so and so bought something. I‚Äôve been selling serums all day and have made about 4K caps on those alone. It‚Äôs nice to see some one buy a marsupial serums go into their pip boy and then start jumping around all over. You can just tell how happy they are.
---
Weird, my friends have the same mod but not the same problem. I'll try updating things first.  Thanks

---
You may be able to build it now! It showed up in my inventory today. Now there‚Äôs a ton of topiary cats around my camp
---
Likewise, all the X-01 plans are over at the Enclave Production Bot now, including the Calibrated Shocks.  Feel bad for those who hopped a hundred times trying to find it.  Feel like it's also a cruel trick how they are at the Production vendor and not the Military vendor. üòÇ
---
Now, if only we could figure out what the heck is up with the Dense mods.
---
Nah, I see player vending as their fix to in-game trading, which is neigh impossible.
---
Should be easy enough to pick up a used copy dont spend the 60
---
I was hoping that I would be able to replace some of my "locked" foundation pieces, but alas, still stuck unless I completely rebuild my camp.
---
into the fire at lvl 12? did you skip the toxic valley?
---
Thats odd..i know the mechanics are gonna take some getting use to. Maybe they marked something way to low and didnt wabt you to buy that tse tesla for 500 caps? Idk. Lol
---
I've never tested it, but I've heard other players report that if you have Butcher's Bounty equipped and then search the dead fertilizer brahmin that it works
---
Release notes said if you go over 25+ they are just gone.
---
I'm wondering if using the big sign and put what the \* are with the letters  might work ---1 at a time though
---
Did they jer just sentinel and cavalier or assassin too
---
I have it if you want to trade for another plan that I dont have!  psn awheaton65
---
I actually usually don‚Äôt go to my camp when someone is there shopping. I feel like me being there will drive them off for some reason
---
Mine is named "Steakums"
---
I cant get the camera on my main account anymore, thats why i need to finish the quest again so i can sell it to someone and they can give it back to me
---
I need too. Esquilax189 add me
---
PSA: 
---
* You can't (re)move a doorway unless you remove the door first.  
---
* You can't remove a metal stairs until all 'second floor' pieces are gone or a new supporting stairs is attached elsewhere.
---
* You can't remove a wall until any arch pieces on top are removed.
---
* You can make temp bridges around gaps in support for second floor pieces using the smaller second floors, making a sort of catwalk.  This is useful if you're moving a floor piece that is the only one linking others to their supporting stairs.
---
* The metal stairs that have an upper and lower platform are horribly buggy; sometimes all supported pieces can be gone and you still can't remove them.  Other times it can be impossible  to delete floors around them.
---
* Bonus tip: A roof can support hanging half-walls.  You can delete the roof and the wall will float.  This trick is also useful for staggering foundations at half height, like giant steps.
---
I usually downvote these posts but this one doesn't have ThAnK yOu BeThEsDa and adequately praises the work done with this update. So here, have an upvote.
---
Haven't been able to do that myself yet.
---
How did you do all those challenges!!??
---
You lose any money. So watch carefully, I would suggest to never have the sum total of items for sale exceed max caps.
---
What mods you got going? I had betterinventory, perk loadout manager, and the item tagging. Cleared out my fallout76custom.ini completely and the machines magically appeared.
---
All 3 now fall under the "will work 75% of the time but might not 25% of the time"
---
This means that cavalier armor is now the strongest due to needing to run away and such as standing still seems pointless now.
---
Mine is right out on the front porch, easy to find for everyone!
---
Yeah was trying to figure that out myself. Not sure if it would be at the shooting range. But it‚Äôs not clear at all.
---
Yeah I am excite. I have the combat armor dense mod but just the one and no plans.
---
I just did what the responder wanted me to due
---
I got a wanted bounty for fast traveling into a sellers camp because I was locked in as I picked the lock to get out, I guess there are still bugs to be fixed, thank god when I was killed I had no junk on me.
---
Broken disease resist afaik, but I‚Äôve never tested it.
---
Nope.
---
Most of my turret kills(purely by them) dont have anything, but sometimes they do. No idea why.
---
But I guess the turret farmers knew what they were doing.
---
I might be wrong but I think that the sickle double dips on a couple different perks so if that‚Äôs true it‚Äôs really valuable.
---
I feel like everyone went for those 3, others are either bugged or too tedious to do.
---
Holy shit, thanks! I was wondering why I could inspect in some shops but not others. I never would have peeved that together
---
Added, my name is LoganTheDex
---
A mister handy that tried to mug me using pre-recorded shake down dialogue...pretty funny actually
---
Could just be misinformation.  But I can't bring myself to kill Steakums to try it out.  haha
---
Disease resist (‚Äúantibiotic‚Äù internally) but broken, as far as I know- mislabeled to us as rad resist, internally labeled antibiotic, meant to be disease resist, but doesn‚Äôt work at all (to the best of my knowledge)
---
I highly recommend going to the toxic valley before the Ash Heap! Lots of new quests there now for more xp and the events there are really easy and can award western outfit ü§†
---
I figured this out a few minutes ago. I'm making a killing though so if some more people buy some weapons $$
---
You can search them though if you have the perk and it works, i have had to murder my poor milky for a steak to increase my carry capacity in a pinch
---
According to this thread, it only works if the camp owner is in the area.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bluda4/inspecting_items_with_multiple_legendary_effects
---
Did you use the perk to search old milky for some meat and dine on her yourself. You cant let someone assert dominance over you like that, you have to show you dgaf
---
i'm also confused
---
I can‚Äôt figure out why I‚Äôm not seeing any X-01 plans.  Are they at the modus terminal because I don‚Äôt see them.
---
That is the same issue that the bot vendors used to have, and was fixed last patch. Nobody will pay 1000's of caps if they can't see *all* the legendary effects on weapons and armor. I know I wouldn't. Maybe they will fix this when they add the Mole Miner Legendary Vendor next week. Just sell 1 star items until then.
---
What's even crazier, assuming we exist that long as a species, is that, eventually, all the other galaxies and stars in the sky will move so far away that we're unable to see them any more. At some point, the night sky will just be...black.
---
I found it dude
---
Is that where the alligator theme park at?
---
I have no mods. This happens to me EVERY patch, newly added items are missing, invisible or neon pink. Besthesda support always says to reinstall the game. That gets old at 59G+ and every major update.  I doubt I am the only person with this problem.
---
But at least allow it between PC and Xbox since both are Microsoft OS.
---
He can claim his own place if he wants to.
---
this if fun i made over 10k in a few hours
---
Me
---
Ok give me a sec please.
---
There should be a spot in the game where if you visit at night the gnomes get a little closer to you every time you look away.  And make them creepy AF
---
Why nerf? They are at least one enemy that‚Äôs not one shot shit. And you can tame them to defend your Camp. We need more dangerous enemies, it‚Äôs almost impossible to die in this game.
---
lol nice
---
Just a couple posts down someone has the body.
---
Just perk loadout.
---
np i gladly take the karma hits for a level head and maturity ... i played guild wars 2, allods, ultima, anarchy .. well a lot im old and i can honestly say the games that kept me the longest were the ones with a respec option, changing builds every now and again breeds new life into the game for me, i dont care if its only purchasable on the item shop with money or in game doesn't matter but this game needs it
---
This levels the playing field I‚Äôm probably the only person who is actually happy about this
---
It's his inventory and business.
---
Your mean, she was just trying to do a nice thing for nice people
---
On the other hand he might not like the location due to its often thermonuclear climate.
---
Oh no, I'm mad excited. Means griefing is brought down tenfold overall and means more complex builds instead of meta style game play.
---
You don't get any caps in excess of 25,000 so you might want to consider "unplugging" your vending machine once you hit the high 24,000's.
---
At least in the previous patch, I had seen various Dense *mods* pop up at the inner Grafton vendor (not the one at Grafton Station).  I haven't seen the plans.
---
Already did that on my main and i accidentally sold it, thats why i need to get it on my other character
---
goto whitesprings, the vendor across the hall from the power armor stations sells cheap and half broken crossbows.. when you repair it be sure you have no int perks.. no gunsmithing or anything.. it will 100% repair.. you then go outside and shoot a few ghouls.. only takes a couple to damage it.. then go back inside and repair... rinse and repeat , takes a few minutes.
---
Just sent a friend request
---
So does this mean if someone contests my WorkShop while im building I can opt out and give up the workshop and not get contest sneak killed?
---
Wait do we know where they are now?
---
I agree lol. I plan on adding a bunch of more machines for more profit after today's haul (about 5k total)
---
I just hope the huge surge of caps doesn't affect buying and selling prices online
---
Counterpoint: don't undersell yourself either. I bought 30+ treasure maps for 5 each, and immediately resold them for 25-30. üòÇ
---
Exactly, but now everyone will be in x01 lol
---
Cripple the wings.
---
i'm way over by point pleasant sold over 10k in stuff i had in my stash
---
Psycho helps a lot.
---
I went into the wendigo cave with all rise. I killed 2 more lurk kings, 3 mirelurk hunters, and the wrndigo. I broke all rise but I felt so accomplished
---
Jesus, bethesda values a brick wall more than a bramins life?? I'm uninstalling
---
Also on Xbox I'm getting really rough instability. 
---
Was just killing some ghoulfers to finish up the quest had a 3* legendary drop a Bloodied +strength faster swing speed deathclaw gauntlet...a few mins later was headed over to near the bunker to photo a bunny for the weekly and server unresponsive straight into disconnected.
---
RIP the best weapon I've ever seen that was perfect for me as I run an unarmed build.
---
Start the new scouts stuff.
---
I think I heard a while ago that he was datamined a few patches back, I think he probably only just got fully implemented this update, like Insult Bot a couple weeks back.
---
Or sell cheaply (to me).
---
doesn't let me revive you, I think deep water won't work
---
Even better, power armor players have no ability boosts. A bit more dangerous for PVP as well, cant really sneak well lol
---
lol did the same thing picked up roughly 20 items ... only to sell 3 then realize the dudes broke had to go farm a couple 1 and 2s to get him zeroed out ... this is gonna take a minute and an option would be nice to disable notifications like in other games .. I am not a fan of being notified every legendary pickup, I can find it just fine in my inventory on my own .. it always pops up at the worst times for me at least
---
Yeah, don't waste it.  Those are freakin' rare.  I've only found a couple in 500 hours.  The first I spent on my 2\* Vanguard piece, not really knowing how rare they were, and that's long since I gave up Vanguard for Bolstering or Unyielding.
---
Eventually, I found a nice piece of Unyielding Marine armor.  For whatever reason, the Marine Dense mod isn't very hard to find.
---
You're out here eating people?
---
No. Not easily, don't know if you get at all. 
---
However the imposter drops them all the time. Some people try selling them for like 1k. Like anyone would pay that much for something that has become so common.
---
Issue with anything with shared storage, easiest fix is delete and remake the item
---
Storing may work, unsure on that yet
---
I personally love quests that dont hold your hand the whole way but that being said i feel it needs to give you alot more information currently
---
Have it for sale in my vending machine for 76 caps. One only.  Also have some fashnacht masks if you're interested. Opening sale prices! PSN is fakenunchucks
---
ok so lets just go to a toxic lake, where the scout camp is
---
I started with something I know but it was still annoying AF with the odd questions. I'll try posting more ones if I can guarantee them to be correct.
---
**Swimming:**
---
 ‚úî A light Snack
---
 ‚úî Immediately Stop
---
 ‚úî Speed Stroke
---
 ‚úî Breath-Holding Competition
---
 ‚úî Refuse Gum

 ‚úî Flailing

 ‚úî Swimming alone is dangerous

---
I enjoyed both of the things you just said no one enjoyed.
---
So they should require placing on the ground, not on a foundation.  Problem solved?  Gosh that was easy :)
---
There's s small building on the golf course SE of the golf club that has 2 spawn on it almost all the time
---
i buy 5.56 for 1 cap per. because i hardly ever see that shit. and my lead/steel go towards 5mm
---
one day ill get a good handmade drop so i can use that 5.56
---
Yes, all bloodied swingspeeds are useful.
---
I think they priced things way too low. They allegedly want to have caps coming out of the world and they priced the rarer plans way lower than some useless plans.
---
Good idea. Less players might actually wake Bethesda up too how poor of a job they're doing.
---
Wanna revive each other?
---
I had to re-place my camp a few times today due to this. It was being pretty weird, sometimes it would let me remove them after being grumpy but mostly all I got was errors.
---
I kept building anyway because I'm a masochist but I made sure to complain the whole time.
---
Didn't know 76 was a free-to-play game.
---
Dont be the guy that takes everything litterally.
---
Oh ok, He didn't say that, Thanks
---
This is how rumors start in the sub, I know you mean well but yikes don‚Äôt throw around the D-word. I think duper‚Äôs realized that they didn‚Äôt enjoy the game like that and they ruined it for everyone else too. 
---
Vendor hasn‚Äôt even dropped yet. Let‚Äôs be patient and try to minimize speculation about stuff like that especially d*ping
---
5.56 or .45
---
Especially considering MODUS isn't a ZAX, he's sort of his own thing, so it'd have to be something new.
---
Your world is full my dude
---
that doesn't work either, I remember reading some deaths insta kill, I put a mine in the water, try and trigger that and see if I can revive you.
---
doesnt let me respawn when I die either, bug
---
I'll have to check thanks for the heads up
---
You can probably fill it with anything but .38.
---
üòÇI'm dying now thank you.
---
Mine will be on the front porch at the top of the stairs. If you miss it get your eyes checked.
---
I bought them for the first time to get the Nukashine skin. I felt a bit dirty, but as others have said, I bought every single piece of DLC for Fallout 4. I have spent numerous hours in this game, and to be honest I've had a lot of fun. There's been bumpy parts, sure. But I still log in every day and do a few things.
---
I was happy to see that I had enough stashed back to get the new rider skin today. That was a pleasant surprise.
---
I really feel like the last couple weeks on here have been the best. This new update is fantastic so far, and has really upped player interaction.
---
You also need to revive someone while you‚Äôre underwater.
---
Yes, there were several quite positive improvements/fixes, and some really nice new features.
---
It‚Äôs right outside the camp, it‚Äôs an obstacle course, should be a table and an intercom for you to talk to.
---
I did that and left the guy a present bag. Lol
---
That kind of thing is totally fine. What specifically prompted me to write this was finding one machine up one of three different sets of stairs, two stories up, placed behind a wall. I was thinking, is this vending, or a treasure hunt? XD
---
Sigh. I posted this exact thing earlier. I‚Äôm glad that you were luckier than I was and this got popular though.
---
Gotta find a very specific frog jar now üòÇ
---
I'm pretty sure it must.  I've seen some player vendors with spoiled goods in them.
---
Enclave bunker at the Production vendor!
---
If folks spawn in where I do it shouldn't be too bad.  Definitely have noticed this though!  Especially if they set up multiple vendors!
---
Can someone explain the foundation thing to me? So if I am able to place a foundation somewhere weird out of luck, can i build onto it without consequence? Thanks
---
Mines the same its always been
---
Bethesda removed the "Legendary" flag from those OMOD's...  
---
In short 4* weapons don't exist any more
---
.45, 5.56, .50 are likely the most widely used, as they work in a variety of weapons, many of which are the most popular.
---
This happened to me today.  Had to fast travel out.
---
it worked, so yeah just explosive hurt me next
---
Plop a port-o-potty next to your vending machine. üòâ
---
Any luck?
---
I am SOOO grateful for: restoring the Gatling Plasma projectiles, as well as moving the Known notes back to the top of the vendor list.
---
Not so grateful for nerfing the Assassin's legendary effects...
---
Some vendor inventory isn't instanced, so if someone else got there before you they might have already bought it.
---
I think that's the best part. Before, you may stumble on one every now and again, but you always got side-eyed if they were there. Now, everyone is so welcoming. And it's really cool to see how others decorate their camps. Mine is utilitarian, but my vending area has full crafting so it's a one-stop shop.
---
You can craft them! Glass and blood leaf. It's under science experiments on the chemistry bench.
---
You might get more visitors if you place it near Vault 76 (free fast travel). Some players are less inclined to pay high travel prices. It probably won't matter much over the next few days. But as the novelty of "the new thing" starts to wear off you will likely see a drop in traffic. Moving your camp might help to alleviate some of that loss, assuming you care.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Yes it worked with explosives, gave me both "revive an ally" and the one in water too, so you only need to kill me with explosives in water one time and revive then we should be good.
---
What's a stimpack difusser
---
i legit spawned in the wall or floor and was stuck every single time.
---
Whoops
---
Idk what to like more about this. It seems like they truly did listen. 
---
They also confessed that the backpacks working in PA was a miscommunication and apologized. 
---
Player vending seems to be going without a hitch - the only issue I've found so far is sometimes you can't inspect an item somebody is selling (but other times you can). The UI is a bit buggy when listing a lot of things, but you can work around it. 
---
They seem to have introduced a new bug with plasma core stacking, but as a whole the gatling plasma is less broken than it was last patch. 
---
They addressed rad storms and the flatwoods monster being an alien, which is something people have been really asking for in light of the past few weeks' challenges
---
CROSSBOW BOLTS CAN FINALLY BE PICKED UP, I DON'T THINK PATCH NOTES EVEN MENTIONED THAT
---
X-01 mod plans and military paint can now be bought at the whitesprings bunker, which is awesome. The paint plans are only 200 caps (with 4ch and grape mentats)
---
I had someone buy my 1900 rounds if organic naturally found 5.56 ammo whikr I was tooling around tgis evening. 1 cap each.
---
Only solution is to remove the inaccessible areas or start over. I like it when I move to a different spot and cannot place my house. So I scrap it and build an identical one in the same spot it wouldn't let me set the other one. ???
---
Ok looks like we're both good, gg thanks
---
is there the full gamut of .50 receivers like the .308, like a .50 calibrated?
---
i may switch back to rifles if I can get a calibrated .50 hunting rifle
---
Is it a bug that each vending machine has it own 30 slots? I‚Äôve had two different vending machines with two different inventory‚Äôs and no one ever goes to the second one
---
If you have Marsupial (and you may not absolutely need it), there's a potential spawn on the roof of West-Tek.  Yeah, it kind of makes the pies a bit less special.  But at least you know yours is "real" if you got it from the machine.
---
I‚Äôm looking for the Fasnacht heltevia Garland plan on PS4 if you have it.
---
Ha joles on you the first quest glitched out and the markets dissapeared so even if i do something  it doesnt count
---
np, glad I could help, thank you too
---
Dude... you‚Äôre not gonna want to hear this, but the camera was meant for you. Seriously, photography or doing any art is often therapeutic... just relax
---
How do you get the crossbow condition to go down, feel like it‚Äôs lasting forever
---
Happen multiple times to me
---
In white springs hes on a car right in front
---
You could counter the build with a non legendary handmade from your crafting bench but keep perpetuating 100% false beliefs if you it suits your argument.
---
They are rewards from the 3 new repeatable quests given out by the Pioneer bots listed under miscellaneous.
---
I got s'mores from Camp Adams fireside stories.
---
Which wing is that one in??
---
Most pc "master racers" spend everything on there computer
---
When you were just minding your business in your port-a-potty when some random fella teleports in and you be like:
---
"How did you get in here?!"
---
Z:2-7/. BcFJazz R    t
---
Yep. I often jump on, FT to Poseidon and use that to farm FCs and lead. And it‚Äôs a nice FT point for the rest of my session.  My only problem is that I‚Äôm usually overencumbered with Fusion Cores!
---
But no way I‚Äôm pissing around with completing the Power Up Poseidon event each time.  Just slap down a Fusion Generator and let it pump me out for the rest of my day!
---
Or at least in til the server crashes...
---
It's kind of a pain in the ass to get and the challenges are kind of ridiculous. Best thing about it is its easy to take pictures with and you can move around while taking pictures.
---
The imposter sheepsquatch is kinda hard to complete without the right players on the server, I've only completed it twice. The real one spawns as an event in 3 places. People almost always join the event and its quick fun with decent rewards. It's the Free Range event. 
---
People run crazy builds without power armor making way more damage than you could in it. They generally avoid radiation though. I run PA mostly for the carry weight. I've collected some decent armor pieces and I'll probably try one of those builds now.
---
I have paintings on literally every wall available inside my house. And some outside my house.
---
 Xbox here. Sorry.
---
Great, thanks for letting me know!
---
Alright no worries
---
Found a fossil at the Kerwood mine. Fast travel there, face the building closest to you, and take out your camera, it is off to your left.
---
It's very poorly worded, but it's your stash that's full, not your camp budget. I had the same issue trying to put something in a machine, and when I went to drop it in the stash I noticed it was full and put 2 and 2 together.
---
Took a few things out of the stash and I was able to continue loading the vending machine.
---
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Yeah the game clearly needed to delay release by 3-4 months with an actual beta. Glad it's really starting to chug along like it should have from the start now!
---
Have you completed every new quest and challenge? *ALL* of the merit badge challenges? All of the weeklies and dailies?
---
Do you need to do the possum challenges for backpack stuff too? These tadpole ones are already pretty obnoxious.
---
You always have something to worry about with any update. They always screw something up.
---
I just bought a set of the common masks from grafton vendor for 22 caps each. I have level 1 hard bargain though so they probably were priced at 25?
---
To be fair, this is day one of this. As a store owner, I take the risk of pricing my items at whatever price I want. Some people may buy them, some may not. But as the days go on, you adapt. Drop prices on stuff that people don't buy or don't buy as much, and raise prices on stuff that people buy quick. It's trial and error. 
---
Since this is a video game where I don't have to worry about making rent on a lease or something, I don't need to worry about it as much, and can test prices on certain items. I feel it's the best option in this case. 
---
Although I agree with you on your intentions of the post, I feel it's best they learn on their own, so they can market their (successful or failing) business on their own.
---
if you're on PC.. you got any of them shocks? ;)
---
Yes, the mods for more carry weight and increased DR require completion of the possum challenges, unfortunately.
---
But of course.
---
Uhhuh, Uhhuh, Uhhuh......what?
---
no
---
i never knew you could do that
---
This has been an issue since launch. I have two characters that have discovered all the locations, but I'm still missing 7 for the challenges.
---
Wow so simple but who would know this!!!!  Thanks for posting just need to get exam answers lol :-)
---
That‚Äôs all well and good but wtf is 10/9? Why is there a backslash?
---
Is the quest still bugged?
---
If you spam 4 vats shots as fast as you can, you will kill most players instantly
---
I've seen a lot of complaints about it. I'm not experiencing any, I've been playing for over 5 hours today (yikes). I'm on PC, what's your platform?
---
I got a 1* armor just a couple weeks ago. It was a ghoul slayers junk tho but I'm pretty sure if you collect 3+ before turning them in you get a better reward.
---
5mm, Ultracite 50 cal, 45, ultracite 2mm. I buy 5mm regularly,  don't know a vendor on PC for the ultracite, otherwise I would buy it. 45 is too common and dont need to buy.
---
Oh yeah I'm on xbox
---
some people mentioned it might not be in the game yet....reminds me of that camera challenges when the camera itself was delayed
---
Oh dear god...
---
Ikr it's so greatüòÅ
---
indestructible camps are just dumb
---
You not only have to take the picture, but have the camera detect the subject too. You have to be close, within something like 20 feet of the animal for it to detect. It will list the things in the picture in the upper left corner.
---
I cannot complete this tadpole bs because of it and it just sucks
---
Nope I still can't find it. Which side of the camp is it on?
---
You mean ACCOOUNT bound?
---
I just fast traveled into a camp and the person had a paper bag of junk sitting on the floor. Lucky momma raised me right so I left it there and moved on.
---
As far as I know. But the jars are kinda cute.
---
so read a post saying for 3 star things the owner has to be nearby THEN inspect works inside the vending machine
---
Pretty much this. Just don't be greedy with the caps and it will sell sooner or later.
---
east side of the bridge is an intercom to start it.
---
Sounds like a good problem to have! 
---
I‚Äôve had a good number of crashes not long after powering up Thunder Mountain... it would suck not knowing if after powering up the entire plant, usually solo, I‚Äôd even get more than a few fusion cores from the extractor. 
---
Gonna be stocked from now on... easily!
---
Go to challenges in the start menu, go under world, and scroll down to the tadpole challenges.
---
i legit always spawn into a floor or wall and have to leave and come back and hope i don't do it again
---
Do you see the obstacle course?
---
You just saved my life! Thank you! I‚Äôm currently searching everywhere I think jars would be üòÇ
---
Ok . Thanks
---
The lights above the stash box in Watoga Station are on now.
---
Nope
---
No, you have to get the 3 badges to finish the quest &amp; get the backpack
---
/u/Valseek will this be addressed in the patch we presumably get next week?
---
Dude, this just happened to me. I was checking inventory at someone's camp and they were selling a fully modded 3 star junkies handmade for 1000 caps. I was standing there debating buying it now that addiction doesn't go away on death, and the dude logged off.
---
You can find multiples now... I have two cameras right now.
---
I got that warning once my stash was full. I think they mixed up the messages. Is your stash full?
---
Idk if this was just a one time thing, but when I died fighting the Sheepsquach in Free Range, I couldn‚Äôt respawn. I was stuck just watching my dead body while everyone else was fighting. I had to restart the game to be able to do anything
---
You have to earn badges to use the vending machines. The badges are a new currency to get backpack mods.
---
You were lucky to see the jetpack mod spawn. You could server hop for weeks without seeing it. The plan is guaranteed able to be bought and made. I reckon the mods will still sell for 2-3k easy
---
Wow, I knew I wanted to make sure, I so checked back this message, and my previous message was shadow hidden.
---
On trading sub and it's discord, shotgun shells were commonly sold for 1 cap a piece. (PC prices)
---
Due to "bad blood" between different sub owners, even it's simple name can't be mentioned here without getting your message shadow hidden, but you can for example find it through my reddit profile, most of my late posts have been to there.(not commets but "posts")
---
If you've thought 2 caps is fair price then I highly recommend checking them out. Particularly the discord for PC is good for finding simple things like common ammo. It gets sold all the time. I think the discord is less popular for console players, while they might use the subreddit more.
---
How? I hopped servers multiple times and found the dead girl in different locations multiple times but i still didnt find one
---
"Resolute Veteran".  It's a gatling that reduces your target's damage output for 3 seconds by 20%, gives 10% additional damage and +50 damage resist while aiming. I'm not too fond of it myself. Even with the three legendary effects, regular gatlings just seem underwhelming to me.  I *feel* like they should really dish out some pain, especially with the nice sound effects when they fire...but I can do more damage more quickly with my lever action.
---
I should clarify that I‚Äôm fine with the nerf as the armor had very simple workarounds as it was.  People shouldn‚Äôt be surprised though that if they were struggling with pvp before, this isn‚Äôt going to do much at all to help that. Especially against pure pvp builds.
---
That would be awesome. Some songs from New Vegas would be nice, along with other songs from the same time period.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think to check there!  Kept checking in the armory.
---
Much as that fast travel change is appreciated, my personal favorite change is the correction to that stupid Wendigo misc quest that has haunted my friend and I since the beta.  Sure its trivial, but I can now look at my quests without irritation over how many wendigo I have killed while in a clown costume and no longer need a clown costume in my stash/inventory.
---
Yeah I made sure that it registered them before I took the shot. In one of the pictures it even registered both a rabbit and squirrel but didn‚Äôt give credit.
---
yep. entering the region will even give you a quest .
---
I got the ones I bought for 15c each.
---
Eagle Scout here, we are expected to know computers. But I never heard my scoutmaster mention nuclear warfare as a prerequisite for progression.
---
It‚Äôs on the west side of the camp. Outside of it.
---
Perk cards don't matter, and legendary effects don't matter. The only thing that matters is what type of item it is. Melee, ranged, and armor all have slightly different values.
---
I always thought we should be able to build next to each other. Like the whole point of the vault opening was going on, restarting society. So we should be making towns, or at the very least camp sites of a few people. Not just by yourself in the middle of the woods.
---
No. Thankfully.
---
athlete/medic/archer is easiest imo for the quest
---
Is the royal jelly you have the junk, or the aid item? The junk item drops from honey beasts, but the aid item is a static world spawn. I haven't found the aid item myself, but there was a thread about it a couple months ago.
---
What if they aren't joking?
---
What if from reading OPs explanation they didn't get "multiply desired income by 10/9"?
---
What if the very idea of staring at a wall of text overcomplicating the shit out of math does, in fact, make their head hurt?
---
You don't know that.
---
Look at your tadpole badge for communications scout
---
gatling so 5mm
---
with a buddy and we farm WS? .45 combat explosive.
---
i want a handmade because ive bought over 2k 5.56 ammo from players today
---
How much would Hunter‚Äôs Long Coat be worth..? Asking for a friend
---
Oh yeah. My camp has never seen so much damage until now. People visiting my camp spawn enemies and they just let the enemies destroy everything.
---
I have crops, purifiers, and a junk machine for everyone to use freely. But obviously not when they‚Äôre broken.
---
It‚Äôs not much of a problem, just an inconvenience. It‚Äôs only a problem when I go to repair all and it won‚Äôt let me, despite having all the materials. It might have been because of the random people around.
---
Some heros don't wear capes... bless you sir.
---
Discover locations challenges still bugged as well as the Greek letters pi and omicron
---
I'll add you if you want me to.
---
Where exactly though, I found the ropes course but no intercom
---
Technically speaking they were already viable in the terms of carrying capacity due to legendary perks and deep pocketed.
---
What is annoying is now you're required to not wear PA if you want the refrigerator effect for food spoilage...
---
Well, between that and the Sentinel/Cavalier (and to a lesser extent Assassin) changes, it's an indirect nerf to Bloodied.
---
Which isn't to say that I can stand there taking a Scorchbeast, but if I get more than a couple Super Mutants with Miniguns on me, draining my AP through Dodgy, it's going to hurt now.  And that's okay - there should always be something out there that gives you pause.
---
Oh I know, they‚Äôre ludicrous. I‚Äôm trying now to finish as many as I can. Milking Brahmin now, gonna snap some shots of things that will kill me later. If this is what Pioneer Scouts did that makes the BSA look like a quivering bag of jelly pussies
---
Games like Minecraft reward farms and clever automation.
---
Hopefully they can implement a similar (same sell price before exiting) function in the other vendors that use caps, especially since it's limit one person to vendor at a time now.
---
Enforcer (shotgun) or Tormentor (rifle) perk cards help with crippling a limb.
---
Since they are marked on the map it shouldn't matter. People can fast travel to you so as long as you're accessible, people will find you.
---
Always check everything!
---
Is the max Carry weight with a Backpack really only 60?
---
I'd like to buy one. What's it worth??
---
Where would you recommend finding a reddit person to do the revive with? Would here be good or is there another sub I don‚Äôt know of?
---
Right in the middle of the best part of Manta Man...
---
I believe Bethesda said, it won‚Äôt completely complete as it will continue in future DLCs
---
Actually, the assassins effect worked 100% of the time, the sentinel effect only when standing in place or jumping on the spot. In my opinion, the only change that was needed was to make sentinel work as per the description, meaning the effect is canceled once you move including jumping.
---
I play 5 toons and they each use different ammo types (transfer ammo types between toons, I‚Äôm rarely starved for any), the only one I think you‚Äôll have trouble selling is .38.
---
I'm tracing you right now pal
---
Then there's no point in PA wearers to bother. I was only doing that questline to get one for a friend. Oh well. thanks for the info!
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I can team with you to get it done. I need it too. :(
---
Thanks.  Plastic has been the biggest challenge for me.  I hit the 2 schools &amp; cat lady's house for plastic pumpkins/plates/bowls, and also a WS run gets me in the 80-90 neighborhood.  But I would say 70% of the time someone else has beat me to those places.
---
Ok this is it right here. I'm not even checking any other ideas.
---
Yes. Only for your characters. I guess i did word that wrong mb.
---
5k.
---
username checks out lol jk.   
---
It's alright, the game isn't so great about explaining it's mechanics. The insane amount of hours I went with pharma farma before noticing the "Y to search" (thinking it was a passive benefit), was ridiculous.
---
Well you can get it for 11 with Hard Bargain 3 at vendors.
---
I bought out one player's supply at 6 caps apiece.  I'd probably pay up to 9 or 10.
---
5k. I'm selling on Xbox
---
Yeah forcing me to decorate
---
Well crap. Hopefully it is something that could be fixed by restarting the client.
---
Much better. Still not touching one of those filthy things anymore.  Desperate PVP people will still find ways to grief in Adventure.. Although this patch made their life much, much harder.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox , looking to get it done as well as in the water lol
---
Are the Legendary Exchange machines in the game yet?  The patch notes imply that they are in now, and the vendor will be in later, but I can't find any in game.
---
I couldn‚Äôt even follow this. Like at all..
---
No worries!
---
legendary weapon prices are sporadic and i dont know enough aboot them to bother selling ingame(since ill just scrap them now)
---
serums ive been seeing around 200-300 caps(on ps4)
---
most plans you can sell for its default cost, except weapon ones i cut in half and some plans are rare so id sell for around 500 each.
---
sell anything and everything you want tho after the next week or so most people prolly wont be too concerned with player vending anymore and/or the prices will be more evened out by then
---
I think I have it on one of my characters but I can't be on until tomorrow. 
---
I accept Mr. Fuzzy tokens. Lol
---
lmfao lol
---
Yo my camps on this loop nice hopefully this will get more people to visit it
---
I'm xbox. I'll be on tomorrow if u still have it (overnight shift right meow)
---
GT: AlldayPotter
---
I‚Äôm on a new character so I don‚Äôt really have anything besides caps to trade haha
---
That is how I got mine. Sadly I couldn't get someone who was in the water at the time.
---
I just sold a bunch for 10. Different servers will likely be different markets for certain things. Since I only have one character, I don't want to go over 25k (now over 21) while still trying to get rid of stuff. 
---
I also bought a 3* somethingorother weapon for 300 which I'll trade for 40 scrip, which to me is more valuable than 300 caps.
---
Its above the camp once u spawn at the camp go to the left its a building on a cliff all by its lonesome lol
---
The TS 50 cal and AA minigun (1 star but I'll take it) are pretty much only for the SBQ fight.  I wait for them to land which maximizes my bullet use efficiency,  I see others blasting away when its flying but I'm not carrying that much to waste.
---
I was wondering why I was getting that notice, thnx for the clarifications :)
---
GT: mlets
---
I‚Äôll be on to nearly-die in a minute, lol.
---
once you fast travel there it should be right on the left side of the bride with a sign too
---
My game is still freezing, but the vending machines (player and legendary) does make the game fell fresh and exciting again.  Just started my 2nd build (non p.a.) so I'm definitely going to do some shopping for that character soon!
---
They were probably just server hopping dude, nothing personal.
---
Meh.  I got so used to the sweet spot that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll bother.  Just more weight.  
---
It‚Äôs such a glorious weapon in its simplicity.  
---
I love my GG.
---
Such a noble creature.
---
Hey look, your post became really relevant today.
---
Add me psn jasonray717
---
I'm an idiot I was at the wrong camp. I went to camp McClintlock.
---
I think it prices will even out over time. This is a whole new economy now. I set my stuff a bit high to see what the new market will bare. Seeing a lot of plans and useful stuff for cheap right now though.
---
in the patch they fixed the bug where if the sheepsquatch dies while unstealthed, it will not go invisible after it dies. sometimes it will turn into metal pile a few seconds in some cases ive seen. so look out for those as well
---
It used to give it to the entire server upon completion?
---
Teapot worked for me.
---
Just experienced the same thing. I feel your pain very much
---
I'm on PC, looking to get this bullshit done too. They did say you could do everything solo.
---
Just got someone to help me, but thanks
---
Because I suck at math and this gives me some easy shit to throw in a calculator take my upvote.
---
Wasn't smores a fasnacht reward?
---
I picked up 76 again. After their updates and some patches I have been playing some more and getting a lot more enjoyment out of it. I've been playing Warframe a good bit as well as Borderlands 2 and some destiny
---
I‚Äôm in que for a server that has tourist with camera, once I grab it I‚Äôll invite you over or join you
---
Worst Travelocity ad ever.
---
Just assume that after every single update, you have to manually update your custom.ini
---
This guy has an interesting theory
---
Have one in my store psnTrickay1stave
---
You've earnt the backpack from the scouts?
---
Omw
---
I mowed down one on sunday, got a one star nocturnal Pickaxe and several duped plans. The endgame boss is a total joke at this point. Didn‚Äôt plan to do it but i happened to be in the area, entirely my fault for wasted ammo and time.
---
Have they said when the scrip resets?  Is it after 20 hours like the other vendors, or after a certain time every day like Biv?
---
Not for everyone, but plenty of people see enjoying.
---
I just did the encyptid event since I knew someone would go down eventually haha.
---
Atom Store Backpack is just a Skin.
---
You have to earn it???? What the point of spending atoms then if you still have to unlock it? That‚Äôs stupid.
---
Wow.......
---
That's the Meat Hook.  Easily confused with the Sickle.
---
Gotta do the very tedious quest bro
---
it's been like this since launch its ticks me off having to scroll thru them whenever i get another holotape
---
How do you get stimpak diffuser
---
would you happen to know how to get a stimpack diffuser?
---
Mine are all minimal. Now I'm decorating.
---
Let me know I'll jump off a cliff for you fellow dweller
---
Are these account-wide?
---
With this I mean, creating a new character and discovering these locations, would it work?
---
But you can buy recipes and mutations from the Enclave, and they're not readily available at the start. PPPs are available at the very first town.
---
you've always been able to purchase it but it's only at a random encounter vendor
---
Oh yea, it all spoils
---
There is no such thing as a pvp server.  There is adventure and survival which both include pvp.  PVP engagement rules are relaxed in survival but they are predominantly made up of low levels trying to level up quicker by taking advantage of the 20% bonus xp.
---
LMAO
---
Only the excavator really. With armor  legendary weight reduction perks and backpacks the carry weight is gonna be on 0r or better than any power armor save excavator. 
---
The backpacks and deep pockets would give more than calibrates shocks and you can use legendary perks including str boosting. 
---
Whenever we get legendary power armor it might balance out but calibrated shocks require you to give up a mod slot, backpacks are 100% free no downsides to current armor.
---
PSA: this only works if you don't close the trade window. Once you do, it's bye bye.
---
Do what I do when I reached max caps, go buy something pretty or in my case three BOS outfit plans
---
"I'm only 18 years old..."
---
Haha happens to all of us.
---
Same with enclave X-01 mods. I just mean, have they now made it easier to obtain like I said above.
---
Exactly, so it won't lock people out from getting them at any level
---
oh i noticed you need one of those.. well crap. ive yet to see one of those
---
I guess it‚Äôs possible someone would sell it for that. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs probable though. That‚Äôs a hell of a grind for a measly 3000 caps.
---
aaahhh, that helps a ton! thank you!!
---
THIS IS MY SWAMP!
---
I'll buy shotgun shells for 1 per cap all day long.
---
Well makes sense. At least they give you a chance. It is still the proper way it should work.
---
I stood on top of the tower waving at everyone who walked by. First one to wave back I invited them to team up then jumped off üòÅ
---
We could try the stream by whitespring or maybe grafting dam area
---
Yea, i thought so lol
---
It's the same idea as power armor paintjobs I guess. Those that play in PA sets don't want/need a backpack, but hey look, a new paintjob, take my caps!
---
There have been other bits and pieces lately that have required the original object to be already in your inventory.
---
I sold all my violet yesterday because I wasn't using it &gt;\_&lt;
---
Well yeah, but they made it seem complicated on purpose to get people to feel like they did something huge. They even said they're a professor, so they surely must've known that it was unnecessarily long.
---
Happened to my buddy. We couldn‚Äôt figure it out at first.
---
75% is still way OP, 50% is more proper.
---
If you're on PS4 I would do it with you!
---
10 over 9, a fraction.
---
25000 is the max. I always keep 17000-21000.
---
Yeah thanks for the help man
---
Good to know theres a max
---
(Sorry, not able to log in so don't have all the location names for you)
---
For plastics, I go to the 2 high schools to pickup plates, forks, pumpkins etc.  Drop by the cat lady's house and also WS run which nets decent no. of plastics (don't forget the golf balls &amp; clubs).
---
For lead, I go to the U, the Charleston Fire Station, and that motel in Flatwoods and pick up weights.  
---
I'm close by WS so for steel, I do a run through WS and the mole miners mine by station which sets me up pretty well.
---
Unfortunately, I find that I have to do the cycle 2-4 times to get me where I want to be ammo-wise after a SBQ fight.
---
I was at 22k but vending has maxed me out :-/ now I‚Äôm server hopping going to peoples vending machines picking out some gems!
---
Now shotguns got heavily nerfed, I like the leaked new skins but won‚Äôt be using shotguns any more. Thank you Bethesda for saving me atoms again.
---
I find broken cameras all over the place, can't you just find one and craft a new one ?
---
I now have calibrated shocks in my X-01. I have no caps left, but I can carry a lot of shit.
---
The thing that has me bummed is that I can't use the bag while in Power Armor. Which makes sense, but...still.
---
Am I doing something wrong it keeps failing me
---
üòÇ
---
I thought the same thing. But hey, if people are selling it for that much I might as well get my hands on it lol :)
---
Have you seen the new event? I dont even know where it starts but i cant find it anywhere
---
They said "herts", so it seemed pretty obvious they were joking.
---
Nope it needs to be a broken prosnap deluxe camera, not a regular one
---
Ive found a lot of those
---
Man, I thought I was bad with 3,500 shotgun shells but many of you put me to shame.
---
My Marsupial seems to sell somewhat regularly at 600 caps.
---
The only reason I priced it like that was to prevent someone from running off to a vendor and selling it for 500.  I mean, I could do that myself if I wanted.
---
I have a good 80-90k its pretty easy if you know what your doing
---
How did you say medic is one of the easiest when you don‚Äôt even know how to complete it..? The coding one is easy just terminals &amp; launch a nuke.
---
Well maybe the math made their brain hurt so bad spelling has become an issue for them?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/8unpfb/high_resolution_topography_map_the_nuke_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I found broken ProSnap camera's, not talking about the regular ones ..
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox &amp; when I logged in &amp; got legendaries out for scrips my game was BUGGIN lol
---
I see alot of overpriced garbage.
---
Yup! I have a CAMP right outside of Whitespring station. I have a free decontamination arch, free water, free use benches, and a free farm. I would like my customers to be comfortable shopping! I sell ammo, weapons, armor, and serums all at discounted prices. I maxed out my caps limit in the first few minutes my store went up tonight. I went and spent a bunch at all the other vendors on the server and left again maxed out! I love the new vending!
---
That sucks if the latest patch nerfed it. Glowing masses are heavy, I sold a bunch (like a hundred) over the weekend because my stash was full of wooden legs.
---
The slot machine mechanics and motifs sure make it feel like a random roll but that could just be because the wood chipper design came from mechanics that have since been changed.
---
I think most people would love this but I think buying the rights for more songs would be expensive.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a valid argument, the machine should be locked whenever the player has hit max caps, either that or don‚Äôt allow for items to be purchased which would put their caps over the limit.
---
There's a reason you can turn them off. If you're too fucking stupid to hook your vending machines up to a switch you've got bigger problems than reaching max caps.
---
When you add items to the vending machine from your person, they're moved to your stash and "assigned" to that specific vending machine (each one has a separate inventory).  
---
This is the same mechanic as adding items to the fermenter, and as with it (and anything in the stash in general), any items added will no longer benefit from weight reduction perks.
---
I went from about 17000 to 23000 went and bought the neon lights from white springs, yea 9800 caps, and just logged off with close to 18000....Cheap As Dirt Vending gets shit sold.
---
Thanks mah dude
---
Username checks out
---
Here i am, trying to kill yao guay with syringer...
---
I tried looking for the diffuser and no luck. I checked the medical bay in the enclave bunker because they have chem plans and nothing. Same thing at whitesprings I'm not sure if it's in the game or not.
---
Also while in my stash it is laggy as hell.
---
oh well if that's the case there is an easy way to farm the bot that sells it
---
Prosnap deluxe? Cause I havent found any
---
PS4. But you can just buy the plans now in the enclave bunker. I think it was 5800 caps for me.
---
You don't have to team up, "ally" is anyone you aren't trying to kill. I just completed it rezzing some rando at Free Range.
---
How
---
This almost always happened to me. Yes you need to have the camera register the subject which shows on the top right corner but very often, somehow the challenges does not register it.
---
Was at top of Watoga for last challenge. Had myself some 30+ pics taken with cam, without, different spots on top, reset the game, I mean there is only so much I can entertain on being a photowhore.
---
I give up after I feel I've done everything I possibly can
---
I‚Äôd sure hope it is so I can get a backpack
---
No, that's bad because you're providing new players with a possible boost that they can only achieve by spamming an RNG action that they need at that stage or else they'll be entirely outranked.
---
Mutations require you to build around them. They come with downsides as to not be entirely broken, and the few that don't are not very powerful.
---
You want to make a 10% XP bonus readily available once you reach Flatwoods, along with a large Rad Resistance boost, in exchange for farming a Pie Minigame that was put in as a joke.
---
For anyone that knows about this boost, the Pie becomes near essential, and would be essential for every build in the game, however, you would have to grind RNG events just for the one item. 
---
In all of my time in Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, I've only opened 1 Pie. That was after 200+ hours of Fallout 4, completing both DLCs, exploring the map completely, and achieving every ending. Everytime I have stumbled across one, I have tried at least twice. 
---
To lock an extremely powerful boost with no downsides behind this RNG wall is ridiculous. It's more powerful than mutations, much harder to get, and it fits in every build.
---
what area is your camp in?  could it have been scorchbeast?
---
I had it happen on my level 3 alt when I took a shop.
---
I wonder how long before they patch it, I got finals to take tomorrow.
---
This is a wasteland survival game. It should be each players responsibility to outfit themselves in a way that enables them to survive ALL threats, including other players.  Only the strong survive. Food and quality of life builds work together for strength in numbers or get wiped out by damage/defense builds.  But of course instead of actually trying to understand how combat works they cry out to the developers to remove a core aspect of the game to suit THEIR own playstyle because who the hell are you to inconvenience them while they are trying to find the optimal place for their punchbowl.
---
Also, I found 3 by Becker Farm near Grafton.
---
What level are you? I got a bloodied grognak‚Äôs with power attack &amp; I two shot them lmao
---
This is true of most game though. The new shiny will get stale and people will start hyping for the next big change. And that's okay. As long as people don't go full dickhead it'll all be fine.
---
I already got one I did archer,Hunter, and chemist not sure what the third one I did was called.
---
Into this. XB1 Message: its Soupra
---
Drill and syringer are still in legendary pool yes?
---
Did crafting this at your CAMP complete the challenge requirement for the tadpole herpetologist?
---
if you pick a lock on an owned workshop I know you become wanted, if you own a workshop contesters can break your stuff...
---
Preachhhhhhhhh.
---
Yeah I'm down GT MisledGalaxy40
---
Nah I don't mind if people help themselves. I have 6 large water purifiers if someone needs all 30 waters for crafting they can have it. I'm just glad to help.
---
Do have a vending machine? It appears that when players come to my camp, enemies spawn nearby way more frequently.  Maybe that's it?
---
Oh, that actually makes sense...
---
Done!
---
Where you get it?
---
After awhile you have too much to even do anything with. Just leave em open.
---
Enclave
---
The hounds at the SBQ fight sometimes drop those. I have 2.
---
I will double check, maybe the name just looks the same, idk .. ok thanks
---
Pssst. Sell your lot of shit.
---
Oooo big man with the insults really helps boost your argument.
---
There's been debate as to if that means we're getting companions in future DLC or just a leftover asset from all the FO4 items that were put into the game. Only time will tell...
---
Idk but i had a couple low level scorched wreck a turret and a wall faster than I've ever seen. They took almost no damage from the turret while i listened to it pump rounds in them for a few minutes. I heard one of my walls break and took them out.
---
I too would like to know this but yeah, probably 20 hours. I just offloaded all my 1 star armor and weapons and got 149 scrip (the max per day is 150). That equated to about 70 pounds worth of stuff.
---
Yes. And proceeded to scrip the Resolute weapon
---
Me too:  JS The Ragman
---
I don't think so, Because it seems to give you nothing, go talk to the other scout leaders at dolly sods and kiddy corner
---
No my base is completely made out of the strong metal one and everything was destroyed down to even the workbenches decontamination shower
---
Had to do it once myself because my camp couldn't be placed.
---
Playstation! Sorry forgot to specify.
---
No scortchbeasts don‚Äôt spawn near my camp
---
Thanks for the helpüòäüòä
---
Didn‚Äôt own a workshop
---
When looking at my guns I can see them lagging
---
Lol I feel you. Still having moderate fun but I saved 200lb‚Äôs of legendary 2 &amp; 3* just to get cockblocked by Bethesda. Because it‚Äôs so bad if I get a large amount of scrips THAT I WORKED FOR. But no totally I‚Äôll clear out my 200lb cancer cell in about 2 months‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
---
Downside... don't want to swap characters as much.
---
Whoever came up with this shit at BGS ought to be flogged.
---
DEMOCRACY IS NON - NEGOTIABLE
---
Yeah i had to find a 50. Cal and kill one that way. So just a heads up to you all i suppose.
---
**\*TIP\***  
---
As someone who has been plagued with the "Freeze" issue for months --the kind that usually recovers after seconds/minutes-- my advice is to WAIT long enough that the event you're participating in will be over! Go make a snack, or take the dogs out, fold laundry, do dishes... once you get back, restart the game.
---
Reason?   
---
It's bad enough our game has screwed up somehow and might require a restart, but it's worse that it happens right in the middle of an event. ***However***, if you give the event enough time to complete before you terminate the game, you will at *least* be awarded with what is given for completing it normally!
---
Once you log back in, you'll have whatever mystery items you won waiting in your inventory. Might take some searching, but it'll be there, and keep in mind that Plans are also often awarded.
---
I know it's not quite as good as being able to loot *&lt;insert Legendary Corpse type here&gt;*... but it sure beats losing out *completely!* :)
---
Where at White Springs can you find the neon light plans? I think I need to have those.
---
What even is it? 150+ hours of playing and I‚Äôve never heard of it.
---
Yeah that quest seems like an enormous pain
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mExSfkl83Ho
---
it worked for me
---
Like the enclave vendor?
---
Happened to me too. Guy had a locked building that I spawned in
---
Been done before minus the venders
---
If you get "hostile" after that I'm sure your base will get leveled lol
---
How do you transfer it with a mule? i cant sell it to another character or drop it
---
Yes
---
Pic please. Sounds funny.
---
Also on PC, also trying to get it done if you need help
---
Oh? That‚Äôs good. Yeah, I agree. They‚Äôll settle soon enoughüòã Thanks
---
a lot easier to find a workbench close by too
---
Yes please someone tell me!
---
May not be in game yet, never heard of it and no one else seems to know
---
Check your World challenges. They contribute towards your progress in the new Tadpole challenges.
---
There is plenty of content... it's just not content you're interested in. But instead of advocating for content they want, some members of the community instead take it out on other players. That's not going to win people over, and now those jerks can float off into obscurity.
---
Step 1:  Play in survival. 
---
Step 2: Sell Aid/Junk in vending machine
---
Step 3: Set up turrets
---
Step 4:  Profit by reselling the same items over and over again.
---
Eat a Snickers. You're not you when you're hangry.
---
Shotgun shells all day e'rry day.
---
Its okay *pats on back* This games gets to all of us
---
Do you know what those exams are for then. Seems really time consuming
---
Good thinking
---
I‚Äôll sweeten the deal and pay 1000 caps for someone to drown and let me revive them underwater while teamed up
---
Any takers?
---
Thanksüòä
---
But you can use it, at least they said your supposed to
---
Mine took so long to degrade. I took off gunsmith so it would degrade faster and ran through Morgantown and Whitesprings spamming at ghouls. Eventually it ticked down
---
Did you buy ammo?
---
Lol, guy above you complaining their ammo is gone and they didn‚Äôt get caps xD
---
My backpack says I need to unlock it still üò≠ and I already have!
---
But... I had to scrap my garden to make room in my budget to sell stuff and I'm hungry.
---
If you hide the quest and then re enable it it fixes it. That happened to me too
---
Do you know what scout values and world challenge badges are
---
stupid question but are u at the cap limit of 25000 caps, it was mentioned that if ur at the cap limit people can still buy from ur machine but u wont get any of the caps
---
Its here!!!
---
I think that'll be a way off yet. They'll need to do private servers first so they can have public vanilla servers and private mod servers.
---
I'm down! And I'm on rn, what's your handle?
---
Whoa....  that's scary,  I'm in the same boat waiting for someone to buy mine!?
---
Where do you take the ‚Äúexams‚Äù?
---
Np
---
You have to complete specific exams mainly the one's your trying to get. Because if you don't complete a exam for a badge you won't be able to get it. It's one of the requirements to get a badge.
---
The Purveyor (sp)
---
Got a SNR after a trade - disconnected - game was rolled back to before the trade &amp; neither of us had the item :( was a 40k gun.
---
It's not an argument, just an observation on your intelligence. You know there's a cap limit. You know there are switches. If you're dumb enough to "leave your lights on" when you're at max caps you're a fucking idiot.
---
No, I had about 3,000 caps when the person bought my stuff. :(
---
Important to note, the place guests arrive via fast-travel is not the same place you arrive via fast travel, and may require you change your CAMP, I had to pull a foundation that everyone spawned inside of.
---
It can be during the day as well. It seems as though different things happen each time.
---
Where is the shooting test at
---
Bethesda really do need to fix all that up, they have people‚Äôs money and providing no product .... gaming industry gets away with to much.
---
So clearly I‚Äôm bad at dying in water. ü§î
---
I'm also uncomfortable about the direction it's heading. But we'll see...
---
I am so very sorry I will arrange a funeral
---
Nah, they updated it in the patch notes. Claim that it was mistake.
---
I think that the daily missions might reward tokens, cause I already have 1 possum token and I didn't finish any tadpole badge yet.
---
Since i got no recipes and one of them gave me a camp item i guess the other one gave me the token, but could be a bug :/
---
Im looking for  that now, ill let you know if i find it.
---
They have always been consumed on use. If it didn't work that way for you, then you experienced a friendly game bug.
---
Not really
---
Yeah, you‚Äôll be fine. Mine is near where you are describing and it is still there. They just made the front right outside of the golf club a no build zone.
---
Anytime you would read a new plan it would always use it and never just moved it to "Known". Plans and recipes are basically a consumable.
---
Still need it?
---
A mole-lady üòç
---
Well I completed the cooking exam but didn't get anything saying I received a badge
---
How about the option to rob a portion of it?  Say 10% with a bounty commensurate to what's stolen.
---
ok wow maybe this is bug/glitch related to the vending machine
---
hopefully u get ur missing caps and beth does something about this fast
---
Honestly that pictures is really well taken, I was definitely not expecting that
---
Found the fossil, a sea creature of some sort but it doesn't show as a fossil when I take out the camera. Is that happening for anyone else?
---
That's dumb
---
Maybe it was nuked? Lol
---
Is that still a thing?
---
Mods were always that price at the vender
---
It‚Äôs on the actual bridge, not the nearby wooden jumping puzzle. You have to follow the course from one side of the bridge to the other. It‚Äôs a bit easier if you clear it or enemies first.
---
I came here to ask this! I killed 60 dudes and condition didn‚Äôt drop. Then I meleed a few with it and condition is still max. No gunsmith or other perks that would affect it.
---
Ya I wasn‚Äôt sure why I kept dying until I looked at my pip boy under effects üòÖ
---
I think it shows it's worth being vocal about changes we want to see... just no reason to be a jerk about it.
---
If you look at world challenges and scroll down you'll see the badge and you can see the requirements for each one.
---
Berkley station. 
---
You can tell she's not the usual Male mole miner because of the beard. The males don't have one.
---
If we're being cannon the doesn't happen for another 25 years. Please get it right next time
---
Cabin right next to jaggy has a computer, the cabin is also labeled exams, hope that helps
---
You do realise that people don‚Äôt sit in their CAMP 24/7 right? There‚Äôs going to be situations where you can t just go and flick the lights off, such as fighting the SBQ, Sheepsquatch or if you‚Äôre AFK. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure why people are getting so fucking defensive because I think that caps just vanishing into the either is dumb.
---
so...how did you fix it?
---
I got it from either the Raider or the Watoga Vendor. Stupid thing they dont want to connect together on the my warehouse or barn walls for some damn reason.
---
The badges are given by completing Tadpole challenges. The values are just your four objectives for the quest.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt happen to know a good way to contact them about this, would you? Also thank you. :( &lt;3
---
Not sure if this is an accurate statement,  but I think using it to bash mobs breaks it down faster than shooting bolts from it.
---
Haha there we go, Berkeley Station. I just said she cause that‚Äôs what Bethesda referee to the Purveyor as in the notes lol
---
Nah, I was only gone for like 10 mins then fast traveled back and everything was leveled flat
---
How ?
---
There's a cabin near Scout Leader Jaggy with a sign on the wall. The terminals are in there.
---
At the camp the building to the left of the robot u talk to its 2 terminals inside...If someone is using it u can aim at the keyboard and take it on your pipboy.
---
Put bear arms on
---
 [u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek)  can you please find out something about this I have 1000 hours on this character and have played everyday since launch and I have lost my will to play if this quest can't be fixed for me
---
Nevermind, just had to back up a lot. Apparently being too close makes it not register. ü§£
---
So which ones do I need to do for the tadpole quests
---
This is true, also create one extremely low levelled like 15 as it has lower condition.
---
I honestly dont know how to contact them hopfully someone else does ur a quick search might turn something up
---
Good luck with getting ur missing caps
---
Same here. Seemed to happen to a few people who played today.
---
Fair point. It's definitely going to take a bit.
---
Ditto
---
Set prices to Max and setup a msg board asking for offers. Working well for me.
---
Thats wat I'm working on now sadly no luck
---
About to log off, but if you don‚Äôt get it done maybe tomorrow
---
My character im playing was carried over from the BETA so, that may explain things. Thanks for the answer.
---
I can't wait. I'll have rad emitters lined up around it in a locked room.
---
Fifth disconnection lol
---
That not a name
---
Same as on here! :) I'll be on in a little while, just waiting to get off work.
---
I used a .308 chambered light machine gun to finish a yao guai off.
---
Ive seen shitty 3star armour for 7k
---
You go to the enclave vender and buy it
---
Well I offloaded all my 2 and 3 star legendaries onto a mule character. For the record, nuke accounts are an extremely normal practice in MMOs so there‚Äôs no reason to feel it‚Äôs bad. Obviously now that we can trade them in I‚Äôll have no need for it
---
The last thing anyone needs are floaters!
---
Or if you managed to get yourself stuck in some awkward geometry with enemies nearby, which would force you to relog or hope that something killed you.
---
They disabled the bowl in this latest patch. It was in the patch notes.
---
They took the punchbowl out of play. It's in the patch notes.
---
I don't actually have that much to sell. I get rid of everything I don't use pretty quickly, either by selling, scrapping or giving it away. It's just pretend money, and I'll have a couple thousand caps again in not too long.
---
Just ask a trusted friend. If you don‚Äôt have one I‚Äôd be glad to help :)
---
I‚Äôm done the first part to get the first bag, wasn‚Äôt to bad :)
---
They disabled the punch bowl in this patch for some reason, no one seems to know why...
---
Wicked update so good to see this game slowly reach its potential.
---
At work atm...I‚Äôve been reading posts after posts of the new content and I can‚Äôt wait to get back home and play! I don‚Äôt mind the spoilers...I would probably come back to look for some useful tips on this new dlc.
---
After making 5k in about 2 hours I was afraid of that...
---
You are effing high if you think anyone will explain it to you.
---
I bought a 2 shot lever action for 500 caps
---
‚ÄúThis leafy place has lots of meat‚Ä¶ soft meat, squishy meat, yummy meat‚Ä¶

It wasn‚Äôt really directed toward you but people who launched the hate bandwagon. Bethesda did release a subpar game and against suggestions from players and their own team. They have done enough wrong. They can‚Äôt turn back time regardless. So it‚Äôs not something that I‚Äôd really hold over their head for the next ten years. Their marketing team messed up bad too. It‚Äôs going to take a lot for them to regain the trust of their fans again, before considering launching another product like that. So yea, I‚Äôve seen the negative and I agreed that they deserved the hate. I just can‚Äôt focus all on the negative when they have done good as well. I agree they can do much better. Like tailoring the game around difficulty and progression. The game itself is pretty fun. Other times it can be pretty daunting. But the game is evolving and I like the direction it‚Äôs going for the most part. I just wish that they would stop favoring those who complain that the economy is broken but expect rare drops to drop 50% of the time. Or the queen. The player makes the choice to participate. Whether that is melee or using ranged weapons. There‚Äôs just so many complaints that people want fixed yesterday but don‚Äôt seem to realize that it‚Äôs not as easy as pressing enter. Bethesda has never really been good at patching things but I‚Äôm glad that they are making the effort.
---
I guess that is the one thing good about Xbox... hummm.  
---
On Xbox we can make LFG groups saying that we need to do X.  
---
Its a lot harder to go out a look for people outside the game.
---
Documents\my games\Fallout 76
---
I deleted this folder and the folder where the game is actually installed. Afterwards I reinstalled and it worked.
---
So many good things. My camp will be even more amazing. If only I could add window-sill flower pots now.
---
Gt CammedPony if you want to join me I‚Äôm getting ready to jump off central mountain lookout tower. Revive me then you jump so I can revive you.
---
I need context immediately
---
Which ones did you do? I got the athletic one done. Gonna have to grind one each day probably. Just gonna do the terminal one and then the archer one.
---
It's good for the market
---
I'm so happy! It's a little bit different from what I expected it to change to, because now the gun takes up more screen space but hey! They listened!
---
That'd be interesting.  Right now bounties seem to be essentially non existant in Adventure
---
I fast traveled to a dudes camp hoping to check his vendor ended up in his heavily locked house. Talking like 4 locked doors and a electric door. I was not in a hurry so I decided to go and play the banjo in his house till he showed up and freed me. Needless to say his reaction was amazing.
---
Archery, athletic, and hunting
---
It's weird to see this post just today that we got the maximum grindfest of FO76 till date.
---
Just the tadpole badge challenges are pretty time consuming, but people who completed some of them say there are Possum rank ones even harder to get.
---
But ofc if you like a game where you get max equipment on a single game session you need to go play an FPS.
---
Personally I'm super happy with today's update, it has bugs like always, but it also has tons of new things to do. I was also surprised when I hit the cap of scrip after freeing only like 20 lbs of wieght from my toon, but I guess I'll only have to unload daily.
---
Some people don‚Äôt know what they have.
---
Ok joining your game
---
Gertrude Specklebottom. Gerrty to her friends.
---
So I should have backed up my perkloadout.ini yeah?  
---
I can use nukes and dragons links to update in .ini and loads will still work, just not saves if im understanding correctly? 
---
Keretus done made a mod so good I don't even want to play without it. 
---
I also use the military map mod. 
---
Anyone know if I am gonna need to use the ba2 tool to recompile to get THAT back in my game instead of abstract art map?
---
Only way to get them is by picking a lock.  
---
Can't damage camps. Health bar gets to 25% then crazy health regen kicks in and it's fully repaired. Does the same in shops, even if you're hostile to the owner (but not if you're actively contesting the shop).
---
I've made sure to keep an eye on my budget meter and each item I assign to the Vending Machine makes the budget meter go up. I'm not sure how much exactly, but can 100% confirm that the assigned items take up budget.
---
We need a clan bathtub and a sink as well.
---
Next week is when she's online I think. I know the legendary scrip machines are live now, but she doesn't come into play just yet.
---
I agree that sentinel needs to not work when jumping and sometimes seems to work while still moving for some reason. I also think it needs a cool down when you stop. But I feel assassin's has always been under powered both armor and weapon and now it doesn't work 25% of the time? Not that I use it but I think it should be more effective regardless.
---
How dare game developers punish people for violating the terms and services of the products they spend years and millions of dollars developing... Wait.
---
Hey. Just letting you know you can‚Äôt revive a drowned player or get someone to down with the radiation. I got mine by them downing themselves in the water with an explosive weapon (while their head was above the water bot their legs in the water) and me reviving while I was mostly or fully underwater. Note: they must be in a spot in the water where they can shoot at their feet. I can‚Äôt help you as I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
Yes, please!
---
I sold a 3* Bloodie Power Fist for 2000, went around to other camps and was astonished with prices of 5000 to 10000 caps for 2-3* items. HOLY SHIT. I am pricing my stuff to sell, well below the value stated.
---
It wasn't near being full.  And it was saying the workshop budget, as in the C.A.M.P. building budget wouldn't allow it.  I ended up logging out and logging back in and it fixed the issue.  I even had enough budget to put a second machine but I can't keep it full due to all the shoppers LOL.  That server was really laggy and such so I think things were just messed up in general.  But thanks for all the help!
---
A dude said the grahm and moo moo weren‚Äôt even real so there was no point
---
Tried to add but your settings won't lemme send, I'm byrdbyrdbyrd23
---
YW
---
Mine does
---
check challanges
---
I put mine on my excavator and they glow properly for me. May be a bug with x-01.
---
Oh shit yeah that‚Äôs right, I forgot the new vendor is coming next week, though the station she‚Äôll occupy is already present as well. My mistake.
---
Anyone care to help me on ps4 with the revive an ally quest marker? I only have 2 other friends who play and they probably wont get on for awhile.
---
I‚Äôve been hanging around my camp making it more visitor friendly, and when somebody buys something I hit my siren and shoot my flare gun around
---
Has anyone noticed they nerfed armor and weapon values when repaired to 200%??? My X0 and my death claw have seriously decreased since the patch. Please tell me I'm not the only one to notice this, it's driving me nuts...
---
Like those new dangle repair kits
---
Get to level 50 and take thw super duper perk.
---
Had that happen before, too. I think it's because there's not enough people doing limb damage.
---
I've found that a Mr Handy blade works pretty well combined with twisted muscles.
---
Same
---
Can you craft them for other people? Might want to jump on that if so, before everyone unlocks them.
---
Wish we could turn that shit OFF. Also, quest completion. Tired of that stuff blocking my view when I'm in a firefight.
---
What did you cook to do the hunting step, I just went all over the place and made a radstag meal and it didn't even count
---
What I foresee...
---
Me: *uses terminal*
---
Terminal: You are already dead.
---
Ambushing Sniper: *headshots me while I can't move*
---
Oof. I traded in 4 total legendaries. Definitely starting with my 2 stars tomorrow
---
I'm also on ps4 and need a buddy to revive, mind if I tag along?
---
I've synced my ini file to the latest, but my game is still crashing. I'm going to revert to a default ini file and the add in mods until I find the one causing it. Anyone already know the answer?
---
Not sure if sarcasm or not, but the reason why is people putting in Nukashine and noobs getting teleported to random places not knowing what happened.
---
Agreed.  I have so many caps.  It's really just fun selling at this point not making caps.
---
What was the point of them? Sorry I‚Äôm kinda new. I remember seeing one on the golf course near a shit ton of glowing ones. Were they placed near ghoul spawns?
---
Uhh dead money was a Fallout New Vegas DLC, FONV wasnt made by Bethesda
---
I sure hope so. I just don't want to end up having to pay 25k for good weapons lol
---
What is the weapon and challenge I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about scrapping it for scrips.
---
I can‚Äôt even find the fucking camera
---
Abbie's bunker lv 0 at the door
---
Did you finish the tadpole quest first?
---
Right side of the park if you‚Äôre looking at the entrance of the park. It‚Äôll be a empty pool &amp; you have to take a picture of the building facing south of the pool
---
What‚Äôs it called?
---
It‚Äôs the wave pool!  You‚Äôll see a big clearing off to the side of the entrance.
---
.308 for ammo conservation
---
.45  after I found combat rifles and lever action. 
---
Shotgun is my slow sh!# down (enforcer perks)
---
5mm for my gatling after I kneecap an enemy
---
5.56 on my vampire handmade when I need to. Only ammo I've had to make. 
---
I have a ton of fusion cells for my tesla but I save that for low level enemy groups in the forest.
---
Apparently no one at Bethesda washes their hands!!!
---
Posted a thread a few hours ago about this. Upon a little more testing, it was found the amount displayed as being purchased is actually what that player has in their inventory post-sale, not what they actually bought.
---
I think the same thing happened to me. Said someone brought like 4 or 5k worth of ammo I got nothing.
---
Her name is Purveyor Murmrgh
---
I think it starts in the camp itself, there's a place with a campfire, named like reunion point or something.
---
But I guess it only starts at night.
---
I used Yao Guai
---
No, that's intended. The reason was that you could put the Miner's key in it, lmao.
---
I saw a guy selling multiple items for 24666k caps.... I don‚Äôt think he actually wanted to sell them
---
I saw mr fuzzy tokens for 25c each! Pass!
---
Fallout 76 missed connections
---
That's just silly.
---
I guess I just wasn't shopping there often enough.  But Bethesda had described T51 calibrated shocks  plans as "random," prior to one of the patches.   I didn't think that was accurate.  The chances of the plans appearing were so low that they may as well not have existed.
---
I paid 80c for  fasnacht plans
---
Patch notes suggest otherwise.   
---
&gt;Dev Note:  Who's been spiking the punch bowl?
---
Also the Survival challenge for Resolute Hero is bugged and you can get them in adventure mode
---
I started today at 25,000.  
---
After a whole lot of fast travel and buying from players? Just under 7000 left. Yikes!
---
I‚Äôm guessing 20 hours
---
This makes me want to buy something from you.
---
An introverts dreams
---
Piss, depends. Dump, no!!
---
This is likely the correct answer, as it's the same as the regular vendors.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of good weapons for a fair price after the update. The player tax has already and will continue to increase the value of the cap as more and more get removed. Making caps an actually valuable currency again
---
I saw a vendor selling a slice of Perfectly Preserved Pie for that exact price.
---
And be quick about it!  I've gotta go!
---
Aaaw crumbs, that makes sense. Now that you mention it, I don‚Äôt think I had 2,000 of that ammo to begin with. I‚Äôm a dummy. Thanks for clearing that up though, I was super panicked! Thank you!!
---
That was a joke.
---
Place a vending machine and power it up.
---
Build the vendor machine at your camp and make sure it has power.
---
once you put down the vendor thing and power is you should show up
---
Yep they just changed their minds. I‚Äôm pretty bummed out about it.
---
Place down the player vending machine, power it up (takes 3 power), and put some items in it to sell.
---
Yeah it did that when I was trying to help my boyfriend with his shop. Just keep fighting it and you‚Äôll eventually get it to stop but it might keep popping up here and there
---
same!!!
---
This makes sense, doing the damage reduction in %, before doing the armor pen calculation. I got thrown off by the "This calculation is run AFTER anti-armor effects are applied" remark which is about the damage calculation after the armor DR value is adjusted for Incisor 3. I don't know what I was thinking there lol.
---
Also the rule, *always apply the next damage reduction in % to the remainder* applies to each effect, even if they are all pieces of the same armor type. That makes a big difference. Assassins/Sentinel isn't that strong without the other perks such as Blocker (45%) and Dodgy (30%, although this perk kills your AP when hit by automatic weapon fire). About 25% of the damage will still get through the armor without those 2 perks.
---
Bethesda didn‚Äôt develop ESO...
---
They are. I have a pre-patch Hunter's exploding plasma gatling that can shred through a dusky yao guai...as long as I have it with me :/
---
Only if it has a flushing animation, or a handle jiggle
---
I love you
---
You can use my toilet if it's an urgent one
---
Built it and it didn't check off the challenge :(
---
Just did this and nothing happened.
---
I was still seeing them tonight, but it takes a while for some of these things to get "figured out".
---
How the legendary vendor works will really impact things.  I'm putting my money on a 3 star costing 1000 scrip.  We'll see though.  Hopefully it's a list of random rolls that sticks with your character every 24 hours or week or so.  Not really wanting to see something pushing server hopping.
---
I keep holding out for Graham to get his own station.
---
That sounds hilarious at first but then will get pretty annoying after the first time lmao.
---
Also, I want it to be sittable
---
Well, sure....but at same time how dare a developer release such rubbish on launch of a game and also not fix issues from its previous incarnation...been fallout 4.  Both the consumer and developers are in the wrong. My point is that they should actually communicate with those affected, this is no way to treat a customer. It‚Äôs also very ignorant to think that only duppers where banned or suspended. Players running around picking up stuff where affected too, Bethesda just don‚Äôt want to or don‚Äôt know how to seperate them. Either way it‚Äôs been very slack of Bethesda to have no time line on resolving the issue. I know players who dropped excess items before the wave, but still got caught in the mess because Bethesda was not able to seperate who was actually holding them as oppose to ever holding them at the time the accounts got scanned. There are also loads of players who just didn‚Äôt log in during that time and still have millions of stuff in there account. Bethesda is not right been silent on the issue. My internet in this is that I have lost many friends to play with who should be still have there accounts. Paying customers who supported a largely broken product at launch.
---
You can do the following
---
1 . give 25 k + straight jakets, straight jakets are worth about 30 caps when sold and weigh 0.1 so for 1 Lb you get about 300 caps. They are great as a backup, instead of farming caps, you can store 100 of them for 10 lbs and sell them for 3k - that's allmost 2 days of store credit
---
2. Give 25k + some low legendary like a suit of unyielding sentinel = about 2.5k or a really good explosive double shot. If you trade the last star for personal use, the other person might part with his weapon itself
---
3.  Use a mule - which is dificult and no way to secure the transfer without a friend. You don't want to part with 25k and the other guy won't want to part with his 40k weapon
---
4. Simply pay in items, some legendary sets or high end gear sell for constant price. For example all serums sell for 500, you could sell 100 of them for 50k, then you can have a caps reserve fill 25k  and have the equivalent of 50 k in banck for easy to get simple items - clothes serum legendary
---
5. use a renowned trader that deals in doubleshot explosives often to secure the trade , he can be the mule, keep the caps trade the weapon, use an alt or use a group. Please consider your vendor can also not hold more then 25k, if he's not worried about how to MULE himself - to fill up 2 characters with caps he might be troling you. due to disconects and server issues, you need about 5 people to meet - 2 characters from buyer, 2 characters from seller and 1 account for arbitration and easy find. If the guy is asking for 40k but after talking he doesen't bring it up himself, kinda means he doesen't intend to sell it to you and just wants you to waste time
---
I did already üòÅ
---
Why would they not allow Nukashine, when it's a punchbowl that holds alcoholic drinks?
---
Everyone loved doing it, removing it would just be lame.
---
I figured the dev note just referred to them noticing that was the drink of choice.
---
I'm selling that stuff for under 5k on pc. Market can't bare the inflated prices we've been seeing. What can you do with a 25k cap limit? Alts? Fuck that noise.
---
Haven't even broken into my good stuff yet. I will put you into a newer car for less, come see me at Nan's discount. I will put you in that newer ride for less!
---
Definitely some truth there.  Acid is the choke point - no "good" source that matches the quantity of lead and steel you can pull out of a single location.
---
troll, it would take you 8 characters for that and it would take him 8 as well, all empty, then another account for arbitration - aaaaand you need a server to yourself lol
---
Two characters around 20k another at like 10k.
---
Imagine how big the outcry will be if the canned beef stew was made unspoilable *before* the server-wide event reward fix.
---
That's what I figured.
---
auto learn
---
I was at almost 50k between my two characters but today I went on a shopping splurge and now I'm down to 10k. üòÖ
---
Got it! Thanks, man!
---
It was an auto learn, but you get one automatically that‚Äôs level 20 and can craft Standard ones at any level.  So technically you can craft them for your friends if you want!
---
Can you even craft with Purified Water? I thought it was just boiled still?
---
Got it :-)
---
Yup, Grafton Station :D
---
I was hearing they cant be traded or dropped....
---
I will, you got a mic?
---
How much do you have that it came down to the like 2%-5% budget of food you have?
---
Hmm, I didn‚Äôt try but I will when I get back on!
---
Yeah this is the least toxic comunity I have ever seen, people help with quest , drop random plans and are super helpfull
---
So it's not the rope bridge course, they are clearly marked courses for pioneer scout trials, little yellow flags, a sign, a start button. I was just in the wrong spot. 
---
The athletic badge is pretty easy to get as long as you can hit 5 agil and 5 str.
---
Wow, that's enough for a whole Power Armor paint swap!
---
If you ask for a refund they will give you one.
---
Please. I'm stuck in the group of peeps that the quest is bugged out for.
---
Survival mode is still just a stealth boy mark3 spam fest.  Please for the love of god, allow us to vats someone using a stealthboy once we've successfully landed shots on them, just like we can against chameleon armor using players. Invisible bunny hopping for the win.  Some guys have 200 mark 3s.
---
How did you get the backpack?
---
I‚Äôm a little OOTL, who are these guys?
---
Yeah, at launch there was a bug where everyone on the server was given a few cans when the event is completed. A lot of folks assumed that was intended (feed the people), and deliberately ran it for the server when it was available. Bethesda fixed that bug in one of the first patches.
---
;-)
---
This patch is badass
---
Right place.  Right time.
---
Legend says that obsidian somehow is keeping the rights to those. 
---
Nay sayers remember that‚Äôs not how public domain work.
---
I‚Äôm at the same boat I have no idea either
---
Awesome thank you dude sorry I couldn‚Äôt help sooner but hopefully this thread explodes with great advice for other
---
I had to actually start googling shit..... I was like are you kidding me. Dehydrated twice.....lmao
---
Yup, same for me. That was the last one for me that would've completed 3 tadpole badges. Now I can't finish it.
---
Really frustrating.
---
Sorry dude*
---
There were a couple of bugs for me but honestly loading out and back in really helped.  Dashboarding, etc.
---
I just sold 2000 shot gun ammo for one a piece.
---
There is a terminal upstairs in the military wing that shows communication between MODUS and a ZAX machine who is oddly fascinated by Abraham Lincoln...
---
If you choose to be defenceless, and if you‚Äôre over level 25 it is a CHOICE, then you should accept that at some point you will be preyed upon, either by player or AI.  
---
Why would you choose to be defenceless in a survival game?  If you choose to equip pack rat and traveling pharmacy over max blocker, barbarian, shotgunner or master heavy gunner, etc that your choice. If you choose to equip lucky break or the better caps or whatever it is called over critical savvy or one gun army, etc then that is your choice.  A choice that rightfully makes you weaker and vulnerable. 
---
These choices should have consequences in my opinion, but the truth is they really don‚Äôt. If you get killed by another player you lose the junk you have on you (which should be next to none because you should be stashing it regularly but either way it is literally everywhere) and a few caps which are completely trivial to obtain.  If somebody destroys your camp it is 1 press of a button to completely rebuild it.  Really... one button press.   You have at least 600 pounds of junk stored in your stash that can be used to do that. You‚Äôre going out later to collect more anyways.  And tomorrow.  And the next day.  And so on...
---
A few options are fight back and win or fight back and lose. Or leave.  It really has very little material effect on you at all.  Unless it‚Äôs your ego that‚Äôs hurt...but that couldn‚Äôt possibly be it because it‚Äôs only a video game, right?
---
Or instead call people cheaters and cry out to the developers to change the game because you couldn‚Äôt beat somebody to death with your lead belly perk card and you were inconvenienced. Get over yourself already.
---
I just want an explosive double shot and to carry more, not in that order...
---
I think it may be the personal terminal, I got it but my wife didn't, and I had the topiary but she did not.
---
Freakin A! Can i just kill 50 players and be done with it? Heck I'll even throw orbital strikes at their camps for free!
---
The quest popped up for me a few weeks ago now it doesnt work.
---
Short answer:  children are not supposed to be playing a game like this.  That‚Äôs how.
---
Fair points
---
Oh sorry I see what you‚Äôre saying now and I agree 100%.
---
Used for Chem recipes.
---
I think you may need to go to map and hit the left pad button to bring up challenges. There are specific ones in there that go towards those. Hope this helps
---
The fast travel is one thing I didn't think about. I have a farmhouse next to Watoga, and I saw a good amount of low level players passing through. Plenty around 20 or 30, one level 3 guy. Couldn't tell if it was a mule or a genuine newbie. Either way, I guess my store now doubles up as an easy fast travel
---
I think I spent more traveling than shopping, which is new for me
---
use X times k caps to trade. You trade your armor for 1-2-3k and I give you the gun for same ammount
---
Could you don't
---
In the scout camp?
---
Go to your challenge menu, scroll down to WORLD, you‚Äôll see all the Tadpole badges you have to earn there.  It‚Äôs tedious AF.
---
You know!
---
Same!! So much fun, and so many cool camps I've seen!
---
This feels like an actual game-changer for creating community and player interaction
---
yea this is not sounding good for us and it sounds like it's only a few of us with the problem which makes me worry it won't get fixed
---
I approve of the reply.
---
I was able to get this done. If you still need help tomorrow I'm down!
---
It‚Äôs 20 caps ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
even better
---
idk i hit 25k a looooong time ago, now i sell leg just to help ppl out. there aren't many good finds tho so rest go to vendor
---
Just got help from another dude thanks tho
---
Speak for yourself I‚Äôm on Xbox &amp; just saw a Nuke keycard for 1500üòÇ I get them for 50
---
I‚Äôve been trying  to tame a cat since a few updates ago!
---
But I think about WoW, and spending $60 on vanilla, then like what, at least $40 on every expansion after that? And $15 a month? What did I spend on that game, damned near $600?
---
Here BGS, have another $20 for atoms. Sure.
---
I played for close to 6 hours today and still haven‚Äôt gotten a backpack. I love it! Gives me a lot to work to
---
You‚Äôre welcome, glad I could help!
---
No problem, thank you
---
Thank you sir, will look for you
---
Short answer: These exams are apart of a "boy scouts" club in order for said "scouts" to get merit badges.
---
See the issue?
---
Thank you! I was wondering why it kept saying that with only a few bullets in it lol
---
How did you get it?
---
Ahhh thank you
---
Alot... read inside the vault to see for yourself it's too much to type lol
---
What exam?
---
Well okay it's not perfect üòÇ
---
I agree, had a hard time doing the hunter exam lol,  failed like 20 times xD
---
Completed 3 of the Tadpole Challenges
---
I only need to do the revive an ally in water one. My psn is WavyNoobSauce

"Dear diary, this one time...at band camp..."
---
My monitor has a built-in crosshair I can enable, works like a charm.
---
That'd be John Henry Eden, of Fallout 3 fame.
---
Another answer: Just because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúboy‚Äù scouts quest in an adult game doesn‚Äôt mean that children should still be playing it.  Bethesda‚Äôs logic for their questions clearly revolves around a player base that isn‚Äôt supposed to involve 10 year olds.
---
Are you on PS4? I think I was here today.
---
It's a scout organization in a universe where everyone smokes like chimneys, drinks like fish and you have a ready supply of chems and firearms.
---
Once you complete the quest it is no longer tagged as a quest item and you can trade or drop it.
---
Hope its not a weekly thing,lets see tomorrow
---
True, all I had to do was take over a workshop in survival because of this.
---
You clearly suffered naught of the days of pre-CAMP permanence
---
Things also may have changed woth todays patch
---
Is it normal that I can build these (cat and deathclaw bushes) even tho I didn‚Äôt purchased them in the atom store?
---
Does the entry allude to MODUS being a ZAX as well? I got the impression that he was, but he was just modified and undertook a different name.
---
Dude a bunch of them have trick questions and shit! Me and my dude had to start googling answers!!!
---
Looks like! I think they were free. I built them too.
---
I'm drowning in gold and all the women are trying to use me for sex.
---
Right beside the scout master Mr handy in a building you can answer exams to get badges I think. Thing is for a camp for kids these things expect you to know some very complicated stuff like what symptom isnt a form of cancer, or how you should tan a deer.
---
Still need help? We can kill two birds with one stone by reviving in water, like OP said. I need to do it as well.
---
hey how do you finish this?  I find the course, start it, run through, but then i fail as there's no button or anything at the end?!?
---
Some of my best CAMP iterations were in that little nook
---
I mean that‚Äôs the first time I saw something horribly overpriced but I mean Jesus bro... 1500 for one nuke keycard is quite a numberüòÇ
---
I find them fun.
---
Best to move on. Imo they caved in giving us a respec of any sort.
---
Multiple chatacters has been this series main replayability factor.
---
try google it works for most of the questions
---
Some of them I dont know whether to answer seriously or choose the "commie" answer
---
I saw the same item for 10 caps clearly it‚Äôs going to take a week for the market to balance
---
I just tried to do that and it said if i dropped it, it would be destroyed and it doesnt let me sell it
---
We have the frog jar recipe, maybe its another thing? Idk just speculating.
---
That happened to me the other day. I thought it was just the visual, but after it wore my health down a bit I paid more attention.
---
Hey man . This patch no fix this issues for me .
---
How about y ? Y found a way to fix this bug ?
---
Yeah sounds good to me. My psn is xxSpace360xx
---
Lmao so far I haven‚Äôt had any of the funny ones be right.
---
Yeah probably, guess i'll wait for them to fix it
---
I mean, you could still turn a profit and undercut the shit outta the vendor.
---
If I had done anything to deserve the ban I'd understand but I was literally playing and doing my quests and the next day I couldn't login.
---
There are no buttons if you are at the right thing. Just follow the quest markers when you reach the last one it finishes the quest. Don't forget to start by hearing the instructions from the intercom.
---
Must have been a change with todays patch :( I have heard unconformed reports of deluxe prosnap bring added to loot tables though have not seen one myself
---
Nice! Was very surprised when I stumbled across them. Maybe they where added to the little potted plants which I bought months ago, bc I didn‚Äôt even purchase a free item in the atom shop today. Hope it isn‚Äôt a bug! lol... a deathclaw garden looks pretty badass to be honest.
---
*being
---
Me too.
---
I have a full set of chess pieces and a bunch of robot models in my stash and I "scrap all" most of the time. I have yet to lose anything placed in my stash before scrapping. And I'm super untrusting of these things so I have a check sheet with all the important bit written on it.
---
Start the game? Check the list.
---
Sell some stuff? Check the list.
---
Scrap?list.
---
There‚Äôs sort of a respec once you hit 50. You are able to take points from one special and move them to a different special each time you level. That‚Äôs probably the best they‚Äôre gonna do at this point.
---
The stuff you sell takes up build budget, not a bug
---
You can actually get that by scrapping any piece of combat armor! Goes for all other colors too.
---
Near the start, there's a post with a button and speaker on it. You press that to start, and then you have to run from flag to flag (they're marked with mission markers) within the time limit.
---
Kids will just Google it. My 10 yo Google's all the time
---
I saw that too lol! Even my Stars we‚Äôre going with it!
---
Military skin
---
feelsbadman
---
I love/hate this
---
I wish this kind of post came with like, a 24 hour ban with a "we're not psychic" as the reason why.  Go watch some fucking youtube playthroughs or just play the game for yourself.
---
Jump off top of my camp,which was on the junk pile,just nw of sunshine industrial farms
---
Yeah it‚Äôs glitched for everyone apparently
---
No fix yet. 
---
I think I'll open a support ticket later this week. 
---
Hopefully it's fixed soon because it's pretty annoying!
---
Talk about asserting dominance, yeesh.
---
Players can control where u spawn when u go to their camp, and I doubt he did it just so you would die, it wqs probably for the view
---
Why? They nerfed Cryo?
---
You do realize the person didn‚Äôt mean kids in real life, but kids in the actual game world who had to take the exams for the organization before the bombs dropped, right?
---
Because it would be abused. That 2% of players who would abuse it with racial and homophobic slurs ruin it for the other 98% of us
---
She has daddy issues.
---
I know, very sad.
---
You'll only see (known) now if you carry a duplicate of a recipe you already consumed.
---
 I was able to when I was rebuilding camp today. I'm not saying you're not having the issue, but it sounds more like a glitch than a conspiracy.
---
I'm with you. 4 people waiting behind me and I'm trying to answer quiz questions. I get 4/5 and after the third try I quit. Am I missing something where I should know this stuff
---
Survival exists. I don't judge people who go there to murder each other. If you're being a sack of shit on adventure, yeah, I'm going to judge you for it.
---
Hey man . After recent patch. Do y still have issues with humming sound audio bugs ?
---
I still have this issues this patch
---
If you still need to swap death/revives let me know
---
*puts away pitchfork*
---
I‚Äôve already placed them. I don‚Äôt cheat, and it‚Äôs not difficult to figure that out by looking at my history. Considering others can do it, I doubt they‚Äôre going to punish those of us who have
---
Didn't know that was a thing
---
yep. Fast traveled and got stuck in the floor today, fast traveled and had to lockpick my way outta the house :(
---
I took everything that was assigned out from my vending machine, and my budget hasn't decreased.
---
My PC cost 1400 and I can safely say ita a fraction of my yearly earnings. You are being disingenuous.
---
I can‚Äôt agree more. When Banthem came out I said fairwell to FO76 as I expected it to be the game that would occupy me for a good long time. Fast forward two weeks later and I was back ‚Äúhome‚Äù farming Whitespring and laughing at all of the loot (it was crap, but each crap drop was a ‚Äúchance‚Äù at a better one). 
---
Thank you to all of the Bethesda employees who have very clearly been working their guts out to bring the game the community has been asking for. Keep it up and I may just never leave again.
---
That‚Äôs not how I read it, but thanks for the clear point of view.  I still stand by what I said.
---
I hear about people doing shit like this on console all. the. time. I'm on PC, personally.
---
Those things can get wiped out too. I went to a vendors earlier, 5 wolves spawned and took out half his building. It sucked.
---
He built on a very small spot on the side of a cliff and built very minimally - it was pretty much guaranteed you would fall and die unless you had power armor on lol
---
Yes everyone go, now, buy atoms! With real money.
---
Thanks for this, the amount of stuff to do was kinda turning me away from it in all honesty since nothing is really marked at ALL and all that.
---
YUP! I leave so many bulked mats in that cash register! I love it. And aid. and (well I used to leave) legendaries... but now I'm going to turn in legendaries for scrip so sorry y'all no more legendaries in the cash register but I'll still leave tons of mats ; )
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a Blues thing. Seems odd singing about West Virginia. Haha
---
Heh, funny thing is I've had a few *since* last patch, but before I was sweet. Never happened while I was in a SBQ fight though, so I didn't worry too much over it. Your experience may differ.
---
Same lol. I think I just crawled back up to 8k
---
Thanks!!!
---
As a long time gatling user, tbh I liked the old way. The iron sights now are big and harder to aim with. We all got used to using the hit markers and shrinking cross hairs to pinpoint and snipe with. Now the clunky iron sights make it harder to aim. I think I'll take them off again and see how I feel.
---
If they changed the iron sight to a open circle sight, or something less view blocking, I'd be happy. As of now, if you have your light on, the iron sight will glow and makes it hard to see anything past it. Maybe add other mods for sights so we cna choose what works for us? But for now, this change... I'll be taking the iron sights off
---
It's exactly what I did, got 500 or so more 5.56 and some shot gun shells. So worth to not farm the mats.
---
Hey I'll hit you up too, I'll be on in a little bit in that case. My PSN is the same as this, Swatguy123456.
---
Oh thats great, Hate pulling out 1 of everything I need from the stash just to track it then put it back in.
---
FYI people don‚Äôt need to wait to use terminals. They can just go up and press it and their Pip-Boy will pop up and display what is on the terminal. 
---
But I‚Äôm with you, the exams are very uninteresting and unengaging.
---
so you're saying its a bug in our favor?
---
Then congrats, I don't, I'm happy you enioy them
---
I've found a few good deals today on PC, still looking for those elusive fashnacht goodies though but I'll keep looking
---
They don‚Äôt get shredded, they are just sleeping.
---
This was in the patch notes...
---
Also interested
---
ya having to spend 15-20 minutes on an exam just guessing is soo bad.
---
Ditto. None of my original fallout friends still play, so I've been a lone wolf since then.
---
I had that only with the Mothman lights. Using the "tactical red"-mod works
---
The weirdest think for me is serums by far! I‚Äôve been having multiple high level players buying 2 and 3 of a kind at 500 caps! And I sold probably 10-15 in a couple hours. It was starting to make me think, what the hell do these people know that I don‚Äôt!? I felt like 500 was what i vendor them for so it was no loss to me. It was fun. Good update
---
The experts who hunt her daily will tell you not to shoot her in the air.  It only postpones her landing.  Seen it work many many times.
---
Yes and no.
---
It's most likely for the view, but there has been plenty of reports of people only spawning at the bottom of player's bases. All a player has to do is build their base on the edge of a mountain and they could earn some easy junk.
---
No idea if this got knows about this issue, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's why he built his base there.
---
Awesome, thanks so much!
---
who's been a naughty gnome?
---
It‚Äôs not obvious but that marker is bugged sometimes. The elevator lets you out just below one of the possible dishes it there is another just 50 meters or so north of the elevator. It‚Äôs down some stairs a lever or two at the corner or a lower roof. The market may still show the space by the elevator but when you approach this dish you‚Äôll be able to activate it.
---
also for anyone wanting to do it the intercom to start it is on the broken dock between the 2 red gasoline things
---
i spent over 15 minutes looking all over cause it blended right in and there was no pioneer sign like there was for other things
---
They are also Americanised as well and us measure system even google can‚Äôt answer some of them, designed by smart arse devs
---
YES!!! Today's patch sounds phenomenal!!! I can't wait to get home and play.
---
so if you have a lot of items for sale that total over 25k you'll lose the caps over that amount so the buyer still gets the item, but you don't get the caps for that item if you've already hit 25k.  That's losing caps imo.  You have to be very careful to move your caps to another character or spend some so that you don't lose.
---
In terms of function, MODUS was meant to manage the bunker and cater to needs and thus be more "human" from start. He's also never referred to as a ZAX, and obviously the conversation with Eden has them differentiated as MODUS and ZAX.
---
However, it's entirely possible we'll end up with MODUS being the "villian" of Nuclear Winter given we genuinely don't know much about it so far.
---
No you can't inspect.  I've tried at several different camps.
---
Thanks for clarifying! I‚Äôll take the unspoiled cans over that anyway
---
Yea I had problems all day!
---
They usually go for 2k on the Market sub.
---
go to camp adams at night
---
i got stuck under someones house just a bit ago had to travel out
---
Go read the poster at a train station...or get poster from atom shop for free under CAMP
---
I server hopped to play with some friends and the items I listed for sale where no longer listed.  I had to go back to my CAMP and put the items back up for sale.
---
Nah I‚Äôm talking about the event! Thanks tho
---
Lmao you actually got downvoted for that pun üòÇ
---
Awesome! Thank you
---
Oh yeah.  You on?
---
Same here. PC as well. I'm also missing on-screen button prompts when I enter build or modify mode at my camp. I'm guessing it's related.
---
They don't think only dupers got banned.
---
Beth plainly stated ages ago that benefiting from a duper is a ban too.
---
And playing stupid isn't good enough. Simple common sense prevails.
---
The heptaphile challenge ge seems to be broken for me. Crafted the frog habitat 6 times and it never counted it.
---
So they are there intentional. I still thought that in my case it was supposed to be a normal protection that through some Bethesda magic spawned as a vendor....
---
none atm
---
If you do not know the answer it is always (c)..... that is how i got though Med school..... NOW what did I do with that scalpel????
---
I think the coolest one I've seen, the guy built his camp around one of the monorail frames. Like it was floating up there, and the ring was the main focus of the building inside. Best thing was that the fast travel dropped you off inside and there were no windows, so once you made it to the top and jumped down you saw just how cool the build was.
---
The tax should go towards free fast travel to the camp stores cause any profit you make will be spent on fast travel fees
---
I completely agree with this - they‚Äôre great player hubs. I ran into a lvl 4 today who needed ammo - it was so much easier for him to find help now we have a network.
---
I'm very unaware of this issue. What was the deal with these items? What did they do? Why were they op?
---
Probably why they still haven't released the Welcome Mat feature?
---
Because some players would make you spawn in some kind of death trap chamber with no way to escape?
---
Daddy-o issues...
---
Can‚Äôt wait to hear what noobmaster69 has to say.
---
Have an upvote from a pve carebear. Guess you'll have to skulk around my claimed workshops and bum rush me when I show up to collect.
---
Happy hunting, buddy! Bet I can disconnect before I drop my junk.
---
I saved a bunch of legendaries... and discovered it was apparently limited scrip per day. Gonna take forever to unload. I might leave a few solid one stars about or something, the kind that are great for when you hit 50 even if they arn't BIS.
---
Still haven't fixed the trophy for reaching level 100 on PS4 I see.
---
OK seeing those headlamp mods, I'm even more convinced that they just don't exist for Excavator.
---
PSA
---
I finally got this at the imposter sheepsquatch event
---
NICE ! I guess you know, post apocolypse it's hard to find someone to change light bulbs
---
i need a buddy to die in water so i can revive. lol
---
Ive seen a bunch on ps4
---
Atom shop
---
If I understood correctly, you can earn mods to rise it higher.
---
I got it too...in adventure mode.
---
I haven't seen any Flux at vendors yet, but apparently people are selling it. You may wanna check out the market though. Someone is always selling Flux on there
---
It hasn‚Äôt come out quite yet actually. It‚Äôs supposed to be like a vending machine where you can put anything in there and set how many caps it cost. It‚Äôs not supposed to be able to be looted or destroyed. Also putting it down will make your camp visible on the map! It shows what you have for sale and for how much.
---
Edit. 40 scrips sorry fat fingered that one
---
You need to work on your English comprehension. It‚Äôs pretty simple.
---
I sell them 4-5k and bought mine for the same. You can attempt to farm it but it takes a lot of patience and a bunch of luck!!!
---
I didn't see it there.
---
OH I didn't notice the scrip is limited but of course it is. I didnt' even remember the scrip machine until almost done playing this evening...that's how immersive and intensive the Pioneer Scouts Quest is lol. Still haven't got a backpack, it's taking some time and that's awesome. 
---
Well if you can only get a certain amount of scrip per day I'll still be leaving legendaries in the cash register then. It's back on boys
---
Yep it was removed during one of the "Spring Cleaning" events.
---
To be honest, I believe Graham and Moo Moo enjoy traveling. Probably why they became traveling merchants.
---
No kidding. Good to know
---
The mammal one wasn't too bad
---
oh okay! can you tell me where i find that in the camp build thing?
---
Stash&gt;junk tab&gt;scroll to junk&gt;scroll the quantity bar down enough to grab it&gt;drag it to low number&gt;open pip boy&gt;scroll to junk tab&gt;hit component view&gt;tag for search. They just cut out all but the last 4. Epic.
---
Must be gone out of the shop then, I cant check since I have it so itll show up for me still
---
mine glow, granted not the red i wanted because x-01 bright is just too damn good
---
In your CAMP build menu, there is now a new tab called "Vending" (somewhere near the right side). From there you can build the vending machine. You can build up to 4 of them, and each will have its own inventory of up to 30 items/stacks (so 120 total with 4 machines). They take up 3 power each to get working. Once you have it, you can deposit things into the machine to sell them (it will ask you to give a price) or you can assign a price straight from your stash. Items in the vending machine take up stash space until they are sold
---
I didn't get a harumph out of that guy!
---
It hasn‚Äôt come out yet you‚Äôll have to wait till the next update. I think they‚Äôll add a new category when it does come out
---
It would be cool if someone can join me and place it in my camp I would love that
---
Giggity Giggity goo, OH!
---
Where do you take the exams? I did all the stuff for athlete and now it's saying to pass the athelete knowledge exam
---
yup! id place it down incase it was an oopsie by beth!
---
Some of the challenges are just outright grindy, but yeah there is so much stuff to do that it will keep us busy for a long time
---
That's a cool pic!
---
I mean downvoting doesn‚Äôt make it not true? I was literally inspecting them today so we‚Äôre three of my friends. It‚Äôs a bug.
---
Same ! Maybe these r little gift from Bethesda .
---
I read the patchnotes but was unsure of how the turrets reacted to a bounty, maybe i read through them to fast but tested it out regardless and figured it may be of help to others with similar questions. But thanks for your response.
---
Lol. Not me but funny!
---
It is a game....and there are lots of kids....and people just having fun.....don‚Äôt be a nazi
---
If anyone is looking to do the archery course, its on the far right of the camp from the fast travel spawn
---
There should be crossbow plans on the table next to the cabin there, if they're not there just server hop a couple times and you'll find em
---
And the medic one requires a stimpak diffuser which apparently isn't in the game yet. Something tells me they didn't want people to blow through these too quickly
---
Same situation, I've been overencumbered since level 15. I don't quite have free stash space yet but I'm getting there, already sold off a good few legendary weapons and probably about 50 plans today
---
It‚Äôs going to make it so I can‚Äôt server hop as frequently. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll cope
---
Just in to mention A few of my friends and I have the same issue on Xbox. We‚Äôve completed miner miracles but the ability to craft excavator armor has disappeared.
---
I felt my time on Market76 helped me see what items would be in demand.  I priced my stuff below where I would ask on Market76, and it moved well.  The fun part was seeing stuff priced way too low, and scarfing that up for scrip or resells.
---
There‚Äôs a computer in the building beside the robot at the Scout Camp.  They‚Äôre all on there!
---
Sweet thanks as I also lock up my things and wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to put up my vending machine because I was afraid ppl would just come and unlock something of mine and start pvp and destroying my camp. I was wondering if anybody attack my turrets and missle launchers would they become hostile to me and be able to destroy my camp?
---
Agree. Even if it isn't meant to be a top tier weapon it's broken.
---
Pc?
---
If you still need that water revive thing - add me (I also need it, so help me out) gilmour345
---
Lol yeah, i had to buy stuff just to free up caps space
---
How do you take the exams? I've did everything for 1 but now it's saying to pass the exam
---
They‚Äôre in pioneer camp
---
bethesda is a multi **billion** dollar company. it doesn't need you to defend it, and they already have more than enough money to do shit, they just want to keep the shareholders (who don't give a single fuck about you or the game quality) happy
---
How did you get that overweight on your multiple charactersü§®
---
well I have 2 pieces of 50% fall damage armor so I would be fine as well :)
---
Yo I gotchu fam, hit me uppppp
---
My ID is Liddykins
---
Its not back, ive seen it happen to pc players mostly, did you update your ini files and mods after patch?
---
Anybody else need a buddy to revive with? TrinkleTrain812 PS4
---
I repaired my buzzblade to 200% today and the damage didn't go up. Did they fix this "feature"?
---
Ignore is the same as this :)
---
Agreed.  I tried crafting a Frog Habitat, and the challenge (Herpetologist) didn‚Äôt reflect that I‚Äôd done it.  On the plus side, I now have a live frog in a jar in my C.A.M.P.
---
They are in game in the Possum Scouts dispenser. You buy the plans with those reward badges.
---
Lead Lined
---
Armored
---
Refrigerated 
---
Insulated 
---
High Capacity
---
Yo
---
It came out today actually. The camps with vending machines working now have their own icons on the map that everyone can see.
---
I downloaded the free trial of Anthem and really liked it. However, I was still into Fallout so figured I‚Äôd hold off on buying it. So glad I did after reading a lot of bad feedback and then reading that it‚Äôs not being supported any longer. I uninstalled it from my Xbox tonight actually. 
---
And I agree, huge thanks to Bethesda!  They did a wonderful job with this patch. I had one issue where my weight was really wonky. I was almost encumbered but didn‚Äôt have anything on me that I don‚Äôt normally have. I checked, double checked, triple checked my perks and just couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on. Then I came on here to see if anyone else was having the same issue...no one was. So I un equipped all of my perk cards and re equipped them and it solved the problem. I don‚Äôt know what happened, but it‚Äôs fine now. It‚Äôs completely possible that I missed something, but I don‚Äôt think so. I think it was some kind of glitch, but it‚Äôs all good now.
---
Those are mods for the bag.
---
This has been out since the morning..
---
For the revive part I was able to get it during the encrypted event, by just stimpacking strangers in need. There's a pond there which is very convenient.
---
Really? So you don‚Äôt hoard in this game?üòæ
---
The hat is hiding all the really naughty bits
---
Definitely needs a bunch of mods and damage needs to be better.
---
I bought a mic specifically for this game but I have no interest in partying up for anything.
---
you can't drop them, only destroy
---
I'm pretty sure these game devs have no idea what they are doing when it comes to economy balancing, they are just pretending they have a clue.
---
Swag, added you, I need to revive you just in general, I don't have the water requirements lol
---
Okay I noticed I'm always thristy and I do have speed demon, but I also have Class Freak and water consumption went up by 2x for sure.  Food seems faster too,but it seems food 1.5x faster depletion, water is easy 2 x.  Since your'e not running Speed Demon... Might be all around.
---
I feel the same my camp is in the middle of nowhere on a lead node i have only had it fail to place once since I put it there. One of my old sites it was every second server
---
How did you get these to begin?  I can't seem to figure it out
---
I usually kill my brahmin outside of Flatwoods for their meat.
---
It's just rude to do that in someone's camp.
---
Yeah the Backpack costs 3 badges
---
and the mods are 5 badges except refrig &amp; high capacity which are 8 badges
---
Haven't seen a scavenging station around tho
---
I can't find the camp again
---
As a non STR character this is still like a third of my current carry weight
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre running into this. If you were on Xbox I‚Äôd gladly help you out.  I‚Äôve had a lot of low levels just send me messages asking for help, so you could try messaging players on your server. If you don‚Äôt get a response, try another server. There are so many great people that play this game that you‚Äôll find someone.
---
Np, pre update i saw a post wondering if greifers could exploit this new system so i figured i could test it out. Just glad it could help out other players. Have fun in the wasteland!
---
Explain how that isn't a problem that ties in directly with voice chat? if you say mute my response is mute the players text, hell I wouldn't even mind if text was proximity.
---
Boohoo you can‚Äôt steal everyone‚Äôs caps :-( I feel so bad.. seriously tho I think you can enjoy pvp without robbing people of their caps lmfao. You already get their AID items &amp; all their junk. Now you want to take their wallets too.
---
Also, fine, perma-ban me. If my crimes are so offensive, than ban me for life. 
---
This stupid limbo crap has got to go.
---
There's a crossbow that spawns on the West side of the palace of the winding path. It's low level, but was easy to damage and repair.
---
Not to mention the times I've traded (mostly with my daughter), the interface seemed to me to be a bit clunky.
---
Letting us bulk ammo would fix this. Say putting them in an ammo can of 500. Sell the can for 250 caps.
---
Pioneer Scout Camp where you started the mission lol.
---
Lots of exploration and grinding. Really fun to do with others
---
I can (almost) guarantee it wasn't my brother, but as soon as he saw he could fast travel to a camp that was selling stuff he started plotting how to trap people, including scouting cliffs with deathclaws at the bottom.
---
He's playing a cannibal raider style character though so it totally fits.
---
Assuming the fast travel is like normal camp fast traveling (based on the CAMP device location supposedly), it can probably be manipulated pretty easily.
---
They fixed SiN and made Class Freak effect it and Grounded
---
I just asked how you got so overweight? I know a lot of people who ‚Äúhoarded‚Äù &amp; got banned for the actual reason: duping
---
It‚Äôs written like shit, are you kidding me? Every other word is the wrong form of itself
---
I'm a dummy lol I was looking in the wrong spot, thanks!
---
great find
---
I thought it was just me
---
Considering it only take 10 mins to finish the event, its worth it to me not to spend those materials on generators. Plus it benefits the other camps with a power box.  Like if I take Monongah and the munitions factory.
---
It didn't count for me either (xbox)
---
No doubt. Spawned under a floating camp today. Too annoyed to look for the machine I just left.
---
It's under challenges, world towards the bottom. Can look through older posts for help completing each one.
---
I took a picture with my first customer today! Lol
---
They moved one vendor from each faction into the whitespring resort a while back but they were just kind of awkwardly crammed in. Now with the new update they have their own space
---
I don't pvp on pvp severs I said this in my rant
---
Asking for gamers to use common sense is not being a nazi. 
---
Stupid ppl win stupid prizes, plain and simple.
---
Your friends knew exactly what they were doing and they got exactly what they deserved.
---
oh ok i though you had to take the exams and those suck
---
I wanna up vote but its sorta down.
---
Yeah I'm talking about different things. They are not in the game yet.
---
Always good for business to get foot traffic. I will have to have some low level items for sale just for that reason.
---
Update: yup, had Stash space issues. Couldn‚Äôt directly list anything from my Stash without first taking it into my inventory. Annoying, but god, loads batter than it first appeared. Thank you for having brought that to my attention :)
---
It's really nice to discover these camps and finally meet people.
---
That's a part of completing them. One thing to note is under the medic one I haven't seen any answers to what a stimpack diffuser is so it may not be in the game.
---
LOVE this! I plastered a wall with these, but this just looks made for them.
---
I‚Äôve done it and it works...it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve found the imposter a few times üòÅ
---
What on earth are you talking about? The vending machines have been out since this morning..
---
If you don‚Äôt pvp on pvp servers you‚Äôre a griefer lmao
---
It's not the rope course. Go to the bridge and you'll see some new equipment to start the course. There's a lot of weaving and bobbing, bit you basically just run across.
---
Is English your first language?  
---
This guy helped me do both the archer and the swimming test, because I *read the post*.
---
Bully? Go play survival where everyone has duped tse and sentinel cavalier gear dude. At least in adventure its a fair fight as far as gear goes 8/10 times
---
Someone needs to educate you on the meaning of the word ‚Äúliterally‚Äù. There are still reasons to pvp.
---
‚Ä¢ Fun
---
‚Ä¢ Caps
---
‚Ä¢ Meds and junk
---
Luckily they just got nerfed
---
I thought the worst I had was getting stuck in a wall.
---
Clarksburg ammo store I just server hopped 3 times there
---
Meh, it isn't nearly as groundbreakingly life changing as the TSE nerf.
---
And thus you should spend that at peoples camp vendors to help other players and find good loot.
---
Got me some sweet stuff so far
---
Really? Not even like the base paints for FO4 like the military paint? I know you can get it for the XO1
---
Go to the pioneer scout camp at night
---
There were a bunch of funny ones. Those tests suck though!!!
---
Not for me, pretty sure it's bugged
---
So did I. I‚Äôm pretty sure doing it was a lot easier than trying to understand whatever the hell this post was trying to say.
---
Afaik you only need to power one. The power is just for making your camp visible on the map, even unpowered vending machines can (and will) sell their items
---
I'm saving this post so when I have popcorn, I can get a little salt for it.
---
It‚Äôs a great way to support the continuation of fallout 76! Was it for the new power armor skin?
---
It was never for farming caps from noobs. If that was your only interest, you've been doing it wrong.
---
Hmmm i thought it was just me. I felt like i was constantly thirsty as well. I was online for maybe an hour at most and had to down at least a dozen nuka colas if not more.
---
Me too...
---
&gt; there is cabin with molo, on molo is talking device, first you need swiming suit, if you don‚Äôt have, turt around and on right side of cabin are toilets inside of them is swiming suit, get it on, use talking device and now jump in lake, use 5 red things and go back on molo.
---
Lol wtf does this even mean? If you‚Äôre going to write out a tutorial at least do it so I don‚Äôt have to decipher each and every sentence. Doing it myself was easier than reading this shitpost
---
Good man
---
Sounds like you just sneak around and murder people for caps. Have to admit that I won't cry myself to sleep tonight knowing the patch ruined your fun.
---
I think you missed his point. That would still be in existence.
---
If you have any level of English comprehension you would be able to see where I‚Äôm coming from, unless you‚Äôre just as illiterate as OP..
---
The Charleston marathon answer is 26 miles..? Have you never ran or read about a marathon? A full marathon is 26 miles
---
 I‚Äôm on a cliff across from the Top of the World &amp; Pleasant Valley Station. I had to move my C.A.M.P. To the other side of my house as people would fall off the cliff when they fast traveled in. Now that I moved that they spawn right next to my house. Though one of my teammates got stuck in my foundation tonight.
---
&gt;None atm
---
Sorry; used to the usual sniping. I farmed nothing but workshops till lvl 100; had a bunch of stuff. My biggest crime (according to the email) was swapping nukas between characters (apparently, they can only see [or at least used to] what you drop or trade).
---
There's archery in the game now??
---
Two things. I read this in the narration of a drunk Russian pilot and we really shouldn't have to jump through all this bullshit just to get a backpack ffs.
---
Can't place atom shop items at other people's camps.
---
Oh my god YES
---
Camp Adam's at night
---
And thank you; support was far from expected.
---
I have what info do you need?
---
I haven't really felt an uptick in thirst.... Usually after every big patch like this people tent to think they are more thirsty, food spoils faster and things like that. I think it's just because they're playing longer than usual exploring the new content and time starts getting away from them. It feels like the rate has increased when in reality it's just the extra time they've put in.
---
See my edit: I'm dum. I has parasites and didn't notice.
---
I've gotten so used to having diseases that don't really do anything bad I forget to check, and I don't pay attention to the "You have contracted. . ." messages. The only time I really worry is if I have something which gives me increased radiation damage in a nuke zone.
---
I think i have been to your camp, The first one I went to had this issue...
---
Why are you trolling?
---
Go to the lake, youll find a pier to your left. Go to it. Grab a swimsuit from the porta potty and put it on. Then youll see something that looks like an intercom so talk to it. Im assuming thats your question if its not then sorry
---
Oh yeaaaaa I totally forgotten already
---
Are we able to build pyramid camps again? Tried it but can‚Äôt figure out how...
---
I'll buy 1* legendaries all day long
---
All of the pip boy games for 100 caps each!
---
Thanks for taking the time to tell me
---
You go to vending in build menu. You place. You stock. I buy from you. You buy from me. Yes?
---
Hes the reason I made my camp there lol, built a house above the coffee shop and I love it.
---
If only bethesda gave it some mods like sights, then id probably lug one around for the survival aspect.
---
I can say it‚Äôs written like someone whose first language maybe isn‚Äôt English.  
---
I don‚Äôt have to say it‚Äôs written like shit, because I‚Äôm not an elitist twat. 
---
But if English is your first language you should have no problem understanding the post. Git gud. 
---
That means ‚Äòget good‚Äô, you short horse.
---
You will have 500+ DR without any perks, jetpack, calibrated shocks and rad immunity (almost)
---
Your tantrum makes me happy.
---
What would be colder is if some stranger killed your brahmin ,  cooked it up , then left it in a little baggie on your bed with a napkin, fork and knife included in the bag.
---
YES! I recorded it too I don‚Äôt think that was in the game before.
---
Two shot explosive lever action, 10k. It's rare for someone to let a weapon like that go for caps.
---
Just forget it you milk drinkers can hide away in your invincible camps vending your trash for way more than its worth but one day you'll log into a pvp server and ill grief you all like the big bad griefer I am
---
I looked around tonight hoping the headlamp plans and military paint plans were added for the full range of T-series but I couldn't locate them. One day they'll add them. I have faith. T45 gets no (free) love yet...
---
I‚Äôve ran into two today! I felt bad and put him out of his misery
---
It keeps failing me is it bugged?
---
Eh, I've got aquaboy equipped.  üòâ
---
Is it out in the atom shop rn?
---
I rezzed someone with a stim during the encryptid event and it didn‚Äôt count
---
Yep, I noticed it, another sneak tweak.
---
No rn but probably in the future
---
Awesome thank you I actually bought the plans from a vendor cause I was gearing up to do it and realized I didn‚Äôt have one or could craft one.
---
I think the workshop pvp thing might be a problem cause I remember a lot of people at the ammunition plant just blocking the doors with barricades and now they can‚Äôt be broken resulting in an uncapturable workshop
---
Gotta Agree.
---
Put up a Vending Machine not knowing what to expect.  Spent the evening fast traveling to about 40 camps (server hopped to have a look see).  Paid for all the hopping with sales, bought some food and drink along the way .... cost me nothing .... gave me a lot of joy.
---
Cleared Out about 50 lbs from my stash (including the scrapping of Legendaries ...accidentally started with the light stuff, not looking closely for the limit).
---
Game is getting good.
---
Yes I saw it today! "Why sheep. Why sheep" were his last words
---
Right!?
---
Nice try Bethesda.
---
On spawn, there should be a large building to your right. Past that is the archery range.
---
My thoughts bloody exactly
---
Does americans not have marathons of varying lengths? We sure do where I live!
---
According to one of charlestons own websites its 13,1 miles, but that option doesnt even appear on the terminal...
---
I had that earlier. I just scrapped a couple of things in my camp and it's been working fine ever since. I also rebooted the game before I did that so, so I don't know if it was one or the other or a combination of both.
---
Game changer! I didn‚Äôt know you can have more than one with different inventory.
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
I‚Äôm just glad I held out on bos plans people were selling them for 4 and 5 k . Bought mine today at the grafton vendor for 90 caps. I‚Äôve been walking around with a polymer leg for months but the patience paid off.
---
Check the spa :)
---
I need one too I‚Äôm on rn but only for a bit then I won‚Äôt be on til tomorrow night sadly :(
---
Heck yeah congrats
---
No every time i gwt to the 4th or 3rd marker it fails me
---
Bye Felicia
---
How's this work? seems you dont have a mic
---
3. * weapon with decent perks for 200 going to become scrip tho lol
---
Then you‚Äôll be just fine in this big scary world of diversity. Have a nice life short horse.
---
the whitesprings station bot says serve and protect instead of protect and serve because he is a bartender and i think this is a really cute thing
---
so there's at least one bot that says serve and protect...
---
My stash has cleared up, kudos to the people buying my garbage
---
Stop it. I‚Äôm going to bust a gut.
---
My luck is 7 with my arm piece added and in the past month or two have gotten probably 3 of the BOS T-60 paints. It really just strokes of luck.
---
They didn‚Äôt forget. It was explicitly stated in the patch notes.
---
I‚Äôm not scared of diversity, I just think if you‚Äôre going to type up a post you shouldn‚Äôt do it like a 3rd grader
---
That mechanic was announced. Sounded a bit odd to me at the time. Sorry to hear it is exactly so in practice.
---
Had this happen a few days ago too. I  watched the guy trying for a while in the blast zone. His buddy tried to get in on it too. Finally it was bothering me enough to turn around and kill him. his bag had enough In it too and, whatever it didnt have, his buddys did. Thanks guys!
---
The icing on the cake is they want us to use the camera but I have had zero luck in finding it.  Have literally spent all day trying to get this shit done
---
Have you switched around perks? Do a bulk load of gun repairs or such. I know I tend to go to make ammo only to have to swap in ammosmith perk to make the quantities I was expecting to make.
---
Bloodied SS bat: 20 caps.
---
I dunno, maybe start an online petition to show the crossbow some love. Its actually really good tbh
---
Finally got it....and I hated it lol Ended up trading the whole tse cmbt rifle for something with more punch... TSE LMG
---
Thanks for keeping me in mind. That was solid.
---
That‚Äôs a half marathon then
---
Just google ‚Äúmarathon length‚Äù and it will tell you 26.219 miles on the top. It‚Äôs not that tough man.
---
Even better. You can farm fusion cores from the sentry bots at the white spring. If you're quick to loot you can get one before and after they explode.
---
Finally found out it's bugged. Friend got camp venture, went with him and got it complete.
---
that should help thanks
---
That just means your stash is full.
---
Everyone I play with has played since launch and we‚Äôve never heard of it until today
---
You're the best
---
Noice!
---
Also it's been that way since the beginning in regards to getting caps when you've hit max
---
I lost somewhere around a thousand caps, somebody bought a whole ton of plans and topped it off with my 3* bloodied handmade. Pushed me up to max and I'm pretty sure it would have been more. On the bright side, I spent all those caps getting x-01 mod plans
---
it's not letting me revive you some reason
---
Aae gatling gun lvl 50 - 2000 caps.. probably could go for 20k
---
I kinda liked the learning aspect of a lot of them. I had to wiki stuff I had no idea about.
---
Also, it had a lot of good Fallout humor.
---
Still bugged for me:( just did it a bit ago
---
Aw man well thanks!
---
Grafton train station, like 90ish caps each
---
I was thinking the same thing tonight. I felt like this is what Bethesda wanted us doing all along. People know where your camp is, and they have a reason to visit. Some guy bought stuff at my wife's camp, and we all took a selfie with our first customer.
---
I'm starting to love this game.
---
Thank u/mistiqe actually. They have a post on getting the badges that helped me initially.
---
I just don‚Äôt know how to share that on mobile.
---
Grafton train station bud
---
he start is on top of the east end of the bridge.
---
It's beautiful isn't it? 300 pounds free storage space and with the backpacks after months of living in power armor I can finally sprint out of it.
---
I think the issue is the spawn point for guests is different then the spawn for yourself, so there isn‚Äôt really a good way to know where they will come in until you just sit there and watch for it. 
---
I had to move a corner of my base to prevent people being stuck in the foundations, and the vending shack I made ended up being on the wrong side of my camp pointing the wrong way.
---
Loaded up my Vendor Machines with thousands of rounds of shotgun ammo, 5.56, .50, .308, .38, the works ... all priced at 1c each. It has all been selling like *gangbusters*, netting me 2000+ caps in the first 4 hours of gameplay.
---
No problems here selling ammo.
---
Today was the first time I‚Äôd used it. It was pretty fun. Like you said. Needs more mods. I‚Äôm not even sure there are any
---
I think so, i played with my buddy earlier and that was first thing he noticed since he uses gatlin. But i don't recall reading it patch notes though.
---
This thread is pure comedy.
---
Hyped for the plague doctor mask
---
yes.
---
The exams are the least of your worries - there's some of the badge challenges that don't work properly/don't give credit.
---
As in:  you can build a frog habitat, but that doesn't count as crafting it.  GG Herpetologist.
---
But wait, in Possum Rank, the first thing I've tried is "Possum: Miner" which has a sub-objective of signing in to somewhere at Garrahan Mining HQ.  So I went there, went through every terminal, opened every door, even grabbed my Excavator armor to tap the button to "register excavator armor", but no credit.
---
So yeah --
---
Don't worry about the exams so much as the damn challenges working right.
---
Counts as a stash so I think so
---
this dude genuinely confused me. maybe they didn‚Äôt know?
---
A bit but the gun now takes up half ur screen when aiming lol
---
You say, with zero proof.
---
That would've been nice to know, thank you. Because sure enough, charlstons own site just wrote that off as their marathon.
---
This would be awesome, between getting stuck in walls and locked rooms that would help out so much.
---
But you don't play on pvp servers. You said so.
---
I‚Äôm stuck at this part exactly. What did OP mean?
---
You're officially old congratulations.
---
Seriously I ended up inside of no less than six solid objects today.
---
It wasn't nerfed. They fixed a bug in which it was doing 2x damage instead of the 20% damage the legendary effect was intended to do. It was never supposed to be that powerful
---
Exactly this. Every single small update. "Is X/Y different??? Stealth patch!!11!!
---
Archer, Hunter and Athletics
---
Don't bother with anything else as some are bugged or missing components to the badge itself.
---
The above mentioned takes about 3 hours through and through.
---
Is the power armour your trying to put it on originally X-01?
---
Darn. :(
---
It feels like they shouldn't, but it would be exploitable if that was the case.
---
I‚Äôve got a camp spot towards the northern section of the white spring built off of a pre existing building and for whatever reason people spawn in my bathroom.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it‚Äôs kinda funny actually.
---
But in like terms of damage? An explosive damage with 200 damage goes to 120, is that right
---
Yeah, I'll give it a try. As it is, if I end up with too much food while out adventuring I usually go find a new player and leave it for them. Just figured if I could toss it in my shop for 1c each or something, it would save me the trouble of tracking a newbie across the wasteland and I can spend more time adventuring. 
---
Either way I'm very excited for the new updates!
---
I read something on the personal terminal that gave me a misc quest to search for some machinery. It was really strange and when I went to the marker there was nothing there
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
I'm to the point I can take the athletes exam and can't even pass it cause it asks really specific questions that I can't find on Google. Why do they keep giving us new content that is so frustrating to do
---
its where i was exiled to after this post
---
None i know aside from the prime mod.
---
I will be impressed when they update again and dont revert half these changes by accident.
---
Fuck this exams.Already 30 minutes wasted trying to do the athletic exam.I know shit about athletis,so this all fucking time i have been in the damn internet trying to answer this bullshit.And some answers are not that easy to google you may even have to read wiki articles.This fucking sucks.BGS you guys are bullies
---
Hey if you‚Äôre still on I could use help with that one. I‚Äôm just sitting at the main menu right now so if you‚Äôre free for a quick few minutes I can hop in and invite you

4 bloodied weapons for 1k each.

---
Where I live we got multiple routes, and we just call them marathons, and thus I assumed Americans did the same, my mistake, I guess?
---
Doesnt help that when one googles Charleston Charity Marathon one of the lists appear with 13,1, when that, as the guy states below, is considered a half marathon.
---
Some of the badges can‚Äôt be completed
---
95% of my trading interactions on Xbox are just someone else wanting to see what all you‚Äôre carrying.
---
Yeah I can hop on real quick what's your gamertag?
---
I got disconnected while someone was at my camp.  I hope he was done.
---
Worth it? Worth it.
---
I don't why you're being downvoted, you're completely right, ZeniMax Online Studios developed it, Bethesda published it
---
idk why the heck there's a tax anyways...it's in game currency...not like Bethesda is profiting any off of this. I really don't get it.
---
Is there any way they can bring back the animals no longer able to be tamed? All the good creatures were taken away, i literally JUST got 15 charisma to tame a deathclaw. This would be very useful in survival. Kinda makes those pacify perks worthless. I don‚Äôt want to tame a dog with 15 charisma
---
Combined with goat leg 2 you can achieve reentry from space
---
Flik Triplez, loading in right now
---
Have y'all noticed that some songs don't play anymore?
---
It's doing the dmg listed on the weapon card, which didn't change... The bug fix now prevents it from occasionally doing double dmg, which you never saw reflected on the dmg output when viewing the weapon anyway
---

Fallout 76 going the No Man's Sky path to success confirmed.
---
The turrets not attacking bountied players was in the section concerning Workshop PVP, but the same principle applies to camps. Did you try shooting the turrets after to see if you could aggro them?
---
that took too much work but we did it. thanks
---
Sorry if this is an unwanted spoiler, but you can take the tests via computer inside a cabin where you get the first tadpole quests. I think they didn‚Äôt do a quest marker for it because it‚Äôs literally right there.
---
Hey, you can still earn a buttload of caps pvp'ing. You just got to WORK for it now. I'm assuming you're a millennial by the tone of that whole whine, so it might be a shock that you have to do the hard yards now. You could wait and see what the next OP setup will be, but you really sound like the type that flat out quits on games that aren't giving you the level of pleasure you want anymore. So, in case I'm correct, can I have your stuff when you go?  üòÜ
---
I can join you

IGN: Demorgoth

I‚Äôm confused with the exams in general, I‚Äôve gotten 5/5 on swimming and medic but nothing happens. Do I just do all the tests hoping that it‚Äôs actually keeping track?
---
Lmaooo that sucks
---
[Salute to the commie national anthem]
---
Ah shoot. Thanks! I forgot about them cause of all the new stuff.
---
add me PSN: Shaun_Walker
---
It does, yes
---
I don't know what the base dmg is. But sure, if base is 100dmg. Then your example would be accurate. Bug would double it (200dmg), now that it's fixed, it's only 20%, so 120dmg.... i want to say the base dmg is a bit higher though, 120 sounds a bit low unless you don't have any mods on that shotgun.
---
well you are going to struggle even more when you get to do the exams. Unless you know a lot about each topic you will spend lots of times on the internet.I cant even find some of the answers on the net.This fucking suxs
---
I've gone done a few and nothing has happened as of yet
---
Ok cool
---
Oh snap I bet you bought my gauss rifle, it can't be a coincidence lol.
---
Thanks chief
---
Meaning what? Like...the frame? Did the frame spawn as x-01 what are you asking
---
I think they used more common sense than Bethesda did, they did drop the items after. Bethesda was to heaven handed, and players like yiourself, well ....are just the type who feel better from others difficulties. Hopefully Bethesda will have at least the professionalism to resolve the issue to their paying customers.
---
I get it man. At the least it qualifies as a trick question which can mislead you into thinking its specifically about Charleston
---
Enjoy my heated unaware rant, lol.
---
Ok I'm joining

i got a 3* explosive hunting rifle earlier for 5k. score!

The power armour pieces are they X-01 or did the skin just make them look like X-01?

Not everyone is a native English speaker. I had to read it twice myself, but glad OP posted anyhow. Why not appreciate the OP‚Äôs effort and attempt to help? Take my upvote Colonel.

Camp Adams to be exact
---
Dope, my camps right below palace of the winding path
---
Train stations
---
nope, yes im on pc.
---
Wow, that's pretty cheap. Finally!
---
Lol your at my camp spot spawned next to you
---
We've had the respec option for ages now..
---
Then its exactly that.
---
Lot of opinions on this and this question gets asked multiple times a day in different forms, I say yes but scroll back through and read some opinions and decide.
---
I had to do a frustrating set of hand signs at the scout village, eventually I just consumed radiated food until I died in front of people till someone caught on.
---
This game is amazing.
---
God damn it it‚Äôs amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to get back home and play. You‚Äôre amazing too for posting this !
---
Maybe that's not a good example, but I've got one:
---
"Samuel is an athlete who spends lots of time running and jumping everywhere he goes. If he had a super power, he'd want to jump as far as a flea! How far would that be?"
---
Now yeah, after some thought, I assume they mean he would want to jump as far as a flea *relative to his own size*. Because the answers are
---
A.) The length of a car
---
B.) The length of a football field
---
C.) 10 city blocks
---
D.) From Charleston to Welch
---
But like that's not how the question is worded. If he were to "jump as far as a flea", that's like...a foot.
---
On top of that, I'm not sure answers are registering correctly, because I had to go back through the exams a couple times to find that question again, and despite getting every answer right, it told me three times that I only got 4 out of 5.
---
So like maybe the Charleston Marathon wasn't a good example but this exam thing is definitely kinda fucked.
---
Why do people come here and ask that? Seriously, this is the subreddit for the game... Do you walk into a bowling alley and start asking bowlers if it's worth getting into? It's redundant. If it appeals to you then yeah give it a go for crying out loud.
---
Youd think theyd announce something like that
---
Idk if you just wanna fall of or what lol
---
Nice!
---
No. It will alarm any nearby enemies, but they will just begin looking for you in your general area.
---
Every time a patch comes out, hunger and thirst "drain much quicker". Considering this is like 8th time already, I'm sure those meters will deplete in 3 seconds any time now.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be on a team with them, you can go to an event or something and help a stranger. That‚Äôs how I did it.
---
Get out of your power armour and jump I'll get you
---
Oh ok, I also need to get revive someone but I got you
---
The Assassin effect reduces damage from other players, the Cavalier effect reduces damage while moving, and then Sentinel effect reduces damage while standing still. Combined in a certain they could basically make you invincible
---
you don't need the goat legs just the 2 pieces of no fall damage armor and you take zero damage
---
Really they‚Äôre not being given out for free .. they still pay full price
---
Bc_ryuk
---
No they're X-01.
---
Oh wait yeah sry I'll jump
---
The cynical answer is to pad the game, make things take longer to do.  A more meta take is they made it as close to the experience of earning a merit badge as possible, which is kinda funny.
---
Hmmm idk it may be a glitch then.
---
Green Lantern dies in EndGame
---
Sorry, what is a turret farmer? Not sure if I've seen one.
---
ok well even if just on pc that means the bug is back.
---
I haven‚Äôt had a chance to update yet. How do you start the quests?
---
Check the train stations - they are there for me
---
It‚Äôs the legendary vendor
---
Thanks dude!

Whitesprings station has one
---
No problem
---
Bro I literally just told you why. Update the ini files and remove mods, this is procedure every patch. No the bug isnt back lmfao
---
ya i got a mic, GT propmok

500 caps is still better than 3750. At this point, A LOT of people have max caps or multiple mules at max. They finally have a means to use them without having to use reddit. Especially with player vending. I made 6k in 30 min off of plans and aid
---
I agree I could‚Äôve gone about it by giving more constructive criticism. I‚Äôll take your words to mind and think about it next time, thank you.
---
Do you know we‚Äôre I can do the shooting test
---
There‚Äôs just so many plans to buy with such high costs. I‚Äôve sold a lot today as well, makes me think I undercut myself. But really I was the only person in the map with anything worth selling. Xbox is hard to find veteran players sometimes..
---
Maybe this is a good time for you to pack it away and go somewhere else.
---
But ffs I can‚Äôt make out a sentence of this post so excuse my frustration
---
Oh ok, that makes sense
---
Very slow with the updates really can't really argue otherwise when compared to other AAA games. I would say it's good pace compared to a lot of indie early access games for whatever that is worth.
---
They made it more deathmatch-like with this update, to go back would mean making PvP very onesided again
---
Sorry for critizing awful quest design.
---
3* legendary weapon (didn't  pay much attention to what) for 300c. I feel like 40 scrip is going to be worth way more than 300 caps.
---
yeah those Possum challenges look bonkers. I imagine casual players won‚Äôt complete them for months lol
---
Yea plans and aid seem to be the best sellers! I built a second machine for weapons and armor but the first does the best seller for sure.

Anything involving drugs or cheating: Choose report/deny

Anything involving communism: Choose report  
---
Anything involving weapon/firearm safety: Choose the safest and most sensible option. Generally involves standing down, waiting for a go-ahead, or taking cover.

Why not? We already have the post apocalyptic DMV. üëç

Nah, none of them are trick. They're all the obvious answer, with the exception of the ones with convoluted topics like medicine, anatomy. Everything else can be googled.
---
Aight OP is an impetuous and whining child, but if a person isn‚Äôt having fun playing a game... why would they keep playing? I get enjoying a challenge or enjoying a grind, but if you‚Äôre just not enjoying a GAME.... why keep playing it lmao isn‚Äôt that what they‚Äôre for? Entertainment?
---
It is on the pioneer camp grounds. It's at the top of the little Rocky hilltop past the dining hall cabin
---
I'm 100% behind this idea but it would probably glitch a lot and also think of the survival mode. me and my friend have neighboring camps and our turrets almost fight when we have just spawned and not teamed up yet. so maybe it would mean that camps near one another would be on infinity wars or something.
---
Todd told them to make sure to tie the scout badges into the challenges just to bleed us of time.

I know no other game that deliberately locks quest progression into challenges like this.

I wish there was a way people can counter-offer or leave feedback on the price. Perhaps I‚Äôll make a sign that says OBO?
---
You‚Äôre doing the Lord‚Äôs work.  I experienced the frog jar bug.  Super cool decoration for CAMP, but I need that validation. Lol
---
I can fault them. They promised the microtransaction shop (in a paid title, AAA at that) would only contain cosmetics. This is not a cosmetic. This is completely and 100% them breaking a promise, and they have the fault for that.
---
Also need to know this
---
Thank you Bethesda, very cool
---
No it‚Äôs the camp budget. Adding things to be requires budget space and when said item is either bought or removed by the owner, it doesn‚Äôt refund that space. It‚Äôs currently broken.
---
You really can't know unless you try it for yourself,  people have different experiences and you can't tell whether you like something or not based on other peoples opinions.

"milk drinkers" i'm actually dying right now

It's at camp Lewis at archery range
---
From space idk about you but i would take goat legs for good measure
---
Well I‚Äôve taken 2 of them multiple times and I haven‚Äôt got a repeated question yet. And every time there was a question that could have 1 or 2 correct answers even after googling. It‚Äôs pretty confusing honestly to miss one question and fail like 3 times in a row! I‚Äôll have to finish them tomorrow lol.
---
Reporting back‚ÄîI‚Äôve gotten him to spawn several times at the soft serve place. Don‚Äôt know why my luck was so bad in Charleston, but I appreciate the tip and recommend that anyone else looking for him go to Janet‚Äôs Soft Serve.
---
Has anyone found a stimpack diffuser?
---
It‚Äôs to get caps out of circulation and prevent people from hoarding them, as best I can tell.  I feel like the limit could be higher, but for now it is what it is.
---
Yup, full stash, had that happen when the punch bowl came out
---
Don‚Äôt be too quick to dismiss lower level camps. Some are mule characters and have good high level stuff.
---
man I was looking for that badge quest all over, thanks for the info now I just have to get off work lol.
---
If you're sneaking you dont show up on the map?
---
Not when fully modded out I don't think
---
Xbox
---
I used Google and finished every test. Some times you just have to think outside the box on what to ask Google. I think it's great that they are giving us content that makes you use your brain and think of how to solve, not just blindly shooting everything you see.
---
OOOH.... they have a limit per diem... Okay I'll have to sell stuff off over a longer period than just tonight... Good that you can correct mistakes before you exit, though.
---
I got 4/5 several times in a row too, before I rage-quit the game and turned off the computer.
---
I was looking to build the Sheepsquatch Plushie I did buy with atoms when I noticed this this morning.  They have the atom symbol but it's not crossed out like it is for other Atom shop purchases you haven't bought yet, so I was able to build both the Deathclaw and the cat.  Get in quick before they fix it I say!
---
Same thing here! Some how I have 2 but my dude who did it with me had 0!
---
What‚Äôs a ‚Äúmolo‚Äù? I‚Äôm at the cabin @ Spruce Knob Lake and can‚Äôt find the ‚Äútalking device‚Äù...
---
But Survival is good about that scary feeling, that somewhere you can meet dungerous man, but the feeling thar you DEFINETLY meet him soon is not good.
---
And this isnt deathmatch-like with this update, its just killing harmless people with targeting from  Bethesda . Previous was more PVP.
---
I've sent a few people messages via PSN. 
---
As elitist as it sounds, I have an MBA so I'm kind of an expert here, and I hate seeing people waste time and effort on both sides.

Players not being able to buy fron your machine if you're at max caps? That wouldn't make any sense.
---
Go shopping.
---
Well since the game was rightfully review bombed at and around launch hes come here for more modern and up to date reviews. There's nothing wrong with that. If you don't like the question just scroll past it. I don't know why the Fallout 76 community has no tolerance when *^((sorry))* they were hand fed an absolute garbage and buggy mess by Bethesda back in November for the full price of 60 dollars.
---
Is there a skin that makes other power armor look like x01?

---
Check the world subsection of the challenges menu. I believe they should be checked in their respective badge challenges. At least I think so, but I cannot say for sure.
---
hey i have an update seems like after the 8 pm eastern daily reset (like for biv ect) it let me talk to the robot at dolly sods to start one of the quests ...going to check the other right now
---
Question have they added Legendary Hunting Rifle drops yet? I took a break and missed alot for which I am try to catch up.
---
Didn‚Äôt know it came out this morning. Not trolling jeez
---
Once you've gone to the scout camp and started the quest, i.e. you have "Demonstrate Pioneer Scout Calues 0/4" and "Growth: Earn Scout World Challenge Badges" as quest milestones, you've got all you need. 
---
From there, the Scout World Challenges are in fact challenges, in the world category, marked as scout challenges. I'm so used to things being not obvious that when they are obvious I completely miss it. Just scroll through your world challenges and you can't miss them. Everything else is pretty clear. The races have a very well marked start point.
---
Most certainly. Without a DJ like other games, you quickly hear all the songs and they get boring
---
best one so far, 
---
i love been able to see other ppls camps, something thatfor me was missing in the game.
---
vendor machines is a freak success, love it set prices forget it then get a nice money sound when someone bought something. I think I made around 3k yesterday. I just wish we could actually inspect what PPl are selling ( for me was doing the sound effect but I couldnt see the item itself). 
---
all other visual changes were great as well.
---
only down side I saw was a increased number off server disconnects and chrashes, I played 3 hours had 2 game to dashboard and like 6 or 7 server not responding. 
---
overall the updates was great, hoping they figure the disconnect issue and the game would be in a great place.
---
I was frustrated being tied for 3rd 90% of the time because hardly anyone was killing. Survival is tough. I love the score now
---
3*  AAE .50 Cal max level with +50 damg resist while aiming for 4k caps
---
Huh, I guess my PSA did pay off...
---
It's just a skin for the backpack, you have to complete the Pioneer Scouts quests to learn how to craft the backpack itself.
---
Plot twist
---
It‚Äôs a skin, you need to earn the base backpack in game to use it
---
Evil schoolboys who wanna easy blood just eat my rating
---
I looked up how long the actual marathon ran in the real Charleston is. Boom, real world answer.
---
damn :(
---
Me no want use brain me want smashy smashy.
---
I hope they bring it back soon.  I didn't get to have fun with it like a lot of others, simply because I didn't know.
---
They aren't.
---
Where‚Äôs is the course for New River Gorge? I‚Äôve found the other two but can‚Äôt seem to find this one
---
hell yes, over 300 hours played, i checked every time I log on and never saw one. time to put my excavator armor to rest for a while
---
Finally done, cheers!  
---
What a pain, lol
---
I think the game is great! After you grind out the lower levels and hit 50 I think it‚Äôs great. Completely different from other fallouts but still good. I was always a solo guy but after meeting someone like minded I team up everyday and it‚Äôs genuinely a good time. Not to mention all the stuff to do now after today! I‚Äôm so glad they didn‚Äôt stick us with another borrows update or something simple like the shear terror stuff even though the sheepsquatch stuff was fun it just was completed fairly easily and fast. I‚Äôm loving all the stuff to do! And player vending is the shit!
---
So far my experience with the game was fantastic. I've been on it since day one and my enjoyment for the game keeps going. I highly recommend it
---
yea me and a guy had a hard time.. we figured why not jump on a roof and dive into a stream.. bam there it was. took too long lol
---
I would rather we could have them come ti our camp for trading or to send stuff to other trading camps maybe the 10% can be pay to them for the service
---
i did the same thing, i was so impressed with it that I said no I need to pay for the DLC lol, no in real i could let that PA skin go by lol .
---
thank you for the edit :)
---
No problem, hyped about all these changes!
---
Sorry bro I didn't know you were on ps4. I'm on pcmr. Sorry broski
---
yes! I'm so happy for you and i just love doing events with randoms and for ppl to be actually talking and helping, it's so nice to see and so much fun. also whitesprings while nuked is a very nice place for meeting ppl. 
---
we need something like fasnacht back, that was so wholesome
---
ask here bro, someone is always to help. if your in xbobx im down to help.
---
Hahaha omg thank you. Makes much more sense, but I do appreciate the spirit of the OP.
---
What!? How the hell did it disable your pacifist mode? Did you have a workshop?
---
Did you speak to the bot that's there? He's the one that gave be the quest to clear up the toxic waste and that completed the kiddie corner quest for me.
---
F*** O**
---
The workshop glitch got fixed in this patch.
---
No problem!
---
Well, you kill a man a need to be frustrated. Thats have sense. But why 8 or 20 lvl person need to be frustrated on leveling?
---
Worth it getting the bounty while blowing up stuff in the camp
---
OK. I was worried it was broken and I was wasting my time. each turn in seemed exactly the same, with the odd piece of wooden armour every now and again.
---
Ill give it a go later
---
nope :) not even to friends, unless you're in a party :P
---
Logging, he's at the water park on my server.
---
I‚Äôm also on pc and I just solo so I‚Äôll gladly help with whatever I can
---
What was the glitch? I just knew when I use to be in pacifist and someone contested my workshop I couldn‚Äôt return fire for damage. Or is that the glitch? The only thing I could think of is if you had a workshop and they contested it they could directly kill you without you returning fire or engaging I think.
---
But brahmin milk is really good.
---
Finally!  Took them far too long.
---
Thanks again.
---
The craziest one I found was somehow built inside a cliff face. You activated a cooking station to enter - right as you leave the crafting interface you quickly walked inside the rock face to the Camp, which is invisible from outside. Once inside, there were views of the glitched underground landscape. 5 stars to that player - it was amazing!!
---
Agree.
---
You dont get a waypoint. Theres a bot at the location that gives a repeatable quest
---
It's right on top of the bridge, the starting point is on the eastern side where it joins land. You run across the top level first, then drop down and run to the other side and back up.
---
Thank you bro +karma if I could
---
I'm not defending it lol
---
I was kind of disappointed that when I first booted up the game that "Country Roads" from the reveal trailer didn't play.
---
Although, you can hear strains of it in the ambient background music, but it's not the same.
---
No, it's not. I got the message that my camp was full, scrapped some shit, and still got that message. At that point I happened to look in my stash and saw it was full. I moved some stuff from the stash to my inventory and suddenly I could add more products to my vending machines.
---
" hey could sell skins in the atom shop for personal vertibirds" THAT will get BSG attention!  I'd probably buy them too....
---
I thought you were meaning that someone could initiate PVP with you if you had possession of a workshop by contesting it then travelling to your location regardless if you were at the workshop or half way across the map.
---
Now I‚Äôm really confused!
---
Both modes have pvp elements so all servers are pvp servers.  Hence, you have to pvp on pvp servers - there are no other options. 
---
If someone hits me and hit back, accepting pvp, am I then a griefer?
---
If I come across someone with a bounty and I kill them, am i then a griefer?
---
If someone contests my workshop and I enter pvp to defend it, am I then a griefer?  Are they?
---
When I return to camp to find it destroyed and I have to walk over to my CAMP unit and press repair all structures, and my camp is instantaneously in better condition than I left it, have I been griefed?  Did I just grief the griefer by pressing one button on my controller to reverse their carnage?  
---
Just trying to understand when I‚Äôve been wronged or have wronged others in the wasteland because these rules were not explicitly stated to me at any point by Bethesda, and I want it rectified immediately.
---
Great work.  I also approve and have done the same thing.  I have always said, if they do the right thing they will get my support.
---
Oh I was. That‚Äôs what I meant in the second part of my last comment. Can that not happen now?
---
I spoke to the bot, no quest appearing. You seem to have just totally overlooked what I said.
---
If you are aiming for pvp, and its not working for you perhaps is time for you to move on.
---
 I didn‚Äôt realize it came out today
---
Or these endless swarms of ‚Äòshould I try it now‚Äô posters could learn to use a search bar. Oh wait- that‚Äôll never happen. You‚Äôve got a better chance of yanking a perfectly preserved pie out of a port-o-diner. :p
---
Again, the toxic goo is not showing up for me. Yes, after I spoke to the bot. That's why this is a bug
---
Same man. The worst is how it‚Äôs randomize like I wouldn‚Äôt mind it being a set order so you can actually hear the whole playlist instead of I DIDNT KNOWWW THE GUN WAS LOADDDEEDDD every other 3 songs and Country Roads once a month
---
Nope, it's in the patch note. You'd only be in PVP with the contested if you're present at the workshop.
---
If you are an avid builder like me then all that crap loot has a purpose. Obtaining plans and junk to break down has been one of the things that kept the game fresh for me.
---
As long as you price it appropriately for spoiled meat, you‚Äôll be fine
---
Google? That's how I got through mine.
---
I've had this issue with quests not starting properly in the past. Have you tried reloading the game? That sorted the issue for me. Sorry if you've tried and it hasn't helped.
---
How it works is simple. it is a 3 party system.. at minimum
---
Person A and B are Friends, Person A and B start PVP with each other. Person A then Adds Person C (The Victim) to a team
---
If Person C accepts, Person B is classified as hostile since Person A and Person B are in Consenting PVP. Person C can then be ambushed for full damage without knowing what happened.
---
Person C dies. Person B gets the caps and Person A removes C from team.. unless they want to milk you for all you are worth (Caps Wise)
---
^This
---
This will prob be an unpopular opinion..  But it is better than what it was on release hands down. But... As a fan of the fallout series as a whole, fallout 76 is just "okay". It falls short of its predisesors.
---
They have introduced many new and interesting  mechanics which evolves the game to the next level, but im not sure it makes up for the lack of story and the gernal, all around lack of quality and attention to detail you would expect from a fallout game (mainly, literally zero story and zero dialogue.... unless you count running around collecting overseers holotapes as a story.. ). 
---
They do have lots of quirky things laying around the map but i do miss the NPCs and their quirky tales / quests, without them it makes for a very lonely and empty world. Even though it is an online game. 
---
All in all i LOVE the fallout series and this is now (with updates and patches, some new content) a some what decent game. I would not go as far as saying its amazing nor would i say it comes close to touching anything after and including fallout 3. (much worse than fallout 4) If you are looking for the traditional fallout game, this might not the fallout for you.
---
yea  i am one of the people that the quest started a few weeks ago .. i did the revive part way back then and now it's bugged because of it..i didn't even get the clothing or the frog jar because it thinks i already started it before i even talked to the guy at camp lewis.
---
Dilly dilly! I'd buy the whole dev and QA team a round for staying the course. Anytime any of y'all are in Vegas, this Appalachian transplant would gladly pick up the tab. Ad Victoriam.
---
Yeah I think that‚Äôs definitely the aim here. I am going to assume they‚Äôll be an update or patch within the next week or there abouts
---
That reminds me, I ought to put some purified water in my vending machine, since mine is locked.
---
no one can take your caps and stuff on either mode. its just that on survival mode, if you have your vending machine turned on, your camp will be showing up on the map (probably, as i have not tested it yet)
---
I actually haven't. I'll do that. Sorry, just frustrating.
---
Or you can just do the new event (Campfire Tales) and tons of each spawn. That's what I do now to get plans/bugs.
---
High reward for Hard af quest. It would suck if they just made it one quest like wasted on nukashine
---
I hope that won't be me. I have camp near cliff. Players from friendlist fast travelling to it or me seem to get to the center of camp, but who knows what other players will get to. I always start below the said cliff, though never in air.
---
That sounds like cap farming and not wholesome PvP.
---
I can see it now; you destroying a beautiful camp with your TSE Minigun, jumping around like a lunatic in your assassin's armor popping stealth boiz like there's no tomorrow, luring players in with your 1K+ bounty, knowing full well that you can destroy then in a moment's notice and take their 5 wood scrap.
---
did you at least get the costume and from jar unllockable from talking to the scout master at camp lewis...my  game wont even let me do that :(
---
So ppl are mad b/c an OP set of armours got balaced?
---
In the pioneer scout camp. Left of  the instructor. The cabin with "PIONEER SCOUTS KNOWLEDGE EXAMS" written on the side. Walk through the door. There's a green sign that says "PIONEER SCOUT EXAMS" with a large arrow pointing to the terminals a few feet away. These terminals have the pioneer scouts knowledge exams on them. Hope this helps.
---
They're permanent, to start them the fliers give a quest location but I think if you poke around the location the quest starts, you can probably start it without looking at a poster. But as an experienced player, I have all 3 posters available at my camp in case anyone needs to use them :)
---
I use the gas station sign for anti-communism signs
---
They probs spent 10's of thousands of caps on it too, probs why
---
Nope. All of them are active until you do them. Only Fasnacht was limited.
---
What do you mean Anthem is ‚Äúnot being supported any longer‚Äù?
---
You didn‚Äôt mention him. But it does come up as a repeatable. Might just be too many people doing it
---
Oh nice. I‚Äôm the type of person who will just give it away. You want it bad enough to contest it, you can have it! But yea if you have pacifist mode on and your at the workshop, it doesn‚Äôt turn off automatically. Or at least it didn‚Äôt before at least, maybe they fixed it.
---
If you have a mic, have you tried bribing them?
---
Idk if it's just me, but I'm missing very frequently with a 95% chance to hit in VATS.
---
See what's confusing me is that I haven't played in like a month or so, so it didn't start early for me.
---
I'm still using whatever armour I can scrounge up, so soending caps on it seems strange. But ppl are ppl
---
may I recommend turning to the ambient music because it's great  
---
when that gets old, classic fallout music mod is 100% gold too
---
I did get the costume. What is the jar unlockable? Is that something in CAMP mode?
---
Sheesh! That‚Äôs messed up dude. People are dicks!
---
I've personally worked my way away from using anything too op
---
As the person above me stated, it won't break your stealth but will alert nearby mobs to your presence. IMO this is why explosives aren't optimal for solo stealth builds, you can get the same and sometimes better damage with Bloodied or Furious and not alert mobs. Done correctly you can clear West Tek without any mutant knowing you were ever there rather than having them actively hunting for you the whole time.
---
Maybe. Sorry I was snappy, I'm cranky.
---
I very carefully got mine down to one hit and bashed it with the syringer lmao it worked.
---
Thank you, you‚Äôre a gentleman and a scholar
---
This answer I wish they would give us some sort of interior walls, even if it's just atom shop, finally give me something to spend atoms on.
---
Because of the content...
---
Three Raw Fertilizer + Roll of Toilet paper = Poo in your bed
---
It‚Äôs funny I‚Äôm level 150 and I got my first chest piece on a drop yesterday! My dude said sell them on Reddit right now. I didn‚Äôt...
---
This sounds horrible..
---
but did you get the items from talking to the scoutmaster at camp lewis (frog jar and the scout costume)?  if you did then you should be good might reset tommrow when the dailies reset mine didnt even let me get that far
---
Yeah, those are the three I'm attempting.  Going to build a crossbow and use it as a primary weapon.
---
That works lol, thank you!
---
They have them for workshops still by the way.
---
Train stations have a new poster
---
Hang around the forest, all Enemies do no scale up, so you'll be one shotting lvl 5's all day!
---
It definitely is. I‚Äôve had to scrap three turrets so far to add more to sell and since you don‚Äôt get the space back after it sells or gets taken back by me, I‚Äôm slowly having my budget eaten up. It‚Äôs a shame too, because I had just enough space for the vending machine and a small generator. Now I‚Äôm 3 turrets down and will need to scrap the others soon.
---
This is all happening with 550/800 stash space. Other people have confirmed it works this way currently, too.
---
3/4 of the caps..? What he f...
---
Bro, do you even math?
---
Anyone got a video of the nrw backpacks and how you can customize them?
---
I bought about 10 serums  ranging from 250 - 400 caps apiece.  At 250, it was a no brainer nearly wiped the guy out (only had like 10 serums but I bought 6) and the other 4 was for 400 each.  Why?  I have 2 up and coming characters and I wanted to secure the serums for they hit lvl 30. Also insurane policy incase something happens and wipes out my mutations.
---
not sure i didnt get it i just heard about it
---
I could use help too. Can I add you? I‚Äôm on XB1. Disclaimer: add each other, do the quest and never talk again. Unless ya know we get along well lol
---
That‚Äôs an excellent rallying cry. (Mind if I borrow it?)
---
"Fallout 76 offline" baby!  All that sweet PvE action, without those other pesky players and server instability getting in the way.
---
Imposter sheep event always has someone to revive if you can't get someone to help. I got it on xbox this way.
---
Im happy to clean up the dirty socks, lotion bottles and sweaty lingerie after you quit the game. I am crafting a new soup recipe ...
---
Hey anything two shot is is always appreciated.

Yes to receiving the costume, but I'm not sure what the frog jar is. I'll have to look and see what that is.
---
Haha... I have all the mods stockpiled from before... will still make some caps selling them, but not the 5k per shocks they used to be...
---
Good news for most, I don't mind not charging such high prices as I was once upon a time.
---
Will look to list them shortly at my vendor toon in game.
---
That's priceless. Good for you!
---
No it doesn't
---
It‚Äôs kind of whatever you feel is right at the moment, or visit some camps and see what prices they‚Äôre charging to get a gauge. 
---
I‚Äôm currently selling purified waters for 10 caps a pop with 2 Industrial purifiers to fill my stock
---
This was my initial thought! (Multiple characters) because why else would someone buy 3 grounded? I‚Äôm not complaint at all and if it helps people out im all for it! Yea if I see them for less than 300 I‚Äôll probably buy them still lol.
---
What is a Molo ?
---
What do you plan on selling?
---
Sorry, I've been running a basic lv40 mutants swing speed supersledge for way too long, this is my endgame toy.  
---
I did also manage to spend oh so many caps on a two shot mini gun, and the other two stars turned out to be aiming protection and +vats, so that was a great deal.....
---
About half the people who come to my camp vending machine shoot Willy the Deathclaw. So far no damage, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to mind üëç
---
It‚Äôs in the chemistry station if you‚Äôve talked to the bot at camp Lewis you have it. The whole ‚Äúfrog habitat‚Äù is bugged though so don‚Äôt hold your breathe
---
I hoard, friend. Before they put that heavy restriction on characters weight (1500 above capacity) my mule had about 18k in weight. All junk and legendaries and meds. I had to spread it out, sell what I could quickly to randoms and drop a bunch. Wish I could‚Äôve kept it all for now, with the legendary vendor.
---
Credit the Raider vendor bot in the ski lodge xD. He's the one that says it.
---
You unlock them after you finish the quest than you have to grind them like tge other wirld badges
---
I do like this patch and where the game is at.  I spat the dummy several months ago as the game was a shambles.
---
Ive come back, built a new camp, set up my vending and enjoying the game again.
---
Sure the server shits itself regularly but its nothing like it used to be so I'm pretty happy.
---
What‚Äôs a repeatable?
---
then you will probally be ok tommrow when the dailies reset ..me on the other hand i think i may just be screwed...and that kills me i have over 1000 hours now on this character. :( and no it won't be completely broken but i won't be able to get the backpack
---
I mean, duh? Unlocked means you're ok with people taking stuff.
---
Colonel isn't lying. It was a bonafide mess trying to decipher some of the key points from the OP.
---
Are you just trying to get a sympathy gift of a new tse rifle by making this up? Hmmmm? Lol jk
---
Make some friends lmao
---
The level jump for completing her quest is stupid. Maybe I just had bad weapons, but most players aren't leveled enough to take on Wendigo Cave by the time to get to it.
---
You'll get one! Bethesda will fix this. Hopefully quickly. Stay with this character.
---
Quest you can do more than once kind of like Biv's quests.
---
I was expecting a comment like this to be honest xD
---
How do we get the backpack anyway. Do you have to complete the challenge quests?
---
That happens to my camp too, but thankfully the cliff is fairly rocky so there's plenty of ledges.  But yeah, always fast-travel to camps in power armor.
---
Just give up the game is barely playable.
---
Yoshi's Crafted World is so hot right now
---
No. Donuts and Sausages were
---
I just wish there wasn‚Äôt a limit on how much we could sell each day... Its right back to be vendor cap limit again, except it doesn‚Äôt even make sense this time.
---
He does have a point though. Coming to a fanboy subreddit to find out if a game is good or not is never helpful. This place is filled with people who only love the game. Most of these answers are not helpful and are actually super biased to a pretty awful fallout game. i get it we all feel burnt by bethesda for paying $80 for garbage just to have them half the price a month later. So we lie to ourselves and others by telling people "it is a good game". It simply isnt, to say otherwise is a lie. If you dont believe me please elaborate on how this one is sooo much better than any other fallout. Dont get me wrong, there are some pretty awesome new mechanics, but it does not make up for the lack of literally everything else you expect from a fallout game. They literally made a game that has zero point, no begining and no end. How the fuck do you do that as a game company? I will prob get downvoted for that but lets be honest here. This is not a fallout game made for fallout patrons.
---
Our society didn't crumble for no reason. Let's rebuild with free housing for all as a standard with this tax!
---
Its definitely a balance.
---
Ahh ok, a radiant quest. Maybe it‚Äôs on a 24 hour timer, so it always resets at X time? Or maybe it is 12 hours.
---
Lucky you found a TSE weapons, started 2 weeks after game release and nowhere i found a TSE, found TS, or Explosive but never both together.  TSE LMG might be overkill for any ennemies !
---
BTW the cats are stackable. I made a stack off cats about 3 stories high.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs a great idea üôÇ
---
thank you   i need to hear that cause tonights the first night since beta that i didn't even feel like turning the game back on :( but with as few people having this specific issue im not too hopeful for a fix
---
I made a comment going pretty much this exact way the other day.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk1tbu/10_sales_tax_time_to_join_the_free_states_i_wont/emdeee8/
---
As someone who is barely level 30 I feel like I‚Äôm starting to the point where all the cool things require plans and they‚Äôre pretty expensive such as the 1250 PA station plans. Just out curiously how is that everyone has so many caps to spare? Even trying to imagine playing from launch it feels so grindy to make so little and spend so much. Any tips or suggestions on how the majority have a healthy cap stash?
---
Got stuck in a dude's wall today. Had to message him to get me loose.
---
Alternatively you have to scrap enough syringers to get the different barrel types for different effects.
---
Weird they forgot that in the release notes.
---
Kind of everything? I have some weapons, some armor. There's such a variety of types of things lol.
---
Yep.  One of my low level guys is carrying a boatload of serums. Travel to the level 4 guy's camp and behold the mountain of cheap serums and muled bulk junk
---
Just need that radiation resistance perk card to get buffed and we'll be set.
---
am gonna try using bleed ammo tonight.. wish me luck ..
---
Yes. Athlete, Swimmer, and Hunter are pretty easy, just a little time consuming.
---
I've been spending the past 3goyrs just looking for the damn camera...  These could have been designed better
---
The curious get wanted
---
Thought they were chasing someone at first.
---
I just got used to using Gatling guns in 3rd person, you get a aim dot that way. Doesn't looking like I'm going to change any time soon.
---
Damn!  Think we have a winner here.
---
Depends. Don‚Äôt be that guy that sells 1* crap weapons for 5k each like I‚Äôve literally been seeing. But don‚Äôt undercharge either.
---
It seems like currently the new ones are on 12 hour timers or shorter, did it twice today
---
Same chief ... same kinda like the vault in destiny
---
I might have to try that
---
I think they reset at 8pm EST like biv.
---
Perhaps they're reluctant, as then players will be able to easily set up inescapable pits or death-falls or something, though that's hardly a reason as we can always wear power armor or fast-travel out again.
---
Why do ppl keep saying tse like they are op in some way lol ??? Tse weapons are shit after the nerf
---
Do you have those items marked for sale?  If it's marked you can't craft with it.
---
I just did kind of a blanket thing. Plans are 99c, Mods are 49c Recipes are 29c.
---
I seem to be somewhere towards the lower/middle end price wise.
---
Best of luck lol, let us know how it goes
---
Let's do it
---
Yea, I'm gonna use google to find out why someone is scared of the pool
---
What's the best way going about it?
---
Nah, this is their new content, so they'll fix it fast. They just aren't aware of it yet. And yeah, sometimes FO76 will discourage you like that, but I promise you'll get that backpack. Maybe take this time to farm legendaries and get as much legendary scrip as you can. Each day try to help spread awareness of this bug, and before you know it Beth will be fixing it.
---
Still haven't found this plan. Been playing since beta and it's slipped through my grasp.
---
The other way round seems more reasonable. Mark items as "do not scrap", then keep the current system and leave out your choice.
---
It seemed so rushed and randomly placed before
---
I've made over 100,000 caps in 12 hours of this patch. Caps cap needs to be fixed. 
---
Other than that 10/10 patch.
---
Huh, going to have to farm them to scrap now to see what all there is.
---
I agree. I feel like I'll give off the "What are you going to buy? What are you going to buy? What are you going to buy?" vibe.
---
Who wants to die with me? XDDDD
---
Are they legendaries or just regular weapons?
---
I hope so! I fast traveled to a player shop and got stuck in their floor and stairs
---
Oh perfect! Thank you!
---
I dunno, they weren't available between two and four hours ago. Perhaps I'm confused.
---
But some plans are rarer than others, is that a blanket price, even for rare plans?
---
I guess we'll figure it all out as we go.
---
It's at the camp where you start the quests. It's up the hill a bit
---
Sending in 1 minute
---
I agree, its a very poor design on their part :\
---
it sure did
---
Love the effect of seeing all the battle scars in the wings
---
Only the first one really.  Very few players are foolish enough to carry any junk in survival, and most stash as much aid as they can. Some even go so far as to move almost all of their caps to a mule.
---
Let's say you're at 20,000 caps. In that scenario, don't have more than 5,000 caps worth of goods for sale.
---
i have some extra masks, selling them on my camp :)
---
my gamertag is renawana
---
I've trying to do the leathwrworks challenge.  Almost complete,  except,  no deathclaw hide... the hand doesn't count when a scrapping... major glitch.
---
Desired Price * (10/9)
---
(Desired Price * 10)/9
---
even the following works too because orders of operations works out for it (I just like to keep parenthesis in things like this because they make absolutely sure it works as intended)
---
Desired Price * 10 / 9
---
Either of those works. Fun math thing to know, each fraction of x/9 is equal to that x number repeating. Like 1/9 is .1 repeating, 2/9 is .2 repeating, etc. 9/9= .9 repeating which since it infinitely repeats rounds up to 1.
---
The reason that's important here is because you need to add 10% of value, but you also need to add 10% of that 10% and then need to do that recursively until rounding makes no difference. The value of 0.1 repeating is like infinite recursive 10%s.
---
Yeah after 9 hours taking exams in school I get to come home and take exams in 76, and you have to ace them üò≠
---
I don't have any mods...
---
since the new update all my workshops are spawning on my roof if i try to place them. yesterday it worked perfectly...
---
Yes a lot do. Computers can be made expensive.
---
I enjoy it for what it is. But I could wander around in open world fallout games for hours. I think these kinds of players enjoy the most. if you just want to run through quests you probaby won't like it. End game is a little lacking but I haven't really been bored so far. I expect this to improve as bethesda has already done a few times so far. Raids come in wastelanders.
---
* this one has some cool stuff and the community is mostly nice with a few assholes. 
---
* The world is gorgeous.
---
* Like all fallout games it has some bugs. 
---
* Bethesda seems to be getting in the swing of things now.
---
I was worried that they'd mess this up. Glad they didn't. A couple of issues already got spotted  however 120 items is OP as melee builds.
---
I hear you. I'm joining your game
---
Ya what is that?
---
Same reason the media calls every gun they see an AR15, ignorance. 
---
People see the explosive effect and say it's a TSE without even considering it could have been one of the many other prefixes paired with the explosive effect.
---
I would love to find someone to revive, get killed for, in a big pool of water. On Playstation. Tag: Fridhed. Online most of the day.
---
I guess your are right
---
There‚Äôs a Deathclaw that you can serverhop farm a little west of The Top of the World at the bottom of the cliffside between the cliff and the electrical tower if you need a regular supply
---
Legendaries.
---
wired bugs you have going on, I literally did the samethings you did and didnt see any off this happened to me. what system do you play in.
---
Agreed!! Almost every single time I spawn into a wall and I can't move!!
---
Shoot karma works everytime.
---
Small stash boxes could fit under certain benches. The green footlocker stash was a common one used. Usually seen tucked in the cavity under a weapons bench. I even had one hidden underneath my armor bench.
---
That's like 96 pounds. damn.
---
Glad it worked out for you, too. I got tired of hopping Charleston.  I wished I had tried Janet‚Äôs sooner.
---
I pissed through nearly 200 caps last night, fast travelling from one end of the map to the other when new camps showed up.
---
I meant vending. But you are right.
---
That could work too. It does seem more efficient.
---
I've been thinking the same thing. Have scrapped 4 of them and no mods. Where are the plans for them?
---
Yeah for now. Nothing I have is really ‚Äúrare‚Äù, and I the ones I sell I already know. 
---
I did a lot of trading on reddit and server hopping, and now have most of what I was looking for.
---
Rule one. Always wear power armor when fast traveling or logging in. Never know where your gonna drop.
---
Just jumped back in. It looks like now the game just auto-completed the Helpfulness portion for me. I didn't even do anything. Ok, odd. I also couldn't fast travel anywhere for a good solid minute, but now I can.
---
What do you play on? We can help each other  if its ps4
---
I real elsewhere on Reddit that you can inspect vending machine items when the seller is in their CAMP, but can't inspect the items if they are out somewhere else on the map.
---
Events are an easy way of completing it. Specifically the sheepsquatch one
---
I'm Old Greg..
---
Yes. Just the other day I was looking for one in the build menu and as shocked not to find one
---
.
---
Yea, no earthly idea what the stimpack diffuser is.
---
Got my deep pocketed combat armour plans at Grafton station. Plus the bos paint for the arms.
---
I too have the same problem. Even in third person the thing seems to take up the whole screen.
---
100 stims for 5c each, guy probably forgot a 0
---
I sell my stuff for the value listed in the info when you select the item. If it doesnt have a value i will just put what i feel its worth. I have some plans for 140 some are 100. The marine torso mod i have is 140 cuz i felt getting it from the damn train yard in cranberry bog was a bitch cuz i had fo fight a crowned albino angler 2 legendary ones and 2 frogs that were both diseased. Blew through 1100 .50 rounds and 4 stimpacks.
---
meanwhile my plasma shotgun still doesn't work.
---
For now I would suggest traveling to the nearest known point to that camp and walking to it.
---
I saw a dude selling a fasnaut mask for 25k lmao
---
Events are a good way, post your platform and I'm sure someone would be willing to help also.
---
This is exactly what happened. If I'd even thought about it I'd have been more cautious about who I teamed with, but I've lost more to less, so it's at least something I can warn other people about.
---
Yeah, my camp has a chance to put you on the edge of a cliff, I've walked the wrong way and fallen more times than I'd like to admit lol
---
Person message me and we both jumped off the lighthouse. Sure you could do the same unless PC doesn't have a message system.
---
My buddy just gave me one for scrip scrap, he said he got from imposter event as reward in adventure mode
---
Wish I could buy the PC copy and use my PS4 Bethesda account login across both. I been hoping at some point this would be possible
---
Junk yeah, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many carry more meds than necessary. Not the hardcore guys, but those who only play for the exp boost or don‚Äôt do it often.
---
It probably has the same bug as sneak.  I use Healing Factor to determine if any enemies are left.  If it doesn't start recharging there's probably a critter or enemy nearby keeping you in 'caution' or 'danger' which stops the healing from kicking off.  When not in combat should = when all enemies nearby have been killed.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I was really expecting to rush through this, but this seems like a nice long term addition.
---
I‚Äôm ps4 I also need a revive TrinkleTrain812
---
Makes you wonder if they test this stuff before giving it to us.
---
I would love to join you guys but I am nowhere near the level you all are haha
---
I love love love these quests !   I completed the swimmers badge tonight and got a few checks on a few others.   Hopefully the bugs people have encountered are fixed soon.
---
What has this worked on? I can't list any atom shop painted items or a fully built camera for sale
---
You'll get a pop up as they're added. There's also a notification in the top left saying who bought something and what it was they bought.
---
Played for 4 hours before work and my food is not spoiling any faster than before. I dont use good with salt.
---
Tbh Bethesda is a good publisher too. Doom, Prey, Dishonored, Prey. Did I mention Prey?
---
Omg your username.....thats just....no..
---
Also yes
---
They did that last patch. Or maybe the one before that.
---
I got all of the masks today. Thanks though! I'm mainly looking for the balloons now, which apparently are rare.
---
Oooooor, they could give us something that already exists and we wouldn't have to do this stuff?
---
Yeah it gives you a little notification on the top left of your screen telling you what you sold and adds caps like normal. I dunno how quickly it works though I guess, I was off doing something else when someone bought from me.
---
Yeah on one of my alts I built a floating pirate ship hanging over a cliff and unfortunately where I placed my camp causes me to fall of a cliff and sometimes die
---
Here's a simpler way of thinking about it (more words but more step by step plain text concept). You need to add enough that when 10% is taken off you end with what you want. Thing is, 10% of what you added is also taken off, so you really add 11%. Thing is 10% of that extra 1 you added there is also taken off, so you really add 11.1%. This goes on infinitely until rounding makes it irrelevant (like 0.1 of a cap would get rounded down and wouldn't matter at that point). So if you wanted 1000 you'd need to add 11.1% (which gives you 1111 assuming rounding works properly tax will be 111 and you'll get 1000).
---
So in actuality you add .1 repeating of the value to it (that's 11.1% repeating). You know what fraction equals .1 repeating? 1/9th. So you add 1/9th to the value (x+(x*(1/9)). Thing is you can make that a bit simpler to do by shortening it to this (x*10/9) since 1/9 + 1 = 10/9.
---
&gt; I spent 4 hours fast traveling to other players, asking them if we could do this small challenge, but I guess most people have in game mics disabled and thus can't hear me.
---
On this note, can we please get an "I want to voice chat/I'm talking to you" emote already?? I tried asking a guy if he had a spare bloatfly gland from the horde he just killed, but I had to server hop instead.
---
I'm all for hoping on the Anthem hate train, but not once have they said they've dropped support for it...in fact they've only said the opposite.
---
That's not what he's talking about. He's referring to overweight characters who's only option to getting under max weight is to destroy stuff. 
---
When you're over the maximum allowed weight you can't pick anything up, sell it, or drop it. Your only option is to destroy it.
---
It sucks that items in the vending machine NEED TO BE INSIDE the stash to be sellable. My stash was full and I couldn‚Äôt put purified waters up for sale.
---
Yeah, I killed 11 deathclaws today, not one hide.
---
I read along thinking "what have they missed this time?" But nope. It's your general knowledge I'm afraid :)
---
This is probably why it was originally the way it was. But people complained enough to get it changed
---
Every single vending machine in survival mode that I've seen to this point has been a trap.
---
Hotdogs are Morgantown airport by the broken down plane on a grill 
---
 No idea about s'mores recipe
---
I'd be careful in survival mode, you're basically just waving yo raiders and saying here I am come blow my camp up
---
someone said they got smores recipe from doing the new event that happens at night at the camp
---
Only issue I see Bethesda taking with that is potential for abuse in some way or another, like placing the mat in some inescapable pit of doom built purely out of evil.
---
Also could theoretically cause issues if multiple people were zoning in at once.
---
Not saying it's a bad idea but I think the above are why it may not be done.
---
I accidentally sold a favourited gun last night, no prompt, but then tried to sell some favourited Radaway today and it asked me if I really wanted to do that. Was I just going too fast last night?
---
This is in fact what im referring to.
---
Really depends. I sold a 3* bloodied handmade for 12500 earlier today, a 3* nocturnal chinese officer sword won't even sell for 600
---
Keep an eye out if you're at the cap limit, they didn't increase it yet.
---
Whenever you buy something from an npc vendor, only 1/4th the caps you spent are returned to their available caps, what‚Äôs so hard to understand about that?
---
No, they are not.  And I hope they stay not nice because I want that constant tension when I come across other players.  Not knowing if I will have to defend myself or not.  Always having to be conscious of who is near me or my camp on the map, making sure I stash my junk regularly, that I remembered to replace weapon artisan with demo expert after repairing my gun, etc.  Having to guess if someone is only asking to trade with me to do a gear check or see if I‚Äôm worth killing because I‚Äôm carrying a shit load of junk for them to loot if they kill me.  That‚Äôs what keeps this game fresh for me.  Or maybe just remove the prospect of getting killed by another player entirely so I can collect all the fasnacht masks in peace. You know what I‚Äôm talking about. That real wasteland survival experience - Parades and masks and balloons!   Yay!!
---
What did his comment say?
---
I'm not sure but I think I've seen people buy them for 200c on the market sub
---
First player vendor I went to I bought 2 3* bloodied meathooks and a 3* aa swingspeed meathook for 50-100 caps each. Along with som other 3* armor/fodder for 50-100 caps each. Server hopped for 3 hours after that guy looking for another unicorn.
---
Smores are from the camp adam event. The ghost story.
---
Thank you for the 'gallows humour' becuase feelsbadman.
---
However there is a silver lining... Changing the perks around and crafting/modding appropriately a suit of Excavator he makes a fantastic mule so I have that going for me I guess.
---
I am not re-speccing him until the gleeful dust of the new patch settles and I can determine what is aggrieving the PvP crowd next so I can stay the hell away from it.
---
For now it seems is just 'caps cap (there is a pun there by I cannot for the life of my find it) bad, plz fix' which doesn't help my endeavours.
---
I have a few junkies weapons but I don't really want to play with them until they get their seal of approval.
---
Ayyy right well shit
---
Thanks. I wonder if I should charge different amounts based on location. Cheaper for forest and more for say the mire.
---
Just get the plan and make them. Much faster than trying to find them. More expensive though.
---
Bravo wont be solved till wednesday. Had 800 combinations and was not in the top 100.
---
Wow, had no idea!
---
Did it pop up like a daily? I just went and talked to them again after i did biv's.
---
did they change laserguns too or just plasmas?
---
Forgot they updated the plans, good idea. Thanks
---
Right now I'm lowballing my pricing just to free up space. Once I've got breathing room my long term goal is to just have reasonable pricing for everything I sell. 
---
The way I look at it, I don't need to hit the lottery on every sale but seeing a steady flow of income makes the daily vendor bot run way less of a tedious planning point.
---
Or when their vending machine is in their locked camp.
---
Here's an easy way of thinking about it.
---
You need to add 10% right? Well now the 10% of what you added will also be taken as tax. Get it? So then you add an extra 10% of what you added (which is now 11%) to make up for that extra tax. You have to keep doing that until it gets rounded to the point where it won't matter. 
---
11.1% repeating is equal to .1 repeating (percent just means move the decimal place over 2). 0.1 repeating equals 1/9th. So you add 1/9th of the value to the value. 
---
Adding 1/9th of a number to the number is the exact same as multiplying by 10/9ths. Example, (x+ x(1/9) = x(9/9)+ x(1/9) = x(10/9).
---
I am gonna kms lmao I literally solo‚Äôd this stupid ass thing for the coder badge &amp; now I have to re-solo a different one.. I think that‚Äôs enough fallout for the day haha. My fault anyway but Jesus man.
---
Sold all mine for like 20 caps because that was how much I would pay.
---
If you need to find a hotdog, at watoga highschool, in the kitchen you have a hotdog sausage spawn usually.
---
It's not even the handmade. It's the perks associated with the handmade....rifle damage is terrible unless you have a specific set of perks associated with said rifles. I have played both melee competitive and rifle competitive. 
---
The fact that you can get a death claw gauntlet to do 8000 damage per swing still is beyond me. Nerfing rifle damage would break the game and make ranged builds unviable especially for pve.
---
I just cheched it, they're 50-75c per map, most people sell all of them for the same price
---
Card will stay valid even if you leave server. If you can't get to it until the code is decrypted, you shouldn't need another key Card. I don't know of another  source for codes.
---
Agree, it's complete BS that we can't use them for our CAMPs. People spawn on the other side of my camp and have to travel around a bunch of rocks up a mountain just to get to where I set up my vending machine.
---
I found the camera on Ansel at Tyler County fairgrounds on the chairs at the back of the ground.  I found it first go, but got disconnected and didn't get the camera.  I server hopped a few times and got him again on the seventh go.  If you stay up on the rocks where you spawn in and use a sighted weapon, you can see him sitting there (or not) each time you hop and then only have to go down there when he appears.
---
Well tbh I also realized I left my keycard in my stashü•¥ ‚Äò‚Äòtwas not my damn night on fallout haha
---
Thanks. I haven't done trading before so I was unsure and didn't want to be that guy that charges obscene amounts. Might be better to use them and sell anything good I get.
---
Some spots it shows up more
---
I just killed things by bashing them lol, seems to damage them faster
---
With Anti-Armor, you can pretty much one shot anyone. Which is the point of the build. Since player health is only 2-300 at best.
---
Yes, melee needs the Nerf, nothing else
---
I have a random wall halfway between two floors in an area that piece cannot be placed,  and I can't select,  delete, or move it and it's not solid.
---
Will take me awhile to get a pack
---
But I'm just a friendly trader who wants to feel a little bit more thrill than in Adventure Mode :(
---
Do you still have it?
---
Same, didn't know what was happening until now and I'm KEEPING it  :D
---
Let's just hope some jackass doesn't come by and destroy that bro's arch.
---
yeah i got the punch bowl for free aswell
---
Shhhhh they check reddit.
---
No problem, I usually check the market sub before I sell legendaries to find a good price. Treasure maps can give rare plans so it's probably better to use them yourself
---
Got a 2 shot lever action for 1k
---
A fair and reasonable point.
---
He wanted to get unbanned lol
---
Speak for yourself, I can can charm the chips out of that machine
---
May give it a bit, the raiders are annoyed their greifing methods got nerfed in adventure so may take it out more there
---
The fact that everyone uses a weapon build variation means it's easy to counter. Do your research and find out what can kill those builds. For instance maybe a Stalkers Fatman? Always carry plas grenades they kill anything. No one has energy resistance. Anti-Armor beats sentinel assassin and power armor. These are things you should look into.

[](/celestiafrown)Day 35: I think I'm starting to enjoy being a floor.

I do but on PC, so not much help

I second this motion. It would also be cool if we could apply them to holotapes for people to collect aswell
---
Correct. Camp Adams.
---
Um, I‚Äôll be saving this post please update if you get any information on this.. sounds very interesting!
---
People can do that now, by building the pit of doom wherever they first placed their CAMP machine.

And multiple people zone into things all the time, we all spawn into the same spots at all the established map markers, and nothing goes wrong then.

Dude check some of the venders I been getting fashnacht stuff all day from between 10-100 caps.

I just hope they learn from this and make Fallout 5 a co-op for four players like Borderlands 2.
---
I don't know how that would work, but it'd be a fun experience.

Yup. They're slowly doling out old content we've all already paid for for $14 bucks a pop, and idiots are gobbling it up.

Fortunately I've got Bird Bones and Goat Legs, so it takes quite a drop to kill me. But it's still not great.

Those exams...  
---
Archery, Athletics and Swimming I had to do many, many times over, the rest was once or twice.

Yeah, I have had 2 camps where the spawn point wasn't very great unless you're prepared.

yeah right now you're on a list

gotcha

I DO!!!!

I'll do a scan of the game as see how it goes just hop it don't happen when I'm scraping my legendary's.

Melee is the only thing that does any amount of damage. Buff other things &amp; stop nerfing everything you see.

If you had a dollar for every time this thread has been posted in the last two months, you'd have enough to buy the game and a console to play it on.

Yeah, so I just discovered. Got all excited and took everything out of my stash that I've been collecting for months only to have to put nearly all of it back again. And I was so looking forward to an empty stash again ‚òπÔ∏è

That's a valid point, just getting rid of some stuff is worth it even if you don't make a zillion caps (that I don't have room for anyway).

Stuff like 3\* bloodied are gonna go for more, tho. ;)

Only ones I remember are:

Swimming in the dark is always dangerous

Alternate strokes so your face is sometimes submerged and sometimes on the surface, breathe when on the surface

Stop immediately when the lifeguard tells you to stop running by a pool

You have a partner with you to be able to call a lifeguard

I have at least one. Psn is tuchflufygetdizy
---
Well Bloodied is worth a lot more, nocturnal stuff kind of sucks.
---
Hopefully you found the patch enjoyable!
---
Oh no one less duplicated gun in this game
---
What about an Enclave quest to unlock them? I believe they shouldn't be personal, but deployed by the US Army,  maybe have an olive skin and maybe there should be a limuted number of them. I would like mostly to see Transport Vertibots. People call them with grenades, and, a Vertobot arrives. And, seeing that Vertibots are just maybe 4, or 8, every Vertibot has his own painting on the side, like WWII bombers, and his own name. I really like your idea

I wish he wasn‚Äôt trapped in the Ash Heap randomly dying, he deserves better

---
Also Brahmin milk removes rads.
---
I don't understand what the second section is for.
---
Totally agree. Me and my friends were SO hyped for this game and it was a total disaster at launch. No excuse for that. I honestly did not think they would recover. We all quit the game. But I was already hooked on the Fallout crack; I circled back in and I'm sure glad I did. Bethesda has really redeemed themselves. Quite amazing.
---
yes it great, I think been able to see other ppls camps is somthing that at least for me was missing. yesterday was such fun looking a ppls camps almost ran out off caps buy stuff from ppl, and yes earing that money sound and then seen x person brought x thing its a great feeling.
---
I did the athletics at Camp Venture. Do I get a badge or is that rewarded at the end of completing the quest? So much confusion lol
---
But what's the point I guess.
---
Same.  What gives?
---
What handmades get in damage, they lose in other ways. Their vats costs is the highest of the other three comparable rifles. The combat and radium rifles will actually output more damage than the handmade does in vats. The assault rifle is trash though. I think its only strength may be range and accuracy. My vats god roll combat rifle costs only 7 AP per bullet. Jumping costs 10 AP.
---
Just need to do 3
---
Crossbows do last forever! i have had a 2\* Ghoul Slayers that i got when i was in my 20's and used it until level 90 or so (and really just stored it bc I ran out of bolts and prefer scavangin them instead of crafting) They are just too slow on the reload.  
---
And I have scrapped idk how many and have never unlocked any mods
---
Yeah...and people say the SBQ is immune to dmg! Fully understandable when everything gets nerfed . Soon there is gonna be a 10 man squad with their awesome 110dmg snipers wondering why she does not die.
---
Not a bad idea, will be sure to put a switch when I build mine.
---
yes I always wanted to see other peoples camps and it was missing from my life, and im glad the we can now just do that. A big part off my playing time yesterday was looking at peoples camps, it was great!!!!!!!
---
Do you know how to get the bow and arrow?
---
Their discount is they can fast travel to your camp for free :p
---
Brahmin milk removes some rads.
---
Do you know where the plan for the bow and arrow are?
---
That was tough for me as well. What I did was wait till someone new came out of vault 76 and followed him around till he needed to be revived. Unfortunately, he went afk at the overseers camp, however, I was able to lure some nearby protectrons to him so they‚Äôd kill him and I could revive him.
---
They're literally just emulating Ebay or anything similar to it. You make money - they take a cut. Except the caps go....nowhere.
---
You can't need rifles or we are fucked they need the buff from perks. Without it they are as good as a fucking 10mm
---
Hey thread OP, this jerkoff here and the middle schooler above him is why all these "should I get this game" threads are always met with negativity. They're breeding grounds for this kind of garbage they're vomiting. My whole point was if you think you'll enjoy it you don't need anyone telling you that will or won't, use your own agency to decide that. But these two chuckle fucks can't fathom their opinions aren't facts and are utterly impotent in their ability to distinguish between the two.
---
Someone found out the owner of the shop has to be there.
---
Max Level, Two-Shot, Explosive Handmade,  1.5k. Been looking for one, was super happy.
---
please, I keep ending up below the cliff of my camp instead of at my camp
---
You just need to complete 3 challenge trees in the world challenge section I would suggest archery hunting and swimming if you don't have the special but you do go for  the running one
---
I think the problem OP is having is more in line with my own. I can‚Äôt sell plans from my stash because my ‚Äòworkshop budget‚Äô is full. 
---
This doesn‚Äôt make sense I don‚Äôt understand
---
No. 
---
Your suggestion has been heard by this player and discounted not out of avarice but because i have legitimate uses for those items. You do not own or need to be using my CAMP.
---
It's actually still jacked though. Now the Dolly Sods quest isn't showing any marker on my map, and the Growth: Earn Scout World Challenge Badges aren't showing a marker as well. Any clue where those are?
---
That‚Äôs crazy.  Those sell for 17k on PS4.
---
Fun fact one of the questions is wrong anyway. The belay device isn‚Äôt the thing on her harness that keeps *insert name* from falling its her belt. The belay is used by a secondary person who stays below
---
Bargain.
---
VATS is not notoriously buggy unless you have a shit connection, which makes all hit detection buggy.  I will 1-hit anyone I want every single time with a cookie cutter garbage VATS build and a one star legendary.  Assuming the aim bot's perfect, and you're in range, and and and.  I push vats, crit, and you die.  You shoot 2-3x, and maybe hit for good damage.  I have never seen a VATS crit not land unless, again, I am literally rubber banding constantly.  And I haven't encountered that in months.
---
The PVP is pointless garbage, however.  It only exists as a free marketing stunt.  I highly doubt survival mode ever gets a significant adjustment or addition to it.
---
The world challenge badges come under the challenges menu under world challenges and you need to scroll down to find them. Don't know what to suggest about Dolly Sods.
---
Just wait till you reach possum. There's like 12 more to take :D
---
About the same, sometimes more on Xbox. Couldn‚Äôt believe it.

No Mutants Allowed :)

I got a set of Fanascht masks for 50c each.

Took all day? You're not alone friend. Now to grind out 4-7 more to get the mod you want.
---
Or just sell it cheap cause folks are more likely to buy it cheap. Banjo‚Äôs gonna run a fucking Costco while you all are trying to Whole Foods
---
Only ones with vendor machines with power to them
---
Cool thanks.
---
I saw some in machines for 1k each. Nice find!
---
but thier is a way to dirrectly contect someone in the game, send him a text on xbox live, you can even do it in game.
---
Ironically, I have wanted one for quite awhile and had just bought a three star version at full market rates.   Although in some way I like this bargain one more.
---
How the hell do you do the bug quest? I have to server hop and waste tons of caps fast traveling just to find the bugs, and then when I finally have them all, they suddenly disappear from my inventory! Like do they all decay over time? I seriously don't get what happened.
---
I love this thread, feels kind of like the antiques roadshow üòÇ
---
I found the BoS player.
---
I think the kanawa graveyard between Billings and Ohio River Adventures, but I cannot be sure if it was sting wings or blood bugs... I have avoided it ever since then as I hate both!
---
Sorry can't help you. Just another example of Bethesda failing to test stuff. Gotta frown and join the rest of us.
---
I've fallen and crippled my legs like 3-4 times today from FT to various player camps today because they're all high up, floating over nothing. This would fix that.
---
Everyone has a use for the things they put in their CAMPs. But forcing anyone walking to your vending machine to walk through your arch? Come on. ... put your Vending machine outside?  Let me hop over it. Something.
---
Heck, I have a rad arch, so other people can use it.
---
I somehow had my Irish side kick in and guess all the none animal ones all right my second try...  
---
I know all on animals... they are my life (zookeeper, environmentalist, animal shelter)
---
Ok I think I might have figured out what the confusion is. Not sure though. But basically the main quest is telling you to complete the Daily repeatables, right? So see, I think the issue is, if you shut off the repeatables (under the Daily section of your pip boy), then it removes all markers for the main quest as well I believe.  
---
u/tanass You might want to check that out. Look under your Daily section in your pip boy, and see if you can activate the specific portions of the quest needed to then fulfill the main quest. I'm not sure if this works yet, but it's looking like it might for me.
---
I picked up a lot of missing plans tonight.
---
Yes, but it said "repeatable". Which suggests it's less than daily in timeframe.
---
Which new event?
---
Raider vendors had them too
---
Exactly what I was thinking.
---
Lol aww muffin ‚òπÔ∏è someone is butthurt. 
---
Thank you for proving my point about this being filled with fanboys and being useless üòÇ
---
100%! 
---
It really is 1-2 shots every time, any range
---
It‚Äôs under Stats, it‚Äôs a new section all the way to the right.
---
After spending the evening sprinting out from under buildings as they were loading in and emerging from people's bedrooms and getting irradiated from spawning in water and from THAT ONE GUY WHO BUILT IN THE HIGHLY IRRADIATED TRAIN TUNNEL I have to agree.
---
I have guns and armor that go for 5-25k caps per piece. It‚Äôs not designed well, and needs to be changed.
---
hey man dont feel bad, I love having ppl over and I love seen other poeple camps. stop by my camp is open for everyone.
---
[](/celestiabarf)I've been combing server by server looking for junkies weapons since the patch hit. I got half of the haul for the day from one awesome dude who just gave em to me for free when I asked, then on the flip side the most I spent was 3k on an explosive junkies pump shotty that I'm not thrilled with.  
---
All in all, spent the day like a 90s kid in a new mall. It's been delightful. Wish me luck finding a Junkies Swing Speed Cultist Blade.
---
Nah just a rad free commie
---
I am sorry you don‚Äôt have nice things.
---
I‚Äôll do it psn bc_ryuk
---
Just FYI I've had to server hop 6 times now and I can't pick up the crossbow plans at the archery range. Nothing happens. Then they eventually disappear but don't show up in my inventory.
---
Yeah. As a side note, don‚Äôt put a switch on them if it‚Äôs accessible to the public. People will just switch them off, lol.
---
I disable mine by scrapping the wire.
---
With order of the Tadpole you get the RadRoach Mount
---
Or just ya know, trade individually to them?
---
I'm home tomorrow so I'll pop on an hour before I triggered it tonight and see what happens.
---
Ahh thanks
---
Thank you very. I appreciate it
---
Thanks friend! I'll add you now.
---
Now that's fucked up
---
The key about the camera is to make sure you‚Äôre looking at the right places. The spawns for the dead tourist are specific and I probably passed over him multiple times. I found him at the Mothman museum and invited friends to me. If you have friends spread out on a server and cover the spawns in a group effort. Best of luck, because that‚Äôs what it based of off ... luck
---
Terror in the Dark or something like that.
---
The airport interior is currently inaccessible in mine. All doors are boarded up and some have disappeared completely.
---
I got the tick and my friend got the firefly
---
Isn't the Fallout 4 people calling for nerfs, it's the same dipshit pvp crowd that wrecks every game they're in.
---
That or he got the visual glitch whilst in Power Armour.
---
Do you have it set to show build able items?
---
Yeah. I bought some random (cheap) stuff I didn‚Äôt really need, just to spread some cheer.
---
But that isn't limited to the handmade. The same can be done with any weapon essentially with the anti armor prefix and an optimized build.
---
Didnt see it there. I checked all vendors in winterspring before this thread
---
Yeah that was an experience lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blw32o/they_removed_the_over_repair_bonus/
---
Yeah...Managed to get a TSE Tesla Rifle for 1100 caps. Been trying to farm something worth trading for one for so long. Was so happy to find it
---
I am the same way. Love for people to use my camp to repair there items or rest. I just feel guilty when I use someone else‚Äôs. I know, it‚Äôs stupid....üòú
---
I did the same thing.  that is not a fun ropes course.
---
Yeah biv's quests say "repeatable" also. I guess we'll know for sure tomorrow.
---
Armor already has pocketed/deep pocketed mods
---
It is hard only because i don't understand every english word, not because it is challenging. Thats bad was to make something dificult. Same as bulletsponge SBQ difficulty, or insane crazy imposter sheepsquatch damage difficulty.
---
Bethesda will need more time to learn how to make something difficult, but enjoyable.
---
This was the last straw that convinced me to buy  a second account. The main reason was to store caps since i have no friends but it helps a lot with doing challenges. Glad i grabbed the game very cheap and it's all so different now.
---
I would actually like help too! Anyone on?
---
Yeah, I need someone to revive, too. Kind of a pain when your regular team mate isn't playing as much and is currently asleep.
---
I think is mislabeled. They should put under "build" , not craft.
---
Cause when you put the colected frog inside the jar you have to BUILD a habitat at  your camp, not CRAFT in a workbench. üê∏
---
To think I sold hundreds of the stuff now can't find it
---
Try under lights.
---
Whales keep the lights on! If it means they get money to keep the free shit coming then by all means let em spend. I spent 9 something on 2 4.99 packs which i feel was worth it. I will drop more if i see something i like but so far im good.
---
Deep pocketed only gives you 10 extra weight per piece so that is only 50 extra. Or the equivalent to one shock. Not to mention there is no armor without legendary affects in the game that comes close to PAs stats.
---
Turn right at the new vending machine things directly in front of you when you fast travel there, then go past the showers,  then up the little hill on the right.
---
I have low intelect, so i didnt craft it with big overrepair. It took me 40kills to break it on 90% then after every 5kills i could repair it again.
---
There is a respec option. Each level after 50 you can move one point from one stat to another. I‚Äôve moved at least 10 points around since level 50.
---
I'm selling my stuff cheap and idc, i dont wanna be rich i just want others to have stuff and me to be able to buy stuff too. But what immediately happened to me was that someone bought a plan for a disease cure from me for like 50 or 100 caps and put it up for sale at his shop for 1000. i wish that there was a way to prevent this as i want ppl to be able to buy things for cheap instead of having ppl that just hoard caps for no reason buying them instead.
---
Damn it Jim. I never thought to look under lights for a lighted sign. Lol. (No sarcasm there)
---
It means pier. He means the pier, or the dock. There‚Äôs a cabin there (left from spawn, IIRC), and just down the steps from it is the spot to activate the swim test.
---
I think this happened a long time ago to me. I think you can only build it in workshops
---
Goat Legs 2* 80% reduced fall damage. Agility
---
I'm not sure if the camera is tradable. I'm also on PS4 and couldn't find a tourist at a few different spots. I eventually did at the Water Park. I had to server hop one time there and the tourist was next to one of the cars in the car park.
---
At least we all have seen some pretty big solid foundations around us, -stucking us inside them, making us fast travel to somewhere else when possible-, fast traveling to other's CAMPs.
---
I don't have a problem with cosmetic content sales in games that don't have a monthly charge. (though with the repair kits in, I personally won't be buying atoms at all, ever). 
---
I DO have a problem when they take old content and sell it for stupid high piles of money, like a pretty huge swath of the launch skins. 
---
The stuff we're getting now, the horsemen armor sets, the new custom weapon skins, the new paintjobs, etc? I'm in favor of that.
---
That's what I'm wondering. What if he sold a bunch of lone bullets and it rounds up the 10% tax (because like fuck a tax is going to let you round down right?)?
---
My god, I feel like I am back in college taking fucking finals again...
---
What?
---
Huh? There is not one?
---
It is camp venture - huge bridge - sunnytop ski park
---
Don't worry you aren't the only one. I sometimes forget they're there and get mad.
---
Molo means pier or dock.
---
Just look for the cabin by the dock.
---
Yeah did buy it :)
---
I thought he sounds like cookie monster
---
Instead of events where you just kill shit, how about one where a group can build Grahm a home with the CAMP builder. Maybe the first person there builds, the other players have to defend (cos I guess you always end up just killing shit)
---
Woah, interact with them? Lets not get carried away. I prefer to sneak to the vending machine and then run away like a spooked radstag if they notice me.
---
For real though, it was a great night of player interactions that I normally would not experience. Best since Fastnacht. I had one guy hassling me at a vending machine for taking too long but the owner of it was like "hey it's fine with me, he keeps buying stuff" lol.
---
I spent the night spending caps (mostly on ammo but I bought an armor piece and a gun) on a few servers and saw about two dozen player camps, but didn't get my machine live yet ( I was near max caps... was).
---
Thanks a lot ! unfortunately, the crossbow plan is always missing...
---
The Archery challenge is driving me bonkers. I've killed 50 enemies, crafted 50 ammo, done the Exam and Archery Text. This blasted crossbow literally will not wear down fast enough now, even with me using the crossbow as a baseball bat. ARGH THAT LAST STEP.

The person I collaborated with went to the river and let a level 6 scorched slowly murder them.
---
I did the same, took off all my armor and let them slowly knife me to death.
---
Hmm, they say "daily" for me on PC.
---
I understand your point, but I just don't understand how everyone has so many caps! I've been playing since beta and I can never seem to keep up. It has been excruciating to build caps and still get mods and plans. With the shared cap pool introduction, I've done a little better, but I still never have had more than 8,000 at a time.
---
Now I'm worried that I'll put something up to vend for way under its market value.
---
Exactly, rounding down from 0.10 is going to be zero (if you round up then it's 1 which is all of it), so makes little sense. Hey here's a thought... just don't put a tax on it at all? Who is meant to be taking the tax anyway? Responders? Vault Tec? There is no government.... although I would admit that those roads need some repairing wouldn't you agree? I think I would be complaining to my local MP Bot.
---
3 hours brute forcing tests that I only know about 60% of the content? Checks out.
---
Dunno been trying to figure that out

Please gosh i am in the same boat

I guess "Revive another player while in water during a radstorm in nuke zone while wearing clown costume and being in combat while another player is taking a picture with 110mm lens while riding a scorchbeast queen" is a skill based task.

I didn't do anything and it worked fine except for no saving only loading. I got a prompt on load that said "SFE detected incompatible version and will be disabled, check nexus for update" or something like that. I don't use a map mod so I can't help there. I'm only using SFE, Perk Loadout, Silent Chameleon, and Better Sorting.

That‚Äôs why Bethesda needs to separate balance between PvE &amp; PvP. Bungie has this problem with Destiny 2. Just because something is op in a PvP sense doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs op in PvE. Of course you shouldn‚Äôt be able to do 8k a hit with a DCG but honestly the only way to even beat a SBQ currently is melee‚Äôs lol. If you have a group of 10 people using all guns you‚Äôre gonna be pushing it close unless it‚Äôs 10 god roll guns with perfect builds which just isn‚Äôt likely in any sense. I don‚Äôt want this game to become a game where you‚Äôre considerably weaker than everything else. If Bethesda has any sense they need to 1) find a way to balance between the two or 2) start buffing other builds &amp; weapons instead of nerfing before they make us too weak. Trust me this community will get really stale &amp; bored if they nerf melee to the ground with no alternative to it.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never understood this.  Then again, my camp is installed high up with a ramp low enough that you need to be a marsupial to get in to my vendor. After seeing two short-hopping visitors fail to reach (had to drop them a damn staircase) I had to redesign to accommodate all these non-mutated pure bloods. 
---
Maybe I should vend marsupial serums below and have the rest of the workshop above ;)
---
Is it still 4 star?
---
Didn't you hit scrap all?
---
I was one of first doing that quest so i had bugs there on all places. Sorry if you have them dead.
---
I mostly was trying to point out that when it comes to minor bugs/glitches -like bulk scrapping- that shit gets put at the bottom of the list, those that work on this stuff know that if it causes major problems they may get pulled off fixing the T-posing raider in the arena to fix it. But they would get extremely frustrated to get pulled off that to work on some other minor detail, then another and another  
---
too many people seem to think their pet bug should be brought to the top of the list, for no other reason than it is their pet bug
---
LMFAO I did the same fucking thing for the coder badge I would‚Äôve had my backpack. Code isn‚Äôt out i looked everywhere. Sorry to break it to you. I learned my lesson CHECK THE CODES BEFORE ENTERING THE SITEüòû
---
Was it some sort of sermon notes? I noticed someone do this earlier today on PC
---
Check wiki, there are some world guaranteed spawns of crossbow.
---
thank you!
---
Thanks :D don't get why the actual course that was already there isn't the one tho.
---
Their discount is you can just sell to them directly cheaper if you have something they want. Don‚Äôt we all hold back some of our best stuff for our crew?  :)
---
At least in adventuremode it is not possible anymore, only in surival and iam not sure if you can find the camps on the map there
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt pay attention either. Code isn‚Äôt decrypted yet. I solo‚Äôd the whole site because someone launched at alpha &amp; Charlie on my server just to get done with launch prep &amp; realize I wasted my entire night grinding for the backpack because I gotta re-solo tomorrow morning haha
---
I rebuilt my CAMP to include a Trading Post/Bar and a public crafting area but I have a locked living area to the side just so I dont have just anyone wandering in there. From what I have heard that is going to be an issue because fast travel could well pop someone inside that locked room ... if they dont end up in the extractor out back, the fusion generator or buried in the floor! Why couldn't they just appear outside the building area like I did when I came home?
---
I actually did hit scrap all the first couple times I did the quest, but this last time I swear everything just disappeared. I know the radroach meat can go bad but the other things shouldn't, right?
---
Correct, but thats long way. Anyway i am melee and witht this backpaxk i have nearly 300lbs. So i don't need to carry stupid power armor.
---
Honestly some of these tadpole challenges are pure bullshit.
---
Nope :(
---
why is that?
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue, I made it through tadpole and got my backpack but the skin isnt applicable.
---
I don't wear PA, but my life saving chest piece has saved me from sooo many accidental falls.
---
Yeah, but you wrote that in response to my discussion on PLAYER VENDORS. On those only 1/10th of the caps are lost. Not 3/4th,
---
Exactly. I spent the night converting my nearly maxed caps into a heap of ammo so I could put my own vending machine live without all the caps going to the house.
---
Grandfather Nurgle always Yes.
---
Hmm, i tried drop that one i got from quest and game told me it will be destroyed. So i belive it is not tradeable, will look on it today
---
No, I‚Äôm squishy. It took maybe two minutes.  
---
I couldn‚Äôt find a way to not totally die, lol. I think they just settled for the slow but sure way, because I suck at both dying and not dying apparently.
---
All this patch was is busy work. Is it worth it? To some, yes. To me who lives in power armor? Not really.
---
speaking of which.. where do i get the damn Brahmin Pen plans? im goign insane
---
Have you seen the possum ones? One of them has 35 requirements to meet.
---
Sold all fasnacht plans for 100 caps each, sold all my other plans at 50 caps a piece. Also sold a TSE prime minigun for about 9500 caps. My first day vending and I made well over 15000 caps. While I see other people charging thousands for plans I‚Äôm getting rid of my increasing stock of old plans. I only plan on using caps to buy other camp plans I don‚Äôt have. (Full unyielding, with perfect roll bloodied ss weapon). Unless you run into master traders from the 76 market you‚Äôre going to find a lot of casual players coming to you camp, you should have prices catch that player base as well. I could have sold them higher and waited to make the best yield, but I‚Äôm quite happy with how things turned out.
---
If anyone doesn't know this, you can move the actual camp thing around to slightly change the spawn point from fast travel. Learned this by having my base on a cliff a long time ago.
---
ask someone thats what I did,
---
Did anyone else notice they've named the frogs Prince?
---
Jesus.
---
We‚Äôre redoing it, I am such a derp..
---
My camp is on a cliff for the view. Sometimes I spawn halfway down the cliff but I never fall to my death. I wish I could place a spawn welcome mat. I‚Äôm sure the guy didn‚Äôt mean for that to be the spawn point.
---
I just got done playing and I can‚Äôt fast travel to peoples camps? Not only that, Bethesda broke the compass. I‚Äôm over here running north west and after a few mins of running the direction my arrow is pointing I end up further south east on the main map. This is weird and confusing. Even for a level 160+ playing since beta.
---
I just invited a guy to my team &amp; voice messaged him asking him to get downed next to a river near us so I could get the challenge.
---
Yep it's available to workshops, not camps. 
---
It has a funny thing if you leave server while on your workshop, with the fast travel mat placed, on next server you will start at that exact location.
---
I once ended up behind locked door with my alt, couldn't open it because it was too high level, and couldn't claim workshop either as there were enemies around. Had to exit and enter another server.
---
Anyone on PC in an hour who wants to do this together?
---
lmao u serious? I mean I would be fine with it if we would have to complete like 20/35 or something like that to pass but having to complete every single one of them is mad.
---
Well my native language is from slavic family so i am basicaly russian. Also i had drink some rum yesterday, but mainly i am on mobile so i can't check translator if i am writing atleast little correctly haha.
---
And man, u didn't see what you have to do for backpack mod plans...
---
Will dying from rads work?
---
Feel your pain brother lol it‚Äôs 1am here &amp; I solo this thing to get my last badge before I go to bed &amp; once I opened nuka crypt &amp; saw ‚Äúnot decoded yet‚Äù I wanted to jump out the window lmao I‚Äôve learned my lesson now
---
It may be fun, if you give it time and someone datamine those fucking exeams, they are real pain.
---
maybe, but sentinel's/unyielding/whatever the fuck legendary effect is meta this month, all easily outshine it, obtaining shocks for PA is often a difficult task, especially depending on the model #
---
Really?  I bought one off a guy dor 50 caps.
---
Some of the bots are in new rooms. So you simply have to look for them, maybe just in the room on the other side \^\^
---
Not anymore, well except ultracite. Every model of PA now has plans available to purchase. Even X-01.
---
Oh boy....that doesn‚Äôt sound good. I would like to put s sign on mine saying ‚ÄúTravelers Welcome‚Äù in neon, not sure if that can be done, but it would be nice. My camp is by Twin lake. I am on ps4, AvgGuy42 level 217. I willing to help anyone who needs it (just a nice guy like that...lol)
---
I have a couch next to my vending machines and I just sit there watching people come and go ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh its complete bull shit. Find a beaker, Collect 100 crops, smelt 50 of every ore, visit every watch tower again, kill 10 of every enemy, take a picture of every enemy, the list goes on and on.
---
I'm sorry that it took away what you enjoyed in the game, but while you may have enjoyed following someone home to attack their base, I'd assume most other people didn't enjoy that. PvP is one thing, and that still exists, but attacking and destroying the stuff people build gives me a sad face. I have a tent in the forest and I've tried to make it pretty and I come home and it's a place to relax. It's peaceful and almost less stressful there than what I've got going on in real life (games are escapism, and I guess for you that means destroy, for me it means relax). I'm sorry that the way I want to play spoils the way you want to play, but up till now it's been the other way round and I never understood what I'd done wrong when people broke my nice things I'd worked hard to get. I guess what you're saying is that I did nothing wrong, I was just there for your entertainment, but I'm proud of my camp and don't want bullies trampling it for fun. It sounds like school all over again!
---
I'm not arguing that this change has made the game different for you, but hopefully you see why this change has also made the game different for the majority of players, and for us, IN A GOOD WAY. I have no clever suggestions, as I don't PvP and only rarely team up (yet another social anxiety type here), I guess I just hope you can find something to enjoy in the game like I do, without it needing it be destroying other people's homes. Good luck.
---
i should've screenshot first but my brother got home from Texas so i turned off the xbox without even exiting the game
---
Took me 10 or so Biv dailies. Still don't have everything possible tho.
---
Well ok I guess fuck that I won't even bother completing tadpole then.  Someone at Bethesda is high af.
---
What did you do?
---
If you get a gatling with vampire, your sustain will be crazy. Otherwise I'd recommend on a small gun that fires fast with a med to big mag you can reload quickly, so you can pull it out quickly when you need heal.
---
Yeah, already to begin mission, its in the toxic valley which is like a LVL 15-20+ area, then it goes through areas within the mire which is even higher and to complete it by advancing from tadpole to possum, the 3 scout world Challenges could be quite difficult for people at a low level and they take you all over the map so if you haven't been to those locations and unable to fast travel. You'd probably spend alot of time traveling and end up just getting side tracked
---
I play on pc as well but I was lucky enough to join a group of players early on, now there's about 20 in our discord I can invite u if u want.
---
I agree. Far more tedious than fun. The fat man related one will be fun but the rest I am dreading. I assume they will be updating them so perhaps future ones will be easier but if they are all similar to this, I am going for one backpack mod and that is it.
---
'
---
you might have a full stash, the wieght is shared between your stash and the vending machine.
---
same as me  i wonder if sold out but server not update??
---
Yeah I‚Äôve tried all the ones on this server but I have to go do rehab for surgery so I‚Äôve had to log off for a bit.
---
I‚Äôve found everything but the one I actually want haha
---
Now you understand how angry i was doing those stupid exeams.
---
I was little drunk writing this and yeah my english sux, but i don't need it in my life so.....
---
This part is fucking easy, go to that lake, run around, find where is that ugly speaker, wear swimsuit, do what it tells you to do and go away.
---
Day 15 : We got ambushed by 3 scorched beast had to abandon the junk we had collected.                *Insert graphic words here*
---
They are just decoration and have been in the actual datafile for at least 3 patches. Need to get the people who do image data mining to work with the actual data miners and coordinate these things
---
That didn‚Äôt work for me, but I could have done something wrong. Tried straight up drowning and it was instant kill.  
---
Jumping into water at our first spot was instant kill.
---
Other times it seemed like it downed me, but then it killed me before I could be revived. So confusing.
---
Awesome. How much would you like and will you be on in a few hours, I have to pop out for a few. :)
---
I just ran around watoga
---
I saw him. Put my rifle away and tried to approach him. He didn't even fire on me, just kept saying "run away" as he limped off. Poor thing.
---
Lol when the majority finally completes tadpole I'm looking forward to the "Screw this shit" show.
---
Thanks you all.... This has been very helpful....
---
Have a nice day....
---
So how does that make them PTW?
---
You can have up to 4 vendor machines in a camp and the object isn't connected. Maybe you just looked a machine that was stuff that was already sold and they had the plans inside the other machine
---
thanks, i reran it and it worked fine, not sure how I fumbled it the first time :P
---
It's a storyline in the Campfire Tales event at Camp Adams.
---
Leave ESO out, fortunately is not made by Bethesda
---
Pioneer scout camp at night. Camp Adams to be specific
---
The leather one isn‚Äôt too bad, easiest one I think
---
I was one of your visitors yesterday I believe. I got a bounty trying to let myself out!
---
Made 8000 caps today ..... selling stuff I wanted to clean out .... mostly at reasonable prices (couple things I overpriced cause I liked them but wasn't using them).
---
Did NO grinding at all.  Sight Seeing.  It's nice to be rich.
---
Same here. I gave up even checking anymore. Then today I go to Whitesprings and I get attacked by five at once!
---
i text someone in game for the revive and ally quest and got it done.
---
The map doesn't often show owned workshops, or that that their owner have left. 
---
Could really be that.
---
Compared to two weeks post-launch, how is the game now? Seems like a good patch so far, but is it worth the download again?
---
We've gone through these arguments billions of times. The only argument against this was that repair kits don't over repair, so getting them was inferior to actually repairing using mats. Now it's no longer the case.
---
Spoilerinos.... would have loved to hear this first hand but it was all in the title.
---
Would you say it was the best quest ever made by Bethesda? :)
---
You don't need other people. But it will help with objectives like "revive a fellow player". When I went begin the quest, there was another guy there. I just sent them a team invite, did the follow me sign and jump in the irradiated water. They understood, followed suit, we received each other and then actually went off to complete the other objectives together.
---
There was no such bonus for 100%+ condition on ranged weapons. Taking the bonus away from melee seems fair to me.
---
Um, ok. If I was you, I'd just not play the game. That'll show them!
---
With the wiffle bat paint best weapon ever
---
Hahahaha thought as much... cheers for the heads up üòÅü§£
---
i messaged one and it said offline while camp is still visible. so, i wonder: is my camp still visible??  
---
do you have xbox? if yes, sidelingtexas74  
---
my brother is asleep in living room so i cant turn it on.
---
Would like more songs  
---
and more stations, bluegrass, honky tonk, country and western, traditional folk. etc.
---
your stash might be full, stash and vendor machines share the 800 lb limit.
---
Smort!
---
Sounds like the Brahmin steak was pretty warm
---
There was a group of people on tonight who took turns jumping off the smokestack at Grafton Steel (near the Pioneer camp). Making it all the way to the ground injures you enough that someone has to heal you - easy way to meet that task.
---
I ended up with the Stingwing one
---
Walk into lake, let rads build up, aim explosive weapon at feet, profit.
---
Yeah, that's what I figured out, some quests you need someone. That's why I thought what the heck... We can do the whole thing together. :) I'll wait a bit more and then I'll just start it myself.
---
you know what, it was mods.
---
but even with no mods, server keeps kicking me off. new features are cool though
---
Take off gunsmith if you have it on, and bash enemies. I did this at point pleasant. Bash a few scorched, repair the crossbow at the weapons workbench, and repeat
---
You need to have it on
---
Honestly this looks like a thread planted by Bethesda to improve 76's image, this does not seem real.
---
The exams will require that you have been to harvard. Like, no joke... they are fucking hard.
---
**Dissolves**
---
Each badge has a handful of requirements to be met before its earned.  The last step of each is to take the exam at the Pioneer Scout camp in toxic valley.  You can see your progress under ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù then ‚Äúworld‚Äù and scroll down to the Tadpole section.  You have to earn three badges to demonstrate the quality of ‚Äúpersonal growth‚Äù for a scout promotion.
---
It seemed to me tonight that people are spawning right beside the camp box. I had it beside my foundation and it was giving people all kinds of grief. Moved it onto the ground beside my patio/deck and it's working much better.
---
You can repair the same one three times. I did it using repair kits dropped from Queen fight
---
Tell me your secrets. I‚Äôm sitting around... 760 total on my person.
---
had 21k now 4k, thank you vending machines lol
---
On the flip side I bought like 100 scrip worth of junk legendaries from people's camps today, for under 1K caps
---
Hotdog constant spawn at near the top of Poseidon. Go up the stairs, etc, up to the top level that has the little room with a safe and a caps stash. Outside that room, right along the edge of that platform nearest to the giant teapot you can find a couple teddy bears having a little picnic and you should find a hotdog. 
---
Sorry for my lousy description.
---
Literally took me all day.  "best quest we ever made" my ass! Has Todd never play3d their oblivion dark brotherhood questline?
---
Yeah I really events which makes people end up doing stuff together. Without forcing people to do things together
---
On PC as well, usually play solo. Would be happy to pitch in with this one. My in game name is MisterTerrible, will keep an eye out when you're on. I'm looking to combine this with the revive in water as well if that's cool. Hope to catch you.
---
It was unintended behavior and it has now been fixed.
---
Maybe next patch they will also fix the unintended ravenous fusion core drain with VATS/Power Attack that is not mitigated by Power User or the relevant bobblehead.
---
Player vendors- bought 2 today :)
---
Someone can build PA stations in your camp if you want to focus on something else. Also I am not entirely sure, bit on my first character, I think the Miner Miracles quest granted them for free.
---
Thought so. Thanks.
---
Is pizza worth it? You think i should buy one? 
---
   Why does your dog think? What does your grandma think?
---
  What do you recommend  to put on my pizza?
---
That's why I specified npc vendors when bringing it up.
---
What platform you on?
---
I think inventory management is what it means to be in business.  Price the first one or two of everything reasonably, and everything else at massive mark ups.  When the stock you want to sell for the day is gone ... shop is closed for another day.  The buyer knows you have more for them in the future, and will adjust the prices accordingly then, so as not to go over your limit now.
---
I used google search Process of elimination using the answer words. Its still early yet. But a YouTubed called riflegaming has a few tests. Sorry I don‚Äôt have a clear solution for ya.best of luck
---
Words mean little to them.
---
But dem repair kits and have at it.
---
If you‚Äôre well off maybe some light wood laminate
---
I wish I had found your source, rather than the shoddy one I found.
---
I called last week and said I would have figured 4 months should be a reasonable amount of time to respond to my ticket. They said they were not in a position to say what a reasonable amount of time is and that it‚Äôs still being investigated.
---
I'm close to having a fucking Britney Spears level meltdown with just the exams. I'm jealous that you have a backpack.
---
It's pretty fun so far though, so if you end up in the toxic valley anyway, you may aswell start it
---
When a gauntlet can do 50x more damage than a 308 bullet, you know the ‚Äòbalance‚Äô is an incompetent joke.
---
Thanks for letting us know.
---
We post-poned for tomorrow, honestly i have a level 155, 82, and a 51.. In all my overly played hours I have never done this. It was just bound to happen hehe.
---
And you could fix it?
---
Sell a man some water, quench his thirst for a day. Sell a man some Nukashine, have him walk up butt naked in the Cranberry Bog :)
---
No. They SAID they fixed it. Can‚Äôt confirm or deny...
---
Yeah, most of those items are junk, which dont CND
---
Dude those fucking exams are the worse dude and I mean it's cool of your carry weight is low but they give you a level 20 backpack that look like a sack of POTATOES.
---
Indubitably.
---
They were ok at best last patch, now it seems better to use just standard shotguns instead, they got nerfed so fucking hard, even with full demo expert they are terrible
---
Hahahaha, yes.
---
You can craft a level 50.
---
Is the way to go man, 'best quest we have done for FO76 so far man'.
---
Just revisit every minute thing you have done for the last 1300 hours all over again... 50 times more.
---
WHO FUCKING KNOWS WHAT PRESIDENT WRESTLERS. Sports are not for this lady, I felt so dumb with these exams..
---
I have 5inteligence so it took me 40kills to broke it first time. I can imagine how long it must take to broke it from 200%
---
How the heck do I "control pests at dolly sods?"
---
Been killing crickets but it's not going away lol am I not supposed to kill them?
---
How do you even do it? I took off aqua girl and drowned myself and it wouldn‚Äôt let my friend revive me
---
Check wiki on guaranteed spawn points for crossbow atleast
---
But I need 3 pioneer badges for the plan and really? Did you try it out?
---
about time!!!!!

No one needs a sight for a gun you use against giant enemies. Aim in the general direction of SBQ and let ‚Äòer rip :p
---
Had a few hundred for sale, sold them at default 10 caps each. They sold like hot cakes xD
---
Lol! I'll keep that in mind.
---
Yep. I could. Just gotta make sure it's the Deluxe one.
---
Went to look for a tourist for a new replacement camera after the patch. Checked a tool case nearby and there was a broken camera that I was able to fix up at the Tinkers bench.
---
Loot, don't scrap bring back. U should see spawn points of different bugs on map, marked by quest.
---
I have clear now that this is related to the building budget. If you have reached the max, you can no longer sell anything. Nor place anything else in the fermenter. Nice bug.
---
Definitely feels like you're using pvp as a cap farm. The cap on earnings from player kills definitely helps alot more of the community that it hurts. And the act of killing other players is still fun and survival mode is just as good even with this change imo.
---
Usually 300 to 500 .45 and .308 each, 50 .50 cal ball and usually 600 to 800 shotgun shells.
---
Go for mammalogist, archery, and swimmer. Those are the easiest three. I upgraded my backpack to level 50, has an increase of 60 carry weight
---
And you owe us 7 years of taxes, due to your mother and father abandoning you.
---
I‚Äôll do it- you can trust me.  Muahahaha
---
For real, though, none of my irl friends play this game, but I‚Äôve made friends in game and they‚Äôre trustworthy with transfers and all that- even give me good weapons if they get tired of it, so I reciprocate with stuff I know they want. I agree that there should be a better way, but say hi to randoms out there (and with player vending it‚Äôs even easier), and maybe you‚Äôll find a couple ppl you like playing with down the road :)
---
Collect the yellow waste and put it in the blue bins.
---
2 hrs and 20 minutes trying to answer all exams.Still need 2 exams to finish.This has to be the most unfun,boring and time consuming idea i have ever seen in a video game.Bad,really bad.It's a "google search simulator.What happen BGS you guys suddenly start making good content but then shit all over it by unfun ideas like this freaking exams.I wont play this game if you make this kind of ideas more often,thats for sure.
---
Lmao sound like my friend. She put bunch of shitty stuff for ridiculous prices xD like a random note for 2k, non legendary items for 5k, fusion cores for 3k, power armor pieces for 25k each lol
---
I stood in the boat that has a little bit of water in it at the pioneer scout camp and shot the ground with a explosive weapon.. was really easy that way and a bunch of random people and myself got it done
---
It is scattered about and should have markers above it if quest is active.
---
They're available on their website üëç you just need to login I think (did it a while back so I'm can't remember 100%, but it was pretty simple iirc)
---
I already did archery and swimmer. I'll try mamalogist and I'll see 2 more that are easy hopefully
---
I like having exactly one piece of chameleon armour equipped and just... walking round a corner and crouching in a bush. It‚Äôs surprisingly effective at losing people.
---
Good source of antiseptic and acid though.
---
Same, same. I also got the Hunter badge going but I have no idea how I'll kill a bear with a Syringer...
---
If you have a mic you can just walk up to people and ask. I just did, its really that simple.
---
Trading individually means I have to make sure whatever they want is in my inventory. Inevitably I end up forgetting something, or they remember they needed something else, and I have to leave the trade. Then go back into my stash, and trade again. Often this is multiple ppl. So I do it for one teammate, then go through it all again with the next one. Just thought it would be nice to have one place for everything. xD
---
oh I searched. but got nothing. Well hope mods will delete my unintentional repost =\\
---
Who the fuck is he and why should I care about anything he does?
---
Yeah i spend too over 2hours only answering that bullsh*t , i hope someone datamine all answers before i will do those for mods.
---
True true. Thank goodness for my friends and their free teleports.
---
Why not delete it yourself? You have that power. Yeah I just put 'Internet historian' in the search bar. Funny that.
---
What is market value on those anyway?
---
I've played since launch, and I don't understand why I'm getting downvoted.  I had my house on the golf course so I could fast travel there for free in order to get that sweet, sweet mineral water to instantly heal me and cure my diseases.  I built a cool looking house and it didn't have any turrets or anything, as I've said, so it was completely unrelated to the golf club farming.  It was further south than the golf club, on the little walkway bridge, so I don't get why it needed to be removed.
---
Yeah I see them, that's what the robot gives you this is for the 4 pillars of the scouts or whatever, it doesn't show up on the map
---
I mean, this isnt a single player fallout game.
---
yes it runs smoother but I did get 7 game crashed in 3 hours
---
Number 2 could be intended, but then they need change the message.  Number 1 is a bug. The inspect option only is available when the owner is near to his camp.
---
This makes me wish we can get actual bulletin boards at some point
---
Happy to help out on anyone on PS4 who needs a buddy to finish any quests. I‚Äôm on nights in Australia.
---
I knew that one outright for some reason.
---
Kind of yeah. I think its the Start of a little QoL thing for upcoming dailys like biv or the new scout quests.
---
Got also one i couldn't Start which said find to defend a Station. Mysterious.
---
On PS4 a max level bloodied swingspeed +1 strength bat is max caps now.
---
Submit this on their website not reddit
---
Reading the title of this I was thinking "They've added *eaters*, what are they?  And what is *right* about a *legendary eater*, they sound horrible".
---
I just asked other people in the area via mic if they wanted to help. It is a new enough objective I had a friend in no time.
---
Wait- you can‚Äôt build a third story?  What are you doing wrong?  Build one story, add a staircase, platform of upper floor pieces, then add another staircase in the same plane as the last staircase. Rinse repeat until you hit upper limit (usually around 4 stories?). Check some YouTube stuff for hints if you need
---
got a AA FSS +1 AGI power fist lvl 50 for 5k
---
Everyone would be pissed if you could buy it
---
I believe it‚Äôs for the legendary vendor/scrip.
---
Turns out it's a proximity related bug. If the owner of the camp is nearby, you can inspect, and if they're farther off, you're s.o.l. Weird, and most definitely a bug.
---
Seems like a bug fix tbh lol
---
Agree with op.   I quit MMOs due to gated content to progress forcing me into groups. (Let's not get into the mmo and solo player debate!)  
---
Fo76 has enough aspects of a mmo for me with other players around and I help if I can as only low level myself.
---
Please don't force us into groups to progress Bethesda especially as there is no in game chat other than mics and many like me dont like using mics.
---
Why do you even play this thing if you‚Äôre so easily led into nonsense controversy? How old are you?
---
If the seller is away from his camp it doesn‚Äôt work, tested it a couple times seems to have been the case
---
Thanks, but I ended buying one plan in whitespring. I'm always on the archery part but I'll tell you if there are some points to clarify later. Thanks for your help!
---
I put up a lvl 1, 1* hunters hunting rifle for 25k for a giggle
---
They who shall not be named are prob back
---
Saying "a vendor" in a discussion about player vendors is not really specifying NPC vendors, but hey... whatever works for you right. Good luck.
---
Why would anyone ever consider buying them? Just kill the queen, lol. I've got 95 backstocked and have used over 30 of them.
---
Athlete was pretty easy
---
I've been trying to complete the musician challenge and am having the same problem, kind of a bummer..:/
---
Any tips on which to avoid due to bugs?
---
That's the news part i told you about.  You probably cannot start it because you already saw and used the new legendary machine.
---
But if you pay attention to the text,it says they heard strange machine noises at stations....because that machine is suoer loud.
---
What quest is this seperate or the same quest? Because nothing pops up for me
---
The (broken) camera now spawns in places other than the tourists.
---
Ah yeah I‚Äôll have a look when I‚Äôve finished the quest I‚Äôm doing rn
---
That's was my 3rd one. The 3 of those were easy
---
Awesome job !
---
It absolutely does not scrap stashed stuff, what are you on about?
---
Already done the mutagenic goo, but now, with your information, I can make a better choice of what to do next, depending on how easy or annoying it is.  
---
You are amazing! Have an upvote, you deserve it!
---
Oh my!! This is a hell of a RP idea!
---
Imagine - wearing the steel worker uniform and the yellow hard hat lol
---
And then imagine when seeing someone raise up their camp and just stand there, with a drill and that outfit ...Silently and fire up the drill... lol
---
Or you could go to the entire green part of the map and one hit scorched in exchange for ammo and scrappable weapons
---
Omg yes dude please you or someone do this and send me pics
---
Right genius...   It was patched.  It used to not require thus this post is very old.
---
There‚Äôs a course there yet they make you run the actual bridge it makes no sense
---
Just server hop Wavy Willard's. The Tourist spawn is right near the spawn point, straight ahead at a car. Hop a dozen or two times, you'll find it soon enough. Just throw on a podcast or something in the background lol, and when you find it msg everyone you know who is online to save them the hassle üëç
---
In the grim dark future of the apocalyptic wasteland,  there are only owl masks.
---
That's the plan.  That's what I love about farming mothman eggs.  Easy kills on the scorched.
---
Ya, only took me like a dozen Wavy Willard hops and I got mine pretty easy
---
If you wanna be efficient with your time this is my method.
---
Definitely about repair kits
---
Bethesda said it could be played as one, though. They've always encouraged teaming up, but they've always said it isn't required.
---
How did they kill you ?
---
It‚Äôs not anyone else‚Äôs fault you have reading comprehension problems.
---
How did you get killed in Adventure mode not being in PvP anyway?
---
I‚Äôm not sure what weapon it was, but the guy who came in killed me in seconds.
---
I hope not.
---
Also. I'm on PC
---
What platform are you on?
---
Not what weapon...how come you were able to be pvped on adventure server?
---
Sorry for not clarifying
---
There was definitely an amazing new vibe playing tonight. The player shops just added a final awesome factor. There was a huge community and I had some really great player interactions, just checking out everyone‚Äôs shops. I really, truly love this game.
---
I had that problem earlier which stopped me from buying a few things, weird because I could have sworn I could inspect things at a friends vending machine. ü§î
---
Probably survival mode. Not sure why anyone would wanna go shopping in survival mode.
---
&gt; WHO FUCKING KNOWS WHAT PRESIDENT WRESTLERS
---
Is it Andrew Jackson? I think it is for some reason.
---
I picked up a 1* bloodied lever for 200 caps today. Huge damage boost over my bloodied handmade, and I dont like my 550 damage gauss at all so it was a great upgrade all around
---
This might be good or bad. That means legendaries won't be crazy expensive with the legendary vendor, just getting currency to buy them takes a long time.  This time they made sure dupers can't screw this one up.  Unless the dupers find a dupe exploit in the legendary machines themselves.  
---
BSG thought this out... a long time....  and will still SCREW UP the pricing on legendary items with the vendor where everyone feels scrip is undervalued.  They will then put a more reasonable scrip/legendary price ratio in the next patch or two.   OR.... BSG will make the legendary items cheaper than expected and everyone will orgasm and BSG will immediately hot patch a nerf and people will flip out and grumble.  I'm betting on scrip being worth less than it should initially, but want to be ready if they go the other way.
---
I don‚Äôt know. It was confusing to me too. Did they get rid of the slap damage in its entirety? That‚Äôs what I assumed but the player killed me in just a few shots
---
Current assassins sentinel price 100k min
---
Unless you were in survival, this isn't possible. Slap damage has been removed entirely.
---
If they were on survival mode then this isn't an exploit or abuse of any system. death and looting is working as intended there.
---
Hey man I tried to do the swimmer one where you need to revive someone near water but it wouldn't work. What did you do to complete it?
---
Jup I know haha
---
Idk this sounds pretty smart to me...because why would you try to trade in survival or with a bounty? it's like asking to be murdered
---
No you would have to be in pvp mode with them for them to kill you. Did you have wanted level from picking lock or something?
---
I'm 5000caps richer üôè
---
camps still exist in whitespring.....on the prime spot (river with the little row boat) is still blocked in nearly any session. tho it is possible to finally finish the unruly golfer quest the patch notes are wrong regarding the camps. IF it wouldnt be possible players should get the "camp could not be placed" msg
---
Honestly, max caps is only ever 18 days away, maximum, just from the Vendorbots pool. If you actually run around killing stuff, doing events, grabbing cap stashes, and not fast traveling all over the place you'll be getting at *least*  a few hundred caps beyond that, shortening your timeframe under 2 weeks easily.
---
And all that is without Reddit, just from playing a few hours a day to clear the Vendorbots cap pool and a doing few events/quests (which usually pay at least 25 caps).
---
Same here haha. Will add u in a few mins
---
Also the mounted stingwing
---
It's a good game
---
Dispenser?
---
I hear you, Especially since it lags. Sometimes I‚Äôll pick up a weapon and won‚Äôt get the animation until I pick up another item and then all of the sudden my entire screen is covered.
---
Pretty sure they have to be in water for it to work
---
Those skull head decorations look like shrooms lol
---
Because any time we say anything we get downvoted and trolled to the moon
---
Wrong. Trapper armor does require 2 ballistic fiber to repair a level 45 trapper armor pieces with a max level white knight.
---
I guess bethesda shadow nerfed the armor
---
Yeah we tried that but when one of us died in water we couldn't revive!!? God its gonna be a ballache
---
Nope. Diffuser. It's the last on under the Medic badge challenge.
---
I just spent 20k
---
Got mine after a lot of tedious work. I finished Athlete, Archer and Codebreaker.
---
I wasted my time on Medic, Mammals and Reptiles.
---
It is in the hills near vault 76. Spotted it the other day. If you follow the road between the lumber mill and the 'haunted' cabins it is on the northern side of the road. I actually took a photo of it because it was so odd but I can't post it at the moment.
---
I believe I made it pretty much of the way through tadpole. But for some reason I can't get the other parts of the quest to kick in.it doesn't give me any information about the next step it tells me what has to be completed but nothing shows up on the map.
---
&gt; Plague doctor mask
---
I would immediately buy this.
---
I believe you still need to find the tourist to start the quest and get the zooming lens, though
---
I've gotten Jetpack plans about 50% of the time, from my last 10+ SBQ fights. Plus a Prime Receiver plan  every time....
---
Last night I was able to inspect items. Now it doesn't work lol
---
Holy hell; this didn‚Äôt get destroyed by the hate train?
---
U mean dupers?
---
Neon signs are available but it is finding the plans for them. I saw someone with neon name above his door and it looked awesome. Various vendors were mentioned, Watoga among them.
---
Only way to inspect is if the owner is near
---
It seems like after every round of patch notes there's a "thank you Bethy" type post. I want to be optimistic, but I'm also waiting to figure out what got broken with this patch that they're not going to bother hot fixing and they'll just re-fix next patch.
---
Yes, I meant "what is a stimpack diffuser, maybe they made a typo and it's a stimpack dispenser".
---
I'm on Xbox and I only had the game freeze one time this evening. I had to restart my unit.
---
Topiary.
---
I'm in the same situation as you. All my friends who play the game gave up on the game during beta so no one plays it anymore.
---
And I'm just not someone who's interested in finding someone random that I do not know to help me finish a quest.
---
I am on the Xbox and have no problem with sound. Is the volume up on your TV?
---
I never heard official word that it was, but I guess. Seemed like it made perfect sense for armor at least.
---
I like you guy. This is my sentiment exactly. I had a thriving raider faction and it was probably my favorite thing to do in any game ever. Never just came a stomped camps. We‚Äôd interact with the owner, ask for a ‚Äútax‚Äù and be on our way. They could leave the server, play along, fight back, or whatever. It was almost always a fun experience for everybody. This game relies on its players to create their own story because they didn‚Äôt bother to make one for us. Sad to see the game lowered to this level to please a bunch of whiny kids. 
---
Also to everyone saying go to survival you‚Äôve clearly never played it. It‚Äôs hot garbage and after today‚Äôs patch you can‚Äôt destroy camps in survival either! Fun Fact! Even if their turrets are shooting you. Can‚Äôt even dent em!
---
can i join please? 
---
psn: gabih5n1
---
I mean I do a lot of repetitive stuff anyway and visit old locations. So I'm cool with this, it gives me reason to do the same things but elsewhere. I get its gonna be time consuming, but I dont really want to do the same things in the same spots forever. This is a great reason to explore again.
---
Yeah it's always been in workshops, but not CAMP for some stupid reason.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll probably stay in the forest for a while
---
Thanks for warning me about this, i‚Äôll sometimes accept random invites from people assuming they just want to fast travel to my area for free.  But if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs possibly gonna happen then screw it.
---
Ah.
---
camps still exist there......so either your code didnt work out or you just promised things u cant achieve. especially the prime spot is still blocked... it kills the immersion massively. it shouldnt be possible at all to use any spot near whitespring as the bases mostly look like a pile of crap and just not fit in there  
---
for those who want that spots coz it looks nice.: youre not alone in this game. if you want stuff like that play FO4 but you cant expect others to tolerate your crap bases and vending machines.
---
that bug sometimes happens when you‚Äôre overencumbered after dying, happens a lot especially with unyielding build when the strenght bonus doesnt apply after you‚Äôre dead
---
Hunting rifle has a bug :( the standard .50 Receiver does more damage than the Refined .50 Receiver even though the refined one states improved damage. (Looks like it's improved relative to 308 not 50)
---
Also, why isn't there a Hardened 50 or a prime 50 for the hunting rifle?
---
Oh; I thought Bethesda just kind of gave up on making people try to find the tourist when I started finding them on the hood of the car right outside the Whitespring main entrance!
---
Aren't you lucky lol I'm also not really selling anything cool, mostly food lol
---
Switching characters to hoard caps? Fun.
---
Fix nothing. This was about making perks give no advantage over what a repair kit can accomplish.
---
&gt; There is no government
---
What makes you think the US government has gone away citizen?  We are still here, where we have always been, in the shadows.
---
It's gonna take me a few days to clear my stash for legendary scrip...Last couple months I've been saving all the 2-3\* legendary gear I can..(mostly Melee and robot armour as it's the lightest stuff) 
---
It's great that lvl of legendary doesn't matter, just the Star value, means I can do those horde events, get the 3 star legendary, and then sell it for scrip.
---
Haven‚Äôt been on since the patch, did they do anything to unyielding/bloodied builds? 
---
I don‚Äôt bother with ass/sent but if unyielding got nerfed too I‚Äôd b a lil salty
---
Yeah I've never had this happen in 400+hrs of play. I have chess pieces and robot models for months now, scrap all every day all day. Xbox.
---
My friend and I did this at wavy willards. We jumped off one of the elevated slides into one one of the toxic pools below(on the submerged steps) and it worked. Make sure you don‚Äôt have goat legs or serendipity equipped.
---
You also could have searched for distance of charity marathons, not just the Charleston one.
---
:D yea that sounds about right :D
---
shoot the yaoguay til 20% health and use syringer with bleeding effect.
---
Discovered this myself. Had a nice little overhead area that was attached to my tavern/bar CAMP, people just ran inside and were very confused. Went a lot smoother once i moved the vending machine inside.
---
It‚Äôs polk, I just assumed..
---
It was also one of the best Fallout DLCs ever, if not THE best.
---
It is. Gave me a misc quest to look at for strange machinery and when i went to the location it went away
---
True, has never been any bonus to ranged weapons . Melee only
---
Wasnt the recent burrows marketed as multiplayer content? (despite its actual implementation.)
---
Arent full fledged multiplayer dungeons / "raids" on the roadmap?
---
Will it be a problem that you cant solo then?
---
I think FO76 is perfectly "soloable" in an online enviroment. If anything overly so. There would have been no point to the entire multiplayer gimmick if there werent reasons to play together.
---
Theres a very small amount of things you cant do alone...in a multiplayer game. Its nothing to complain about really but i guess im in the minority :|
---
I believe it's the same thing.  I was confused about this as well because it says "pest control at dolly sods" but you actually kill pests all over the end part of the map.
---
Wait hold on
---
I have my camp on one of the holes at the very edge of the course
---
Am I safe?
---
I could be wrong but I believe when you play with others it's important to be a team. That way the rewards are shared.
---
It'll show any new developments, like it told me about the new legendary vending machines at the train stations.
---
I got those too and was confused but placed down 2 deathclaws just in case lol
---
Start closing the doors behind you (were you born in a barn) and I'll think about putting a switch in......
---
The system you're talking about is exactly how direct trading works already. The tax only applies to the machines, and I'm assuming it's because it's already so much easier to make caps now that they're attempting to stem the ever-rising inflation (because now the caps can just kinda flow in while you're out and about)
---
Your stash is safe from other people don't worry about that one. You only lose caps IF you accept a PvP fight in ADVENTURE MODE.
---
D R O N E
---
I think so. I don‚Äôt want to get long winded but this is about repairing with perks and kits on more equal footing so ‚ÄúI may as well buy some.‚Äù Bah.
---
An easy badge if you have a friend (the one requiring you to hack terminals):  have friend lock their personal computer (free in atom store) and have you unlock it (repeat for level 0-3 locks)... This eliminates the need to find the terminals or serverhop... Then final part of the same badge is to launch a nuke which take maybe all of 10 minutes or lessüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Camp Adam's, you'll be swatting mosquitos. All I got was rent plans. Only happens at night
---
Bulking ammo is the ideal, but another way to handle it would be allowing fractional cap pricing below 1 cap.
---
Ok, thats good to know :)
---
Edited my post to include that I play on PC
---
Just curious how you came into this info.  I don't really understand data mining and I feel like most of the time people say stuff and it turns out to be wrong.
---
Imagine pvping in this game
---
Cool I'm PC too. My game name is rych1981 I'm off work all week so I'm happy to team up with you if you want?
---
Ugh, annoying. But thanks for your help!
---
And dropping now too
---
And remember to realistically price your stuff.
---
Nah...it‚Äôs not worth playing. I only have 500+ hours into the game and beat the main story mode on 4 out of 5 characters...but still totally not worth playing. I also play it 5 out of 7 days a week for an hour or two a day...but as I mentioned before definitely not worth it. By the way, how about you buy the game and try it out, you might just play it and secretly like it...not unlike me.
---
... google Bethesda support...
---
Sure :) ill add you once i get on pc in like 20ish mins
---
I thought about doing this too, don't you need to be in a group with them though?
---
That's your fault.
---
Don't know why I like "Russians". Maybe because I grew up with Ruskies, Poles and Ukes and back then at least you all got along ....kinda .... anyway you're the only guys who understand Canadian winter (except maybe Minnesota) LOL ...so  –ó–∞ –∑–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—å–µ!  my friend! Drink the rum, speak broken friggin English and keep up the awesome playing tips!
---
Nice one, I'll be online in about 30 mins, I might have to duck in and out of the game as I've got some building work going on so might be needed from time to time.
---
I won‚Äôt buy anything from a floating CAMP. Plus I‚Äôll leave a bag of fertilizer at the door.
---
150 shells for 1 cap each.
---
Exactly. I used to sometimes get a status effect for bonus damage from over repaired shotgun, so I know damn well it was originally intended until they realized the money potential
---
Good point!
---
Got the poster, but missed this.  I'll pick it up tomorrow.
---
Dude!!! You're the best!! Right where you said it would be!!
---
Just to be a bit more specific for other people doing it, its almost directly north of "alpine river cabins", about as far on the north side of the road as the icon dor the cabins is on the south side. 
---
Are you on xbox by chance? Id like to hook you up with some ammo or caps or something
---
Yes!! I saw todays patch notes as the top post on this sub today, then checked out Anthem sub to find out the top post over there is fake patch notes. Its a good day to be a Bethesda Boy.
---
Stash is only your items. You only lose caps equivalent to your level if you engage in PvP. You can enable Pacifist Mode in settings which means you do no damage to players and vice versa. As long as you are not engaged in PvP your camp is now invulnerable. Building interiors are not instanced so you can come across other players (which means loose loot can be taken). All loot in containers is dynamically spawned for each player. So if you see say 5 caps in a suitcase, someone else might see shotgun shells in it. Yeah that's about it lol
---
They did not say they were a good professor :D
---
Nah ps4 but thanks anyway.
---
Lucky it was such a weird fund otherwise I would have totally forgotten about it.
---
Wish they would fix explosive weapon legendaries in pvp somehow 1-hit kill me in over repaired power armor, while tanking in no power armor.
---
This applies to adventure mode ( I don‚Äôt play survival so I‚Äôm not sure)
---
1. no, people can‚Äôt take anything from your stash, it‚Äôs player specific so if someone else looks in your stash box all they see is their own stuff
---
2. No you don‚Äôt lose all your caps if someone murders you, you lose a really low amount (like less than 100)
---
3. As of the update yesterday, no one can destroy your camp, unless they are hostile towards you. They can lock pick your doors to get in though. But enemies can still destroy your camp. If your camp is in the red circle of the nuke zone when the nuke hits then it will completely destroy your camp.
---
4. When you die you drop your junk, when you respawn you get a little waypoint showing you where it dropped so you can retrieve it (providing another player hasn‚Äôt already picked it up)
---
More than happy to help You with it. I need to do it as well. I am online at this moment. Give me a shout. Ps4 nickname is MTKristo
---
I'm on XB1, but I am increasingly seeing them on the hood of the car right in front of the Whitespring main entrance!
---
I restarted a new playthrough after getting the game at launch. I enjoyed it before, but it had problems. A much better game now. For people who waited to play the game until it got cleaned up, it feels like a solid fallout game again.
---
Oh and no people can not loot your corpse, only items you drop on death is any 'junk' on you, or aid items if in Survival.
---
Im also looking for a friend, that can help me with this challenge
---
Ha ha, they got you :P
---
Server hopping or regular play. The only thing I noticed is, when I change multiple server the hunger and thirst bars are at 40% in some of them. But this is not tested. I will have to check and reproduce it until I can confirm it as a bug or feature.
---
150 shells for 1 caps each, As well X-01 Nuke cola quantum paint for 150 caps.
---
Not too happy, because no damage bonus above 100%
---
Found one myself in front of the Waterpark thanks :)
---
Thanks man !!!!
---
Yes, I am terribly sorry you started responding about NPC vendors on my comment about Player Vendors. My bad, obviously. Terribly sorry once again.
---
This is one serious oversight.
---
although no damage bonus above 100%, which is bad... dissapointed
---
I resat 3 of the exams, the rest I passed first time. I am probably older than you, but I can confirm it is not a problem with the exam. Use google, type the key component to the question. I read a lot of interesting things whilst researching for the exams. Very informative.
---
Why the downvote?
---
I think both. My Gatling Plasma works just fine now.
---
I've noticed that when checking out what players have for sale (particularly legendaries) the "inspect" function works sporadically and it's a bit hard to make the right decision on purchasing when you don't know the legendary specs. üòä
---
Still not fixed - no damage bonus above 100%, which is bad... dissapointed
---
Hey let‚Äôs help each other! I‚Äôll add you now
---
Remember these questions are targeted at children earning merit badges, they‚Äôre educational, not tricks.
---
It‚Äôs Lincoln
---
I renumbered the rooms so now that's room 13 and has broken, worn down furniture.
---
It's four foundations big including the bathroom, so... quite many.
---
Yeah I've been getting that lately when I die in my excavator armor, for some reason as soon as I die the game forgets excavator's weight bonus and I'm instantly super overencumbered.
---
Yesterday it happened while I was defending dolly sods from another player, I had no respawn locations whatsoever because my workshop was the closest but it was being contested. Luckily the other player was killed by the mirelurks that were also trying to take over, so the workshop became an available spawn point again. üëåüèªüëåüèª
---
I just did it with a team mate in the pond by white springs
---
Or can they be free please?
---
Thank you for the answers! Seems more clear now :)
---
What's that you're in the middle of a fight and you've got a dozen ghouls running at you while a super mutant is hammering you with a mini-gun?  
---
Be a pity if we *totally blocked the centre of your screen leaving you effectively blind* wouldn't it....
---
jump to the left towards the dam from the left pipe draining from grafton steel into the lake. theres a yellow strip of shallow water before it turns orange and deep. land there with no armor or and you should need a revival.
---
Obvious question but are you a possum?
---
Yes, thank you. And sorry for all those "troubles" I think it had something to do with revive cooldown. Also sorry for kinda late response.
---
Did you both have to be in the water? 
---
Me and my girlfriend tried it with me or her standing in water and the other going down on shore by jumping a cliff.
---
Was awesome yesterday, managed to get nearly every plan I've been looking for. This is an excellent idea all round. :-)
---
Sent. I‚Äôm kuraidark.  I have a Kuja avatar and you have Zidane.  It is destined to be.
---
The bug fixes and vending machines/legendary scrips are very welcome, but I wouldn't call that scout nonsense "content"
---
Yes, advanced after finishing the order of tadpole
---
Can't tell you what to do, but the game development probably isn't affected by the atoms sale.
---
I've only just recently started playing, came in with my mic plugged in and switched on, expecting everyone and their dogmeat to be using them. 
---
So far, I've encountered 2 people who used their mic; one was a very friendly man from South Africa, the other was a young boy who was quite lost. Anyway, my point is; not many people are using mics in this game for whatever reason, therefore, their needs to be an alternate means of communication, outside of emotes.
---
Thank you! 
---
So I better build my home somewhere where people dont nuke then :D or move it
---
I found the poster and the terminal on the CAMP tab on the atom shop
---
I'm having the same troubles. Super effing bugged
---
Ah, so that is why some camps had multiple machines, I always assumed it was shared loot and limited to 30 only. So doesn't that mean someone could technically make ton machines to sell lot of items?
---
A nuclear key card for 50 caps.
---
Anything that requires a stimpak diffuser.
---
3 Star Vampire Explosive Railway Rifle with Faster Movement Speed while aiming for 3K on Xbox!!
---
Do you believe that the atom purchases affect the development in any way? I doubt it.
---
I‚Äôve bought about five of these things and I love them. I work a full time gig and have a life outside of work and video games but besides all of that, I don‚Äôt enjoy having to scavenge all of the time - I like to focus on quests. It‚Äôs about catering to ALL play styles, not just one. Is my use of repair kits game breaking for you? No, because I don‚Äôt engage in PVP. The comment you replied to has the strongest argument. If you don‚Äôt like them, don‚Äôt buy them.
---
There's a limit of 4
---
I really want them don't wait for big patch to bring balance challenges. Patch is great, but make things community want to be fixed part of the patch content isn't right. They should fix it on the fly
---
How about when you add stuff to your vending machines it puts it in your stash so the things you're trying to sell are taking up valuable stash room? Yeah...figured that one out when I couldn't add any more items to be sold but I had 18/30 slots filled. :/
---
Are you needing to pick someone up?
---
So, if I want to finish the hunter badge, I have to make the fertilizer brahmin farm, cause the flatwood ones don't work. Was the nerf to them that if someone milked them everyone else has to wait on a cooldown?
---
I think the repair kits are a superficial repair method. I believe the workbench will still allow you to increase the bonus repair.
---
text chat actually helps immersion. More people will be using it, meaning more easy communication between players. I barely see any mic users at all. There can even be different chat boxes for local area and for map-wide.
---
Yeah.. preferably in water üòÑ
---
Ah ok thanks for the info.
---
Alright I'll help you real quick before I get off
---
Actually, you can do stuff while that displays.  Saw that on Oxhorn's stream he did today.
---
Agreed. My god im gonna struggle with those exams. Im not good at complicated english. I dont know how im gonna pass the exams
---
Sweet!
---
Tested : 
---
"autostimpack" on an armor : doesn't work
---
"auto healing" on a powerarmor torso : doesn't work
---
Thanks bethesda to be so "explicit"
---
Oops. I did all the exams first.
---
You can setup a trap also without mats, you have only to check where people spawn
---
Could just be a hidden thing like the Easter bunny mascot head. They seem to take up very little CAMP budget to boot. Like, less than a picture on a wall.
---
This is why I always walk around in power armor at Whitesprings until im inside the main building lol
---
Even though I understand the english there's a lot of sports things and Appalachia specific nature stuff that is still very hard.
---
sold all my Fasnacht parade plans for about 200-400 caps each people were flooding in and buying them. I later found a camp were someone was selling them for over 10,000 caps good luck with that m8
---
Build your camp somewhere less popular, I've only had 'cannot place camp' thingy a few times in 691 hours.
---
may I join your server?
---
When there's no more room in hell, the Dead will walk the Earth
---
Someone bought T-60 jetpack plan for 3000 caps from me.
---
There is a collect option but I never thought to try that either :(
---
Jumping servers shouldn't  be an option when you spend 20 minutes to power up the power plants and some jack wagon can come and attack you for fun.
---
Is it hard because english isnt your first language?
---
Swim on your back
---
Chewing gum and swimming is a choking hazard 
---
Waving is useless
---
Xernophobia makes no sense
---
Really? In the first day? Banjo thinks you need some hobbies. Economies are ruined by exploiters, and exploiters discover this stuff first. Just play the game
---
Uhh when this dropped earlier today I saw prices fluctuate as people setup shops and traveled around. 1 cap per bullet is a fantastic deal any day of the week and heck shotgun shells sold for 3 to 5 caps per for a solid 3 hours. WAS NUTS!
---
Hey, uh, did something happen? :/
---
Can confirm. I usually build 3 in any workshops for fertilizer and then dispatch them before I log out for steaks.
---
some serums for 100 caps and the winter jacket and jeans for 1000 caps
---
Will do when Im home tonight. Unless you can add me today, Kaiser's Curse. Should be a gears of war icon if correct
---
Maybe this was their "a few times in 691 hours" today.
---
They don't anymore.
---
I hate those creepy three headed critters, my least favourite mutated animal.
---
24 and I'll play whatever the goddamn I want.
---
Move your camp a little to the left/right.
---
Or just try and delete things from top to bottom or edge to edge.  I couldn't delete stuff when it was over extending the green circle.  I left the game and came back,  it was gone.
---
I do play the game but I also love understanding the mechanics of it. This is a hobby to me lol.
---
Spend some caps on something.
---
Are these permanent like the rest of the plans now at other vendors? Or random rolls on server hops?
---
Yeah and because i am not pioneer.
---
Btw: in my country "pioneers" were communist propaganda for kids.
---
There was bonus damage resistance for armor/PA that's now gone. Also, range gives you the option to stay far away and attack while melee does not, hence melee should understandably be stronger.
---
Drop it, I had the same issue and dropping them destroys the backpack.
---
Still need help?
---
Permanent.
---
So with this Limit, how on earth would it destroy the marketplace? Now people will still sell gear for caps. So the low levels can buy stuff. In general, low levels don't have many legendaries, so how should they buy legs with scrip in glorious idea?
---
Yeah, just thought it was silly that I can't scrap it.
---
Hmm a nice clue, thanks Man! or Woman :))
---
Ill have to check this. I didn't even go to whitesprings yesterday as I went to Sutton station for the poster for the new quest lines
---
joining you soon, world full earlier :)
---
That is excellent :)
---
I may have to steal the idea lol
---
Do the leg vending machines spawn at every Railway station everytime or is it random? just went to a couple that had the machine last night, but not this morning.
---
We we‚Äôre both in the water. He just stood there and shot his legs with an explosive weapon.
---
This behavior is so disgusting, if anything it should be the other way around. Players should be given a compensation for the deplorable state this buggy tech demo has been in for months. It's like buying a dish at a restaurant, realizing the meat is still raw - and when the chef comes back and microwaves this train wreck of a dish you tip him?
---
They ran out of coffee in the patch developemnt computer lab, can you blame them for rushing, Starbucks was about to close :(
---
Im on PC and that's just ghosting stuff on map. When you log out your camp is gone. Its just a marker. 
---
Haven't you seen sometimes teammembers are still showing either as nearby compass marker, or on map, while they are gone? The client just doesn't fully sync changes, for whatever reason.
---
Looks like Days Gone with PA.
---
Aha I was wondering if it was slots per machine too! I even posted it in the patch notes page lol
---
Also, if you look at one vending machine, will it show you the products for the others?
---
Oh yeah i have
---
Are you able to find out what the vendor will sell? Mods? Random weapons?
---
Why would you attack someone spreading good information? What would an exploiter do with the knowledge of there being a scrip cap that a non exploiter wouldn't do? Regardless both will check legendary finances to balance it out?
---
I can't wrap my head around the asinine mindset behind this.
---
I don't know about a toggle, but atom shop items have an atom symbol in the preview of the build menu (in the same place where the red cannot build icon is if you don't know a plan yet). A lot of the posters are added as extra versions of the first poster you bought, for me most of them are next to the mothman poster. I hope you find yours!
---
Nice :)
---
Been needing to burn a hole in my pocket these caps are making lol
---
&gt; Also, what's with all the floating camps?
---
They're awful, anything that looks anything like a floating camp, even stupidly unrealistic buildings won't get my custom.
---
I was being hypothetical......
---
+karma thanks!
---
Nah I‚Äôm good thanks though!
---
Over on PC a surprising amount of ppl use mics. I just always leave mine on during popular events. I've met 3 good friends during events, one's even from West Virginia! Would make sense if less ppl had mics on consoles though.
---
Why would you drop the chassis? You deploy it next to a power station as if you want to enter it and then just use the station.
---
you have any frag i can borrow? i dont think plasma frag works ..
---
Haha I'm buying as much of them as I can in case they get taken away. Makes the X-01 a lot more useful now.
---
Np glad I could help
---
I made a Spotify playlist with my favorite songs from Fallout 3, NV, 4 and 76 and the Conelrad mod and some personal additions. Not all of them, just personal favorites. 
---
You're welcome to it:
---
https://open.spotify.com/user/rinus454/playlist/2RjzDCv3sdpdWTnhDCsOCU?si=ZY5qf9o9S_OqR_bLWJsnzg
---
91 songs so far.
---
Aww, I don't feel that way about it... I like visiting camps when the owner is present, it feels more polite than walking right in and creeping around their house by myself. :P
---
I have enjoyed seeing some cool camps but I still look at the map to make sure the player in not at their camp when I check the machine inventory. I feel alot of pressure if they know im checking out what they have.
---
I only have one myself.  Should we let some enemies kill us?
---
I was able to do the Atomic one. Got 7 of the music ones, but it's not registering when I play at The Nukashine or Rusty Pick, nor is it registering the guitar, bass, or snare drum when I play them. Also, I've killed 9 or so Deathclaws, and am not getting a hide. To be fair, I couldn't loot one because it's body glitched and fell into the cliff face next to it, disappearing into the map. So yeah, I'm done until they unscrew this buggy ass quest.
---
Yup although i dont have a big problem with the kits because of the encryptid event and queen both dropping them. I think the impersonator drops them i forget but i do know the queen does and those kits are 150%. 
---
I only buy the 100% ones if i have low atoms i dont mind buy 1 or 2 but i dont buy atoms just to get them. I bought the underarmor tacticians and the track suit. Thats all for purchased caps everything i earned through playing the game which is a whole lot more.
---
I respect everyones opinion on it.
---
it used your items from the stash when crafting or buliding I lost SO many mods that way in the early days
---
I came to see if this was commented. This is a really much better. PAs are so OP overall on pretty much anything. Regular armor now has a small bonus it desperately needed.
---
&gt;as viable as a PA build in terms of carry capacity.
---
Uh yeah.  Excavator gives little over 500 carry weight. PA doesn't weight, even weightless armor gets nowhere near the totals.
---
I'd just advise to not put up for sale more than you're able to earn before reaching cap limit. My husband had the same yesterday, he planned to buy a serum recipe to make room for items to sell, but he opened up shop before buying the serum so he was running through the bunker trying to get to the vendor while a player was buying his stuff and getting closer and closer to the limit... Ngl, I laughed at him for not planning that better. 
---
I just put up a couple items at a time, and depending on my caps level I'll add them back in if they get low.
---
I will try one more and then i will take a break until it's fixed
---
man, thanks alot !!!
---
But he never asked you to visit, and it is his CAMP.
---
How long is that quest line in real time? I get off at noon today (12 hour shift tonight), play time is limited today.
---
The buffer zone between CAMPs is huge ... appears to be the size of another CAMP build zone. I know this because when unable to place my CAMP I have occasionally opted to stay on the server and to have a look at what is preventing me. It is sometimes someone on the same spot but more often than not they are far enough away to be put of sight, but the software will not allow them that close. 
---
Why do I stay on that spot? I built on a resource node so I have some mineral extractor going. Acid often as that is rare, but lead is useful as is aluminium. It's a free resource so why not.
---
Ran out the clock on that one, couldn't find the last thing, whatever it is. Annoyed me. That and the million bloodbugs.
---
Faction wars but with vendor bots. Everybody bets on their faction
---
You lose caps equal to your level.
---
Thanks! :D ps level 500 holy hell
---
I build near junk piles and only have to change once or twice, my new site not at all so far.
---
Tell that to Nordic people...
---
When it comes to cold weather and bad spirits, only the Finns can compete with the Russians. I'm not from Finland.
---
&gt; lugging around a camera
---
Cameras weigh 0.1.
---
&gt; survival game
---
No, that's Survival mode, the game is primarily Adventure.
---
Get a vending machine and sell all your extra ammo. 
---
I sold shotgun shells at 2 caps each and got almost 10,000 caps from a single sale. I had previously been saving up to use shotguns but switched so I had a lot of ammo.
---
Now I have to clear my browser history again.
---
I also had this, I think it's a bug... Try scrapping a few items, it should then work.
---
The only fun? Are you on something? I‚Äôm 243 and use heavies. Other players use snipers, some use shotguns or melee.
---
Thanks squeakybeak. Very cool.
---
Sorry. Sure give me your Psn and i will add you :) reddit don't let me write my full name here
---
Will add you! I need this done too! Magness1993 add me in the psn!
---
They are often mixed in with other items ... like on wall decor on a row with other things so you do not see it at first. Having said that, the Pickaze sign I bought when on offer appeared under Lights ... I didn't even realise it was illuminated but there are other illuminated signs under wall decor so why change for that one?
---
I crafted one today to run around with and used it for a good four hours solid just ***thwipping*** stuff left and right. Right about the time I go to check the durability for the Archery badge I find out that not only was it not able to be repaired, the damn thing still had about half of it's bonus durability left.  
---
I ended up having to fight a world spawn crossbow to repair as mine still has too much durability left on it to repair it any  time soon.
---
Two things that really struck out to me personally
---
My 3 star Grongak Axe can finally go to 200%
---
Fast travel after 15 seconds with enemy's. This alone made me almost cry in joy
---
I literally just messaged someone this, " Hi! Can you help me? If you can could we team up and you get killed in water and let me stimpak you so I can complete this badge?" He said yes and we killed and stim'd each other then parted ways. It was easy. Just ask ppl for help üôÇ
---
Amen.
---
Oh I found that out..
---
This was clearly stated in the patch notes and is how brewing works as well...
---
&gt;  just keeps giving them prompts to "drink" so most players just follow the prompts 
---
As an alcoholic, yes.
---
I ended up running around bashing everything in sight with it. Seemed like that did a little more of a dent. The good news is when you get the bonus over you don‚Äôt have to wear it all the way down. So the actual repairs come pretty quick.
---
Except I never gave them any money. I live with 5 housemates and we sometimes share games / consoles. If I buy something from the atom shop, it's the first time Bethesda has been given any money from me for a game that I've been enjoying for quite some time now. 
---
So I actively appreciate having a way to purchase items, particularly in a situation in which the DLC is free.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
For funsies, I put some flamer fuel on sale at ZERO caps.  No takers :S
---
All their "improvements" are nice but as a long time gamer it's too little too late.  Fallout 76 won't be remembered as some great game. It's gonna be remembered as a game that was released broken.
---
Server hop the war memorial. It was the second place that an online guide told me to look, and sure enough.
---
The patch notes say its a main quest now. So hopefully it will pop up on your map when you make the quest active.
---
Well ill be taking a trip into the bunker tonight to spend some hard earned caps.
---
I just need to shift all the bulk junk im selling at my camp now lol
---
Wait until the heavy update.
---
What are you trying to say your wording is confusing
---
I always close doors. :)
---
Your right to an opinion does not make it valid.
---
y'all droning
---
And it still is a bit stronger. 
---
You also don't use ammo on melee builds and most melee weapons are quite light too... How many other advantages would you like to have?
---
psn k-o-d-a-m-a
---
if [you.ve](https://you.ve) played fo3/4, you might notice that all mutant voices have lost that [menace. Now It](https://menace.It)'s like a poor impression. I'de like the original voicing back. Havn't come across Grahm recently tho.
---
Concrete foundations as well. I do a lot of building.
---
I saw the workshop part but wasn't sure about the camps. And no i didn't try that but now i know what I'm gonna test later today lol.
---
Couple it with the one in luck i think its lucky break. I never repair unless its way low and lucky break didnt proc at all.
---
Good husband points :) I like that, I get wife points for making tea
---
But you do want to level up whilst diseased on chems, wearing a full clown outfit?
---
Also, having only 50 slots is irrelevant, simply attempting to take the photo is good enough for challenges. The image doesn't have to save.
---
I remember first buying this game back in November 2018 and played it for about a month or a little bit more, then got incredibly bored. Also got incredibly tired of the STASH restrictions, the bugs, the insane server instability etc. However, as of early April this year, I got back into FO76 and I've been on the game pretty much **every single day** since then due to the vast amount of added content, bug fixes and all the other patches that came along. 
---
Huge praise and kudos to Bethesda for getting stuck into things that players want and addressing all the issues to make FO76 a great game to play!
---
Thanks! I was wondering what the limit was. You must have had a lot of legendaries lol!
---
Yeah and then i would need to server hop x times before my camp could be placed..
---
Do you have discord? Or would you like someone else to set it up? I only really use discord, my mic is problematic and only registers for certain things FO76 not being one of them. I'll properly get on board with this in a week or so. Still studying and only logging in for little things.
---
I "think" you can get them as part of the repeatable quests aswell.
---
meanwhile me and my friend were entirely oblivious to everything online and just played the game. i honestly do not remember anything being a direct disaster. there was just other things like poor stability. but we never encountered any game-breaking bugs, exploits, or whatever, and while stability was more of a beta thing than a released game, not sure what part of the game i could have called "total disaster".
---
i mean... it was all kind of OK. not too bad, not that good. although the first few minutes of roaming around after exiting the vault was pretty epic.
---
ESO is Zenimax', tho
---
I think they were just in it for the LOLZ.
---
Does anyone else feel like this update is aproaching a 2.0 ? I had the feeling of fatcat pressure on the game developers but, I feel like we were a part of the development process.  And with enough support, Fallout 5 will be an actual community.
---
Would you place the preassure plate over the mat or the the mat on top?
---
Liked it for you. Now I just need someone to like it for me.
---
You have 5 characters and you're complaining about potentially wasting time on repetition....
---
I do have a lot but it's a 150 cap per day and 1000 cap total. Found it in the data files.
---
Hey also, just run everywhere! You will find a lot of stuff and level pretty quick. Kill what you can and run like mad if you cant! I did it with every restart i did; to me finding things out in this game without fast travelling is pretty fun. I do fast travel now since i have travel agent and im going somewhere i already discovered.
---
I had the same problem today. Do I need a special note or holotape for that quest? I moved all holotapes and notes in my stashbox, so if I only knew which one¬¥s the one that I need for completing the quest...
---
Can anybody help?
---
Try fast traveling near one of the spawns instead of directly to one. I've had more luck finding them that way, especially at the Fairgrounds and Bolton Greens.
---
Yeah I went from 20k to 12k last night, and I did a vendor run so between that and travel costs at least 1000 has been repo'd.
---
Like ‚Äúarmy of the dead‚Äù amounts of ghouls?  That might be interesting, especially if it were a limited event, like for a week or so, and you‚Äôd need to come up with strategies...
---
Is this a paid post, do you work for bethsheda
---
760? look at this Rockefeller MOFO. I literally have to think twice about fast traveling to an event near me because of the cap cost. But I also just reached Vault tec for the first time...so....
---
IV been getting random places, not even 76 or my camp. Example, last night I was making a run through th asylum, I died (my fault for not watching health), the only place it would let me spawn was the white powder lodge. It also charged me caps to spawn there as if I was fast traveling.
---
I think if this game as it stands today was the initial offering it would have had much better reception. But that is impossible, because without such incessant whining, it would have been an inferior game.
---
Yes, and there's lag.
---
Even just a deorbit means that you're hitting the atmosphere going upwards of 7500m/s.
---
You're not gonna make it to the ground. The heat from the pressure wave in front of you is gonna vaporize you.
---
Unpopular opinion: what makes Banthem's crap drops different?
---
One more question. Clarification actually. I have a camp built under a hydro tower. It's unique and i'm not liable to build like that again. However while i am running around i left it all, intact, doors unlocked, for other players to use as needed. (Friends always welcome, especially new, not made yet ones) .... Now if i decide to move camp clearly the building will be gone as I have not blueprinted it BUT what about the materials used to guild it? Do I lose them or is the raw building material returned to my inventory?
---
I see where he‚Äôs coming from though. It‚Äôd make more sense if the camera wasn‚Äôt insanely hard to find. if you don‚Äôt have a Reddit or friend to join when someone‚Äôs holding the tourist it‚Äôs probably a lot harder. 
---
I was lucky enough to have a friend msg me after he‚Äôd been searching for DAYS. Even then the camera is kinda stupid, it‚Äôs harder to use and obtain and the pictures are worse than just taking a screenshot anyway.
---
And melee can block, and can do grave attack
---
Nuke zones and events seems to give a lot of xp. Also quests and now since workshop are no longer world PvP, take as many as you can for the free fast travel and to generate defend type events. Just beware of griefers during those.
---
Follow some of the extended questlines, start grinding free range, uranium fever, violent night... stuff like that. Im 128 and from 50ish to about 89 was still unlocking perks and getting upgraded gear from those. Hope this helps.
---
*heavy attack
---
That‚Äôs untrue. Im level 180, I have never lost over 100 caps from being killed
---
I saw a mod for a chainsaw flamer, i didn't have a chainsaw but i can't wait to find out what it does when i do
---
No, mine is running smoother and more consistently than ever since Patch 9.
---
Mine is inside my shop next to a counter. The ground floor is a shop/workshop while the top floor is my living room.
---
If you spawn in wearing your excavator armour you have an extra 100 carry weight more than you're supposed to, so if you die and respawn you're losing that extra 100 bug and dropping to normal weight.
---
There‚Äôs ridiculous lag, I spent atleast 15 minutes on that legendary machine turning in guns which should of taken less than 2 minutes
---
+karma
---
You already can. Place down your CAMP-device and build your trap around that point. Done!
---
Right now you can build the traps, but you can't make the CAMP fast travel friendly unless you rebuild your entire CAMP to accept visitors appearing on the ground in the absolute middle of it.
---
Thank you! I had noticed that. Thats handy to mark the item when you know where the heck it is! But I keep looking!  LOL I was hoping they'd be near the paintings or the signs but nothing yet :(
---
I sold 150 for 7c each
---
I feel like this update is approaching a 1.0. I absolutely love this game the way it is now and I hope they will keep improving it and bringing out new content like yesterday. But it really should have been released like it is now. The fact that they were okay with releasing the hot mess 76 was in november is a shame.
---
This has **made my day** haha! Ingenious idea but also absolutely annoyingly uncalled for. 
---
But then again, it's that players CAMP so they can do what they want I guess!
---
Some saint was selling 20 stimpaks for 20 caps each, easy purchase
---
So uh, Can we still tame Deathclaws and Mega Sloths? I had a pet Alpha Deathclaw named Ringo that died awhile back and I haven't taken the time to replace him yet, Will I still be able to tame bigger creatures with a different perk or has it been taken out entirely?
---
My GF is Norwegian and most of her friends are Finns so i understand. They handle cold weather and alcohol with the same enthusiasm :)
---
[This is almost word for word the same post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm2p87/lets_talk_patch_9s_effect_on_the_games_design/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
From what I can tell it'll be random weapons and armor. Probably more like a slot machine than anything. I'll find out more in a bit
---
Please elaborate the type of item. Because the only thing I bought was a plan, which I received and the proper cap transaction was executed. The owner gave me heart emote after the transfer even, felt good.
---
It‚Äôs never enough, isn‚Äôt it?
---
I just killed someone at level 200 and got 200 caps for it
---
I am sure they have a logic to them ... it's just not one that i understand yet. LOL ...Thanks for the answer!
---
I had it when I was trying to sell things that weren‚Äôt in my stash box and my stash box was full

The punch bowl is currently disabled.

Just keep killing Deathclaws, you‚Äôll eventually find some.

i will as well. psn: moonadamt i don‚Äôt play in groups if i can help it.
---
That‚Äôs what I was afraid of. A lot of server hopping to see if the vendor has any good drops. More rng. And no ultracite Gatling laser :(
---
Strange, as I have tried moving my CAMP around and it affects where I spawn in a strange, unpredictable way, but visitors always spawn at the same place.
---
Super odd man I was feeling the same way. There were changes made that made me really believe we have all just been playing Bethesda to beta test this game and it didn't really sink in untill today.
---
Between the rampent design changes to small things like it taking 6 months to get a legendary scrap machine or player vending which was obviously working at launch or they wouldn't have ever shown the machines in early gameplay.
---
It's super frustrating how slow quailty of life content is coming out and with each new piece something else gets broke or negatively effects some other part of the community.
---
After today this game is litterly a farming simulator with no danger of other players effecting your experience and if that's what you want go play fallout 4.
---
Bad on you bgs for being forward thinking about how a multiplayer fallout game was designed and then backtracking on every design choice because a portion of the community wants to hold hands and skip around farming with no threats for miles.
---
Invite sent :)
---
That‚Äôs exactly where I have mine. And my buddy built his right next to the stray cat billboard just down the way. We have a little neighborhood when we‚Äôre both online...
---
My game was running smoothly before the patch and now it‚Äôs lagging way more than usual.
---
Thank you but I meant where can I find them once i have already purchased them. Appreciate you taking the time to answer me. Cheers!
---
Would be great if that was next to the Top of the World. Thecliff there... if you jump down there's a Deathclaw. So either you die falling or you die of Deathclaw.
---
If you kill it you are a monster!
---
The punch bowl is intended to be free anyway.
---
Fallout 5 needs to be a product of good game design and a team that makes descions based on a experience not listening to every crybaby on the internet.
---
I remember when Todd and friends made a great experience without having to bend over backwards
---
I‚Äôm worried about this, because I‚Äôm pretty sure some of my CAMP budget just vanished. I mean, I‚Äôve deleted more stuff than when I used to have 30 items for sale in my machine, and yet now I can only put 18 things for sale, even though I have less stuff in my CAMP! We need some explanations on how this works.. Does deleting a player vending machine doesn‚Äôt actually free up CAMP budget? Or is there another reason behind it?
---
The patch notes don't make it good
---
Easy kill.
---
Other post was deleted
---
Or its bugs or developers put wrong logic in questions. One of it. I answer definetly right, but its not count
---
Bulking items pulls from both stash and inventory. 15 steel in inventory and 15 in stash = one bulk in your inventory after.
---
all people do is destroy recon showers and fusion gens. not a high bounty, but high resources to fix. not everyone wants to pvp. why should they be subject to it. even if they were in passive mode, their camp can still be destroyed.
---
As I see it there's two ways they can handle the point you appear in in a CAMP.
---
Either they make sure you actually are pushed up through all foundations and out of any walls you might appeare in.
---
Or they allow you to place a fast travel mat. This could be restricted to only the ground or foundations if they don't want players to risk falling before the CAMP has loaded.
---
Either way they really should make sure that foundations are first in the load order of any CAMP.

And this isn't all because of patch 9 I like player vending and think the legendary system can work but it needs to be done correctly without alienating a large portion of players.
---
Fixed in latest patch
---
They serve no purpose after you top out. You grind for better drops, but they‚Äôre mostly non existent. You get crap drop to craft things that do nothing to improve your stats
---
The whole premise of this quest chain is awful design
---
Let's hope they don't get advice from zenimax because ESO is full of one shots in vet dungeons and bullet sponge bosses.
---
You‚Äôre probably right, although I remember a lot of the drama in r/fallout and the media in general was over the game not having human npcs and being online only, people were gonna be pissed regardless, but that‚Äôs why we have r/fo76 where we hate each other slightly less.
---
Farewell. We‚Äôll always remember yo-OOOH ANOTHER AWESOME CAMP WITH LOTS OF PLAYERS WANTING TO QUEST TOGETHER!!!
---
Hey wait I know you. xD
---
Thanks heaps
---
.. and yet the large mag now blocks the sight 50% of the time. Nice "fix"
---
That's fine for Adventure mode but don't let design mechanics bleed into the so called PVP mode. And as for adventure I think I'd be having fun if there was anything to actually do for a end game player.
---
I crafted some leather armor and pre patch 9, a level 1 gave me DR 13 ER 2. Now it says DR 2 ER 2 (160% condition via INT bonus).
---
Yep.... Sounds logical....thx
---
You clearly aren‚Äôt understanding what I‚Äôm saying.
---
If you're speccing for VATS use hip fire accuracy mods (it's the "true" ones). range is also really good, get the best scope even if you're not aiming manually. 
---
Also, any instigating lever/hunting rifle is more than enough to one-shot pretty much any enemy you'll encounter.
---
For boss fights Anti-armor is better for obvious reasons.
---
Funny that you are for the tax to lower caps in the world but you have multiple accounts to hoard caps. One way to get rid of your 50k/75k/100k/etc caps is to not have multiple accounts with maxed caps and to play like you're one person.
---
MMO markets always end up controlled by the people with multiple accounts hoarding cash. And it means prices get higher and higher and higher and higher over time because the sellers want more. They need more. So they make more accounts to hoard more...
---
Are there any skins available for them? Like that enclave skin they showed concept art for?
---
Only time me amd my friends actually experienced an issue was some random crashes, amd at ome point my friend got the glitch where you cant log back into your character.
---
I'd just use a aae lever with less vats if you csn find one &amp; use gunfu  perk as well. It's awesome if you are a vats user.
---
If you want to use 2 weapons, instigating hunting &amp; anti armor lever as backup.
---
I use to have 6 or 7 guns, now all I use is a BE Lever &amp; a BE Gatlin Gun, both can be used in most situations, even queen fights
---
lever for the mobs &amp; gatlin for queen &amp; larger enemies
---
Another option is lever &amp; handmade or just handmade, as the handmade is probably the most versatile weapon
---
It doesn't need power as said in patch notes apparently, i build it and before i could connect it to power a had 2 ppl fast travel to my camp.
---
also spend your caps... stop hoarding.
---
vending isnt a mess. you can have like 5 machines. you can put 30 items in those machines. organize your shit. you can literally put just armor or just weapons etc in 1 machine. 
---
you just want to spawn kill train stations. however would you really fast travel to someone's camp on survival? thats literally bait. also fast travel isnt the point. you shoukd walk places.
---
I enjoyed it. The questions were pretty funny.
---
How can someone have so many caps? I‚Äôm lvl 93 and I have like 3k lol
---
interesting about the hip-fire mods...will give that a try tonight. Thought adding scopes was pointless when using VATS and Inotice it also increases the VATS cost per shot.
---
Currency cap is 1k. Have read it somewhere.
---
You have to w8 for the legendary vendor. Will come at the end of this month.
---
Are you on XBOX? I'll die for you.
---
I feel you on that one. I think I'm going to try to find a Cryptid event and revive someone there. 
---
Also there is a puddle of water at that event, meaning reviving someone that dies in that water should also count as one of the swimming tadpole challenges, if I'm not mistaken.
---
It oddly bothers me how small that jar is for those poor frogs. :(
---
You don't need to solve the Cesar cypher. You just need to know it's the answer made up of Roman numerals.
---
You know you can buy it back? Your only chance to buy it back is DONT close the trade window when your favorite weapon is in.
---
i have the same problem, the daily take a picture of a player doing X mean that i can't do at least 2 challenges a day, if you are on ps4 i can help PSN is blaine\_anderson i will be logging on in about an hour
---
Weeks later this still holds true. I'm not a fan of sentinel armor, but with the debuff on patch nine it's just sort of better than nothing. I think weapon range is a problem here too. One shots could be counter sniped if ballistics weren't ineffective after 120 meters.
---
It was a legendary machete that I purchased for 500 caps
---
For the record, albeit 9 hours late I meant characters... I have 1 account with 5 characters
---
With your first point it kind of had to be done. As much as I have faith that most people wouldn't be asses with the player vending opening up camps to everybody, I know that having fought in a team where a friend's camp got destroyed by some dumbasses because we wouldn't trade with them, camp destruction is annoying in the adventure mode. My friend was pretty gutted by it and we as a team rallied to help. But not everybody is so lucky. I was prepared to take the risk of having my camp open to all but I can guarantee that camp destruction with this feature would have created a greater uproar. I think it's rather sad how people get enjoyment from camp destruction, which is so easy compared to squaring up against another player who can fight back. 
---
You can still PvP in this mode but if you want that as the main focus of the game, go to survival. It's not as if they haven't given a different mode and made these changes.
---
Non-stop players that also googled the early dupes could dupe the right vendor items and meet the 1400 daily limit every day for a while early on. This on top of multiple accounts (like OP), hoarding those caps, then they set the new highs for weapon prices in discord, because the higher price the better to the hoarding people with multiple accounts.
---
I have never had more than 4k on my character at once and still have a hell of a lot of fun and some decent self-found weapons. 
---
(the problem is greed, with no end in sight really)
---
Vats hit chance is calculated by using your range and accuracy. Improving those 2 gives you a much better hit chance. This is probably your issue
---
Every game has those
---
Was most likely a stealth nerf to op melee.
---
Last patch notes before the current ones were really poor received but for the most part it's going in the right direction.
---
Patches in general have been good, and this latest patch is just great all round. Bodes well for the future.
---
They won't understand....its greed. Essentially a mental disability.
---
Trump tax info just got out and he's been the highest loser of money for 10 years apparently. Still thinks of himself as a godly rich man (when he was born into enough wealth to sustain wealth)
---
i'm also a solo player but if you need help and on PS4 send me a friend request and i will help (i still need to do the revive an ally and revive in water challenge), PSN is blaine \_anderson
---
Making it so no damge can be done is not the fix. And tell that to everyone else who has 4 vending machines with a random mix of shit in them because of the 30 item max. I'm not saying player vending is bad because it's a awesome idea and edition but it's breaking other parts of the experience in ways maybe you don't understand because you want to just farm and hold hands.
---
And looking at the above I have no intention of starting this till the weekend when I can sit and do them all in one sitting lol
---
The frog habitat doesn't register as complete
---
Somewhere in pioneer scout camp
---
it might be bug they took longer than normal for them to spawn for me
---
Perhaps just join a random team? There are plenty of people online who will want to make a team. It's an Online game, that's like... the main aspect of Fallout 76. You don't have to yell at people to kill themselves, just join a team and have fun adventuring, and then heal them if they fall.
---
Can provide help with other challenges as a payment
---
i don't think it's like that. you'll get a completely random item without even seeing it before buying it.
---
Agree with the OP. 
---
I'm even more surprised than bethesda dont come back on their free DLC promise with this rocky and hard launch ( bad initial selling for the game ).
---
Many studios with such difficult times to cross just became P2W.
---
I m happy to had stick with the game even when nearly everybody just talks trash about it ( sometime with good arguments... but sometimes not )
---
Honestly. Beth is one of the few devs/publishers that feel like they are still making "games" just shit to play for fun. Wolfenstein, doom, Rage 2,(from the looks of it) fallout. It doesnt feel like they are trying to goad you into padding player time to show shareholders, or MTX to make a assload of money (til 76 which, IMO isnt that bad of a MTX sys) they just make/publish a fun game to play.
---
Noice, also the cap limit and ability to sell over the cap limit are annoying. Last night I made over 10,000 caps in less than an hour from selling ammo. 
---
I‚Äôve been hoarding stuff to sell and want to clear space but I can‚Äôt do that if I can only sell small amounts at a time. 
---
Either way, caps are pretty much useless to me in this game. Aside from travel I barely buy anything because the things I want, like serum, are way too expensive.
---
Supermutants pool cue is one of my favourite. Lile having a bar brawl with a supermutant
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat with you bro, I‚Äôm level 12, picked the game up for $28 NZD (brand new physical copy) and I‚Äôm really enjoying the game aswell I have a cousin who plays with me (level 83) I did have a few annoying bugs but they recently got fixed with the patch/update recently üôÇ
---
='(
---
Which is honestly one of those quite great features.... so long you don‚Äôt close out lol 
---
Something like that is something I‚Äôd expect them to patch in after many complaints but they seem prepared for this
---
I noticed this too.  But only did one run.  Normally I would get 4-5 1*s but received zero.
---
Ive repaired mine finally to 200% and didn't see a damage increase either.
---
Although right now I can live with it, since I get double to useage out of it so its still all good till the damage increase is updated
---
Thank you! Appreciate the heads up
---
Thanks for the heads up! Appreciate it üëç
---
Don't hoard caps on 5 characters then either. Barely different from accounts except you can trade the caps between accounts if they weren't capped.
---
A collective 125k caps is ridiculous. Take a day off and do something for real life and the game world might have a less problematic level of caps.
---
I get that and in Adventure it makes sense. But why in survival why are these make half the player base happy backtrack Bethesda changes effecting people who want more from the game. Sometimes it feels like the devs have been trading out each week on who makes the decisions
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. For example when there were patches with a good amount of QoL changes and bug fixes, but they also introduced new bugs like the friends list sorting getting messed up, adrenal reaction completely messing up, food spoilage is crazy fast, etc. Some of the time these bugs aren‚Äôt immediately evident, so I‚Äôm just going to wait and see.
---
naw toilet flushing sound would be better followed by a wood chipping grinding sound :D
---
I bought it for 4K on Xbox before the nerf
---
:(
---
It's just market control.  If you don't have enough money sinks inflation hits your games markets HARD.  Your currency becomes trivial and players end up coming up with their own currency system using whatever is actually valuable at the moment... Which sounds fine untill what is considered valuable shifts and all the players saved wealth poofs.
---
That‚Äôs even worse lol
---
So close to a Rockstar release too was unfortunate.
---
Yeah, but I read that adding a scope also increased VATS cost by 30%. So it was a trade off, considering my VATS says 95% most of the time anyway.  
---
 [https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Gun+Mods](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Gun+Mods)
---
This happened to me last night! I was so confused. I thought maybe I'd finished it earlier but I really didn't think I had.
---
At level 15 you are now able to use Raider Power Armor pieces and the (in)famous Handmade Rifle. Welcome to Nuka-World ))
---
Still have to get into new yesterday contents, i'm worried about parts involving other players.
---
I have no problem to party, i'm used to play online with others, but 90% of my game time actually i cannot use mic (i have one but not so used to english talking and usually i play in late hours and i will awake all family), since there is no textual chat in F76 i'm forced to play almost alone, i had only one friend that play but stopped a month ago.
---
I really love this game and it's a shame i have to consider it as a single player, my few "party" experiences are with my only friend (that last just 2 months and played just 4-5 times...) and some occasional "emote talking" with random players.
---
I still have hopes anyway :D
---
I'm wondering the same and won't be off work for a bit.  Has anyone checked the enclave bunker to see if it was added as a purchasable plan?  That is the only thing I can think of atm.
---
inspecting objects in player vending machines works 1 time on 100 :(.
---
And i have an issue from the previous patch,sometime when i use an object in pipboy (when i drink water,eat something,read a plan) the game freezes and i have to disconnect [windows.It](https://windows.It) happens more frequently when i use many item in succession.
---
It's a common issue?
---
I‚Äôve literally found her 4 times at the lighthouse lol
---
you just want to be a dick and destroy. to survival servers. you probably too chicken shit to go there.
---
if people want to have unorganized shops let them. you can still organize it in the menu by going to the category you want its 30 items per machine. would lag the server if 150 items was appearing.
---
reason why no one is talking about the stuff you bring up cause its what they wanted (no camp destruction) or has a simple solution to a minuscule problem (like an unorganized shop) that you are too stupid to think of.
---
Lol I‚Äôm so mad - so I suck at games (always die, can‚Äôt shoot etc) and I was playing solo yesterday by the lake near the scout camp and mirelurks kept killing me. I was thinking that someone would revive me for this quest - nope! People kept hovering around me until I died to steal my loot.
---
Workshop quests give free plans. They can then be sold at your vending station if you already have them. They also have resources to mine &amp; sell
---
It's at the archery range there, surprisingly.
---
And this is another reason why there is a vendor tax because instead of giving us actually interesting and engaging things to spend caps on they say nope we will just do a tax to make gained currency not just stack minus fast travel costs.
---
Then you may have a switch üòÇ
---
Nice. I've got about 20k shells between two characters that are going on sale soon. I was gonna sell for 1/1 but since you said people are buying, it's gonna be 2. 
---
I bet the Munitions Factory is gonna be the most hotly contested workshop now
---
I am kinda the same....I gave 76 all the chances, I defended the game and was on the small team of people doing so until I got bored with the game and I suppose gave up but really just needed a break. I recently got back on to play it and I've been having a blast I wish friends would get back on but I suppose I'd just have to make new ones and perfect my gear
---
If caps are useless to you anyway, why are you both hoarding stuff and selling amo for big bucks and then complaining that you're over the cap limit?
---
The endgame seems to be really fleshing out your RP and then inhabiting the world as that character. Everyone is an NPC with a completely random and unreproducible story. That‚Äôs the draw for me. I‚Äôm sincerely sorry that this game isn‚Äôt living up to your expectations but it happens. I couldn‚Äôt get into it the first couple months. It felt very awkward. I stopped playing for a few weeks and when I picked it back up, I couldn‚Äôt put it down. Maybe just take a break. Maybe start fresh. I have some 1 star level 1 guns in my vendor station that I could sell you :)
---
Sure, but fast travel through that territory now costs triple due to underfunded roads being replaced with toll roads!
---
Cool story bro
---
Indeed on both observations
---
The truth is I dont game much anymore mostly because games have become revenue extractors. It is somewhat ironic for someone who refuses teams becase I am a low charisma build lol.
---
It was a minor inconvenience before, sure, but I used to just finish me off, or sneak/run away
---
i will help PSN blaine\_anderson, i will be online soon
---
Honestly it‚Äôs luck guys. I‚Äôve got multiple runs recently netting me the regular 4-7 1-2*s.
---
There's an archery range?
---
Vats cost is meaningless. I'm always using vats. You just have to have good enough AP regen.
---
Perks i'm using for ap regen: Lone wanderer, Action Boy, Grim reaper's sprint, Rejuvenated.
---
PA Mods: Core Assembly + AP legs.
---
My AP bar goes from 0% to 100% in 3-4 seconds max. If i'm in a fight grim reaper's sprint procs quite often too. If not, i don't mind waiting 1 second for my AP bar to go from 0 to ~25% to enter vats again and hope grim reaper's sprint procs again.
---
Thanks but I'm on PC hope you find some to help you though
---
Survival is still essentially in beta though. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It is subject to player feedback on what is wanted, not wanted, what works and what needs repair or refinement.
---
I would suggest if you feel that strongly about the implementation in survival mode that you better phrase your feedback, present what it is you would suggest and why and post it up as a more coherent suggestion that Bethesda may read and take in. Others may also read it and add their thoughts.
---
But I have spent more time on FO76 than anything else...
---
No one does
---
I putted up my store. Made 10 radium rifles. Sold them for 150 caps each. It was great seeing actuall people buying them. Felt like i was part of it
---
Same here. 3 runs 1 legendary ghoul but did not drop anything more than a stimpak and a 1-star exterminator combat knife. Was the only player in Whitesprings at the time and for almost a hour. The volume of enemies was actually more than normal for me but had a bunch of level 9 golfers and sh!tlload of ghouls that literally crawled at 100 mph.  It was hilarious to see my health drop for what i believed was no reason until i saw i was getting slightly moved around...looked down and there were 4-5 crawlers chomping at my legs.  Im level 110 and I have never seen them before. They came flying down the hallways in the clubhouse...they looked badass though.   The crawlers were even outside on the course itself.  Was getting mobbed by hordes of level 9 golfers and crawlers along with the occasional level 62 diseased ghouls and that damn alpha deathclaw at the same time. No luck but memorable nonetheless.   I will keep trying to turn my luck around,  hope you do as well!
---
There are several posts from patch 7 documenting issues introduced, as well as every previous patch. If you want to bury your head in the sand, knock yourself out
---
It's not about if I like it or not it's about there not being a multiplayer more and more everyday. This game is a 4 person coop game at this point because PVP has been ripped and shredded to where there is 0 incentive to play and adventure is a solo / coop game for how ever many hours you can get out of it's story. Why grind or farm if there is nothing to get good for.
---
I'm not used to all this positivity and good updates. It's like a bad omen. Something might go wrong...
---
thanks good luck
---
I have no idea which pool to take a picture of at Wavey Willard's. Been running around that whole place. Took pictures of 3 different ones, didn't work.
---
You want to be a never satisfied little grumpy loser knock yourself out bud.
---
The fossil is north of the road that‚Äôs above the Alpine River Cabins.
---
Never listen to a persons opinion who doesn‚Äôt know the difference between edition and addition
---
ah got you too place on your camp. 
---
wall decor, where the other two quest poster are. or atleast for me was there you probably will have to move left or right. 
---
now that i think about it is where (for me) all other poster I have gotten from the atom shop are.
---
Pot, kettle, black.
---
Oof, and I thought I undersold mine for 8.5k.
---
The sliding ghouls did give me a real good laugh though, I was just doing a WS run on Monday and I picked up a handful of junk legendaries and 1 good one, the spawns, the amount of enemies, and the level of enemies has def changed. I noticed more wearing gold outfits now too.
---
It‚Äôs located under the resources tab of your camp build menu. All you need is 2-4 razorgrain and a few steel. I don‚Äôt remember the exact amounts because, it‚Äôs been a while. For the razorgrain, a easy guaranteed location is the field near big al‚Äôs tattoo parlor. It‚Äôs a small farm down the road just past the bridge.
---
You can get legendary leg armour that gives -50% fall damage, with two it eliminates fall damage completely
---
Yeah true thx for the heads up!
---
Its to the left on the cliff once u spawn into the camp. It the building at the the top its the only building up there
---
hmmm iunno about this. He's supposed to be a nomad!  
---
How about in the spirit of the wanderers spirit... lets let him COUCH SURF. 
---
Give us a new CAMP item. "Grahmns Bed", which is a beat-up old couch.  If we have that and the fertilizer resource out (for Moo Moo), then Grahm will occasionally be found hanging out. Sleeping. Eating your food. Fighting intruders. Browsing your wares, etc.  
---
He wouldn't be there all the time obviously. At any given point he'd only be in one place, either on his route, or chilling at one of the camps on the map.   And it'd only work in areas near his normal route.
---
the only thing that takes camp budget is the vendor machiine itself, if you can place no more items on the vendor to sell, then you might want to look at your stash space.
---
your stash and the player vendor share the 800 lb limit
---
Yeah, kudos to them, but maybe - just maybe - next time they work this hard **BEFORE** the release?
---
INB4 Starfield is an utter disaster like FO76 and needs two years to work even remotely close to the advertised product...
---
I still get killed by invisible enemies when loading into a sever.
---
Me too :)
---
Anyone on PC willing to do the same? Online now, same IGN
---
Respect to the guys, that sell you a broken car and start repair it weeks and months after you got it.
---
It's not like that you paid money for something that doesn't work as advertised.
---
Everyone does i guess, shame mothman from path to enlightment is unkillable
---
you and me both but on xbox. 
---
best 60 bucks i have spent on a game.
---
I don't play adventure. It's the shit PVP design that makes trolls attack bases in adventure. It has nothing to do with what I want.
---
Yeah tried that too :)
---
Attack?
---
Yep happens all of the time now. Also loading and FPS has taken a massive hit as well as general server stability and performance
---
Agreed as well as a boost to stash and cap limits.
---
One mode effects the other because people just want to have fun and when they change and give no bonus or incentive for PVP of course the trolls go to adventure where for the last few weeks gave more caps per kill than survival.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
There is a slight display issue - since items for sale go into your stash the item in question most likely went over your stash limit - but the game displays that as "camp site limit" for some odd reason.
---
Just being 3* doesn‚Äôt mean it is any good.
---
You also lose it by exiting and re-entering your suit
---
Radstorms?? What radstorms?
---
On the other hand, I keep getting them drop from non legendary bugs while doing the scout quests.
---
Good
---
I saw a vendor tonight that had many comics in numerical order.   It was cool to see all the covers.
---
Your complaint about no more fast travel to Stations in Survival (even though it will still happen), makes me think that you are one of those that the only "PvP" they do is camp in said Stations waiting for someone to come over.
---
Stand infront of enterance gate. Now you have it on your right side like in middle of park. You have to aim at it for while so camera can recognize it.
---
The cap travel cost is a massive hindrance on this game. I'm hoping that now we have to travel to bases it will inflate the issue and it will either be removed or camps are free to travel to.
---
Nuke it
---
..gotta collect them all! :P
---
Because the end-game items that you can purchase are too expensive and use up 1/5th of your cap limit or are impossibly hard to find so you have to save up to hope you find the item. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta and trying to find an X-01 jet pack with no luck. I don‚Äôt want to spend 1/5th if my caps on a mutation serum then have to spend days recouping that money and possibly miss the item I wanted. The day they released all the plans I spent close to 12,000 caps on a handful of plans which was basically all my money at the time. 
---
I was excited about player vending because it meant I could recoup money more easily but you can really quickly and suddenly hit the cap then you lose any money from sales unless you removing the vending machine. 
---
So it‚Äôs a combination of items being too expensive for what you can save and losing caps when you‚Äôve sold too much. 
---
I think they should raise the price of end-game items and increase the cap limit to make caps more useful in the game.
---
How is that? I thought fast travelling put you outside the camp boundary? Or by foundation do you mean normal world floor
---
Wait so their legendary effects just don‚Äôt proc 25% of the time?
---
I didn‚Äôt buy one because I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy them all.  It seemed tragic to break up the collection.
---
Thanks for pointing out the obvious . Hopefully he revalues life now
---
You are doomed.. It's been patched.. Check the patch notes
---
Found it, thank you both you are gems.
---
Why not just say anthem?!?
---
Isn't the scout poster unlocked as standard to initiate the questline?
---
I keep my purifiers locked away inside my huge camp. There‚Äôs a 3x3 area with no foundations so I could place small purifiers. Unfortunately when people travel to my camp, they often spawn in that room, so until Bethesda fixes this 3-4 months from now I‚Äôll just keep the purifiers themselves locked too and go without the crops that people keep taking. Nothing you can do about people picking said locks but at least you can kill them after.
---
This is why I have put a keypad access door that leads to my farm with locked purifiers outside lol.
---
The inside of the farm has a rolling shutter door with only one way access so with no damage to camps, its pretty much safe :)
---
That‚Äôs how most games work . They feel like if they just hand you everything you want then you won‚Äôt play anymore so they make it so you have to come back day after day
---
Yeh I got that yesterday, can barely see it so tiny, nice to get another one though.
---
Have been wondering this. I don't think so, but I wish there was. Would be nice to know what is selling well. 
---
I went AFK a bit ago and made 300c but no idea what was bought.
---
some spent real money
---
Dude, I completely second that. I had to redesign my camp to keep my plants and purifiers in a closed area because I'd have a whole bunch of people run through the place take all my crops and water, and wouldn't even bother actually buying something.
---
I've killed 2 so I may have one somewhere. Would it get auto scrapped or anything? I'll be on this evening I will check.
---
Yeah, likewise. It's nice :D
---
That sounds very unfun and probably something people do which makes the PVP mode even worse, bgs needs to give the mode a reason and drive. Right not it has no soul
---
People would put it in sealed room, but it's still needed
---
Don't actually know for sure, probably ?
---
I use it, and pack rat, ordinance express, thru hiker, traveling pharmacy...I‚Äôm always carrying part of my stash and measure everything in .01 increments.  
---
Too lazy to bother with a mule.
---
So no Enclave backpack  alas, Its the one faction that is the most "alive" one remaining in universe, but the one that gets no love on the atomic shop :(
---
Have junkie finally been buffed then?
---
You could use no weapons or armors then you wouldn‚Äôt have anything to repair and be unstoppable
---
I don't know of any bugs that you should really worry about, particularly at your level. Have fun!
---
Hey, neato, thanks for linking a page with no usable information!
---
Maybe unyielding armor idk. Looks right to me
---
Damn bro that kinda hits
---
I just put some letters to say "Feck off crows" lol
---
PvP in Fallout 76 was always an afterthought. Even with the addition of Survival, it feels like the devs just said "there, now you have a PvP mode, have fun", but actually forgot to balance it or make it interesting at all.
---
You can't trade backpacks so you'll have to unlock mods yourself.
---
Just curios, where are the owlets mentioned in the prima guide? There‚Äôs even a picture?
---
Wait what! How the hell can you get DEATHCLAW gauntlet damage to 8k o.o
---
Well 1% of the player base is still unfairly banned sooo, no they have not been doing a good job
---
I can sell you one for 3k tho if you already have one. Its cheaper than getting the plan and building it yourself.
---
That's where your wrong go back and watch the game at e3 they made a statement and have slowly back tracked on all there ideas for this game
---
Have you ever tried to launch one ? Also what platform I can help you launch one and show you some ways to make it easier, as long as you have a decent build it‚Äôs not too hard, especially if you do it by yourself
---
Nukashine, partyboy, unarmed bobblehead, bloodied build, bloodied claw, ect
---
Moreover, the camera should give you the name of what are you aiming in the upper right corner
---
i Spawned inside some ones locked area of their Camp, i had to fast travel away.
---
I had the materials to make it and now they‚Äôre not there. I have no idea I searched everywhere around Top of the World and can‚Äôt find the stuff that sticks to the trees.
---
Damn never thought about nukashine but you're absolutely right. Out of curiosity what would you suggest for a rifle build?
---
Nice man!
---
The same argument still exists . You can repair to 200% at a workbench , 150% if you play the game, 100% if you are dumb
---
This game should not have tried to walk between 2 world's or at least not like this
---
My friend got that while at the same time that I was completing it I got the mounted blood bug. Really cool and somewhat disturbing to have right over my dinner table and cooking stove
---
You probably dont want to do it all in one sitting. I was going to do the same thing, been at this shit for 5 hours and I'm still not done. Some of its bugged, lots of it is super tedious.
---
Especially as this specific mission is really stupid. Revive a player in water??? That's been designed so players will have to down themselves in water to be revived. How is that in anyway engaging? That's terrible design.
---
Is it a proposal or informatiin from data mining?
---
I got mounted bloodbug from this quest
---
Are you on PC and do you need someone to revive in the water? Cause I am and I do lol.
---
This patch had a few cool features piled on top of crapüòë
---
Feel the same way, was hyped on drugs when this dude zipped at me and 1 hit killed me. Literally made zero fucking sense. I haven‚Äôt played on the survival servers since day one for that reason.
---
It‚Äôs going to take quite some time to balance out pvp. In the meantime, there are some lower levels or more casual higher levels you could have some good fights with.
---
That‚Äôs what the daily limit is for.
---
Did you log out and go to another server? Also, I can‚Äôt recall what the stuff that sticks to trees is? The only thing I think it is is a resin that you see on some trees that‚Äôs collectible and it can definitely always be found at whitesprings north entrance. There‚Äôs some trees to the right and north, just before a super mutant camp. There‚Äôs several trees there with the stuff stuck to them. I think there‚Äôs actually some In whitesprings resort too.
---
Slap damage, for example, was always there. It was mentioned many times, and on the "PvP trailer" it was shown. They never intended to make this game PvP.
---
If I remember correctly it's this quest.
---
I‚Äôm buying legendaries for pennies and selling them for script!
---
You‚Äôre gonna get aids.
---
I was also rather impressed by that period finally some forward thinking going on by the developer is and I gotta give them a lot of credit for that period stay ahead of the curve of any negativity and you've already won half the battle!
---
Some properties are worth alot more than their intrinsic value. Fallout 5 still has a clear lane. No addons promised, fuck I paid for MGS% missions.
---
I dropped and destroyed my decked out excavator armor. I fat fingered two buttons trying to deploy it and insta demolished it lol.  No one to blame but myself. Luckily I had a ton of mats and was able to recraft it. It sucked though.
---
Well I did the daily misc quests yesterday for a feel of it. Gathering the goo was fine, but collecting the bug parts was sending me over the edge :/
---
120 unique items by the way, if you sell say 200 stims, it counts as one slot.
---
Yup. Wait for a patch
---
Not if I have Fireproof!
---
I built mine on a cliff with an excellent view of white springs golf course, I built it over the cliff and then down. It has several levels and actually connects all the way to the bottom. I have a great view from my patio deck. I love the new building method. 
---
Only problem was I didn't see the small super mutant camp just above me a little bit so periodically two super mutant try to take pop shots at my camp. And I've gotten a few scorched who will occasionally show up to shoot at the bottom level. But I don't mind so much.
---
Or rename them and favorite works to 
---
But if you do, just buy em back b4r closing the scrap
---
If you favourite them I think you also get the confirmation dialogue asking if you really want to sell that item too? 
---
Maybe someone could confirm this for me as my memory is a bit shite and I was doing a few other things today ü§îüôÑ
---
Stagger and vats crit always negated the effects.   They were never impervious.   And now they are nerfed due to the whining of incompetents.
---
Just say no to Scorched Bernie Sanders!
---
Tip two. Fav items now ask you if you really sure you want to sell or scrap before doing so.
---
Don‚Äôt put a lock on the door. Just have a wall. When you‚Äôre there to harvest, go to edit, swap to a door and just walk through. It‚Äôll snap right back to a straight wall, because you aren‚Äôt confirming the change. Repeat to leave the room.
---
This way, even the pesky lock pickers can‚Äôt take your stuff. Unless they get that lucky/unlucky  spawn.
---
read the patch notes.
---
From my experience it seems to work if player that is selling is near but doesn‚Äôt when the seller is elsewhere
---
Some people on this sub would like to keep the focus on TSEs. 170 levels, 2 characters, not a single TSE anything let alone a god role. how did that occupy gaming news cycles?
---
They forgot to mention it in the patch notes at first but added it later.
---
Huh? I just placed it down earlier
---
you got it wrong, wait Im going to help you.
---
I forgot to buy some stuff and get my 25k caps down, AH SHIT now I gave my stuff away for free. FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
your welcome LMAO.
---
I mean honestly would it even be that hard for us to be able to punch in a server number. Have items respawn instead of 100% reset.
---
This really isn't the place to ask this, in this sub if you don't pretend fo76 is the next BotW or some other great game you get downvoted and argued with by Bethesda boot lickers.
---
Ohh thats the easy and fast part. The challenges are the shitty tedious part. It's especially bad if you don't have anyone to work with. There are several that are fairly quick if you have someone to help. If you don't prepare for an hour per challenge or more. Today is probably the worst for it since there aren't any real guides and lots of stuff is ambiguous or bugged.
---
I'd still recommend people wait for the Steam release tho.
---
Mines been perfect except when initially entering vending machines
---
Damn nice buy.
---
Jetpack recipe for 50c
---
Probably
---
Going to reinstall at some point, that game can  e great but I dunno if I‚Äôm not bothered about nukes and the scorch beast lag fest what else is there end game? I mean I‚Äôve never really understood what the end game is I guess
---
Go to the red zone where the scorch beasts spawn. The dead claws there usually got hide in them.
---
*radscorpion digs out of a cloud and attacks you*
---
People won‚Äôt be able to drink from it. The features are disabled.
---
Yeah. I'm casual. Hopes are gone for finishing this any time soon.  
---
Still looking forward to it, bit I don't expect you'll see me walking around with a backpack soon.
---
I just shot one until it was close to death and bashed it with a syringer.. that worked for me
---
&gt; Let's not get into the mmo and solo player debate!
---
I *loathe* when people say MMOs are "supposed" to be teams/groups/guilds.
---
It's "Massively Multiplayer Online" not "Online Group Play".  
---
It *only* means that there are a bunch of people online together.
---
There are plenty of squad/group based games but they aren't called MMOs.  Pretty much every online shooter is group based.  Sure, complain people aren't team players there.
---
I don't mind some group aspects in FO76.  I play with one of my kids so i always have a teammate.
---
But to lock content, in any Fallout game, behind needing other players is just ridiculous in my opinion.
---
That‚Äôs what all of it‚Äôs for
---
The new mission is honestly the most tedious and unenjoyable thing I‚Äôve done in the game. I think I may just buy the back packs from other players. Everything else is pretty cool though
---
you have to do the quest the scout leader gives you
---
Just like Borderlands rng machines. It was great
---
All right nice thanks. I shot 50 syringe on a lvl 26 Yao guai and not even half the live haha
---
like i been all over the place an looked on googlr 4ever .... cant find an answer
---
Haha exactly
---
What‚Äôs your IGN and platform?
---
In the same location of the Pioneer Scouts camp, from the fast travel just take a right turn instead of left.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ay100y/bethesda_please_make_a_few_cooking_corrections
---
Not sure if that‚Äôs related but it seems like honey has or had some difficulties.
---
I like how there is two types of sugar bombs. And only the old boxes count towards cooking
---
I have to agree with that. That is why it feels like the end of an extended beta right now. Look at Skyrims initial production budget and gross. FO76 doesnt look like such a money sink after all if they can have the fans guide the production.
---
I am selling my plans for 50% off the BGS Value. Need to find more because those are going moderately quick
---
I'd just lookup Captainoob on youtube for one of his melee weapon tests, pause the video and make a screenshot.  He seems to be adept at picking the perk cards -- or at least he knows a lot more than me.
---
You again lmao
---
Patch notes say the 16th. So a week away
---
LOL i built my camp on the side of mountain slope on a acid resource with most of the camp floating, i had bricked underneath my camp until i saw that players were spawning under said camp and were locked by my stupid walls, which is weird coz i spawn to the side of my camp like 50 metres away. Nice waste of materials that was, needless to say i scrapped the walls and built a stair case up to the front, id redo my base but cant b assed doing it for 76th time
---
Y tu.
---
I can help, just sent an invite
---
It‚Äôs not out yet what kinda sucks. It was supposed to be activated with Imposter Sheepsquatch
---
I see what you mean, but in any economy you have to balance your income and expenses and maybe not buy that thing you want knowing it might no longer be available later when you do have the cash. I agree that with the recent changes something of an increase in cap limit might be beneficial, but having my shop open only when I can actually earn caps makes sense to me. 
---
The definition of endgame items can be pretty subjective, though. To build off of your examples, I've had marsupial for ages and in my experience it has made finding a jetpack redundant so I stopped trying. From what I've seen the serum recipes are the most expensive items in the game and you don't even *need* them at a high level. I'm just buying them so I can offer people serums for less than the enclave charges lol
---
eyy nice :)
---
Oh my. Lol.. Not so secret now. xD
---
What‚Äôs bugged about musician challenges?
---
No papi.
---
I think there are websites online that post the weekly codes as soon as they can.
---
It would be nice if destructible actions required an unusual confirmation button ‚Äútriangle button‚Äù (PS4) etc. (And not the confusing swapped buttons used to prevent scrapping a favorited item)
---
We will see may 16th!!! :)
---
I have mine out for everyone, might have to put done more water purifiers.
---
No mic, no team. :/ At least that gives me a chance to judge the situation. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I solo'd the silo at lvl45 with a sub optimal build, all you need is stimpaks
---
Are you at the cap limit?
---
The new foundation rule should hopefully help stop the ugly ass floating bases
---
Yes I‚Äôm aware but they don‚Äôt have them so I‚Äôm asking for help with other pieces. The only bravo piece I have is 0-6
---
Thanks for the offer, but I‚Äôm on XB1. But seriously, thank you.
---
I‚Äôm surprised this needs to be said but it does. Upvote the hell out of this answer
---
Shit dude, I hope that‚Äôs not me. I have cliff side and a vendor!! When I spawn to it I spawn inside the  cliff sometimes but I have never fallen.  Let me know! I‚Äôll move my ‚ÄúCAMP‚Äù.
---
Hunter is also fairly easy.   Got that and athlete first.  The only hard part is killing a yao gui with a syringer.  What I'd suggest is the bleed out syringe option,  hit it with a stronger weapon first to get health down,  then just go for it.  Low level yao gui at cemetery in parking lot south of prickett fort is your best bet
---
I hate it when people shut my back door. The front door, shut it if you must, but leave the back one open. I argue with my more uptight teammates all the time, and it's my damn house.
---
I keep lagging out on arrival at workshops fuckin shoot meüòÅ
---
90% of the bugs are smallish things like floating weapons, t-posing, poor entity positioning i.e. Having a super mutant spawn upside down and underneath the ground so you can only see the bottom of his feet. Stuff like that. 5% of em are a bit more painful... For instance, dying in an area that makes it impossible to retrieve you dropped junk because while you can see your bag... You can't actually view its contacts. The last 5% are absolutely devistating. However these are extremely rare and I doubt most players will even encounter them, but it is definitely possible to have things completely disappear from your inventory or stash. But I doubt you'll have to deal with that. Because I'm level 140 something and the only experience I've ever had with that is listening to my friend yell at his monitor lmao
---
I locked two of my three purifiers. You can have my crops. 
---
For some reason I haven't been able to lock my junk extractor.  No error or anything. Just nothing happens.
---
As far as I am concerned you are a complete noob. I mean no offense, but I have
---
&gt;I‚Äôve been playing since beta and trying to find an X-01 jet pack with no luck. 
---
Check the production terminal in the Enclave they added X-01 plans!!! Yes plans not mods *heavenly choir* 
---
I haven't been there yet but I hear they have everything
---
Same. I knew I was going to shell out as soon as the Black Rider paint dropped. I regret nothing.
---
You could just remove the door. Argument no more
---
Instead of good with salt get serendipity and instead of lone wander get tenderizer.  Maybe even nerd rage instead of makeshift warrior. Just my opinion tho, I feel like weight/armor/food perks are a waste. Also get twisted muscles mutation if you have not yet.
---
Damn that would have helped a lot! Platform is Xbox.
---
He built on a tiny crevasse on the face of a cliff which was only accessible by jumping down from a higher area on the cliff. It was pretty much guaranteed you'd fall unless you spawned in that small little area. So you're probably fine haha.
---
I feel you there.
---
Are you talking about camps being invulnerable in survival mode? Because I‚Äôm pretty that was unintended and you‚Äôre also not being clear about that at all
---
Good Idea m8
---
I tried to put up some duplicate masks but it said i had maxxed out my camp budget and wouldnt let me mark it for sale so strange bug maybe
---
I guess I was just too giddy after seeing everyone else sell them for the default 40 or 50 caps each. Do you simply not need them or are you swimming in them?
---
They are already in game and anyone can make them already.
---
When I had a junk extractor I always locked it I had to move my C.A.M.P because it turned me into a hoarder of junk
---
Can't beat a good bone job can you?
---
Oh, is that all? Good thing I don‚Äôt have an optimal build and carry 150 at a time...
---
Thanks! I've been thinking about it for awhile.
---
I am expecting to see more camps around Vault 76 to get around the cap cost of fast traveling, or maybe I am hoping to see more.  Another thing I thought of was maybe they could refund your fast travel if you purchase something from the vendor like "validating your parking".
---
I saw someone mention this last night! Which ones are the production terminals? I looked in the terminals on the military wing but no luck. I assume the production ones are different?
---
Possible to wait. Seems after I got the one at someones camp, the flatwoods one started to work again. Between that time I also stopped for a while to get something to eat and completely closed everything out in my computer so that may have done something as well.

---
Tyler County Fairgrounds has been good to me.  Just a couple hops and got it.
---
Oh that's embarrassing i didn't realize
---
That would be tragic.
---
yup was thinking this too. I just go really slow.
---
Are you suggesting the legendary scrip vending machines in some way harm pvp? Is this a troll?
---
Just like Max cap loss of 50 across the board except 20% of a Max 50 in survival.
---
I totally respect folk's extractors, however traveling around to y'all is expensive and I do work up a thirst. And what does a powerful thirst have as a traveling companion? That's right, a rumbly tummy.
---
So before anyone starts hollering about their vittles being gone, let me remind you that the most successful of establishments cater to the needs of the folk who be coming to them.
---
Also, thanks in advance.
---
so because I don't actively farm legendary items to sell Im a noob?
---
aight homie, log off
---
Uh not event them
---
That's a spoiler
---
By him not apearing on the map wouldn't that show he's at his house though?
---
I think it's the Watoga train station vendor.
---
It clearly does kid lol
---
Blissfully unaware
---
Seems to be fixed. =/ I tried placing one but I don't see it any of the menus.
---
ha yeah maybe I should just take it as it is now aye.
---
nope about 11k
---
Depends on what you intended to do with the build. Imo bloodied rifle builds are good, however after playtesting with a full health build with sentinel and a bloodied build with sentinel. Anti-armor is more consistent in killing players so aae rifles. Like the lever, handmade, and gauss.  The nice thing about aae, is it ignores power armor and sentinel by 50% it will kill bloodied builds and full health builds with ease. If you wanted a good build for pve bloodied is better Imo. For that route I would recommend a bloodied explosive handmade.
---
Thanks for testing it!
---
That's fine by me.  They put out more water than I can possibly use.  The lead extractor is unlocked because it's damn near useless.  If you need the 14 lead scrap (which is the MAX it can hold), take it.  It will make more.
---
Grafton has all of the deep pocketed plans
---
Mr howard, i dont feel too good
---
Checked enclave bunker twice, no such plan available :(
---
God yes the floating camps annoy me to no end.
---
Best way I can describe it is. Where the medical Bay is there are stairs go left at the top.
---
It is, but given the tests are random, it's possible to have done the test multiple times and not have gotten the question.
---
Mind if I get in on this gents?
---
No one else has reported bugs yet.
---
Sounded vaguely like a rust monster for a moment.
---
What did you pay for them? They are a little costly at the vendbots.
---
Not built in, but you could write it down or type it up. Based on my experience, stimpaks sell very quickly. If you have any spare, put them up for a quick sale.
---
Sweet thanks for your guidance. I do tend to use bloodied for pve and switch to a merger of bloodied and anti armour/player protection for PvP. I need to work on my perks for rifles but I imagine that's pretty easy of figure out.
---
Yes. Check my edit.
---
But yeah if you‚Äôre highest level is sub 100 you are 100% a get fucked noob
---
Sorry but my camp has always been there and I‚Äôm not moving just because of whiners who are all like ‚Äúoh god my legs are broken‚Äù or ‚Äúoh my god oh god oh Jesus is that my spine!?‚Äù or even ‚Äúplease just shoot me, I can‚Äôt take this suffering oh god why‚Äù
---
:)
---
Nah it's too much effort for just an backpack. I'm refusing to did that quest until they do something to make easier that quests. I'm expecting fun from this game, not a hard work job.
---
This always happens to me right after they update every time for some reason. I have no idea why.
---
Agree. I am not a fan of players spawning in the lake behind my camp rather than at the front next to the deathclaw topiary.
---
No its broke i have proofüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This is the first time
---
I would put money on it being the sudden influx of players that join tontry out the new dlc, plus people playing for longer again to get things done sonthe servers start having heart convulsions
---
The water is the first thing I check, then I will hit the vending machines.
---
But why
---
It seems to work when vending machine owner is nearby only.
---
I honestly have this problem with my camp, located the cliff down from the lookout tower west of Whitesprings. Thankfully its a small cliff, with plenty of ledges so I don't think I have killed anyone yet, but it can be rather annoying to spawn in and have to ledge hop and come back up.
---
Have you tried turning it off and turning it on again?
---
Found the synth...
---
I know I've locked them in the past. Maybe I'll be able to later. 
---
And I sell a lot of junk at the vendors. I'm really casual so I don't get a lot of pricey items often.
---
Each server seems to have its own RNG factor in that respect.  It's always been that way.  If we want to farm, we'll make a pass through through to see how the drops are.  If they are good, it gets nuked.  If not, we move on.
---
Almost certainly not intentional
---
That's useful info, thanks.
---
That's great and all, but for those of us who are actually deaf, it's not a solution. 
---
Which, I must add, doesn't justify that holding back everyone else who could potentially solve said problem with a mic. There will just always be a segment or two of the player base that just can't use a mic for whatever reason. 
---
For such people, even the most basic of text chats would be a godsend.
---
Sigh
---
This is the new kink, isn't it?
---
That's why I'm always in the Power Armor.
---
Why? What's the difference?
---
For sure, in my second time as rifle build in order for me to be an effective build for pvp, I had to shed a lot of perks, and stats that I wanted but weren't necessary. It's totally worth it though. My character Violet, is lethal.
---
Yeah you do now. Thankfully.
---
Me too!  GT is name
---
It‚Äôs free but you still have to purchase it from the atom shop to be able to place it.
---
If you aren't 12 and have a headset, you are more than welcome to goof around with us.  GT: AlpineYJ
---
Doesn't seem to be other than the pop up when it happens. 
---
Would be a great addition.
---
I'm with you. I hate groups. Like the quest yesterday, I cringed at the fact I have to revive another player. All this for a backpack I bought to unlock? GIVE ME THE FUCKING BACKPACK I BOUGHT!
---
Should be able to finish the whole game solo if you wish, every quest, it shouldn't be forced just because it's online only.
---
I built a ton of water purifiers and extractors for people to take when they visit. It‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt fill up quick anyways.
---
I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but when something is sold, it pops up and tells you in the top left corner what was sold.
---
I'm down, added you
---
FOUND ALL X01 MOD PLANS LAST NIGHT AT PRODUCTION VENDOR  IN ENCLAVE BUNKER!!!
---
How do we do that?  Is that the app?
---
I'm down, my IGN is blackmore26
---
damn brother, don't be so mad, its only a question. no need to stress on me for that lmao
---
Finding a bloatfly gland was a bitch. None of them would drop glands and every place that has a chance to spawn them would spawn something other than bloatflys. 
---
I remember that Green Country Lodge always has bloatflys and found one there.
---
I put my C.A.M.P. right next to Overseers camp so that people could take whatever they want. You want corn take it that's why it's here. Hell if you ask me I'll just give you 20 purified water. Take it all that's why I put it out.
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying. I just think the game needs a bit more of a balanced economy and more late game content, which I know they‚Äôll add in eventually. 
---
Since I got my X-01 PA I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm lazily playing the game. I mostly go to owned workshops to try to build fusion generators for the owners because the end-game content has gotten old for me. I had originally saved up for serums but like you said you don‚Äôt even need them at high levels, even though I‚Äôm only level 79.
---
I might do like you said and buy stuff and sell it at low prices for other players!
---
Accuracy is still broken on the Gatling though
---
Awesome! I‚Äôm gonna check it out later!
---
Any advice you'd give on perks? I tend to get fixated on useless ones quite often?
---
I know it pops up for a few seconds. I am talking about a log on what sold and for how much.
---
It would be great if you could somehow control your pipboy radio from your RL smartwatch
---
Cool joining you now
---
Would be great. 
---
The other option is building a auto pipe pistol and walk around the Forrest mowing down shit. 
---
Then you could cook and sell tbe food at vendors. Round about way, but there would at least be some use.
---
This is what I was thinking. How tf you supposed to sell ammo at 1c each unless its ultracite or shells?
---
Thanks buddy. I'll drop you a message when I'm on
---
What‚Äôs the fastest way to get that backpack ?
---
Right. Point proven. Also, how do the repair kits that cannot repair over 100% become pay to win because items repaired over one hundred percent no longer incorrectly gain damage/resistance? Go ahead, I‚Äôll wait.
---
I've been waiting for this for quite some time now...I mean what gives? They already have them for workshops, why not camps?
---
That's the only thing that's been selling from my vending machine so I haven't had this problem. One camp each seems to be the way to go
---
You really enjoy standing perfectly still and thinking you‚Äôre a pvp master don‚Äôt you lol
---
Totally agree with you, but they have added in the Sheepsquatch and Imposter Sheepsquatch, two other high level bosses. I've yet to fight the imposter, but the real one is a good fight. A little on the easy side, but still enjoyable. It's something that should have been in it from launch I think. But it's getting there. I'd rate this as a BETA game atm, that's on its way to being good. I think the Vault "raid" will make or break for me. Until then, each patch has been good, a step in the right direction, but currently not enough for me to really think it's on par with other games of the genre.
---
Yeah that's a big steamy pile that is,sounds terrible!
---
I didn't pay attention but Sounds like the visual detect total stack number rather than the sold number.
---
Well that sucks man im not really sure what your build is but I really haven't had that many problems. My game fucks up too maybe the problem is I really don't have a reference of what to Expect..
---
I played at launch and around January I stopped, when I came back about a month later it was like some pod person took him over.
---
revive an ally? Screw that!
---
Gave up at that point...
---
I guess not everyone needs to buy the whole set but specific parts instead. Also, going with individual pieces allows people to verify the item's condition and level. It's safer than going with the whole set because once the transaction is done, there are no returns.
---
Thanks, That makes sense, I'm being impatient....
---
People can still drink from it. I drank from not long ago. I think the patch disabled adding drinks to it, not drinking what was already in them before the patch.
---
Stupid healing mutation!!!
---
I fast traveled to a camp yesterday and appeared in a little trap room with no exit. There was another player in there and we both just laughed about it and fast traveled away. That camp didn‚Äôt get either of our business though.
---
I'm getting the same.
---
I think it‚Äôs something to do with the angle. I could hit them if I used vats midair
---
There might be people that actually clear their all their mutations and then use the serums so they have all the positive effects and no negative effects for a few hours.
---
More content will be out. The game will be less buggy/closer to fixed.
---
First time and on accident lol
---
Yep im pretty much in the same boat only worse, not only am I casual I can't  fast travel either because im over encumbered and have been for 3-4 months now
---
People are looking for partner to do this on reddit. It is actualy good part. Worst are those exeams.
---
Seen it. Once bitten.
---
Do you know if the weapons and armor will be at the level you at? I'm curious because if I use my level 5 mule to get scripts can I then purchase lvl 50 stuff.
---
They lost me at gameplay altering microtransactions
---
Indeed, trying to do the 'Path to Enlightenment' quest yesterday I had the same issue. Slightly annoying but not too serious, not for me anyways.
---
Bethesda out in full force today with the psyops
---
Not sure I'd call whatever Banthem is triple A I've never heard of it
---
I don‚Äôt even pvp.  But I think all nerfs are absurd. People invested a lot of time in their builds and equipment.   It is unfair to change the rules after the fact because of the whining of losers or the failure of Bethesda to balance things properly during Beta.
---
Yesterday I spawned under the floor of someone's camp. The owner had to remove the floor panel to set me free üòå
---
Same. There has to be an alternative for solo players.
---
Try the athletic badge stuff, that was pretty fun. Especially the overly happy counselor who was underline depressed/nihilistic haha
---
Owl masks. Owl masks never change.
---
Backpacks tho
---
Yes I know, i have 1.5k hours in it
---
Yikes. 
---
Can't you sell some stuff?
---
Now I have anxiety at my camp being judged. I've never been much of a builder....
---
Gold plated problems.
---
If you would like later today I can take a screenshot of my perks and send you the link to them?
---
I just started with a shotgun and finished with 1270 bloatfly syringer shots haha
---
Google crossbow plan location, it shows you the map to the pioneer shooting range
---
So, players doing an event with you count as allies toward the quest? That's good to know
---
Is there any work around on this?
---
As I said in my post above, I spent 4 hours fast traveling to people to ask. It's not that simple, as most people I met couldn't/wouldn't hear me at all.
---
I sold my copy 2 months after,  but I guess I can get a copy for 5 bucks somewhere and try it out again.
---
The trick is to Sprint like hell asap after spawning, this happened to me once, now I spam the Sprint clicky and gtfo before the camp loads.
---
I just put everything at 50% of whatever it tells me.
---
EVERYTHINGS GOT TO GO. ITS SALE TIME.
---
To be fair that's what people said about FFXIV, and ok it's been many years since its initial release, and the Realm Reborn expansion, but it's fairly good and gets decent reviews now. There's still the black mark, but I think Bethesda could do the same. Though FFXIV did remake an engine for it... I don't think Bethedsa would do that...
---
That is an easy fix and would benefit the game as a whole. Just let us inspect the whole chassis. PA is the only thing we cant inspect
---
Actually it seems to count "drug-induced" Specials. So if you got some Bufftats left that could give you the edge. Please be aware that using drugs is frowned upon by the scouts tough...
---
Sure, backpacks are great (for non-PA users anyway) - but seems like this could've been included from the get-go, or at the very least added now as a craft option in general. I mean how hard is it for a wastelander to make/obtain a simple backpack?
---
Jokes on you it didnt work there either
---
Yeah I can do that. The only issue is that I do not have mic cause my port isn't working.
---
Hell, have us buy them in the atoms shop.  100%, especially if a quarter a tune, just like a jukebox (assuming that was a one time fee per account).
---
‚ÄúI think all nerds are absurd‚Äù ok then you simply don‚Äôt understand the many reasons they happen. It‚Äôs never just because some people whined. There is a level of balance they were shooting for and that stepped out of line wether above or below and needed tweaked. People that farmed hundreds of hours to get something so clearly better than everything really should‚Äôve assumed they‚Äôd not last forever in that state. Nerfs are not bad by nature nor buffs good.
---
Sure thing! My GT is ii Am The Ping. Thanks
---
I found the athletes, swimming, and archery to be the easiest of them all. Was able to knock them out in an hour or 2
---
:-(
---
I've gotten rad roach and sting wing plans
---
They never said that the gaining of extra stats was a bug or unintended behaviour. In fact, that was the whole point of the perk. If the whole point of the perk is to make repair being needed less often, then it's even more p2w because that's the exact thing the repair kits do, with the added benifit of not having to spend time scavenging for materials, fighting the queen or looking for a repair bench in the middle of nowhere.
---
It was only "rocky" because people decided to ignore everything Bethesda said and invent some false narrative about what this game was supposed to be like.
---
I found one guy who had several 3 star two shot, bloodied, instigating and furious weapons, and none for over 2000 caps.  Also people really are buying ammo at 1 cap apiece.  I guess it's still easier than buying it from a vendor.
---
I'm on psn. But I will pm you with a link to imgur on here later today
---
Which basically means its an item that doesnt exist ingame.
---
For you ‚Äúfloaters‚Äù that don‚Äôt know - under ‚Äústairs‚Äù at the bottom, is a metal column. At least put those columns! For really reals, your CAMP looks bad, and you should feel bad. 
---
Also, if you are someone that doesn‚Äôt have these plans (I don‚Äôt know if they are default), and are in PC, lemme know - I will build them for you!
---
I don't care :p just come online and we are going to revive each other to finish this.
---
You are my hero.  Have a scout badgeüéÆ
---
That tells me things might not be as expensive as I thought they would be. Takes a little time to get it, but with a low max, nothing can really go higher than that.
---
No. Best you can do is type it up or write it up.
---
Both the fermenter and the vending machines inventories count toward your stash capacity. Yes the error message is camp if full but it only means your stash is full.
---
Thank you. Will edit.
---
Yep first d/c in months. Xbox
---
Man everything is nice and all but I‚Äôm gonna jump on the hype train on the shotguns and say @bethesda, this next patch undo what you did with nerfing they please for the love of God
---
Possibly but most of my weight I carry are aid items and weapons I want to keep.
---
My stash is full of junk and now items for my vending machine.
---
My average weight fluctuates between 957 and 1126 and to fast travel my weight needs to be 275 lol.
---
Honestly I don't mind walking everywhere and nukashine roulette has helped me get around quicker although random lol.
---
I put some in my vending machine and they sold fairly quick.  Maybe they're worth more than 100 caps?
---
Thanks only word I didn‚Äôt get lol
---
There is probably not deathclaw hide. I farmed deathclaws, super mutant behemonths, deathclaw corspses around fisure sites, now i am running around cabbins, but i don't belive there is any, we need dataminer here.
---
Sent assassin is not that op, people just have bad builds. In pvp I did better with my unyielding build than my sent assassin build cause  headshots, crits, or staggers are so easy there are many counters to that set of armor you just have to be good at building a character
---
This post has given me the inspiration to drop back into West Virginia and give it another go. Thank you.
---
I did post about how to do first part. You need about 3hours of time.
---
I am getting discord set up. I have 2.. im unsure how it happened i was trying to set up the one at work so that i could admin things at work and not burn playtime adminning at home. I go back to work tonight and i will be looking into it . i did a tone of work on the one at work logginged into the one at home and it was diffierent. i have 2 accounts on accident somehow.
---
I live in a high spawn traffic area :-P
---
Keeps costs down... plus it looks like a weird beetle due to multiple staircase legs :-D
---
This happened to me. FT‚Äôd in, and then heard Super Mutants, including a suicider. Luckily I managed to take them down before they destroyed the poor person‚Äôs CAMP.
---
That's just for PC though, isn't it?
---
I have 4 or 5 of the medium purifiers with no lock and a single locked industrial one. As for crops, thats fine really.
---
I don't use a mic so there is no way to communicate to other players my needs for this group gated content. A mmo without a chat box is just mind boggling. (Just checking... its 2019 right?)
---
I am lucky as I have my stepdaughters account I am able  to log into. Her room and my game room are right next to each other. So I logged her in, put her character in the middle of a bunch of enemies and waited for her to fall. Done, revived an ally.
---
I just wish I would have know about those badge challenges (I don't do daily challenges for atoms so it took me forever to know what they meant by scout challenges. I play everyday and never even opened the challenge page until yesterday.)
---
I would of let her die in water for the challenge.
---
I will be doing that after work tonight. 
---
Only bethesda would force group challenges when there is no way to communicate to others.
---
Yepper. I have two of them sitting on a shelf. Thought one didnt take and then tried again. After that one didnt do anything I searched and read it was messed up.
---
i made an alphabetized notepad one month ago, with all my plans, recipes and outfits , and since yesterday every time i put something in vending machine, i write with red pen on the notepad the price i put. 
---
Now i am putting the plans for the camp (currently the plans from a to m). But i understand that a notepad is not everyone cup of tea.
---
I love being organized in fallout :)
---
Those prices tho omg
---
I find myself plugging in my mic less and less as I realize 90% of players don't want to talk and often don't even hear what I'm saying.
---
Who's building a Moon Door?!  :-P
---
Spoopy
---
Omg wow. Lmao. They did say it was unintended. They said that like 2 months ago. Obviously it wasn‚Äôt top priority especially because of the certain coming of childish posts from those such as yourself here. The point of doubling your condition was suppose to be that your weapon/armor condition was double. Go figure. You could totally buy a repair kit. Or you could spend the small amount of resources it takes to repair the item and do it yourself... maybe double that if you‚Äôve got the perk... or get 150% from the repair kits that you can‚Äôt purchase... up to you bud
---
Hey I'm dead behind you waiting :P
---
I figured it out
---
Happened to me last night. Was getting heavy decided to scrap the junk i had right after getting the tic blood sac and boom! Do it all over again. Except the bloodbug it didnt scrap
---
Did that comment say it was op? It says it‚Äôs a dumb design
---
I take a pic on my phone after I've loaded the machine.
---
Should have a quest to help him and then he becomes an ally to help you.
---
...lol
---
I think this new patch makes now a great time to implement a new fast travel system. 
---
Perhaps add a map to train stations that let's you warp to other discovered stations for free
---
I generally do that as common courtesy.
---
It was a bit 'iffy' before they patched it so one had to do 'substantial damage' to CAMP items before earning oneself a nice bounty because my aim is not perfect and splash damage is a thing.
---
Now that you just can't unintentionally damage someone's CAMP at all leaving them to trash the place is unforgivable - and exploitable.
---
Because rememeber that there are players out there that still really really want to wreck your camp for shits and giggles one way or another.
---
My garden and water purifiers are for everyone, I drink flux and have carnivore so they're not super useful to me, but I would like a sign to indicate that you can help yourself
---
wait xD Server is sayin ''no'' doesnt want me to join
---
Don‚Äôt think gonna be able to Unsee a giant wooden beetle now :P
---
I only go just because my base is....unique and if I don‚Äôt tell them in voice chat not to walk through the invisible walls they will fall out of it and die. I built my base inside hornright and so I have to be there to make sure my customers don‚Äôt kill themselves or get too snoopy as to how I got it in there ;)
---
Show me where they said it was unintended. I don't remember that ever being said. Show me and I'll believe it.
---
Unfortunately yeah, besides any possible timelocked stuff like new side quests or a new dungeon, this update was basically just a short intro quest and then a bunch of grinding for Scout cosmetics.
---
Yep, that's what everyone complaining about this seem to be missing (note that I'd be complaining right alongside them if it didn't work, but it does).
---
It¬¥s the same on the Warriders butt.
---
Where do those numbers come from?
---
What are you talking about
---
Didn‚Äôt know you could sell those! I will be on the lookout now
---
You're very welcome! :) It has brought me so much joy. 
---
Don't forget you can just copy everything to a new playlist, then you can add or remove tracks at your leisure. Not all songs from the games are on Spotify unfortunately or are different (worse) versions.
---
Crops are individual to the player. You can harvest crops, I can harvest them too. Water can be locked, if its unlocked it's fair play.
---
That was one of the major gripes with many people since the game released.
---
I just slap a .38 receiver on my *** combat rifle for a little while. Not much notable difference pve
---
Is there a point saving scrip on alternate characters? Or do you think the vendor‚Äôs items will be level locked? For example I have a few level 2 mules. Should I get scrip on them or transfer all the junk legendaries to my main character? Hope that makes sense.
---
A cm replied to someone asking why it wasn‚Äôt applied to ranged weapons. When they said it was unintended to be happening at all everyone cried there too
---
I agree. I would hope if someone brought something to my place, they‚Äôd kill it. Or at least keep it from killing my cow.
---
That's a pretty spicy take for a game that's barely been out for six months.
---
How do you control where other players spawn, then?  
---
I'm not going to use it to make people fall off cliffs. 
---
Come on, it's not even near a cliff! Stop looking at me!
---
Shit, I still haven't found the camera yet.
---
oh ffs
---
Ut tells you the current amount the player has once they buy something. That player had 21 fusion cores after buying some from you.
---
That's the price of running a small business unfortunately.
---
It's legit the people who were working on anthem were told to move onto another game because it's become one of the worst ea games ever
---
We don't know that. We don't know shit about it. The fallout gamepedia has lots of pages just as lacking info on things that are in the game.
---
It‚Äôs a requirement for the Tadpole Medic challenge. I concur with past discussions on this topic that the item simply doesn‚Äôt exist yet.
---
Well that sure was a constructive and informative post. If you think the exams are too hard i have some news for you...
---
So many new items in the Atomic Shop that I'm happy to drop money on but I have no budget to place it.
---
Mine crashed 6x in a row last night to the point I couldn't play at all.hopefully won't be as bad once I jump on here in a few.
---
??
---
Show me
---
No. Don't.
---
Find a window and hope there's a crafting bench next to it. Press E, and get out of the bench. Leave a bag of fertilizer on their bed.
---
Sweet thanks
---
Thanks for the update.  Glad it turned out well.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
My camp will prolly spawn you outside of the map
---
I get that you can do stuff still but when you have that in the way it can be annoying is the point because there's no way to stop it.
---
Glad my buddy plays with me. Wouldn't have that issue. Only one character though so I just stick to my heavy weapons and power armor. And he likes the lighter weapons so we just give them to each other.
---
What‚Äôs up!?
---
Naw, it's a wasteland risk!
---
Yeah, quest wise there is not a lot to do for us higher levels in between updates, but I realise that creating new quests takes time so I'm willing to wait. In the meantime, I love paying things forward by helping out newer players. Offering to build Fusion generators is a good one! I've been dropping plans and chems for lower levels for ages, and I love that I can now use my vending machine for that.
---
Once you spawn in at the camp, walk forward a bit and then to your right and then towards the building with the campfire in front of it. The archery range is behind that building if you go past it on the right side
---
i can't click on you wtf xD
---
I have it so if you need something just ask
---
im on xbox....will you die for me.
---
It's not that everyone isn't using a mic, many are on teams and prefer to use another method of communication (discord, console party, etc.) since you can talk to your group when you server hop or crash.
---
That said, I often don't have my headset on as I'm a lone wanderer at times and don't want to hook up my headset or wear it.
---
Those comments were me exactly brother don‚Äôt worry
---
Process of elimination. Keep-a goin
---
You can scroll through months of this subreddit yourself thanks
---
I want to milk your cow \*blushes\*.
---
You can stop making unfounded claims without proof, thanks.
---
The only exam I 1st-time passed was Cooking..ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I think the exam questions are well thought out and there‚Äôs multiple random questions to make it more difficult. It‚Äôs kinda like the DMV quest, just embrace the moment and you‚Äôll actually end up having fun!
---
Im offline at this moment. Be back later. Ill give You a shout if thats ok.
---
You and I both know they'd charge at least 200 atoms per song
---
I am pretty sure some people bought stuff from me just to be nice, like a little kid with a lemonade stand.
---
Diluted stimpack?
---
Lmao don‚Äôt believe me then
---
Don't kill the frog, collect it. 
---
Otherwise you're stuffing a corpse in a jar.
---
Are u online now m8?
---
Sent/ cav assassins gear should be o.p. .The problem is there should only be like ten complete sets out there but there are 10000...
---
There is cabin at lake, with ramp in water, on that ramp is speaking device-reproductor. Use it while wearing swiming suit.    I did post and it is in hot, check it.
---
can we get an F in the chat for camera-jumping.
---
getting lvl25s like me to Watoga since 2019
---
A thread about this was posted a few days ago and someone summarized it as it takes a bunch of time to get the license and stuff. Plus it‚Äôs pretty expensive.
---
What is that in cash?
---
Agreed. Been in and out since Beta. I wish they had waited and released the game in its current form. Maybe I could get some friends to buy and play with me. They really need to consider doing like a 20 level trial or something. I look forward to playing every day.
---
Yeah, haven't figured that one out either
---
I never locked my purifiers before, however I realized I never actually used them so when i rebuilt my camp I got rid of them and my crops altogether. Wasn't using them at all and needed the extra camp budget. I never minded people getting them if they needed. I have so much purified water I started selling to vendors to get rid of some. Its literally laying around everywhere if you are a good scavanger.
---
Nevermind he just died for no reason.
---
No its something else. Diluted are listed for the challenge as another step
---
I'm playing solo so most charisma cards are useless to me, but I instantly put on the one that discounts travel costs :D
---
I came out of some players house and there was a scorched mirelurk king. 
---
It took me a second to realize it was his pet but I wondered if players could kill his pet. Now I know and feel bad because the king was/is a good boy.
---
that's great hopefully they will stay on this time
---
I would have took out my Grongak Axe, cut him to pieces, cooked his meat and put it in the fertilizer for the new Brahmin...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
---
Ahem
---
This is also why my farm and Brahmin is downstairs under lock and keypad lol
---
Okay. But did they fix Chainsaws and Drills?
---
Why are you even hanging around this sub?
---
Good info, thank you brave frontiersman
---
Roughly $2
---
That's pretty spicy take for a game that has barely been out for six months. Look at FONV, that game was rife with about as many bugs and crashes as we've ever seen upon launch and now it's heralded as one of the best games in the franchise, which would have been unthinkable shortly after it's release. Perceptions (unlike war) always change.
---
Im of this mentality too. Trying to put up signage to advertise the place at a distance is so hard under the budget :/
---
Haven‚Äôt started them yet and I am actually dreading it based on feedback.
---
All of this is really awesome. 
---
Please forgive me, I've had a shit day at work. How do I start the scout's quest? I'm sorry guys. I'd really appreciate some help.
---
Put a point into travel agent and things are much cheaper.  
---
Making FT free to camps would ruin the exploration side, people would abuse it and use it to travel to nearby destinations.
---
Omg I laughed til I cried, thank you for that lol
---
Yeah it is good but i have inside 209plans in it worth maybe 3x what bottlecap cap is. Lol hopefuly someone guys wont want buy everything at once.
---
And i hate people who can't place vending machines on visible spot!!!!
---
Very jealous, looking for this exact thing on ps4!
---
That would suck...  would 100% do it for 25 atoms/$.25
---
Lol good luck. If you‚Äôre on Xbox, GT Jay Kateel.
---
1400 caps across all the vendors.. yup
---
Well I‚Äôm fairly certain that it‚Äôs a lot easier to get these older songs and also I just think it would be great to get more songs.
---
From the very first hour of BETA, I have never put a lock on anything in my camps. 
---
My Camp and all of its components are open to the public. It‚Äôs just water, it‚Äôs just crops, heck my junk extractor is even open for any who want to collect it. 
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why so many people want to lock their 6 water purifiers away, like it‚Äôs such a precious resource..give me a break, for real..give your fellow players a nice open place to enjoy as much as you do. 
---
Like Joker says in Next Friday, ‚ÄúNo locked doors, homie!!‚Äù
---
They did somewhat for explosive shotguns.
---
Finally.
---
Not sure, yesterday I tried to snap a foundation in a different height to no avail.
---
Yeah, I figured they were the easiest, but when you finished you only got 3 badges I‚Äôm sure, right? What I‚Äôm hoping is that those challenges aren‚Äôt the *only* way to get badges.
---
Same. Im loving it
---
Let's not forget the entomologist part, where the things you need can be automatically scrapped.
---
But it‚Äôs not a bad design it‚Äôs a design it has limitations and counters. Your just garbage so you got killed by that build a lot
---
More ambiguous than hard
---
Thats different lol
---
Was it snapped to a previous foundation?
---
Fun fact. If someone buys it during a load screen sometimes it just forgets to tell you
---
That makes sense at least we know where the discrepancy comes from. Hopefully they can fix that eventually.
---
Grahm is also affected.  All vendors share a pool.
---
Amen. I actually hate the cameras. I think it takes away front the post apocalyptic vibe. What‚Äôs that? Everyone fucking died and everything‚Äôs gone to shit? Fuck it let‚Äôs just take goofy pictures in fortnite poses. At least make it not a requirement for challenges and stuff.
---
Mine is there as well! Everything I own others can use, it‚Äôll regrow/comeback.
---
Have you found a way to get badges other than the ‚Äúworld challenges‚Äù? Or have you just been grinding those out?
---
Yeah!
---
Even then, there's almost no one that do the events anymore, besides maybe 2 or 3 events.
---
... dude, you do know they have a survival mode now right?
---
Eh I'm to busy with my AA lever action although not a bad idea
---
Yep i did that, when i got sone extras i out them in my stash until i got the meat
---
I also love building in 76. I more meant the legendary drops. I love getting the junk needed to build new camps/craft. As someone else said below, the crafting in Anthem is a joke. They give you unimaginable amounts of materials to craft, but the items you craft will never be better than what you already have. This leaves the only course of upgrade to obtain them from drops (and those are next to non-existent). Crafting in FO won‚Äôt allow you to make items better than the legendaries you already have either, but at least you get xp for the craft and you can learn mods by breaking them down.
---
I really do love this game lol
---
This was posted the other day :
---
https://redd.it/b9driw
---
Nope, PC... these new 'challenges'... is going to take a while :P
---
This is why the game needs an official text chat. The mod was bringing us all together to complete these challenges, tracking down the Flatwood Monster or a meet up on the edge of a nuke in Garb of Mystery. Now, while it's down for the patch, it's so hard to meet up with even my friends to do the new missions. Is there really no possible way to contact a PC friend if they're not directly in front of you or in your group ? Literally no possible way, unless you have their reddit or other forum info.
---
I know at least three places where a Deathclaw is guaranteed to spawn every time, if that helps? I can't say if they drop hide every time though?
---
1: Deathclaw Island near Point Pleasant
---
2: Power station just north of Watoga
---
3: There's a lead deposit at the bottom of the cliff just west of Top of the World. Follow the cliff south from the deposit a very short way to find a third Deathclaw.
---
Is that any help? :)
---
Dude this question is asked daily here, just go read the patch notes for all the different updates. no one's going to give a concise Reddit response with all the changes
---
They even make you confirm you want to sell favorites items before you do it! They knocked this all out of the park!
---
What is all this thanking Bethesda about? They are *supposed* to make a bug free and good game to begin with. You don't get rewarded for doing something you were supposed to do anyway. 
---
That is like thanking me everyday I show up to work on time. 
---
Why has the community just tacitly accepted coming out with unfinished and broken games are the norm? And then when AAA companies like Bethesda fix the problem they created they are suddenly seen as the heros we never had?
---
Remember when beta testing was an actual paid job and finished games (minus microtransactions) was a normal thing?
---
Okay screw that. Did it work for you?
---
This is true. 
---
Mine are out front, all in a row, and easy to access. 
---
I even labeled my machines with what loot they have in them so if you see I have 15 weapons and 25 plans on the map, I have them on separate clearly marked machines to help üôÇ
---
So are camps now visible to all players ?
---
Not that bad an idea
---
You can inspect the legendary items.. on Xbox, I click the right stick. It worked for me last night when I was jumping through people's camps
---
They are not hard, people are just impatient and like to whine about everything irrelevant. It takes 5min of trial and error to pass them.
---
I got 2500 .45 ammo and 1700 .44 ammo for 0 caps. Not sure if the guy was giving them away or is just didn't realise he made the price free
---
It would be impossible to sell my favorite gun because no other gun is name ~Abroham Lincoln.
---
But thanks for the heads up!
---
It's a server stability issue more than any other. Likewise with stash size people keep begging for.
---
Limits like that keep you logging in every day.
---
You can't use up all your legendaries today so you will have to log in tomorrow to do it and so on and so forth.
---
So makes perfect sense for a game company.  The more days you log in the more chances you have of buying Atoms. $$$
---
I did it once. Was enjoyable.
---
Hunter is easy also, radstags by the golf course, you guai at the mountain side bed and breakfast (stand on the train cars), and wolves from leader of the pack. Took about 30 min to do.
---
He put a vending machine there, which is you going "Hey, come visit and buy my stuff."
---
Jesus Christ, this echo chamber smells of horseshit. You need to get a maid or a stable hand or whoever the hell cleans up horseshit... I mean like yesterday, this is awful...
---
That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt put a door in my house. ;) that and I always left it open anyway.
---
I could also use assistance, if anyone is still up for needing a revive or swimming revive.  
---
Can make it someone's while!
---
What is the cap limit please?
---
sweet, I guess that uses the fall reduction armors?
---
Bethesda xD
---
Cranberry relish!!!!  If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can make some for you. It‚Äôs +10% xp for an hour. I usually make 4-5 at a time and the others spoil before I can eat them so I give a couple away.
---
Yeah because I pvp so often üòÇ even in pve it was just flat stupid. You literally stand there and bam you‚Äôre invincible. How can they balance encounters when a player either has 300 health and dies in 10 shots or a player has 20 health and takes 400 shots to kill? Now it‚Äôs just gonna feel an immortality slot machine with proc chance but honestly that sounds like the most boring play style I could possibly imagine.
---
No clue man but they way a metric ton...
---
Feel like I might wake up in a prison lol
---
I need to do the swimming revive and can die for you :)
---
Also, you‚Äôre*.
---
He's hackin and whackin and smackin.
---
Yes.  I just saw it.
---
Only if you set up a powered vending machine
---
I think there was a small boost in camp, I was max budget before the update but after I was able to put 2 vending machines, a few signs and conductors to attach wires to the machines.
---
Lol 33 days ago silly. Those Nuke codes are form 3 weeks ago.
---
My point exactly, why loot at a camp..
---
They don't drop hides tho, killed 20. Not single hide.
---
By wiki hide should drop also from behemoths, killed 5. Zero hides.
---
Not even death corpses around fisure sites.
---
I am not sure if it is in game. I need it to get mod on my backpack tho.
---
Yea, I see that same question come up 5-10 times a day.. there are too many changes to go over, and the best thing to do is a google search for the inside the vault series and patch notes.. both on Bethesda.net
---
Right!? I‚Äôm running thru every floor of someone‚Äôs CAMP looking for it and it‚Äôs hidden in the back.
---
That would put an end to Power Armor being useless in Survival.
---
You can pass them just by asking google the question anyway.
---
If it DOES exist, about 3 weeks of grinding all possible vendors for plans didnt reveal it. And I haven't seen anyone chime in on it yet, so I'm going to assume this item simply isnt released, and it was some cut content they forgot to remove from the challenge.  
---
Given how buggy the challenges are in general, I wouldn't be surprised if this was content they initially had slated for  release, then decided to cut out and now "readded" it without doing proper QA on it.
---
Every damn time!
---
I use an XBOX controller on PC and it wasn‚Äôt working. Also didn‚Äôt work for others in my group who use keyboard.
---
I found that people spawn in a small radius around where I originally paid to place my camp module.. even if I move it after, they spawn around where it was originally set.
---
25,000
---
I mean they spawn inside the wooden foundation literally lol... I'll have to modify my camp a little
---
Me = also an idiot so thx for the heads up. Cooked the gathered radstag meat for explosive bait quest.
---
I've gotten them from the Imposter sheep.
---
but all the butthurt fanboys wanna talk about is "bioware screwed us! They're gonna abandon the game." I've called them out at every opportunity, and they just  circle-jerk downvote me. I'm not sure how long you've followed FO76, but I'm pretty sure I remember plenty of "Bethesda please don't abandon us" when this game came out...and I think similar things happened with Destiny, maybe even other games.
---
I will,ty for reply
---
I got a bolstering/Sent piece for 2k and my friend got a FE Gatling plasma for 1700
---
same here guys, i will die for You both :D, whats Your ign??
---
Then don‚Äôt do that quest.... problem solved? What‚Äôs the issue?  It took like 10 minutes to do it. Then I put the camera in my stash box.
---
How did anyome reach 1000 in a single day?
---
I'm overcumbered for the next 3 days waiting for the script reset.
---
How am I supposed to do this without a Mic?
---
Use some secret combination of emotes?
---
 I never join a random group without discussing what our objectives are 1st. Impossible with this game while there is no chat box.
---
Piss poor developing decisions.
---
&gt; It's legit the people who were working on anthem were told to move onto another game 
---
If I remember right, these were the higher up managers? You know...because EA probably wants to get DA4 in the works. Anthem is out....they just need a crew their to fix the game and support it. Maybe, just maybe, DA4 is now the next focus of Bioware for upper level management, while Anthem still gets a good chunk of resources?
---
Well, that's convenient! That's what I get for having IRL stuff to do and forgetting to log back in sort of frequently. Thanks!
---
Do you get a notification for a sale? I don‚Äôt think I have sold anything yet. :(
---
I hear this "I'm roleplaying a raider" excuse a fair amount.
---
Unless your bro is running around in only raider gear, then he is roleplaying a dick, nothing more.
---
Just join a random team 4Head
---
Social anxiety is a thing buddy. Or Some people just don't want to talk/play with others.
---
I would suggest starting a new build.  The changes "fresh" are amazing.  
---
I took a break to finish out stormblood content in ffxiv.  Came back, monday launched a new character, made it just past morgantown.  Last night did morgantown again (had to grab the "advanced responder training" at the airport).  And holy shit. 
---
The change they made. It finally feels like the responders tried a last stand.  
---
Yes, player vendung is great,  i love the other changes on my higher characters. But knowing they changed something they didn't have to while still making all their other user request changes... I mean fark, terminals?  Camps you can travel to? True world building?
---
Amazing.
---
No Leroy I'm bilingual, there's a difference!
---
This is good to know and likely would have driven me crazy wondering why I could only inspect things *sometimes*
---
This is one of my favorite hobbies in game, right after hiding flamingos in camps
---
How in the heck do you get over 100,000 caps in 12 hours?  I barely have 2300 caps.!
---
No, are you saying that first I need to snap it? Then change height?
---
Yea, I've got two peices of fall damage armor, eliminates fall damage entirely. Needed back when I'd get fall damage for jumping too high with my marsupial combos.
---
&gt; gameplay altering microtransactions 
---
Such as...what, repair kits? You realize benches exist everywhere for repair so you'll almost never need a repair kit? Also, They're super cheap if you decide to buy the,, or you get the better version from in game enemies?
---
I played about 20-30 something hours over the recent double XP weekend...I only use three weapons and one armor set. I never repaired my armor, and I only had to repair each weapon once.
---
Everybody wants to rant about "bethesday bad for repair kits" but literally most comments I've seen is how unnecessary they are.
---
Yeah, I hate this new mission because of this. I don't like interacting with players because of how horrible some are. So doubt I'll get it done anytime soon.
---
Are you sure it's properly plugged in?
---
I found the inspect button works sometimes, other times not, with no rhyme or reason. On PS4
---
Come on. Who the f\*\*\* uses repair kits? and you get the better version playing the game (im sitting with 73 improved repair kits)
---
Read a poster at a train station then follow the directions!
---
Done and done. I had to kill the bear, that cleared the pests. Thanks again
---
Huh. That explains why today, during Encrytid event people were *rushing* en-masse to be the one to help people. Got it.
---
I was asleep. I have work for the next eight hours
---
System?
---
&gt;triple A
---
Just an FYI - Ratings like this are based on the size of a studio (the game itself, arguably), and has nothing to with the quality of a game. You can take a game as small as tic tac toe, have someone like Bioware create it, and it can officially be called "Triple A"
---
This happened to me last night. I spawned at someone's camp on a cliff in the sky. My goat legs saved me. I bought some great weapons from them in the end ü§£
---
Most can be found on Google, the situational ones are the best commonsense guess.
---
I placed it.  Haven‚Äôt really figured out what the thing does though!
---
recommend fighting off the scorched  as theres atom store challenge for 76 scorched crossbow kills just go to poisiden plant tons of scorched there that are insta killed by the crossbow
---
You can spot them in the head 1 shot kill, you can stagger with an automatic weapon very quickly and they‚Äôre armor is useless, most melee attacks stagger, critical shots ignore the armor. You just aren‚Äôt good and it shows people like you who complain about things being over powered even tho there are counters and balance are why these nerfs happen.
---
That fast travel mat sure would be nice. . .
---
Is this really what the "raiders" have been reduced to in Adventure?
---
Maybe there should be a third game mode for "raiders" who can't exploit Adventure anymore, but are too scared to live in Survival.
---
It‚Äôs for the new scout missions
---
Yeah, it's not perfect ..... I'm thinking of something along the lines of incorporating a 'mat' into the design of the vending machine, so it increases the footprint of it and that's what you spawn in on.
---
I FT'd to somebody's camp at Watoga and I spawned in mid fight.  
---
The camp had half a dozen rocket launchers giving it hell and there were 3-4 super mutants returning the favour.  
---
I couldn't see a thing, the constant concussion waves from the rocket launchers were over lapping making my screen constantly blurry and shaking, coupled with my screen flickering the red hot markers.  
---
Then the bugger logged off and took his camp with him, leaving me with the super mutants!  
---
Not shopping there again.
---
71 sneak attacks from a bleeding syringer killed a level 66.
---
lol.  here come the reddit nazis!
---
This has been happening for a few weeks now, not just after the patch, I was hoping they would fix it. When the queen is on the ground I can't even get a vats hit. It sucks.
---
its been a while, if I remember corretly it happened at the same time the vendors got added to WS
---
Oof do you mean individually or just all of them compiled?
---
There's a little speaker/button on a pole, on the dock near a small building. Its not very noticeable..
---
There should be a way to pass a intelligence check if u have high Int.
---
I'm not sure if I smell some sarcasm or not, but in case there isn't then yeah. I think I used something like 25 stims in total. This was with a shotgun/rifle build when I only had a single rifleman card maxed. So unless there's something else holding you back you should be good to go.
---
Or you're a melee build and can't shoot down the key card cargobot. üòä
---
I don‚Äôt have enough caps to do that yet. :( I need to sell some stuff first.
---
I really would like it if they just added some storyline as to how the bots got there for each faction, as right now it‚Äôs a bit of a lore-break
---
This everytime I FT to a camp I now book ass before the camp finishes spawning
---
Individually, But in the athlete exam you dont throw a shot put you "put it"  that one messed me up lol
---
PC, my bad.
---
I tried the Whitesprings station but didn't have any luck. I'm sure it's right in front of me lol.
---
Wait seriously?
---
Haven't launched a nuke myself yet, too, but the main problem I see with this challenge is lore-wise: I get that pioneer scouts are a highly patriotic institution, but asking children to launch a nuke just seems off.
---
I think I've found them in random world containers before.
---
.. Okay?
---
I farm flux and let it spoil for the superior stats to purified water
---
This is just more proof that most redditors are cucks
---
I can get you four out of the five in the Forest, all relatively close to each other.  First, go to New River Gorge Resort; bloatflies always spawn between the cabins.  Then run over to the bridge nearby and snag yourself one of the bloodbugs on the top.  Next, run down the hill (or fast travel) to Flatwoods; there's a trailer on the back road (the one with the safe) that always spawns a radroach in the shower.  Finally, fast travel over to Vault 76 and run down to the Moonshiner's Shack for the ticks.  The only one I can't help with is Stingwings, but if you haven't done the clean-up quest yet and you walk from the Kiddie Cabins to the toxic waste grounds, you might get lucky like I did and have a few spawn along the way.  If anyone knows of a guaranteed spawn in the Forest, I'd love to hear it though.
---
I have the answer but can't be arsed to tell you
---
Yeah I wish I would have paid attention to my vendor. I had 15,000 caps when someone came and bought 16000 of my 5 mm bullets I had on the vendor.
---
 So basically I lost 5000 caps because of the Max cap cap.
---
I've already done it but if you're still needing someone I can help you.
---
There is. But not the ingame intelligence but your actual one.
---
  Thats my situation.  
---
On one of my frames, I have 4x L50 parts and 2x L40 parts.  
---
A full suit of L50 is buying parts I dont need.....
---
OTOH, as a seller, a complee suit only takes up 10# of stash, whereas the individual parts are (at least) 5x that.
---
You are so clueless of the complexity here that it‚Äôs honestly frightening. Still got nerfed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Lol yea
---
Phelangie Banana-Hammock
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/anthem-fails-to-meet-eas-expectations-but-company-/1100-6466719/
---
This seems to suggest they will continue to support it
---
Somebody is just not in the pioneer scout spirit
---
Hopewell Cavern. Always spawns a Deathclaw. Not sure if theres hide though.
---
It causes lag with the current limit now.
---
But yep my feelings now with most griefers on Adventure is they get their asses handed to them in Survival, can't deal with it, don't want to work to improve so just trash others who just want to enjoy it and perhaps engage in PvP with the Adventure bounty system and workshop claims. 
---
I'm not crazy about PvP, I am building a Survival mode character to have a go, but at least when I do PvP in adventure I fight other players who attack me and mine or hunt bounties. I don't need to wreck camps to make me feel special.
---
All good. With time zones etc I‚Äôm sure there will eventually be a time we line up :)
---
Also you just suggested that fallout 76 is a highly skill based competitive pvp game lmao
---
ya its between the 2 red gasoline things, it blends right in and there is no pioneer sign like there is at other locations. spent 15 minutes yesterday looking for it
---
Where is that?
---
Actually do t worry, just found one at some randoms store :) thank you anyway
---
Damn. this shall be fun.
---
I'm doing this the week of my finals.... I was excited so much for a new questline.... now more test even when I'm done my testing for the day... great XD
---
I enjoy playing the game and particularly building CAMPS, so yes I have 5 characters but I do different things with all of them, different builds, CAMPs and RP backstories, so I would argue outside of the main quest, which I haven‚Äôt completed in most of them that I don‚Äôt actually repeat that much, I see no reason why the backpack shouldn‚Äôt be tradable and I feel like you completely sidestepped my main point to take a weird dig at me, the fact is I enjoy being able to build 5 CAMPs and RP 5 different characters, I don‚Äôt enjoy completing the same time consuming tasks like hunting animals a specific way or taking photos of them, just to unlock an item that I could already craft on another character, I‚Äôm not dissing the patch, I think Bethesda did a fantastic job, this is just one thing that irks me
---
Love how people were talking about how bad it was for Bethesda to have Atoms for real money.  Now it's the complete opposite and it's now the best thing to do for this company that lied simply because they finally added QoL stuff months after release.
---
Check west tek in the super mutant blood balls.
---
Mine are all unlocked. Have more than I need.
---
I have a mildy overweight man and some grenades.
---
XB1
---
Good idea thx. Gona report later.
---
Abbie‚Äôs bunker, I think?

Probs go to u/fibblez for putting this together

Patch 9 - read new info
---
Yeah...mines kinda floating but I have I think 16 columns up to 'support' everything. It probably is still unrealistic, but it makes me feel better.
---
Yooooo any chance you‚Äôre on Xbox? I need to complete those stupid magazine challenges.
---
Collective pool and the faction vendors at whitespring all got put in the same patch.
---
Means running around for shopping less hassle :)
---
Side note, I've seen today the faction vendors in whitespring have their own counters now. Will look at this tonight incase you notice it :)
---
See that's total crap.   Sorry buddy
---
I havent played for months... is it REALLY that much better?
---
Yeah, sucks being in a popular spot sometimes.  I just spent fifteen minutes trying to get in game due to my spot being taken and seeming to load back into the same server.  Same time, weather, etc.
---
you sir are a dick, have a nice day
---
hahahaha Pete Hines doesn't play this game.
---
Is that on the workshop at Ash Heap? Isnt the destroyed Monorail near Fort Defiance higher?
---
Standardized testing must not have been a thing in your life. I think they're strikingly accurate to actual merit badge test. Its not just a test for items in game. Its world building, and is very on brand for the fallout universe.
---
Looks to me like vending machines takes very little space in the budget, same for the personal terminal
---
I feel the same way about it. If you aren't engaging in pvp once in a while why are you still playing? I guess some folks find another round of white spring ghouls fun but after six months what's the point.
---
Why?
---
So your whole thrill of being killed on adventure mode is when somebody throws you a group invite?
---
 That keeps you on your toes does it?
---
 There is absolutely nothing to fear an adventure mode.
---
The only way you can be attacked on adventure is if you own a Workshop or get a random invite like the op.
---
 So keep checking your stash! You never know when that random group invite will come along!
---
Yep I'm doing the same. I'll buy any 3-star if it's 500 cops or less. I probably bought 15 3 Stars last night. It'd be so much nicer if we could turn in unlimited legendaries per day but oh well.
---
It looks like "Wasted" is fixed! Thank the maker.
---
I'd like to know too, I was really hoping for the Vault-Tec one, it wasn't in the datamined atom shop pictures.
---
yeah....i had a BIG problem yesterday
---
Placed my CAMP machine thing, and it dropped under the terrain. I spend 3hrs building my CAMP, and had to move my camp to get the machine back....which in turn stored all items.
---
annoying!!
---
Todd said these quests were there best work.... hahahahahaaha
---
They also have Tetris for the super meek.
---
Fast Travel spawn point is relative to the CAMP beacon location, moving the beacon changes the spawn point.
---
Nah it feels about right. I did a queen fight yesterday and probably around 3-4 times I could see myself taking full amounts of damage from the queen while the rest of the time I wasn‚Äôt taking any :)
---
Game is getting better every day - the progress made is awesome. I recently built a PC to play fallout 76 on instead of PS4 so I could get that nice nice rendering.
---
I agree. I have a full sent assassin set and it feels like it works 1/10 times. It needed a nerf, but not this way. Maybe slash the numbers, but not only working sometimes.
---
Yeah same here. After I saw it was like 3 scrip sell price for most legendary items, I thought the buying price at the vendor would be like 5000 for an assassin's hunting rifle or something, but if the cap is 1000 then they may not be so bad.
---
I was hoping to see the Enclave backpack because it matches the Enclave officer uniform
---
Go to West Tec, put on the 'Aqua Boy' perk and jump in the green water. One of them has a fatman in it
---
Ah Nuts I was gonna take u up on that offer....
---
hey there :) sorry, on pc :/ But on the bright side though, using someone else's magazine and bobblehead unfortunately won't count toward your own challenge. Need to find them ourselves, I speak from bad experience heh.
---
My best weapon I found so far was it 3 * plus 250 damage resist explosive Furious 10 mm. At the low low price of 3,000 caps.
---
That's why I put plants and purifiers out. Not for me, for travelers. Now if you stole the whole plant somehow then we have a problem.
---
For real, last night I was buying legendaries for under 200 caps, like who cares with caps? They‚Äôre an infinite resource with a hard limit.
---
A 25% chance to fail is fairly large, especially when it has to roll the dice once per piece. Factor in the fact that you‚Äôre probably being hit multiple times quite fast, like by an automatic rifle, or the fact that the dice probably gets rolled per shotgun pellet, and you‚Äôll often take a decent amount of damage. Still a good affect to have.
---
Message on selling is old feature. Message on drop is new
---
I wear a full set and was testing it in PvP. I would say the vast majority of incoming attacks did either full or most of the damage.
---
one thing you can do is move your camp thing or just rotate it. people spawn a set spot away from the camp thing and even rotating it changes where you spawn
---
 I think this is good news wrt what we can expect legendaries to cost (my guess would be most will fall in the 300-700 scrip range). 
---
Whether or not the vendor will populate with anything worth buying is another matter. 
---
Will be interesting to see if there is an item of the day or similar that is available to everyone on every server or if it will be a shared inventory pool where once a player buys an item it is no longer available for anybody else to purchase or if it will be a truly instanced inventory where each player gets a random list of items. 
---
I
---
This is so weird. I traveled to 5 or 6 camps and spawned right in front of the vending machine each time. Hopefully they fix this soon.
---
This is what i can remember
---
Swimming- dont run, swimming buddy alerts in a emergency, dont chew gum, light snack for high energy, dont run-walk by pool
---
Archer- shell isn't part of a arrow, mr handy gives the all clear, lower bow and release tension, arbalist shoots daily.
---
Athlete- Abraham Lincoln is the wrestler, a marathon is 26 or so miles, 4 possible runs in a homerun, shot put is "put" not thrown.
---
For anyone asking, this. I put on goat legs in tandem because I thought it was multiplicative. Another poster said the destroyed monorail is higher so who knows. I didn't do any real tests I just thought it was cool.  
---
But yeah,  I play a very fast, stealthy marsupial build. My 3* instigating dagger can generally kill anything in one hit and being able to jump, and fall great heights really helps.
---
Is the latest update just a patch? I noticed that survival mode had been updated recently so I headed on yesterday to try it out. Alas, another update. Going to have to give it another go today!
---
I spawned inside of 3 locked camps while on a shopping spree last night, but was able to FT to a nearby location everytime.
---
Players need to monitor this and make adjustments to their CAMP beacon location if they want to sell anything.
---
Tadpole challenge
---
You can't control where you land in someone's base, I appear in one of 6 different places at my base!
---
Im aiming to reduce the weight in my stash. I put 1500 rounds of ammo for free yesterday, and some level 7 bought em all (Thank you!) Then looking at the value of items, I usually go down from there. (So if a plan is worth 50 caps, I sell for like 25 caps) I'm not gonna make a fortune but at least I'll have room to move! 
---
And from my experience so far in this game...all of this is bonus caps. Hearing prices though makes me think I won't be able to afford anything.
---
I spawned inside of foundations or other solid objects SIX times last night.
---
I also managed to get inside of three locked CAMPS thanks to wonky spawn points.
---
if you still havent done it by tonight like 6pm let me know because I havent either as im usually a solo palyer  and will need some help. Feel free to request me!
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
It's okay to give optional Team-up challenges but not depending on them.
---
On top - how do you communicate with other players with no mic/muted only by using emotes?
---
Exactly! I probably spent 12000 cops in a couple hours. Only made for back but who cares I still have another 40000 in worthless caps. Now I'm just looking for specific armor that I think looks cool and guns I've always wanted and then just having fun being a vendor. Just last night I talked to more people than I've had in a couple of week's
---
How‚Äôd you know the exact location of it without ever using it?
---
Well, based on the way they nerf everything and cao damage players can take, Bethesda just wants there to be nothing powerful. They seem to want this to be open world call of duty and I disapprove.
---
Ohh, I am way over priced. I put mine up for 200 caps.
---
Do laps around the pioneer scout lake, I found three

You saying that actually proves me right, but no there is no content in this game. The problem is, all the new content they‚Äôve made is too short, and no the Biv quests don‚Äôt count. Dailies are not content, nobody wants to wait an entire day to do the quest and don‚Äôt tell me anything about me not understanding that because I‚Äôve been farming the Camden Park dailies since January. I‚Äôm tired of doing the same thing over and over again until I finally get the fuzzy costume. Nobody wants to go and make player quests because those aren‚Äôt fun for the people who make them, which I‚Äôve also tried.
---
It's not a drop from an enemy, but I have certainly found it before multiple times in containers. Such as the yellow wooden crates you see around, unfortunately it's completely random so gl lol.
---
Jesus, did someone shart in your cereal this morning?
---
I had tried that and didnt seem to find any. Serverhopping now
---
I agree with that wholeheartedly. During the Fasnacht event, everyone on the server would come by and participate, and more often than not people would just chill around after and talk or go do more events together. It really brought the community together. But I see player vending doing something similar. I've had more player interaction in the last two days than I have the entire time I've been playing.
---
Well yes I have a full assassin sent set too. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet in pvp however I‚Äôd assume it would be less effective due to the fast rate of fire of most of the guns. Seems like we are going to have to rely heavily on fireproof, dense mods, dodgy, serendipity, and stealth boys to survive in pvp
---
No it's actually not though and that's the dumbest argument I've ever heard
---
Archery, swimming, athlete. Provided you can talk someone into stepping on a grenade in shallow water.
---
She got the ultimate sunburn when the nukes dropped.
---
Those poles use up lots of budget and get destroyed by mobs very quickly!
---
* South of Watoga by the houses where the mirelurk queen spawns. 
---
* Census Violence event south of Watoga.
---
* Swarm of Suitors event near Camp Lewis.
---
So it‚Äôs 75% with a full set and not 75% per piece ?
---
I'm an Engineer IRL, so the floating camps bothers me to no end.
---
Yikes!
---
Free samples. I have an aluminum extractor and can't spare the acid for smelting, so I plan to sell the ore for 1c each. I'll lock it when I need to replenish my inventory, but the rest of time the 14 in the extractor are freebies.
---
IIRC, scrip is not transferable, so you may be better off xfering the item to your main.
---
Lol thank you OP
---
TIP: If you‚Äôre not doing high level terminals because they suck to do when you‚Äôre not in the mood, choose the top three passwords, back out and try again until it works.
---
I wouldn't even say this is dlc since it was promised way back at launch.
---
Who is this nobody and why should I care about his opinion?
---
I agree i have always liked the game even though it was a bit laggy in the start because they kept on fixing and listening to the community.
---
It was just a double barrel that I was being hit with. Not even a quad so it was easy to make out the rate that I took full or near full damage. I would say a full set of Sentinal Assassins helps about as much not having any armor and just jumping around with marsupial now. They've destroyed the only counter to OP bloodied builds and explosive weapons.
---
I need somone on xbox.
---
Dump the junk, you can find it as you need it (more fun to do the hunting for junk anyways)
---
I end up with 100s of purified water just from doing events. It's just not that big of a deal.
---
If it were easy they wouldn't be called "challenges"...
---
David Attenborough: "The wily cannibal raider of Appalachia often relies upon their prey teleporting to precarious heights, whereupon they fall to their doom, thus feeding the raider and his gang for weeks."
---
I watched live stream on my way home from work yesterday, saw someone use it.
---
That's what i mostly do with level 3 terminals, i already did everything higher than 0 in a nuke silo tho
---
Is the max caps limit changed?
---
I'm sure your camp is better than mine, I just have a church with a toilet to worship. A player yesterday got on his headset and said "praise be the poo temple" lol it made my night.
---
This has been a problem in one of my bases forever, if I'm not there to place down a rescue chair, they have to fast travel to a nearby landmark, which thankfully is free due to proximity!
---
I read that a flee can jump 50 times their body length. I'm \~6 feet tall, so I took 50 x 6 to get 300 feet 300 feet is 100 yards or... the length of a football field. It's obviously going to differ based on the height of the person but it was the closest answer and was correct.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I notice. Seems they just want a open world call of duty game. Oh well though not much we can do about it.  Gonna trade my set for a Unyielding set
---
I'm down! Riggyrigg28! I'll add you later if you don't beat me to it, could use some help with quests as well. I usually play solo. I do have a headset.
---
You can't sell on them unless you have space in your workshop budget!
---
Sponsored post: cards are for sale in some vending machines. Like mine.
---
&gt; Remember when beta testing was an actual paid job and finished games (minus microtransactions) was a normal thing?
---
People playing a game like Fallout 76 was never a paid job, beta or otherwise and I sure as hell remember a time when most games were as buggy and janky as Fallout 76 without the chance of any kind of patches, or a time before microtransactions when a single bad game could close a studio and lose hundreds of people their jobs. The good old days where people could spend hundreds of hours of their lives only to see their game flop in sales. Truly those were the good old days
---
That's awesome to hear :). I'm also glad I'm not alone ha.
---
ya you can get random mounted plans
---
i did the quest last night(2 times, like 6 hours later from the first time)
---
the second time i did it i got all my bug parts turned it in and got mounted tick, fast travel somewhere to be hit with "controls temporary disabled" which then dc'ed me. get back into the game and have the same daily like it rolled me back but i still had the plan in my inv but not my bug parts i had collected....did it again and got a new mounted plan. so i did the same daily 3 times in one day......
---
I play for 20 hours a week and from scavenging for junk, chems, food and clothes which I sell to vendor bots with their new 1600 caps per day limit, I can earn 4.5 to 6K a week I never seem to keep it as I've been buying lots of plans, and I'll keep les of it now with player vending.
---
I'm about damn sick and tired of this Destiny style game evolution. It goes like this.... 
---
A new Meta arrives, you grind for the new Meta, you get the new Meta, they nerf the new Meta into oblivion, Another new Meta arrives, you grind for the new Meta, you get the new Meta, they nerf the new Meta into oblivion again, and on and on and on. 
---
Bloodied are next I guarentee.
---
Wait so the shooting range is in the southwest corner of the pioneer camp, I can‚Äôt find it
---
I had a good laugh when i saw that
---
Exactly! And that's really cool about the selfie ;)
---
I don't have the resource space for columns.
---
You can dilute stimpacks, radaways and rad-xs at chemistry workbench.
---
I‚Äôm hunting for ammo and shit like that, yesterday a dude either made a mistake or wanna to get read of some, because I got 2k cell for my laser gun for free!
---
Amazing times!
---
That doesn‚Äôt cover all the possible questions for those exams. It randomizes out of a list of like 20 questions each time you try any particular exam
---
Lol no ur the amazing ;)
---
Has anyone noticed yet that fix it good does not increase defense on armor anymore. I been reading on here and have not seen a post yet. I'm wondering if it was intended, or if it's a bug.
---
And a robot/scorched/mole miner dj!
---
Before you do though just know that an unyeilding set will only directly increase the damage of your melee weapons. All of your stats will be increased but ranged weapons dont see an increase in damage, not even bloodied.
---
you can also grab a free poster from the Atom store, put it in your camp and read it! (Assuming you have space and don't have to spend the next 30 mins rebuilding things to make room for a tiny poster like I did!)
---
What a madlad
---
And they no longer add a star to a 3 star!
---
Nope, 8deathclaw hands, zero hides.
---
Yeah I know I‚Äôm switching to melee build.
---
Diffuser is different than diluted. No one seems to have figured out how to make it yet.
---
I bought an Max Level All-Rise for 100 Caps, a Sentinel combat armor left leg for 200 and a whole bunch of other good shit for pretty cheap prices
---
I liked how this one camp I went to, they were selling purified water for 10 caps each, and there were a bunch of water purifiers near them. So I thought I could be clever and just take the water straight out of the purifier. Nope, all of them were locked. Clever.
---
It is the 3rd floor of ash heap. I haven't been to the monorail I'll go check it out!
---
You'd be surprised, people will pay it!
---
I have mine just right above Camp Adams on one of the rock outcroppings. Hopefully it's in enough to where nobody's falling off.
---
Also feel free to make use of everything if I'm on and you're around! ¬°Mi campamento es su campamento!
---
Oh, ok, didn't started that pioneer quest yet, so it must be something else.
---
The thing they changed was now there is no requirement for any peices snapped to the first peice, probably has to be same height
---
It will get auto scrap....i have one if u want. Picking up from my dropped bag wont count toward the challenge. U have to purchase it. I have mine in the vending machine. If i get back home early u can come to me. Ign:hookah002
---
Kryptonian2075
---
Bought 1500 shotgun shells, 1500 10mm, and 1500 308 all for one cap apiece.  Best update ever.
---
I feel you. I bought a lot yesterday, sometimes with the vendor around. But it was all good experiences. I usually do a lot of lurking and scoping places out first, but it seemed like everyone was on a shopping spree yesterday so it made it fun :)
---
If you stand next to vending machines, looking on pioneer robot, you have to turn 90¬∞ right and go stright in corner. 
---
Or run around outside of camp, you cant miss it.
---
I worked hard to make sure my camps usual default spawn was right near some stairs and a sign to my store. But sometimes it still decides to throw me in the middle of the lake.
---
I've considered moving my camp someplace close to a free travel location (the vaults, generally) for just this reason, but Im not sure if it would help cut costs for visitors
---
Aside from the floating houses, I love that this patch lets us see what other folks have created!
---
Also you‚Äôll need a swim suit to do it
---
Yes! Me too. Got a lot of fashnaght plans I missed out on :D
---
Also a swamp under the W of the compass on the map that has a big mirelurk family not really a grinded area so the should be alive on arrival
---
Don't need to pvp, just go to a workshop and do it. I did it last night after seeing a post on it.
---
Maybe the deathclaws in the Abandoned Waste Dump in the Mire drop deathclaw hide. I'm not too sure though.
---
Ok thanks
---
People have cried so much about the game they have ruined it for everyone else.  The nerfs to legendary armor, explosives, and shotguns have made the game harder for people to fight enemies that are not other players.  Good luck running silos by yourself now.  Armor durability has gone down, weapon durability has gone down so they can sell repair kits in the atom shop.  PVP cap rewards are locked at 50 caps.  I thought this was a game about the wasteland?  If a raider cant raid, how is that person getting to play the game they paid for how they want to play it?  Isnt that the reason for a multiplayer online game, to play against other players? All these snowflakes crying about it and then the devs just do whatever they say.  This game is turning into the worst kind of game.  Why are there still enemies in the game?  Just take them all out so care bears can run around and hug each other.
---
If your contesting you cant destroy the workshop, i posted a video on bethseda, its pretty horrid i had i much higher level come steal mine, 
---
He took it, my turrets didnt shoot at him, well.....
---
I go to take it back my old turrets start railing me while he chases me around with melee 1 hitting me while i try to destroy turret to no avail.
---
Using a nerfed explosive shitty with 300 damage i bairly scratch him im 1 hit kill to melee and his workshop objects are invincible yeah... good job Bethesda
---
Isn't it a power armor mod? Or is that called something else?
---
I have a tamed one at my camp, if any pc player wants an easy pic.
---
Name: ThisNonsense
---
bloatfly syringer made this easy
---
Codes are only good for a week....
---
It isn‚Äôt an open world CoD pvp is pointless in both modes now.
---
I got significantly faster load times and no disconnect on PC after the patch
---
This ^
---
Wear a swimsuit and touch all 5 buoys.
---
Im confused. Thats why the dates are on them? Were you replying to someone? :)
---
Well yeah? these codes were for a month ago.. Not this weeks codes? So.... yeah
---
K
---
I didn't even notice this!! The attention to detail in this patch keeps amazing me.
---
Oh. Good luck. I'm just going to make a bloodied lever action build... until the inevitably nerf that too.
---
Gonna check, but none hide from 20deathclaws total, so i don't belive. I think it is somewhere outise laing on shelf of some house. But map is too huge for me to find it.
---
Now I‚Äôm confused üòõ I just want help figuring out bravo I have one code piece lol.
---
Find friends that will play with you then... It's really not that hard. If you're on PC we'd be glad to take you in to our little community.
---
oh didn't noticed that, I'd have to keep an eye on it then! Thanks!
---
The crossbow plans haven‚Äôt been there for multiple server hops.  RNG shouldn‚Äôt play such a huge role in whether you can earn badges.
---
Ah you want something to be able to go back and look at. Ok, I gotcha now. That would be handy...
---
Looks cool! Thanks for adding the spoiler tag! I guess I have a new location to check out today!
---
The only thing I'm not happy about is the Survival leaderboard change. With this new system resetting your rank on death, we go back to the original leaderboard's problem of being a revolving door of who gets marked. I don't give a damn about this game's busted PvP, if I'm in Survival at all I'm only there for the XP increase. I just find an unoccupied corner of the map and farm PvE enemies. I should not be on a PvP leaderboard and definitely shouldn't be marked on the map at all if I'm not engaging in PvP. 
---
Of course, the easy solution to this is to just not play Survival as I really have no interest whatsoever in PvP.
---
True. PvP has no point anymore, no fun or reward.
---
I noticed this too. It's the small stuff that makes a nice change!
---
Yeah, if ever there was a time to introduce camp fast travel mats it is now.
---
Spam jump, too.  I panic when I see the camp spawning above me, I won't lie.
---
When will you get home ?
---
Someone took it, it is not rng, just too much people. You can get crossbow in middle mountains cabins (between westtek and whitesprings)
---
Yeah but it's not right to alter the economy like that when we have what seems like an easy fix
---
Apparently you can only inspect the item if the camp owner is close by, likely a glitch
---
On one of my characters I have a wall with a door. No other walls. 
---
The only reason I built the wall and door was for the sweet atom shop reward. 
---
I'll close with this: Praise be the poo temple!
---
I love it! But had to switch to standard mag... Still 250 bullets mag size for this weapon feels good enough
---
Oh lol. You know if you have done the enclave stuff you can request silo specific mini quests to find ghoul officers and collect all the code pieces. Then if you like you can try and use a decrypter to solve it. :)
---
it was??
---
Yep :)
---
Theres an elevator that takes you to the third floor on the monorail too. Its definitely worth a check to see if its higher!
---
While your there, find about 8 bags of precious concrete too!
---
I have jumped from it, but in power armor lol
---
I see, have to try it then, thanks.
---
Did you know that CAMP brahmin don't drop meat?
---
I'm also on XB1 if you're gonna be on later
---
Thank you!!!!!! You da best
---
I do not understand why they felt the need on the shotguns. I'm very disappointed in the performance of my aae combat shotgun now. The  single best gun I ever found is now just a way to waste a lot of shells.
---
Yeah it's interesting neither the terminal or posted was featured, I nearly missed them!
---
Sleeping at the overseer's camp because moving your own camp is too expensive. üò©
---
Same my aae combat shotgun does absolutely no damage anymore. It's ridiculous
---
From now on, I will consider my 10% a donation to the care and keeping of Murgle and Chally the Moo Moo.
---
Any way to not have have damage resist on them?
---
lol thanks, good luck to you too
---
They were never in a perfect spot in PvP. A shotgun should **not** be able to outdamage a rifle at mid to long range.
---
The market place will still be the place to sell your more expensive items so that you dont lose 1000 caps or more when selling God tier items.
---
"CONGRATULATIONS!!!!" 
---
;)
---
This update was very good. I even purchased 2000 atoms to show my appreciation.
---
I just love how it shows they're really paying attention to all the details this time. When I saw a 8gb update for PS4 I was like WTF but it's been an awesome update all around. 
---
A few minor bugs like having to exit and re-enter the build menu in camp but it's to be expected and a few great bugs like my shiny new Atom shop Deathclaw bushes not sure we were supposed to be able to place them in our camps but I'm not complaining they look great. I even placed a few cat bushes just so I can have them when they fix it.
---
I've considered FO76 to be in a live beta/extended beta since launch. They've proven that they can build it and they've proven that it's popular. Now they are clearly looking at and working toward long term viability.
---
There's two major issues that will make or break this game. One is the economy. The other is balance. Both need a lot of work to keep the game alive.
---
I guess you were just lucky early on in the launch then. Back before you got a notification that your CAMP spot was unavailable, and you could either stay on that server or jump to a new one, if you just happened to load into a server where your CAMP location was taken by another player, your CAMP strait up disappeared, and at first there wasn't even a "one free move" rule. You just had to deal with your CAMP disappearing pretty much all the time, and you still had to pay full caps to build a new one. I think you're getting down voted because your gripe of losing two CAMPS in your entire time playing seems a little silly. I'm not saying your upset isn't warranted, just a little overblown. I don't think player houses should have ever been allowed in Whitesprings proper, for plenty of reasons that don't involve players exploiting anything, so I've never built/lost one there.
---
oh btw im on xbox
---
Then they also have to nerf the handmades... It's the only viable weapon now in pvp
---
You need fireproof!
---
Why build 4 stores?
---
Yeah, I don't understand the logic of making mods for that particular armor so hard to get.  I got my X-01 PA at level 51 and didn't find the shocks until level 180 and got them both within 2 hrs. of each other.  I was so excited I created a post here on the reddit called "I knew they were more than a myth".  Same story as yours with the jetpack.  I used to see them all the time. The game ate mine here a month or so ago and I have yet to find another.  I'm marsupial, so it doesn't really matter, but I just wanted it.  I am glad everyone can get what they want without too much issue now.
---
I've already made over 1000 caps, whitesprings is a good spot
---
It's going to take you a bunch of levels to make a strong character, and some of the perks which are very useful sub level 20 (IMHO scrounger, cap collector, can do, butchers bounty) may not be so useful at 40+
---
That said, melee needs lots of strength, so plan on maxing that out.
---
These are a given: Bloody mess, incisor, martial artist, glowsight (iincreased damage, armor penetration, and swing speed)
---
 green thumb (for farming food and eventually, flux).
---
good doggy will decrease you overall food needs.
---
slow metabolism - go longer between meals.
---
THere are several perks to reduce weight (packrat, batteries included, bandoleer) - great choices if you are a hoarder, not so much if you always travel light.
---
If you plan on playing (mostly) solo, you do not need many points in Charisma - most of those perks are team oriented.  
---
The only 3 charisma cards I use are Lone wander,  tenderizer, and hard bargain. (equipping the latter only when I trade)
---
Eventually, get super duper
---
picklock and hacker are also useful at lower levels, but (at least at the point I'm at, not quite as useful now.)
---
Nope. Giant walls. Turrets within the walls; so only if they breach the walls do they get shot at.
---
for the tadpol one you need to throw a granade at yourself in shallow watch the auses you be to downed
---
That's anecdotal. My CAMP is right by Whitespring so I do runs all the time. 3 last night in fact. And for each run I got 4-6 legendaries. If they changed anything they didnt for me.
---
Are they included in the loot pool for turning in badges?
---
&gt;Possum: Electrician: Take a camera picture of a generator.
---
&gt;Have tried every generator I can craft. Small, Medium, and Large generators properly show the "generator - size" in the corner, but do not give credit. Fusion generators do not give credit, and no corner indicator. Wind generators are the same as Fusion generators. Even "in the wild" fusion generators with a fusion core does not count.
---
I haven't done this yet but try a Fusion Core Generator at the power plant workshops? It probably won't work but that's all I can think of.
---
Yeah the game sound works for a moment then turns off.
---
If I plug in my headset then game sounds on tv turns back on and stays on but it requires the headset to be in the whole time for sounds to stay on.
---
Probably not
---
I also didn't think they were overpowered either, a strong solid weapon choice but in no way overpowered. I'm almost to the point I wish there weren't legendaries because everything we work hard to get/ find gets nerfed.
---
Buy and use a mic. Problem solved.
---
I liked fo76 because of open world pvp now it‚Äôs butchered in every way possible, that‚Äôs cool though.
---
Hahaha bless you my child ;)
---
I'm curious about this too because there are a lot of things you can buy with possum badges (some costing 8 badges) and about 14 possum challenges. I did two possum challenges and they each awarded 1 badge, so not sure how you can get enough to buy each thing if you want all the stuff.
---
I felt the same way when the tse nerf first came out. That nerf ruined my fun in the game. I barely play after that patch.
---
Have you put the goo in to the containers then find the bot. If u did that then not sure what's up
---
It has to be dumped into a barrel,  near the original quest start by the robot.
---
I would assume your internet speed is likely the problem. Even if you have the disc, it's an online game.
---
Wow, and here I thought years after finishing school that I would never use math again.
---
I mean don't get me wrong, I'm still not going to give a damn but if I ever *were* to use math in my daily life, it would be for this.
---
No. I do not want to hear your squeaky prepubesent voice.
---
Haha i and my scoitgroup will alsow vist the Jamboree in WV the new Questline has the perfekt timing
---
&gt;Water can be locked, if its unlocked it's fair play.
---
This, I have 2 purifiers at mine and teh wifes CAMP, 1 is locked, to makes sure we have water the other isn't and is free to use by other players
---
Gathering materials plans, and recipes so me and my friends can grow stronger easier, farming the SBQ or Imposter Sheepsquash, Farming other scorch beast for materials, making fat stacks of caps in trading! Helping fortify bases in more dangerous less contested zones so there are less servers where your base is taken! Plenty of fun to be had without pvp!
---
I keep watching for the encryptid event and hoping someone dies in the puddles there :) 
---
Seriously though, this is a bit frustrating.
---
So pretty much a ledger
---
It would have a different name though probably like Liberty Delta or Omega
---
bashing worked for me.  TIP : killing mobs by bashing them with the crossbow counts as killing them with a crossbow.  So, make or find 3 crossbows, bash mobs to death for the 50 kills (and radstag hunter kill), then go repair...
---
Atomic and Railway worked for me. Finished both without issue.
---
Lower your prices. After looking at other people's machines I went back to mine and cut my bobble head prices in half. It's a buyers market!
---
Ooooh. Powered. Shit that was a few hours wasted.
---
https://www.playstation.com/en-au/get-help/help-library/error-codes/ce-34878-0/
---
This may help... hopefully....
---
Sometimes you can‚Äôt inspect items in the vending machines which I‚Äôm sure if leading to a lot of people not buying items due to not knowing the second or third effects.
---
And I'm ok with that, if that's what I acknowledge. When I'm out to PvP, I go to survival or I disable pacifist and fight. The PvP mechanics of adventure mode are SUPPOSED to force me to willingly engage, and that's my complaint/frustration. I don't mind PvP when it happens, but this wasn't PvP. This was essentially an exploit that forced me into PvP without telling me that I was suddenly in PvP.
---
Now, that said, the mechanics of adventure mode let me ignore the guy who killed me and then block the guy who instigated it by teaming with me so I can continue what I was doing, so it is what it is, but if there's a way to force me into PvP, it would be nice to know BEFORE it happens.
---
since it is early days the wiki isnt even fleshed out yet most of the FO4 stuff in 76 is out of date like weapon damages and such
---
Thanks guys.Done üëå
---
Thanks! that was it, needed to pay more attention :)
---
probably not yet in the game or not activated, like the "stimpak diffusor" for the medic tadpole challenge
---
Oh you're confident about licencing in a field you've never worked in before before? Tell me more.
---
What if most of my camp is on the ground and it's just a 1x4 area that I needed for Gens, turrets, and symmetry?
---
Small one worked for me, i had to be have hight ground tho
---
That's definitely the correct spot I used it last night. Did you try server hopping?
---
No idea if this is good or not but I got every mutation serum for 300c each. Also all Marine plans for 200 each.
---
The crossbow or the plans are in middle mtn cabins?
---
Well that's 1000/150 so only on ~two days you can't sell full amount, if you really manage to have that much. 
---
But it's good to know, so you can recycle heavier 1-2 stars first.
---
I had a couple hundred from being able to make so many with Chemist and Super Duper. Weight is a factor. Even with a mule. Plus I run Healing Factir
---
Over 100k made on day 1. I'm basically out of mules to store caps on. And still hundreds of things to sell. 
---
I had to stop farming to mule caps 4 times.
---
I get a % hit chance as ranged, but miss really badly on a bloatfly....
---
My camp is in the style of a large barn/garage, and the machines are right in the middle.
---
This is why those locations need foundation fortresses, +two missile turrets and two heavy laser turrets! That way visitors get free meat too!
---
Cash registers are almost always level 0 locks. Also suit cases tent to be level 0 or sometimes 1
---
Liberty Alpha
---
I‚Äôm pc :/
---
Hi There! That is incorrect- a Belay device is absolutely attached to the climber - it's so that the climber can manage their own descent pace and an additional safety measure is that they are also on a separate safety system managed by a teammate who also has them "on belay".
---
I have High Angle Rescue and Rope Rescue certification through the Fire Department - so my experience and tools may differ from Mountain Climbing. :)
---
No one is buying .38 ammo. I don't care if it's 1cap per 10,000. No one is buying .38 ammo. Drop that shit.
---
I'm currently at work, can someone tell me what the challenge and reward is?
---
Will you be on in about 30 minutes?
---
To be fair almost all raiders were just dicks ramped up to eleven.
---
Most of the raiders in 76 we just rich people who wanted to take other people‚Äôs stuff to live and before someone could take their stuff.
---
You also have daily limit per character, of 150.
---
Game is amazing except camps are super laggy all of a sudden.
---
Wanna be my friend later and let me revive you?
---
I'm not implying they're tricks, I'm just saying they could be worded better considering you don't find the information in-game.
---
As far as the 4/5 thing, I feel that's more of an error with the game rather than some trick question. Like I said, I had to retake it a couple times to find that question and copy it here, and it told me that I was getting one wrong each time when I definitely had them all right.
---
Still just add me and I‚Äôll be on occasionally
---
Only crossbow.
---
Plan is at pineer camps shooting range. Or whitespring vendors.
---
I'd buy bobble heads for 60-80 caps, not the 200 some players seem to think they need.
---
Bethesda may as well get rid of all legend Aries at this rate
---
Damn, srry man. I usually get at least one outa there.
---
to sell more than 30 things.
---
looks like the latest update has rectified this now :)
---
You have it on PC! That‚Äôs awesome, same name?
---
Agreed. I think the problem people are having is they want the backpack, so they want to rush through everything instead of enjoy it perhaps?
---
Yep
---
Imagine all the griefing for fall damage without PA... Bored people will put it hanging over a cliff, wait till someone spawns in and remove the floor. The other person dies, pick their bag up, wait for another...
---
Be ready to mule fast. I made over 100k today and had to desperately stop 4 times in my day to mule caps. Now I'm out of space for caps.
---
I leave my water and extractors open, it'll fill up again by the time I come home! All locking them will do is give a chance for PvP to trigger and them to attack my home!
---
Just logged back on and tried hopping a couple times, no luck.
---
Oh, I didn't know it did that. That explains why I saw so many at some people's camps.
---
I hate seeing floating camps, they're so ugly and low effort
---
Protect and serve!
---
PROTECT AND SERVE!
---
You fucking legend :D
---
They basically are. They are nerfing them to the point that they provide no benefit and releasing new weapons with no legendary versions.
---
I‚Äôll add you when I get home
---
No problems, technically because it's just a remodeling its not all that exciting to some. But to others, it looks awesome.
---
Yup, you can build 4 total for 120 lines worth of goods to sell.
---
Wild crops are instance per player, domesticated crops only one person at a time can take!
---
Ok great!
---
Darn that will effect my Berserker build D:
---
They may as well get rid of all legendaries at this point
---
I should get my badge for helpfulness.  üòÇ You're welcome!  Took me a moment too, I was up late doing the quest
---
Obviously it‚Äôs more complex then what your pea brain can handle. Shoot them in the head it‚Äôs that simple
---
Does having multiple vendors increase the amount of items you can sell? I‚Äôm limited to 30, if I had 2 vendors, would I have 60 items etc?
---
There's plenty of content. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not there. Most of the shifts are bigger than all of Anthem, and almost every zone has more to see and discover than all of division. Just because you want to play it like an mmo rather than an exploration based Bethesda game doesn't invalidate it. 
---
But that debate is also missing my main point which was: Acting like a twat will just get you ignored by both the community and the development team. Good riddance to those who spent their time Trolling.
---
[Hurry up and buy!](https://i.imgur.com/mrDyKTI.png)
---
It seems to let you sometimes and then other times not.
---
I‚Äôve been spawning in locked  camps or in foundations. It‚Äôs been exciting
---
Sorry man just found one!
---
I was only using .38 as an example and I know plenty of people who use .38 besides I'm in the forest and from mine and my friemds experince the main guns in that area for low levels are pipe pistols so why not help them out
---
We can go to 200% on our own or go to 150% with a repair kit. Unless the repair kit gives a damage bonus I don't see how they are pay to win.
---
Still happening.
---
Imagine the horror of having to interact with other people... IN AN ONLINE GAME!/s
---
Ha I thought you were taking the p*ss, I tried it and... HEY PRESTO! You my good man, are a genius! Thanks!
---
Damn ....are you on PC? I'm on PS4 I know if you run mods you may have to change some files or something sorry wish I could be more helpful.
---
Fall damage, and breathing underwater peices. Because they won't get nerfed.
---
its still boring and not fun to me like the other games. i may of liked qol stuff if done before launch but even then i never felt like exploring was rewarding. its not interesting even though it could be . im not a hater i out 100 plus hours in and thought what is the point.
---
1. Build a turret, trap or defensive structure in a workshop or camp. 2. Claim any workshop. 3. Kill a human-like creature (scorched for example) the reward is a 3 star Gatling with +50 damage resistance while aiming, +10% damage while aiming and reduce targets damage output by 20% for 3s. Probably the least time consuming challenge like this so far, which is probably why the weapons is meh. It‚Äôs called the Resolute Veteran.
---
RNG doesn‚Äôt help either, my buddy was looking for T60 emergency protocols, couldn‚Äôt find them after weeks, bought them for a few K in caps, the next day I found two of them in modification form while roaming wit him, he was irritated. Lmao.
---
Yep, PC. No worries! Hopefully I'll hear something back from the Bethesda support request.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if they had a proper text chat! I can't use voice chat 90% of the time due to anxiety but text chat is usually fine for me. I can't do challenges that require other people or the quest for the backpack that I was so looking forward to because I don't have friends or the desire to socialize with random people. 
---
As soon as I got to that part of the quest I just closed the ap and went back to ESO where I can actually interact with people via text chat and play the game normally.
---
Doesn't always work, unfortunately.
---
I noticed very shortly after getting on yesterday, I'm wondering if it was intended or a bug. I checked all of my power armors . They had all been repaired to max with fix it good . They all now have only basic defense. No more bonus. My melee weapons appear to have no more extra damage either. I wonder if they were ever supposed to actually do that. Are they now fixed? Was it a bug all along. Just curious, it's not a big deal. I can see where melee players could be upset. But they still strong as hell.
---
Weird that neither it or the poster was in thr featured list
---
When that happened to me the owner was away on business, so I had to fast travel out.
---
It's bugged right now it is supposed to be in survival bit for not it is allowing it to be completed on adventure.
---
I mean, the reward is good if you're using a heavy guns build and don't have any good legendaries so far.
---
Hmm ill have to cgeck it out, havent played 76 in a bit
---
Don't stop with the fertilizer ,  throw in a roll of toilet paper and a plunger.
---
After yesterday I have like 200 lol
---
That‚Äôs not raider style, that‚Äôs griefing, taking unintended mechanics of the game and using it like that.
---
I don't overly care what sort of mental gymnastics people want to use to try and make themselves out to be "normal". I mean, there isn't even anything wrong with being a dick, but to try and pretend that you AREN'T a dick because "I'm just roleplaying hur dur" is pathetic to say the least.
---
That was way too cool to be intentional. It was a bug and it's been fixed.
---
What does this have to do with repair kits? They don't give a damage bonus either.
---
Flair checks out
---
ya, I had a few poles for some overhanging spots around my camp but took 1/2 of them down because I needed camp space.
---
Really wish we could get another CAMP budget as they keep giving more camp items to use.
---
Yeah I have to agree with that at least for the people that are on reddit. I mean people and really the majority of fallout players are not on reddit  Hence why everyone is finding TSE weapons and bloody explosive weapon in player vending machines because not everyone is on Reddit.  For us that are on Reddit, we know that if we get a really good drop most likely we're going to sell it on read it from more caps.  
---
That being said, people are not going to get 25000 caps for weapons anymore because I think people will take chances finding it in a player vending machine for a tenth of the price.
---
Awesome!
---
Trolls gonna troll
---
I love it
---
The Band of Brothers
---
Awesome work on this. I use it all the time.
---
I removed them due to the fact the bottoms keep getting trashed, looks off with half floating poles!
---
I KNEW IT LOOKED DIFFERENT!! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
The Encryptid event is about to get a lot more popular. Every time someone dies there will be a scrum of do-gooders trying to revive them
---
One thing FO76 does is to gently push you to work with other people, at least passively, and more actively when you're talking SBQ or a few other events.  If this were 4 player coop, I guarantee you I would never have seen, much less interacted with, another player.
---
That's a design decision, for better or worse.  Someone probably thought (and I can't say if they were right or wrong), that the game would do better going in this direction.  
---
Honestly, with as little as there is to the game, it would be a pretty lame single player, or even coop.  Whether they could have taken all the effort to port it to multiplayer and channeled that into a broader single player experience remains to be seen.
---
Personally, I think Softworks, or more probably ZeniMax, thought a low effort online port of Fallout 4 would be a quick and easy cash cow, and just directed that to be made.  They threw a few people at developing the net code to make that happen, but didn't allocate the resources to fully flesh out the story or quests (necessary for a good single player game).  Designing and doing all the coding for questlines and all that is a lot more labor intensive than people understand, so if they were short manpower in that area, you get...well, what we have.
---
Why handmades? Mine is barely pushing past 100 dmg and that's with all the rifleman perks. Now, I know bloodied ones deal more dmg but if they nerf handmades, I'll just use lead pipe then. It'll likely deal more dmg. I also don't PvP at all. Only PvE. Handmade nerf will render my only decent guns useless
---
This game has turned into a total loading screen simulator.  
---
End game is basically FT farming and server hopping player vending machines, traders and legendary sites.
---
Do you have mods on your game ?
---
Is this the only new content that your missing ?
---
I hope it'll be like this for the deathclaw gauntlet they promised!
---
Ants can carry 10-50 times their body weight.  100 times is the correct answer according to the test.
---
I believe it‚Äôs 75% chance per piece. So if you get hit, you might have 3 pieces proc and 2 pieces not.
---
if you want to inspect items, the owner must be nearby..
---
An "inspect" button for PA could be the answer here.
---
I think it‚Äôs just placing us in the dead center of their camp area, which may be a common place for vending machines to be placed?
---
How can we control where someone spawns?
---
Also when you walk to where it is do you collide with it ( maybe the sprite isn‚Äôt loading for some reason )
---
75% chance is still really good. Pretty sure cavaliers and assassins have gotten the same change. I'm sure low health builds will be next to be balanced (unyielding/bloodied).
---
Level 33 and I currently have 8 caps. Never had more than 400 yet
---
You playing the game for 8 hours a day, probably doing nothing except farm west Tek, doesn't mean other players are noobs.
---
Liberty Rhymes? Instead of spouting capitalist rhetoric, he raps it?
---
30 item stacks per machine.
---
4 machines = 120 item stacks.
---
The stacks are important as you can have multiple bulk items eg steel with 50+ which will only count as one stack
---
Yes. 30 items/stacks per vendor, and you can build up to 4 vendors in your camp.
---
It's same for fix it good, no more bonus defense.
---
Yes, same here. Maybe it's the dupers again? Found a way to crash a server and roll back stuff like way back?
---
I‚Äôm keeping my bobbles. Display cases make my heart happy.   Any one had luck on selling ammo? It‚Äôs tough pricing this stuff for sure!
---
You take no damage from explosive weapons if you have the perk card fire proof and the dense mod on your chest. Bloodied builds are super strong I agree, but now they aren‚Äôt as tanky. My advice is to use something with a good fire rate, as using a hunting rifle or black powder anything might proc serendipity and then you‚Äôre screwed.
---
I don‚Äôt see this in most other subreddits based around games that are live services.
---
And if you're unlucky he steps on you, kills you and drags your corpse for a bit as he walks.
---
Good to know. Thank you.
---
(X) doubt.
---
They could certainly manage to allow me to put more than ten posters if those weren't considered as full objects. You could tag almost infinitely in Counter Strike twenty years ago I doubt these servers are weaker.
---
If tehy were easy, they wouldn't be called "challenges"...
---
I love seeing changes, however small to the game. I can‚Äôt find them all by myself, so I appreciate your post!
---
How‚Äôd they cheat
---
so how DO you get one? lol
---
I was using the perk card management mod for a while, removed it about two weeks ago once my build solidified. I figured any issues there would be resolved by a fresh install. But that's a good thought!
---
No collision, tried that last night.
---
Travel agent perk card..30% travel cost reduction.. Auction house in Warcraft takes a cut.. No biggy. So easy to make caps in game these days
---
Having less than a 20% HP pool isnt balanced enough?
---
75% is better than 0% - so while it got adjusted, it's still high-end armor &amp; the most competitive. People act like the stats weren't changed for every player.
---
I'm a new player so I can't compare to the experience at launch, but I did read reviews and stuff and decided to wait.  I just picked it up last week and I'm having a blast.  I've only encountered one bug that made me have to quit the game.
---
I will say performance on the Xbox one X is not great though; I wish we had more graphical options so we can try to increase frame rate while decreasing other stuff like resolution, etc.  
---
Either way, the game is fun.  At this point I'm not missing the NPCs because I find I am enjoying exploration as-is.  I don't have many player interactions but those I do have are mostly positive.
---
For ammo, you have to sell the stuff people want. Try .45, 5.56, and shotgun shells. 1 cap each, maybe 2 for shells. 
---
Nobody is going to ever buy .38, 5mm, or .50
---
Maybe there could be a log on the terminal to check all player vending machines on map
---
Oh is it out of beta now? Maybe I'll give it another try.
---
Who is he? I think you may have the wrong post bud...
---
Cheats? On Xbox? What specific cheat?
---
Two shot explosive 90% reduced weight minigun for 310 caps. Prices are all over, but some people seem determined to clear out that stash box.
---
\&gt;  3 scrip sell price for most legendary items 
---
My observation was 3 scrip for 1\* armor...3, 5, and 9, IIRC.
---
Weapons were 5-40 scrip depending on \* level
---
and
---
Scrip was not affected by Hard Bargain.
---
I feel like this is going to end up being a item rewarded from doing the scout dailies. Like one of the badges says cook smores but issue is, I'm pretty sure they just got added with this update and are probably a reward from the dailies too.
---
Your comment literally made me LMAO. Thank you :D
---
We would get crashes and the occasional invisible group member, but reconnecting took so little time compared to something like GTA Online that it was never really a huge issue. It even keeps you in your group if you disconnect, how many games actually do that?
---
The level 50 scorched Wolf , however the Wolf would have random levels upon log in,, sometimes it was 10 sometimes it was 50.
---
now,go away,or i will taunt you a 2nd time
---
I get what you mean but I found myself server hopping way before true endgame &amp; I‚Äôll still find myself server hopping after I‚Äôve got all my god rolls on everything because I love to see these player bases &amp; check out their vending machine set ups even if I‚Äôm not buying anything :-) at least load times are severely reduced from before man.. I‚Äôd be loading for 5 min sometimes now it‚Äôs about a minute &amp; a half MAYBE 2 min. Never quite played a game like it though, can‚Äôt say I hate it though I get your point though
---
Do you know you messed up the buff from repairing weapons and armour to 200%?
---
This absolutely works too if anyone wonders if they have to be in your team for it to count. It's how I got revive an ally for the quest. There's little pools of water there too though no one went down in them so can't speak to it helping with the swimmer badge. Can't see why it wouldn't.
---
Yesterday i asked every guy who went to my shop to jump the cliff and kill himself.
---
When I FT to people‚Äôs camps I run or jump as soon as I start loading in. It‚Äôs kept me from falling or ending up stuck in foundations quite a few times. I‚Äôve had people fall off the cliff next to my house, so I moved my C.A.M.P. so that wouldn‚Äôt happen anymore, but one of my teammates got stuck in my foundation last night. But when I FT to my camp it always spawns me on a little hill overlooking my camp ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Congrats on making the game playable... *sigh*
---
Yup I never did it either &amp; last night I felt like a true idiot..
---
DEW IT!
---
Same. Its quite annoying
---
I can‚Äôt find the data mine, would you be able to link it please?
---
Add me. PSN fakenunchucks
---
Does getting paid at your job effect your willingness to show up everyday?
---
That‚Äôs some bullshit man, I don‚Äôt think the whole team should be flagged for PvP, just because my teammate wants to duke it out with someone doesn‚Äôt mean I want to
---
I don‚Äôt usually visit my camp and my water purifier only holds 2 so I don‚Äôt really care about players getting some water
---
May I ask about the term QOL? Can you provide examples from the update that represent better QOL?
---
Hey don't sweat it man, everyone's broke in college
---
I‚Äôve also got VIDEO PROOF so I mean if you really want to start an argument then I‚Äôll just post the video. It‚Äôs a bug.
---
fast travelling is a convenience, not a necessity. you pay for convenience.
---
Lol yeah I mean idk what system you‚Äôre on but on Xbox most people sell those things for 50 caps maybe 100 if it‚Äôs a guy who doesn‚Äôt quite understand the market. I bought 10 last night from a vending machine for 500
---
Already Opposum but can lend a hand , Gt KnowledgeHound
---
I knew this would be an issue. We've been asking for this for ages. What's the point in me being able to lock doors if when people fast travel to my base to see my wares they end up behind my locked doors? 
---
Besides often I end up in walls and user foundations when fast traveling to my camp, it is something Bethesda need to get sorted for us.
---
But it isnt challenging. Its simply annoying to people who dont have friends that play.
---
So there's a menu to choose the 3 world challenges? Where is it?
---
I built a dedicated wall for posters, since it seems like this is going to be the new way to launch quests.
---
You might want to look into your Fallout76Custom.ini in the Fallout 76 folder in your documents folder.
---
When you had a mod installed you had to edit it for the mod files to load and now need to edit it (with the code from Fallout76.inj in same folder) to load the update's new textures
---
Unfortunately, I have a feeling that also means it's gonna be more RNG. I was thinking/hoping the vendor would have an inventory we could see and decide whether or not to purchase something. Now I'm thinking it'll be spend X number of scrip for a random 3* roll.
---
Now this is a post that will generate action :)
---
Is it possible to give the other player the bucket list instead?
---
Witch hunt? You can‚Äôt cheat on console besides duping my dude
---
Because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want to be held responsible for what people say.
---
I have a question.... what do you mean? I‚Äôm quite confused but concerned all at the same time
---
Sentinel
---
Take a right at the fast travel point at the camp and go all the way to the last house. You‚Äôll see an archery range. Press the button on the speaker to begin the challenge. You need a crossbow.
---
200 was my first price, yeah.
---
I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs a bug. I submitted a ticket to Bethesda, and asked on their Twitter for clarification. Hopefully I get a reply soon with some answers.
---
At this point I‚Äôm exploring, earning caps, looking for plans and recipes, and or a new weapon to try out or dismantle for learning weapon plans. Things of the sort, it‚Äôs not always about the fighting for some of us
---
I've been buying the 4000 atom pack every month since launch, I never thought I would, as I played destiny for years and never spent a penny. However I enjoy this game so much more, and see it as money well spent for 80 hours of entertainment per month. 
---
I'm collecting the excavator armor skins and I hardly ever use power armor, however I do spend a lot on the camp cosmetics
---
the monthly cost for me is a night out down the pub for a few, however I get more hours of entertainment from this game each week for the same price, so I think it's worth it.
---
It is same for all challenges. Pres map - menu - challenges - world.
---
What do you mean?
---
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
---
Haha, shots fired.
---
You can build a frog jar at the chem bench under science projects, then find and catch a frog (some spawn at white springs pool), then im C.A.M.P. menu under floor decorations is the frog habitat.  Though challenge is currently bugged and doesn't register when you build it.
---
Yes!
---
You on pc?
---
I‚Äôve been trying to find the article I read with no luck so far. I was shocked and disappointed when I read it as I thought it was a pretty good game from the trial, but that article (along with feedback here) talking about all the issues and saying it was no longer being supported is what caused me to uninstall the game. If I find it, I‚Äôll surely post it here.
---
In the future I really hope we never see any exams again. I didn't enjoy when I had to do it to become a responder. I didn't enjoy it when I needed to do it to be a firebreather. Or to become part of the Brotherhood. Or the Enclave.. 
---
Just stop with this. Give us quests with locations to explore. When I get off work and crack a hard lemonade to play the new update I dont want to do this shit lol
---
You don't NEED to be able to one shot folks at medium range with an explosive shotgun. They aren't useless, they are now going to rely on actually hitting someone at close range with all of the pellets in the shells, which is the way shotguns are supposed to work. It was a balance change, and it seems like a good one thus far.
---
I‚Äôd like to see an appearance of a non-ghoulified Hancock (from Fallout 4) on Talk like a Pirate Day going around rappin ‚ÄúRhymin‚Äô and Stealin‚Äô‚Äù by the Beastie Boys.
---
The cap tax is the only thing saving me from hitting max caps.. people don‚Äôt sell enough good shit for me to buy I‚Äôm teetering on 24.5k lol
---
there are dead deathclaws around fissure site prime, as well as the unmarked one near the middle of cranberry bog. These pre-dead enemies don't work like normal not so dead enemies, they work like containers, which means if you look in their inventories but don't take anything out of them you can server hop to refresh their inventories until they drop what you need, if you do loot them they won't refresh for 20 hours.
---
Ok I think everyone should give this game a second chance and be open to seeing its improvements but everyone had a good reason to be upset with this game at launch.
---
I dunno, Mate. I refrain from fast travel besides my camp and Vault 76. Server hopping? Well, I guess how much you do depends on how desperately you need to have certain items.
---
They said the original fallouts were for PC but you can still download them if you have 76 on console
---
This would be a nice, ive been realising how under/over priced some items I‚Äôm vending are after visiting other players lol.
---
Yeah I was surprised how many people keep their water purifiers open. I keep mine open because I usually have so much water I don't know what to do with it but then I can also understand why people lock them. I heard you can actually Farm water and sell them to the vendors.
---
Someone always has to complain
---
Down to play with you later today !
---
I just wish it wouldn‚Äôt use my stash space, I have so many plans to sell
---
You are not required to do that stuff, its optional. You cant honestly believe, that every single thing caters to solo play in an online game. The majority of content is soloable, you can just suck it up this time. Dont act like some entitled old geezer
---
If I get a FT matt, i'm making a prison, trap people in a locked room. Make them break out, get that bounty moolah.
---
Unless they fast travel. But If I'm quick enough, bam, 20 caps.
---
The extra damage when repaired to 200 percent was a big to begin with
---
I have a seven story tree house....
---
Well he probably just didn't want it. Before I got my three star laser rifle I used to drop cells. I probably dropped four five six thousand all together. Now I heard it haha!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch_05_new_atomshop_datamine/
---
We had some guy leave shit on the bed and "waste oil" on the floor beside it
---
should be some hotdogs at camden - on the table, left side of the park.
---
What time is later? I‚Äôm interested but need to know what time.
---
Yes, BUT it still doesnt give a reliable spawn point. You can fix cliff spawns, but foundation spawns can still happen.
---
There isn't, that's why Sentinel/Cavalier was so popular. There isn't really another comparable 3rd perk. 
---
I already manage my weight, I don't need to carry more stuff. I have perk cards that can take care of sneaking, breathing underwater, and fall dmg. So every other 3rd perk is redundant.
---
Well everybody is doing it constantly. I know because everybody follows the same routes. That and we now see peoples bases popping in and out of the server every 5 minutes.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it but that‚Äôs such a gnarly way to play. Just walkin‚Äô around and getting drunk, passing out. Lol
---
Great work, thank you! Tesla rifle is still missing though.
---
I would.
---
If I'd have them.
---
Overall, I shit on camp beds if the camp front door is locked. If there's something like a panic room, that shalleth be'eth okay.
---
This weapons were not working correctly. When all explosive weapons were nerfed shotty just survived. U used IMBALANCED weapon, so now they took that from u. And u screaming? Have no idea how to play? Find another build and weapon Jesus. Or just put some corrections to urs.
---
haha. 
---
I locked 2 of my 3. You can help yourselves to the 3rd one for stopping by.
---
26.219 miles.
---
Your welcome.
---
People supposedly using them to glitch inside restricted areas.
---
I feel like theres another rank that'll be added to the game at some point. When you go to your camp and look for the scout flag banners, there's tadpole, opossum and squirrel. I don't think Squirrel is out, I could be wrong though but I didn't see a vending machine for squirrel related stuff.
---
Basically all camps are visible now because everyone has a vending machine. Except those sneaky camps, staying in the shadows with vendors.
---
Couldn't agree more. They've really added a lot to  the game, and so far the Scout quest is really cute and fun, too. Can't wait to earn my backpack!! I've really been enjoying player vending as well. I built a seedy hotel/dive bar on the main highway into Morgantown and I sell ammo, plans, meds, and low-level armor and weapons cheap for the lowbies on their way into town. It's everything I ever wanted FO76 to be.
---
Heheheheheh!
---
I like to have ammo, I like to mix up my gameplay.
---
I'll give this a try later today, thanks!
---
Yeah, I came here looking to find out what a stimpak diffuser is.
---
Also, where is the frog habitat located in my building menu?
---
I have an AAE handmade. Definitely don't one shot everything. Nearly all the time it takes me half a clip just to put down a high level ghoul. God forbid I go up against a scorchbeast or mirelurk queen. With those I just run away

Not saying you're wrong (because you aren't), but different items have different values to different people. That's going to be hard to go against. For example- 5mm ammo (while the cheapest ammo) may be more valuable to me than it is to you, because I covet it being a Gatling Gun primary user. To you it may be damn near worthless, and you'd give it away.  Really hard to set a value on something, unless it's a rare/limited item imo.
---
I just wish my cannibal perk would let me refill my fluids meter when I eat a body. Blood can be a valid source of fluids for my character
---
Huh, cool. Ok, I guess it's not stupid.
---
I doubt this was intended and more Bethesda's lack of foresight and ineptitude.
---
We need placeable spawn points.
---
I waited at the quest robot and jumped around until I got someone's attention. Threw a grenade at my feet and let them revive me. They then did the same for me. Thumbs up were exchanged and we went our separate ways.
---
Worked pretty nicely and didn't require too much social interaction so win win
---
Lol saaaaame. 
---
I was starting to think nobody wanted to go that far North, but once I realized and Powered it, I had a guy come and buy stuff.
---
Then he drank the punch and was forcefully evicted from the premises. Lol
---
I‚Äôm your dude, if I can revive you too. IGN. Shankwell
---
I sold a 3* Bloodied baseball bat for 350 caps. I think I might‚Äôve sold it for a little cheaper than it goes for. Nonetheless, I sell things for what I think they‚Äôre worth rather than what everyone else says they‚Äôre worth..... mostly bc I don‚Äôt know what other people say they‚Äôre worth
---
At this point I only use my plants for Nukashine, my purifiers are open to the public.
---
You weren't assuming a weight lifter ant?  Rookie mistake ;-)
---
Jesus I boy them off people for 100 a piece
---
Yeah wtf you‚Äôll be consistently one shot that isn‚Äôt balanced..? üòÇ sentinel &amp; cav didn‚Äôt depend on any health requirements it just allowed you to be near invincible in certain situations..
---
I guess I need to have others test mine. It's partially on a cliff but the VM/store is up top by the road and that is where I FT in but I am not sure if other players will have the same FT point as I do. I assumed so but perhaps not?
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
I keep all my doors open now so people don‚Äôt get stuck. I‚Äôd feel bad otherwise.
---
What system? I bought 10 out of a vending machine for 500 last night on Xbox lmao
---
You want to give away .38 ammo? Sure, you can find some rare cases where young inexperienced and undergeared players think they need .38 ammo. The ammo type is terrible, never a shortage anywhere for it unless the user is overlooking some key aspects of gameplay (for instance: why would anyone use a .38 weapon by choice, unless they are making a choice to handicap themselves).
---
A civil war radio would be nice. Put some yank music and some dixie music, use singers like Tennesee Ernie Ford's "Songs of the union army" album, etc. Make pricketts fort great again!
---
Totally.   I found a 308 explosive hunting rifle so now I'm hoarding that.  I used to hate that ammo
---
My 1500 pounds of muled legendaries are going to take a while to liquidate :(
---
Apparently the extra damage was a bug that‚Äôs been removed now :-/ best bug of the entire life cycle
---
How about you use that big brain of yours and find out 'how long is a marathon'. Then maybe you'd extrapolate that all marathons are the same length. These are questions for children lol.
---
The current budget is plenty. What are you building? A manor house?
---
I keep seeing Ansel at the entrance to Whitespring on the red gar you're facing as you teleport in.  It's not (nearly) every time, but often enough.  Might still take a bunch of reloads, but that one is 0 effort.
---
I‚Äôm assuming this is a joke because that would make no sense in the lore.
---
New sign: "Thanks for shopping - Welcome back!"
---
I've never tried this, maybe I don't have to keep spawning into the river
---
71 "sneak attacks"..."must've been the wind".... :D
---
Nothing wrong with that!
---
Where's the start point for the sunny top ski lanes athletics course?
---
Fact.  Players are very, very squishy in this game. You and everyone else is basically one shot with most weapons - explosive or not, regardless of armor. Even those with full assassins sentinel armor are 1 shot kills if you know what you‚Äôre doing.  Both pre and post patch.  
---
They can make the explosive legendary effect do 0 damage and you‚Äôll still get one shotted.  Since you use power armor I would suggest getting the stealth boy mod for your torso and always stay crouched to avoid being vats‚Äôd.  Unless your using excavator power armor. If that‚Äôs the case do not fight anyone, ever.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I wasn‚Äôt far in but I‚Äôm curious if you felt any benefit to starting fresh.  We‚Äôre things smoother? Quest flow, etc?   Just curious if the experience was largely the same or different in anyway.
---
It came back last patch. It wasn‚Äôt horribly common but it happened. I had a blood bug that was able to kill gulpers lol.
---
Told and see in streams, when doing the obstacle courses, wait till the quest tracker changes to the timer and not just go when the intercom says. 
---
You will know it‚Äôs working with a sound effect passing the flags.
---
Not if it's in another locked up area, or you can use the pin thingie.
---
Someone didn't lock their junk extractor and is selling bulked junk... Proof that socialist capitalism works?
---
Mine are always locked point blank lol. 
---
Always someone around with sticky fingers
---
I was going to post something similar.  With legendary weapons and armor those prices will always be a wide swing.
---
My thought was with the data miners. We need a "commodity " price list for the vendor bots. No hard bargain or charisma perks needed. Just the raw caps cost for aid, bulk junk, apparel &amp; the like. Once this spreadsheet is ready we can see a super stimpak selss for 45 caps ( or whatever it is) and decide how we should price.
---
I felt I had a good grasp but when it comes to pricing things like plans I have no idea what is fair, to much or I just screwed myself with a fire sale.
---
Many people will post here when they find the body and hold the sawn so people can join their games to finally get the quest. Just keep trying to watch and hopefully you will be able to get it.
---
Personally I never server hop. 
---
Play survival. The game is much more fun when you can‚Äôt fast travel. People do it for the quickness of it. But it‚Äôs not as fun and hurts the game in the long run
---
First, stop calling it death match mode.  It's Survival, which is for people seeking a greater challenge, which includes uncertainty in player interactions.
---
Second, you are right.  The top Killers was very useful to see where spawn campers were. Survival score is too ambiguous:  is this person a murderer or someone who's just managed to survive by doing quests for the last 3 hours?
---
I love Survival but Bethesda needs to make a choice on what the mode is supposed to be.  Is it supposed to be a more challenging mode with possibly dangerous player contact? (which according to the E3 presentation is what they originally wanted with slap damage.)  Or do they want death matches or Battle Royales?  Because Survival can't be both.
---
Sure join up
---
Weapon damage usually increases in relation to the level its repaired. My bloodied mr handy buzzblade dmg increases significantly when over-repaired.
---
I know that feeling. If I wasn‚Äôt online when my husband found him (we are fortunate to have 2 XBones) I‚Äôd still be looking for him!
---
Ours was on a car, in front of Whitespring. So - at least it‚Äôs a common visiting spot we know spawns? Good luck.
---
store caps? there's a limit to how many you can hold?
---
Haha, I just buy them, and resell them at my prices.
---
"I made a huge mistake."
---
I also wouldn't mind some different tracks for the instruments.
---
Excellent sleuthing, and good advice.
---
My problem is by build is very specific to the location it's in (inside a small river canyon), and it won't take kindly to being shoved around.  But I'm not planning on trying to corner the vendor market, so I'll just have to see how it goes.
---
Luckily, right now there isn't a danger of falling to your death, so it's just a convenience thing.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a constant for me. I was able to kill a lot of mobs last night including defending a workstation in the Mire from ants with my Tesla Rifle and then suddenly I couldn‚Äôt kill anymore. 
---
Hope this bug is tracked and fixed. I love the game and wish for the best in this.
---
I've played since hour 1 beta... Are there fall damage legendary effects?
---
I never lock my stuff so people who stumble upon it can have it as I rarely visit my camp.
---
I'm on PC; where do I join? :)
---
But in the same update they added player vending, they removed the punch bowl drink option...so he just fast traveled away of his own will.
---
You need Space Man skin for re-entry and Sherpa Lung to breath the thin air.
---
Yes, that question can be googled:   
---
[http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+long+is+a+marathon+in+miles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+long+is+a+marathon+in+miles)
---
I can confirm the numbers look good. I wasn‚Äôt playing long enough to test if it actually did correct damage in combat.
---
Found someone selling one star items for twenty to thirty caps.  No brainer right there.
---
I would say we do t have the same definition of challenge then bud... It's not that hard to find someone to play with...
---
Think of the plus side. You have 24 possibilities that you can fast travel to a closer location that you wanted to go to and could potentially cut running time down.
---
It's 20 hrs from the last time you bought or sold from them.
---
What system? I'll help you look man
---
If u have any idea how to do that ok
---
tommy_n1ghtmare
---
The updates on this patch were pretty good.  I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the explosive shotgun effects nerf, but felt better after they did a nerf to the ass/sent/cav armor as well.  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt notice a big difference with the shotty.
---
Well that's just stupid, armour needed the buff to keep up with PA and the weapons.....meh.
---
How about you mind your own business? How the fuck can you tell ME about MY camp budget. Fuck outta here.
---
I'll pm you the server. Welcome to the ex residents!
---
I revived my friend who i was in combat with using quack surgeon (alcohol can revive enemies btw) and it still counted towards the challenge, "ally" is a very loose term.
---
I think there are alot of people who have been sitting on gear like this who don't know the types of trades people would have offered.
---
This is freaking hilarious
---
Don't you judge my hobbies!
---
One is open, one is locked. I moved half my plants to right next to the Brightly Lit vendor, and the other half ‚Äúbehind‚Äù my house. No one touched the back ones.
---
Can't say, mine updated without a hitch.
---
"distance of a marathon" in Google comes up with the correct answer if you're part of the minority who don't actually know already
---
Thanks, added the Tesla Rifle.
---
You obviously need it more than I do enjoy
---
Don't forget to drop the 'you've been insulted' note.
---
 You know that lovely note the insult bot gives you.
---
Junkier would be fun but it wouldn‚Äôt fit the lore since it was built in Boston before the war. At least the Fallout 4 version.
---
Yeah, they wanted those 4 screws for 3 caps each, you can't have it all.
---
For real hahahaha
---
Thanks for the help, but really this is also ridiculous, I don't have time to just log on when someone else finds it. Again... I have a real life.
---
oh god xD
---
Throw your trash explody shotguns my way, please.
---
Like I said .38 was just an example as it was the first to come to mind and it would be helpful to sell to newer players as that's what usually used at beginner levels and you tend to go through alot of  it just replace .38 with another ammo type and ut the argument for bulkable ammo still stands
---
With u in 10 üëç eating
---
I agree but I can‚Äôt stand top deathmatch mode or that fact that characters aren‚Äôt locked to survival mode so I don‚Äôt really bother with it
---
Its pretty easy. Take off your armor let a weak goul attack you ankle deep in water. Revive
---
For sure the Anti-Material Rifle. But PROPERLY done, not like the Creation Club version.
---
Or one of the many fun Energy Weapons from New Vegas. Like the Holorifle or Sonic Emitter.
---
Or I guess just any weapon from New Vegas. It had a great collection of fun sttuff.
---
As far as I can tell, there is now only one way in and out of the Morgantown Airport. It's now on the side that has the monorail station.
---
Battle rifle ie m1 grand from fnv
---
Ps4
---
Just out of curiosity's sake i checked the scrip price on the Last Action Hero legendary 50mg from the weekly challenges and it was 40 scrip- that may be the max for a good 3 star? Be interesting to see how the values are computed.
---
Im also curious, never hesrd of them
---
Another reason for it to becoming even more of a losing screen simulator
---
I noticed the same thing last night.  My damage was all over the place.  I'd one shot a glowing lvl 40 mole miner and the next one would be at half HP or less.  I have adrenaline so my damage should have gone up but instead it wasn't reflecting that.
---
A server has a max of 24 people. More people playing could make login slower but what are they doing that extra people slow down other instances?
---
The 1911 .45 pistols from new vegas
---
No? My friend in my camp drank the mountain honey right before so the Nukashine would be up next.
---
And I drank champagne from one players bowl earlier in the night. P.s. lead champagne bad if you like to skywalk.
---
Science!
---
Now, don‚Äôt understand me wrong but the praise shouldn‚Äôt go to ‚ÄúBethesda‚Äù, it should go to ‚ÄúBethesda‚Äù as in the developers, Bethesda the company isn‚Äôt doing this game any good. The devs are putting their everything into it, and I wholly appreciate it, they are doing amazing work. 
---
But when ‚ÄúBethesda the company‚Äù gets involved is when we get things like repair packs which, whatever your opinion of them, is something that could be seen as going against their promise of no pay to win. I don‚Äôt mind the repair packs, never used one and never will. But it has sparked a lot of controversy and other shit. 
---
The devs are putting their heart in to try and please the fans and look at what they want both on the forums and here on reddit. The devs were not responsible for the canvas bags or nuka-rum whatever it‚Äôs name was, Bethesda the company was.
---
But that‚Äôs my thought on the matter at least ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
This
---
I too leave when I get to a base that is floating.
---
 I don't get how anybody can build one of those bases and feel like they did a good job.  Ugly as sin.
---
Ah,a man of culture I see
---
And what's the deal with airline food?
---
But it's not hard. It's just tedious.
---
Ok thanks. So I haven't played since last week...follow up question...does it take caps to fast travel to camps with vendors?
---
The holorifle is interesting. I agree with your opinion, Fnv was one of the best when it came down to the design of armaments.
---
Literally take all my shit. I absolutely look at my crops junk extractor and purifier as a marketing bonus for anyone that comes and potentially buys my shit. I literally hide the vending machines in such a way in my camp that in order to even get to them, they gotta walk through all of my lootable/regenerating crops/water/junk. 
---
If I can continuously count on people to look at my spot as a hub to buy my loot that I have on sale, them imma have returning customers all the time. Just my two cents. The crops water and junk literally respawn in 30-45 mins
---
You can still drink from the punch bowl, but you can't refill it. So once it's out, that's that.
---
Yeah, a few of the armors and outfits need a once-over.  If you aren't wearing underarmor, your body clips through the sides of the Trapper chest, for example.  The Vintage Football Outfit is kind of a mess as it protrudes through every piece of armor I've tried.
---
They seem aware of these things (they fixed the linen coat, for example), but it would be nice if they were a bit more proactive, especially with DLC outfits.
---
Similar. I‚Äôve killed two SBQ‚Äôs got T-51 Jetpack plane first time, T-45 on the second.
---
I'm not on at the moment (and won't be for a while lol) but my love for Darren Criss tells me to add you. Expect a request later in the afternoon or night!
---
That sounds like I did yesterday. No one had anything good to sell except that one dude who I bought 21 Disease Cures from.
---
Other than that, I walked away with about 250 of other people's Purified Water. Good day!
---
Cool.  Add me.  utchia23.  When I get on later I'll server hop.  What times do you play?
---
Was this on XB1 near top of the world?
---
Y‚Äôall running the Gunsmith perk? Take it off and bash stuff.
---
The 1911 is a pinnacle for modern handguns. That gun helped win wars!
---
And if i could get the lincoln repeater i would be set
---
Someone mentioned that S'mores recipe is rewarded from the new event at camp Adams. I am not online to confirm this, but I doubt that they will lie for that.
---
Most difficult gun to acquire. It was still a fun toy.
---
But having armor that let's me negate fall damage saves me 2 points on Goat Legs that I can put into increasing damage output or improving damage resistance.
---
I don't want to spend points on Aqua boy/girl if I can spend those on a rank of Fireproof or Cola Nut. So those effects are useful.
---
Also in the vault-tec uni frat house, in living room corner
---
Friend and I took off pacifist, took turns smacking each other with it. Smack 5-10 times repair, repeat.  Done in 5 mins.
---
Just play the game, the quest is not going away and you'll eventually come across them
---
I think it's actually 20 hours from the first transaction when they have full caps.
---
Caps are already too easy to get.
---
It is the Save Everything mod that is causing it, and it is a known issue. Update your .ini file and remove the SaveEverything.ba2 from the mods list until it is fixed.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148?tab=posts
---
What bug was that? I‚Äôve fitted and crafted the HUD to different suits without issue (Not X-01, which until this patched couldn‚Äôt be crafted at all)
---
I haven't started the new quest, but this is quite annoying to here.
---
I had to let a trespassing area completely open so the people don't get stuck there, which broke the immersion of my build shop/inn completely.
---
Eh armor isn‚Äôt meant to keep up with PA but I hate PA so I know how it feels running around without it (super squishy boy)
---
Probably something along the lines of 'the vendor is a list, the actual item is tied to the person'.  Makes it so that you can use stashes wherever you are, instead of just at your camp.
---
There's detailed and somewhat complex coding reasons why this would be, but it's pure speculation without seeing the code.  I suspect that it is partially because items don't have a unique identifier when created, so you can't just look up an item based on that (which could cause other issues if it were in place, but would solve other issues as well).
---
Yup, ported from fo4
---
I‚Äôve found camp and stash limits have been the biggest issue, Bethesda keeps giving us tonnes of cool new stuff and I‚Äôve nowhere left to put anything lol.
---
They‚Äôre useless in PvE too lmao we feel your pain
---
it is not
---
Small generator works, as for every photo challenge, the name must be written in the top right corner
---
It is the Save Everything mod that is causing it, and it is a known issue. Update your .ini file and remove the SaveEverything.ba2 from the mods list until the mod is fixed.
---
If you don't think you have any mods then look for a Fallout76Custom.ini file in your My Documents\My Games\Fallout76 folder. If that file exists, delete or rename it.
---
As funny as this may sound, I've been designing every camp to fit a shop/vending machine in it since they announced that eventually it would b4 added so it didn't hit me that hard. My camp still feels boring to me though due to lack of decorations...I should get on that
---
I think it‚Äôs a good balance, tedious enough that not *everyone* will have a backpack, but not so difficult/time consuming that only no-lifers get it.
---
Conan Exiles
---
No not always. It‚Äôs seemingly random whether or not it works.
---
play a lot. i have so much gear to sell its not funny.
---
I got the S‚Äômores recipe. I can confirm the Campfire Tales event is how you get it.
---
I seriously don‚Äôt understand this shit.
---
I have never owned one piece of sentinels or asassins items period that were worth a damn and I have dropped fools left and right with a regular non legendary shotgun blast to the face (while they were in PA and I am just in regular armor)
---
YEs PVP needs to be balanced but where the hell are you all finding these insane next level god tier griefers that are haunting your dreams? I literally play survival mode almost exclusively now and I never ever get in these situations !
---
I'm insecure as shit about my camp now after seeing some people's stuff. Jesus are you people interior decorators?
---
Yeah it use to be my second choice in game beside my 50... know I'll go back to by 50 cal all time it's not worth 15 shots to kill a scorch leader damage is 220 wow... might as well use the crossbow it does the same damage to enemies as shot gun... shame
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal. The resources grow back and replenishes. I thought most of the people here were into sharing stuff anyway?
---
I lose 1-2 corpses a month, and every time it can be attributed to me not paying close attention or using explosives to launch the loot off the map.
---
I've missed 0 impostor sheepsquatches, thanks to the wondrous labeling camera. Was it buggy? Yup. Did they fix it? Yup.
---
If slinging poo at a developer is your knee-jerk reaction instead of examining your own behavior. . .
---
Last night, I got a deep pocketed marine plan from the random "Can you help me" mr handy.
---
Repaired him...think it cost me 2 steel, 1 copper, and 1 circuit.
---
Got the plan as the reward.
---
Haha yeah I wasn‚Äôt at the time. I gave the game a break got back on and passed first try. I legit spent about 45 minutes in that terminal though , it got pretty frustrating.
---
7 Days To Die if you don't mind ps2 graphics and horrible game performance
---
Server hop the font entrance to Whitespring.  One shows up on the car right in front of you, draped across the hood.
---
ARK: Survival Evolved
---
If i remember it right, after fast travel turn around and run up to hill thru yellow flags.
---
Junkjet is an interesting choice, firing Mr. Fuzzys' and all the teddy bears at other people would be epic.
---
It is a little rough building to a pre-established limit, then trying to add more.  I'm grateful that my camp was all set up before they did their budget re-do, so it gave me plenty more space for future expansions.  I've now added about 50 percent more to my building, and still have about 25 percent left in my budget.  Granted I haven't started decorating yet, so I'm sure I'll get boned.
---
Don‚Äôt think so. I haven‚Äôt seen any posts &amp; I haven‚Äôt personally seen or gotten one.
---
I feel your pain on the acid I farm Yao Guai at the Mountainside Bed and Breakfast about 20 minutes of farming I get over a 100 acid but it goes fast. ( I hope to farm even faster now that I have a instigating power fist that does 712 normal damage I can 1 shot level 76 glowing Yao Guai)
---
Just curious. What in the heck do you buy with those Atom's?
---
 Besides a couple of camp objects I haven't found anything worth buying on there.
---
 I still have a few thousand Atom's just sitting there collecting proverbial dust.
---
Thanks again! Also Gamma gun has two mods which change its damage - deep dish (rad damage) and signal splitter (adds energy damage).
---
yes, he came back for me too, last night I couldn't use my explosives ( cal.50, gatling gun, combat-shotgun), but I noticed that I could do damage with non-explosive (bloodied tesla) or melee weapons.
---
I don't have them. I haven't found the Insult-Bot at all for about 130 levels.
---
The Wet Bandit?
---
This happened quite some time ago, you must have been away for a while.
---
I found the cabin with the outhouses and the swimsuits.. but I can't enter the cabin? can't find any "molo" or speaker box?
---
I fully agree. Bulk ammo feels like a when not if.
---
It is fantastic they are working on it.  It needs a lot of fixing before hitting steam (because I would argue that its going to get a massive surge of buyers if its mostly fixed to where we are all accustomed to/with Bethesda game releases lol).
---
I still hope for private self hosting servers before I buy it. I am patient.
---
Maby gram has the plans?
---
I have played the game, I'm lvl 95, I've got this quest and the new one to do.... So great advice!
---
It should be in your floor decorations. But first you have to catch a frog and build a frog jar, which the jar can be built in the chem bench under "science project" tab. You dont need a jar to catch one but you need it to craft the habitat
---
There's been crossbows since day 1. 
---
No longbows though, but I think that would be a bad ass addition.
---
Add me, the tag is EmaSlayer. BTW it would help if you can let me revive you
---
I built a little chill area for my vending station but you don‚Äôt have to re-build your entire base! I‚Äôve literally seen people put their vending machines outside their houses by the freaking generators.. not something I‚Äôd do but to each is their own
---
Just for the record, you can use this to your advantage - there's a spawn point near enough to my CAMP to aggro any Scorched or Super Mutants with ranged attacks, so I stuck a blackberry bush there to draw their fire away from my steel extractor and artillery. Works a treat.
---
Tell me about it. I don‚Äôt like playing on teams or with other people much. Mostly because I hate talking on the mic lol but I just like to do missions and wander around. 
---
I wish they made things that require group play as part of its own badge. Or even throw them in a few different ones, I‚Äôll pick the ones that are purely solo play.
---
Lucky you! I must be an a****** because it seems like he follows me around.
---
 He even showed up at the fasnacht parade twice for me.
---
Miss me with that gay shit
---
Depending on what level you're at, it may be hard to believe, but if you play the game enough, you'll reach a point where you have more points than you know what to do with, and then you'll probably value having Goat Legs and Aqua Boy/Girl as perk cards, and not having to drag around a 3 pound piece of armor just for that purpose.
---
Ouuu this looks like fun! Thanks!
---
This. 20 hour from the first item sold
---
But you can lock your water machines I believe?
---
Yes, because every person who plays this game is a squeaky voiced tween.
---
I'm quite annoyed I have to redesign my garage. I loved how my base was set up and how it looked. Tried to at least add on to what existed already but I didn't have the space to do it
---
So now I have destroy my garage with all my benches in it and redesign it as a store/garage hybrid.
---
This much creativity? Have you ever played minecraft
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs screaming, it just seems like they were nerfed a bit too far. Guess everyone needs to be a bloodied build to actually do damage or they ‚ÄúhAvE nO IdEa hOw tO pLaY‚Äù.
---
Awesome I'll send an invite, I've got about 2-3 hours free this morning. Im only available randomly, because life.
---
Hmm
---
Which is cool as all hell
---
&gt;I love Survival but Bethesda needs to make a choice on what the mode is supposed to be.
---
That's what they're doing - trying different things that look good on paper, but may not work out well in practice. (that's also why they're calling it a beta).
---
Once they figure out what the best way to do it is, they'll likely start doing seasons or some other recorded contest over time.  I've seen mention of some sort of system like that.
---
REEEEE
---
I mean, that is ramp for boats . Wooden thingy. And gray box on stick in middle
---
If you take the Mutefruit, corn and Tatos you can be a Sticky Bandit.
---
Well, the next level after Tadpole has a badge that requires you to ‚Äúbecome a conduit‚Äù in the Encryptid event SIXTY TIMES. So hopefully when more people reach that level there will be more opportunities.
---
weird they have a daily limit of 150, but a max limit of 1000. Seems like they would have chosen something divisible by 150.
---
Nope lol
---
Lots of cars at the whitesprings.
---
Just keep going out and buying stupid shit
---
Yeah, but hopefully this post grows and jumpstarts the conversation.
---
don't forget about the non-existant "stimpack diffusor" for the medical challenge
---
Google is your friend.
---
Also if you have a camera, the animal challenges should be easy.
---
yeah, the caps cap only serves to stop people from trading more, counterproductive af
---
Except that what you put in it counts towards your CAMP build budget. :(
---
Same I am selling my legendary around 3K max
---
Like my assassin 1* Tesla is 777 :D
---
I know it's bad but I'd happily take 10% more crashes for 25% more budget
---
Think of it like a mutation
---
Yeah that fucking sucks
---
Bloodied Tesla would work for you but my normal one didn‚Äôt at one point? Odd. Hope the devs can track this one down. Have been much of constants to it, besides melee doesn‚Äôt seem to have the issue.
---
Or, you can just not swim underwater or fall off of cliffs, and spend those point in dmg perks anyway.
---
I have a lot of love for the rcw. I'm sure it doesn't work Lorewise but dang is it a cool looking gun.
---
This ends up a pretty notable, indirect nerf to Bloodied because it does introduce a fair bit of chance into the equation (much as Serendipity does).  Plus, you can't over-repair weapons or armor now to deal more damage / provide more protection.
---
But I finally have a use for all my .38 ammo
---
I downloaded Honest Hearts just to play around with the 45. Pistols. Was well worth it there was so much to that DLC. The submachine gun though, having a tommy gun in the strip was great.
---
It's right in front of the main entrance.
---
Well send me an invite.  I have a daughter so I understand.  We'll get it.
---
This.
---
we have floating camps because the buidling system is EFFED UP. You just can't build the way you want to so you have to have floating effing camps. Give us the ability to lay floors down on the ground and we'd be getting somewhere. This absolutely has to have a foundation thing is stupid
---
There's enough of them for me not to get a mic.
---
 It's not just their voice I don't want to hear it's anybody's voice. I don't want to hear any voices on my video games, completely immersion breaking for me.
---
 The developers should have known not everybody uses a mic. There is no way to communicate with anybody without one.  Very poor development decisions.
---
Wendigo Cave usually has a few.
---
I quite like the new PA skins
---
I play with guys who have banned accounts. They made a new one.
---
I guess I'll continue to store my decon shower then :(
---
Last night 2 player vendor camps spawned me into the structure of the building - had to port out. I'm sure they would rather have me buying their stuff. Yes, Bethesda needs to fix this and/or give us the spawn mats back.
---
I do that on plans besides for like Ultracite mod plans
---
Am I crazy? It still looks the same.... the Trading post, the crashed bird, the rooms....
---
Press f to pay respects.
---
maybe Atomshop too again like with all the "skins" for various items
---
I mean, you can shove the camp like, outside the fence too.
---
thank you for finally put something in the game, that should have been since the beginning?
---
If you go the institute route in FO4, you get Shawn as a member in your camp. If you do his little side missions like finding him junk. He will eventually give you a laser rifle called ‚Äúwazer wifle‚Äù Ever since I had that gun I couldn‚Äôt find myself to delete it. So I‚Äôd love to have the back just for nostalgic reasons. Or just let us rename our guns
---
I'm pretty sure what you put in it only counts for your stash, and not budget
---
Could you give me some numbers? Does Deep Dish affect ballistic damage?
---
I saw someone selling a pie for 9999K but was totally a joke, all his other items were super awesome deals.  All ammo was 1cap a piece, bobble heads and mags were 25-50 caps and rarer plans were 250 caps
---
Happened to me once. Just kept jumping and then got out of the floor.
---
I'm a simple dweller.
---
Floating Camp - no trade.
---
You should get all stuff for free just for having to look at it.
---
But a text chat doesn't break the immersion?
---
Buy a mic, use it until you can complete the quest, then move on.
---
It's on a public forum, if you want things to be your own business perhaps don't post it on a public forum?
---
Also, no need to be triggered.
---
Ay, Papi!
---
I need 10 minutes to check. Will post here soon.
---
I'm grateful for the addition of player vending, but damn if I didn't spend hundreds of caps traveling around last night doing nothing but looking for deals on different servers. 
---
One of the guys in our party asked "so...are we gonna kill anything or what?" I think he was getting tired of it as well.
---
I feel compelled to keep looking for deals, even though I pretty much have everything I think I need.
---
I had to severely downsize my camp to make vending machines work.  The items for sale add to the budget which is completely ridiculous.
---
No because I can imagine their voices in my head.
---
I don't want to see this big burly guy in a huge power armor suit talk like a four-year-old boy.
---
Requiring another player to get a backpack is kind of a spit in the face for the whole "you can play it solo" thing. I play with my wife 100% of the time I'm playing anyway, so that part is easy, but still.
---
I‚Äôve found them since this post but thank you!
---
Yea anyone who uses shotties are mad cus it isn‚Äôt op. Getting the game to an equal standing is the cool and make more builds viable. I think it‚Äôs dog ish power armor is that good in PvP survival unless in a nuke zone. But I‚Äôm sure they will balance it. There shouldn‚Äôt be OP guns or armor just different flavors with their own pro and cons.
---
I didn‚Äôt post it. As you say whoooooooosh
---
Thanks, sent from- Williamsthc
---
You are a bold one
---
What's better than a laser tommy gun? Nothing.
---
Well, I mean probably something.
---
So with a full set you should avoid non-vats//non-staggered hits about ~95%of the time?
---
I've done various rebuilds of mine from day one, usually when I'm bored and waiting to get the gumption up to go grind some more. For the vending, I was a little worried when I saw how big the machine was. I ended up just placing it on some rock, near enough to my generator to provide power. I'm having so much trouble with build budget that a new redesign is probably in the future, but I love how my C.A.M.P is right now.
---
I have a couple of people that I team up with that don‚Äôt use a mic. While in our party they use the chat there so we can all see it and reply through our mics. We don‚Äôt mind it at all. And I don‚Äôt mind teaming up with people that want to do their own thing. Being on a team brings better XP for both...and we don‚Äôt have to talk.  My GT is the same as my name on here. I‚Äôd be happy to do the quest with you...and die for you üòÅ  Just add me...during the week I don‚Äôt get on until 8-8:30 EST, but I‚Äôm glued to my Xbox on the weekends.
---
What does mean nerfed too far
---
It was nerfed the same amount as other weapons 
---
Wtf
---
If it's a fully open camp, no doors or anything, you're okay.
---
If it's a big camp that's fancy as fuck, the front door is locked, I let myself in.
---
The Bedshitter continues the bedshitting spree!
---
I'll do, adding you now
---
I have a camp with a nice pier over the eastern river, I wish I could put those columns in the water!
---
Some dude asked me to join my team, so he could kill me, to revive me. I agreed, and then ‚Ä¢immediately‚Ä¢ upon getting down to my skivvies, I was attacked by a swarm of Liberators, and truly died. Dude revived me, and that was that. Weird.
---
Kenshi does, but it's not an FPS like Fallout is, it's an isometric RPG/RTS/City Sim instead.  You can't build buildings piece by piece like this either, but you can outfit the interiors however your heart desires.  It's not at all like Fallout, but if post apocalyptic, settlement building games are what you're after this is worth checking out.
---
Yeah, a list of vendor bot prices would be a good start, but I don't think people should feel bad about pricing low. I'm selling stuff I'm not using, so any caps is better than useless items sitting in my stash.
---
Anthem is soooo bad it makes fallout76 look good!
---
Thank you felloe vault dweller and praise Mothman!
---
Yeah, before last week  I played a couple of times just for the Fasnacht event and CAMP reforming, so not much trading going on. Still, it's great
---
All the 1\* armor I turned in was 3, and the highest I saw for armor was 9.
---
each 1\* weapon, regardless of type, was 5, I think the 2\*s were 15, and the 3\* executioners rolling pin, which I modded from wood to chefs - listed at 40.
---
Equip/unequip hard bargain3 made no difference in the amount of scrip offered.
---
So a 3\* rolling pin has the same scrip value as a 3\* mg.... 
---
Given all that....seems to indicate its fixed  quantity of script per star
---
I really enjoyed the launch for the most part. It wasn't perfect, but I played until I ran out of content. What would you say are the big changes?
---
Ok then tell me a useful weapon in pvp wich is not a handmade. Wait u don't even play pvp so u don't know anything about it... That seems to be the case to me at least
---
Dps? Likely a lot. 
---
Ability to turn you into astronaut gangster? None can do it better.
---
My CAMP doesn't look like crap.  It's technically floating, but I have a nice pathway up the stairs with railings so you don't fall.  Plus I have ledges for those with Marsupial to quickly jump up.  It's completely decked out with 2 master bedrooms, a shared master bath, workshop with all workbenches and a kitchen/living room area.  I have a bar at the bottom with my vending outside.   I got so tired of having to rebuild every time I move so a 1 foundation base is a LOT more flexible when moving and the view is great 4 stories up.  Now the 1 stair in the sky bases are crappy, I agree.  Mine at least looks like it doesn't defy gravity.
---
Is that the running one on top of the giant bridge? There is a timed checkpoint run.
---
Camp Venture.   Sunny Top Ski Lanes.   Eastern Side of Gorge Bridge over Flatwoods (NOT the pre-existing Ropes Course!)
---
The scrip value is fixed, it only cares about how many stars it has versus the actual legendary effects. A god roll 3* handmade is equal to a meme roll 3* rolling pin.
---
Armor: 1* -&gt; 3, 2* -&gt; 9, 3* -&gt; 24
---
Melee: 1* -&gt; 5, 2* -&gt; 15, 3* -&gt; 40
---
Ranged: 1* -&gt; 5, 2* -&gt; 15, 3* -&gt; 40
---
I already had a porch on my house, I just expanded it to hold vending machines.
---
Dang it, a little too slow. I need a partner for that as well.
---
As much as I hate it, you're right. And I'll admit I wouldn't be so keen to keep playing if I didn't have any reason to. Plus, if you could just nitpick the legendaries we'd all be little clones of one another running around.
---
Between work and kids I havnt got to play since the update I cant wait til little ones bed time tonight I feel an all nighter coming on üòÅ
---
Gotcha, thanks everyone!
---
&gt;Microtransactions
---
Microtransactions in AAA games is going to be the standard because it works out for them and Stupid people even defending them...
---
The red car to the right, right in front of the Fast Travel spawn....that's where I found mine, also where my buddy found his.
---
PC users can use pre-existing tools from Skyrim/Fallout3/4 to open the esm files and look at data.
---
You can rename your things.
---
You spent $20 for a patch that should have been made at day 1???? Smh
---
I think people just bit into the streamers' agressive complaining about stuff and everyone ran with it.
---
I had stability issues, dc'd a few times, but never enough to angry rant for 30 minutes on youtube.
---
All their games started as unstable and were eventually patched up.
---
But this pay to win repair kit has irked me a bit...
---
Hey me, howsit going?  I've just given up on finding it at this point, and I'm spending my time farming tatos in survival.
---
Are you close to a travel point location on the map?  I'm it easier to travel to named locations next to people's camps instead of directly to their camp.  Hopefully more folk start doing this.
---
this joke flew right over everyone's head.
---
Add me Psn roshamboN7rus
---
Ha yeah, the price of the weapon doesn't take into account the 20 camps I visited to find it. 
---
It was cool to see everyone's camps and how they have arranged and decorated things. After the novelty wears off, though, I'm sure people will only visit shops that are convenient or have a very tempting summary on the map.
---
It‚Äôs water... are you really that worried about a couple waters?
---
Except that I only have 1 vending machine built, only 20 of the 30 slots filled and when I tried to add 10 stimpacks I got the exceeding build budget error but I could add 4 of them. I then tried to add a 22 pound weapon and it wouldn't add but a 1 pound one would...
---
Let us send messages with it
---
medics explosive handmade 2k
---
Put some stuff in your vending machine.  Made 7k last night off plans and chems alone.
---
Is it a floating camp if I've put up supports in each corner?
---
Someone would REALLY have to hate my prices to waste a nuke on my C.A.M.P. it's nowhere near anything good to nuke.
---
Yeah when you rank up to possum the scout leaders say it will be awhile before you reach your next rank and there's no way you have enough challenges in possum to get the badges required for all the upgrades, for both the possum bag and extra carry weight mod that's 11 challenges out of 14 alone
---
Except its bugged to hell
---
What are you doing with all of your level ups if you aren't respecing / tweaking your build. Like, are you not gaining levels between these major updates? Are you just logging on and pining for a respec and logging off again?
---
Play the game, bank some level ups and change your build, man.
---
Cardboard Vault Boy Standees everywhere!
---
Well, this vendor I was looking at was also selling Fasnacht masks for a cool 12,000 apiece. I don't think he was joking!
---
We get tunnel vision about stuff like that. There are plenty of people who play who don't crawl reddit or the trade subs and don't really participate in the whole extra-curricular economy of it all. They don't know or don't care how much it might really be worth.
---
Same reason you'll see stuff somebody has dunked on a vendorbot that amazes you anybody would ditch it-

---
Thankfully I am currently using a HW PA build.  I'd be more annoyed at wasting the fast travel cost.
---
A half matathon is 13.1 miles. I'm not letting you get away with using no mathz whatsoever.
---
Dumb question probably, but have you tried resetting your router and PS4?
---
Yea, i know the locations, but what i need to do there?
---
How do people have the stash space to sell 120 items??
---
It's the plans that cause the most headache. Aid items I agree they should be easy enough.
---
Do you think that the developers salary is paid by the sale of atoms?  
---
The content that is coming is already planned, how do you think this works at a company? They will already have allocated funds to finance the upcoming content. No way that they rely on atom sales for that.
---
I'm pretty proud of it. I'm glad you and I can enjoy it.
---
I play Survival exclusively so I have to focus on damage avoidance and output.  Every special point that I'm not using for that feels like a serious disadvantage.
---
I tried mammals and reptiles too, couldn‚Äôt find a rabbit to save my life.
---
For sure. It's not about that tho. It's more about a rough range. Some items are definitely going to have a certain amount of value more or less. It's the same for selling and buying cars and the same factors apply. Some people need to get rid of a thing so they sell really low. Regardless Blue Books come in useful.
---
My camp is at max budget and I can sell things, it's just a bug as far as I'm aware.
---
I appreciate the offer but im on PS4. My stepdaughter has a ps4 too and I downloaded fallout 76 on it. I just log into her character and let her die so I can revive her.
---
  But that doesn't change the fact that this game desperately needs some kind of chat Box.
---
 I'm guessing the engine won't allow something like that or it is too difficult and time consuming to implement.
---
You shall create the Wazer Wifle.
---
You should wait to give it to a TSE though, if it's a possibility.
---
iirc, the Wazer Wifle was very powerful, so giving the name to a powerful one would be more suitable than a standard.
---
I recently came across a Treehouse style camp in the Mire and it looked really awesome. Mind you there were a few floating objects but it was probably due to running low on budget. Got a nice 3 Star Combat Knife with SS from it too!
---
Damn son
---
Press the intercom and complete the course within the time limit.
---
There are a few smaller insects that have caused me the same issue. VATS will turn on but using the strike key for melee won't fire.
---
I did the test, 5 out of 5 in one try, yeah me!
---
...but I didn't get this question so now I'm sad. :)
---
It's not fun by any means. But it is a means to an end. I wish they could do "difficult" without bringing in "tedious".
---
I was super excited when I saw the cats...I put a couple outside my front door üò∫
---
Dew it: CODE RED for smashing communism!
---
I have two Xboxes so I just bring a mule over every 15k caps or so
---
Hell yeah, astronaut gangster. Couldn't say it better myself.
---
I hate my current floating camp. It's stupid amounts of useful in the current spot I am at but I still don't like it.  I keep my doors open though. Since you can't destroy my camp anymore and there's tons of wood and food in the area, you may want to stay and rest awhile.  Plus there's critters outside, come on in and stay awhile. I've considered leaving my extractors unlocked and might do that, depending on what I'm working towards.   
---
It's the least I can do with my area and budget.  The cement defense walls are pretty tall though, I've been thinking of rebuilding and using them more instead of the poles that always end up getting destroyed.
---
My camp is in an area where I'm frequently getting hit by level 68 mutants or packs of level 50 (ish) dogs.  If I keep anything outside, it'll get nom'd by creatures.  I've moved everything inside my building, including my crops and purifiers.  I don't want to subject shoppers to getting bit while shopping.  Therefore, gotta build an expansion wing.
---
Yes idk if it‚Äôs just melee ( I don‚Äôt actually use a gun just 3 different melee‚Äôs lmao) but it won‚Äôt allow me to hit them in vats &amp; some of them can be really tricky to hit without vats lol
---
Is this a serious questions? I think it is... But you realize most of the non weapon/armor things weigh less than a pound. So if you think of the hundreds of plans, aid, ammo, food, junk, etc. People could easily have 1000's of things available for sale and not exceed their stash limit.
---
Is not over my control where they decide to fast travel.... I wish it was.. 
---
tbh with you this is a flaw of game design.... they should at least spawn the visitors in the same place that we as owners spawn.. It would already fix the problem and avoid a lot of inconvenience.
---
That's a 10k-20k axe.  It's crazy out there right now
---
I've seen T-51 jet pack plans being sold for 25 caps, and 1* walking canes going for 1000. Some people need to chill. Who's gonna spend 1k caps on a walking cane?
---
I'm most probably wrong,but that rings a bell. I'm sure i've seen something of that nature......................now its going to bug the shit out me.
---
I didn't notice this!  How bad did they bulk up your budget?
---
I thought this was affecting me as well but I realized i was hitting the stash limit. I was trying to sell items out of my on-person inventory which will first need to go to stash. If your stash is nearly full like mine was then you get an error msg. Maybe you have the same issue? Hope this helps.
---
Spent ages looking around the existing rope course at new river gorge bridge before someone from here kindly pointed me in the right direction lol.
---
Someone was selling about 15 different magazines for only 20c each! I bought em all of course
---
One piece I wish they would add is either full or half wall with the white trim on the top edge that connects to the roof-wall pieces. so you can have barns wider than 2 tiles.. Right now my camp looks weird without it.
---
I'll be on tonight with a friend, but always open to playing with new people.
---
GT: matbmorr
---
I will also return the favor, let's make it a group thing :D
---
Yeah I feel that. I built on the cliff overlooking cranberry bog with the little lake pretty common spot but I could never find another place I truly enjoyed visually &amp; spawn-wise. I get the occasional super mutant but my 4 missile turrets make them wish they never walked up on my camp lol
---
It must be for future content- otherwise why bother? Nobody who's leveled up has any use for the area since it scales so low.
---
How do you even get the badges anyway??
---
my camp does this for me but everyone else who fast travels to it lands inside my camp fml.
---
I got it right away just not that funny lol :)
---
To me a garage / store hybrid sounds awesome.  What else would you have in your garage?  Sadly no Fusion Fleas or lawn mowers.  (Fun story.  In Fallout 4, I built a home around a decent conditioned car somewhere just so I could have a house with a car in the garage.)
---
I just had to move bits around so it sits to the side in my bar. I keep my garage for the crafting, bar has the brewing and cooking plus now the vending as it's the fun side of my camp and leads to the dormitory upstairs. Just made sense to put it there as my bar area is central to it all.
---
Make a badge called "plays well with others" and put in group activity challenges. Just keep it out of the main quest. I may never finish it and thats fine, ill miss out on some extra cosmetics. Just dont lock me out of the main quest if i choose the solo option.
---
Definitely not fun. I had to leave party chat because I was getting so frustrated that I was taking it out on my friends lol. I think I may just buy the more advanced packs off the players who went through the struggle to finish all of the challenges. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll make it past the next rank offer tad pool. I just wanna be able to build the one I got from the atom shop.
---
Done
---
Literally in front, Laid across the hood of a red coupe.
---
Sounds strange, at level 200+ I never get that, but quite frankly would love it.
---
The rare occasions when Ghouls continuously re-spawn at White Springs causing you to face 20 or more at once is a blast, and the normal has become quite boring.
---
Later in the game you will find yourself hoping for moments like that, I went into West Tek a few days ago, and the SuperMutants were spawning like crazy, at least twice the normal amount, I nearly died a couple of times, it was a real adventure that left me with over 1000 Steel Scrap.
---
It‚Äôs annoying &amp; tedious &amp; I too raged pretty hard last night but can‚Äôt say the backpack won‚Äôt be worth it..
---
Mattyboh23_  I need someone to let me revive them.
---
lol I install 15 extra water purifiers large or industrial at Charleston landfill and leave them all open
---
Challenges -&gt; world 
---
Scroll near the bottom
---
Same on Xbox. Claimed a workshop... fixed it up... kicked... logged back in... same thing happened all over again.
---
I'd happily buy what other people scrapped too.
---
Communist Prime Plz. 
---
That poster has me excited
---
it's probably just Bethesda overlooking something again like with the camera challenges back then or the deathclaw stuff 
---
...with Bethesda's patch history they've probably tied those items with the release of the legendary vendor next week
---
The possum challenges are an even greater lessen in tedious quest design, but I really want that high-capacity backpack so time for some coffee and music.
---
I do that with 10mm. Once i hit 1k I grab my sub out the box and go to town inside the mine next to WS. then take all those items and sell them to vendor bots for caps and then I tuck subbie back into his bed/box
---
Couldnt you just...ya know...run everywhere instead? The game doesn't force you to fast travel.
---
Right? All this hate on floating camps, just because they're in the air doesn't mean they're ugly by default. Plus house stilts are real people, look it up.
---
Hey that games an OG though! My friend &amp; I have fuckin flipped playing that game late nightüòÇ
---
then your stash box is full. What I did was take out around 100 lbs of things out of my stash box, and I was able to put what I wanted into my vending machine no problem.
---
I just last night found the stupid camera and am doing that questline. Bethesda really knows how to make things wildly difficult for no real reason. Also I know a good chunk of people are high level, but they really need to add some more low level content for the newbies
---
maybe it 'slipped' bethesdas mind (if you know what i mean ;) )
---
even a pretty cheap military skin too!
---
Cuz the starch. I get it it too! We're a club now.
---
Check the Communism Posters in C.A.M.P - they gave themselves some wiggle room :D
---
Just checking because I haven't seen it yet: Does the Campfire Tales event show a notification on HUD like the Fascnacht Parade did?
---
No I don't use bloodied and I kill players all day long l. If you think bloody is the only way your just bad
---
very clever though
---
20 caps, whew! Lowest I've found is 50 caps each heh. Nice find :) I'm having so much fun this patch just constantly checking everyone's stores for finds like these :P May you find many more!
---
Oh no
---
You need a broken Pro camera to craft a new one at the Tinker bench
---
And hope someone doesnt get to them first
---
Wow seems like high school.  People who want to be different and creative are usually shunned upon.  I have a floating camp.  When I made mine back in November I had not seen one previously and thought it was pretty neat and different.  Since then I have seen them pop up everywhere.  Guess I‚Äôll redesign it in order to get some sales from my vending machine lol too funny.  The reason I made a floating base is for the nice view when inside the camp, gives a treehouse feeling.
---
Dude I would little sleep with Todd if I could get the Lincoln‚Äôs Repeater
---
I feel so bad for you
---
Dude, go to Wavey Willard's.  There's never been a time I didn't see him there. He's leaned up against a car placed directly ahead of you when you fast travel. Can't miss him.
---
this entirely. the only purpose of my charisma is hard bargain, lone wanderer, and the fast travel perk
---
I need that too, I can help you later if you return the favour. I‚Äôm at work now though
---
Xbox. I‚Äôm awfully new to trading, but with my prices people seem to be eating this stuff up!
---
Well, time to rebuild my house.
---
Yes!  I haven‚Äôt even put anything in my vending machine because I have no idea what to price things at. I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to end up way under pricing things ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But as someone else said, it‚Äôs better than the stuff sitting in my stash.
---
That‚Äôs just propaganda, it‚Äôs not a real robot. It was in Fallout 4 as well.
---
It is really fun to watch what people want to sell; i used about 1.5k caps for the fast travels last night!
---
Do you know if we will be able to purchase the more advanced packs from players who managed to grind through the entire quest line? I hear there will be refrigerated ones. If so I will gladly give these players my money lol
---
umm.... really?!? Because the things you are selling in the vending machine are already in your stash box no?
---
I don't know whether it was purposeful or not, but the 200 squashed 2 camps with one nuke. Both were near the Whitespring. Don't know about the other one, it might've had turrets that the man hated, but mine didn't. Was open, even 10 unlocked industrial water purifiers. Might have been because it was the Whitespring. Mine and the random's camp had the player vending machine powered.
---
Exactly. Is that even fair? Are a few scrips worth 1k? That's what a list would help with.
---
I‚Äôve been searching for people to co-op with forever psn: yoraeh
---
Rust
---
Ark
---
That new pirate game
---
There are a whole bunch
---
where was the location? I'm gonna avoid fast traveling for that one.
---
Have you tried spamming the placement button when its showing green but giving you that message? This was my work around.
---
Also, the stairwell piece has always been cursed and should never be used. But if you must use it, try removing everything attached to it in reverse order from how it was attached. I hate that thing.
---
Now! Thats Propaganda
---
Supress the instant gratification part of your psyche and play?
---
I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm not the only one that had noticed that some weapons were able to skip reload and made you in to a tank
---
Sledgehammer missing the searing heavy bladed rocket can't get the numbers tho
---
Yeah same I sell it pretty cheap though. I was relatively new to the market about a month ago just really bought stuff on LFG through Xbox which is horribly overpriced but just going through other 76 markets on reddit really helped me get a grasp of everything‚Äôs average price &amp; what is considered TOO high for most people
---
My crops are there for taking, and my water purifier is there for collecting. I do get slightly annoyed when people leave all my doors open, but I really don‚Äôt care for the most part
---
this!
---
I‚Äôm not holding my breath though.
---
I really wish they would stop stealth nerfing everything in the hopes of making this a PVP game.  I have seen so many fun games become grindy messes because developers couldn't understand how to balance PVP.  In this case most people don't seem to even want PVP but Bethesda seems hellbent on shoving down our throats anyways.  Makes me really wish this game had only been co-op so they could focus on bug fixes and new content only.
---
It says I need a broken prosnap deluxe. I can't find another one
---
The xp based top 3 system does seem incredibly odd though. I‚Äôd be interested in an explanation just to understand the intent, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad I‚Äôm just curious to know what they‚Äôre intending to achieve 
---
I‚Äôm glad I started a new character a few weeks ago and got him to the 60s with a solid PvP build from scratch, I spent pretty much the entire time at the absolute top of the xp leader board.
---
That's glorious. Hahahaha
---
If we had more control over our spawn points, it would be a hell of a lot easier.  I am not rebuilding my entire camp to accommodate the vending machine + 0,0 spawn point.  
---
What I DID do was carve out a hole in my foundation to allow folks to spawn in properly, then put up pointing vault boy cardboard cutouts to direct them where they need to go.
---
In for reply to this....I was wondering this myself.
---
No, not like that.
---
I have to confess I have played the game since launch including a couple of hours on the beta. Yes there were bugs. Server drops etc. The lack of NPC's was a bit of a let down.  However my experience of the game, since the start,in its entirety is pretty  positive. I love love the game. I still cannot get my head around people calling it a failure and the worst game ever. I get there will be people that just don't like it. But overall I think it's a good game.
---
I play my drums while my vendor is open. Voice chat some with potential buyers. When I wanna go do shit I just unplug the power and off I go. Don‚Äôt want them buying something they might not want because they couldn‚Äôt inspect it. As for going to other vendors, if they aren‚Äôt at there camp after I‚Äôm done browsing, I‚Äôll bounce and periodically check the map to see when they are home.
---
Right?
---
It was only introduced fairly recently, so it probably didn't exist for most of those levels
---
How do you earn badges ??
---
it was regular stairs... i had to reset my whole camp again &gt;.&gt;
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the crops are 7 /hour (roughly). That‚Äôs like less than 10 minutes per spawn, so unless your grinding crops for something, I don‚Äôt see an issue with someone taking them
---
While I may be inclined to agree, I still think it's a god damn embarrassment that a game studio that's been around as long as Bethesda is still shitting out games buggier than most indie titles.
---
Yeah, their games tend to be far larger and more complex, but that excuse only flies the first few times. We're on Elder Scrolls VI and Fallout 6 (effectively) and they still don't know what they're doing, apparently. 
---
It shouldn't take a year after release to make a software product stable. That's embarrassing.
---
Deep dish chages rad damage from 50 to 125, and increases the range, that's it.
---
Signal splitter (aka Electric Signal Carrier Antennae) adds 40 Energy Damage.
---
I'm actually OK with this as long as we can select base item type and # of stars.
---
I started with listing 26 plans, and listed most for 100-400 caps, and ended the day with 12, so I made a lot of sales. Most of the plans are free spawns out in the world, and I know where to pick them up again, so I'm not sad if I left some caps on the table.
---
do you know what the "athlete knowledge exam" portion of it is after you complete all the courses?
---
We appear to have the same charisma then. 5 charisma though, right? I switch between Inspirational, Hard Bargain and Lone Wanderer.
---
This is bad and unacceptable.
---
Lever action
---
They need proper end game dungeons with progression - both in terms of difficult bosses and gear grind.
---
Yeah I met him in the mire, he had a mysterious quill on him too
---
That is correct. Nerf was about damage explosive effects
---
I‚Äôm pretty damn critical of this game, weird that Bethesda hasn‚Äôt kicked me out...
---
How much did you pay for it?
---
I‚Äôm not sure. I also haven‚Äôt ‚Äúspent‚Äù any badges on things yet at those new vendors so I don‚Äôt know how it works. If I remember though, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs enough badges to get everything, so more badges may be coming. Later I might see if I can make and sell another basic pack, just to see if it‚Äôs possible. Could be very lucrative business for people who don‚Äôt have the time for all the tedium.
---
I literally woke up today thinking "if these tokens aren't items like mr fuzzy tokens, is there a limit to them?" Seems like you got to it first though, nice
---
I mean, I sold a 2* Furious The Dragon powder rifle for like 350 caps, so the only thing I'd be willing to spend more caps on would be really badass weapons, rare plans and serums.
---
You'll need to find the tourist again or ask to buy it from someone who has an extra
---
So he spends more caps to fast travel then he earns.......what's the catch?
---
Went to a dozen vendors yesterday, prices were ridiculously high.  5 to 10 caps per bullet.  25 caps for alchohol that we can pretty much craft ourselves.  6000 caps for a 1 star black powder pistol.  Very discouraging , gave up after a couple of hours.
---
This wouldn't be designed to punish or shame people that price low. Hell, a gift is a gift in the wasteland. I'm mainly interested in people overcharging (like the guy I saw charging 5000 for a 1 star 10mm medic pistol). 
---
That's just ridiculous. It has to be. Likewise I personally have some legendaries and I'd like to price them fairly. That could be where a resource like a community blue book can help.
---
That for doing the camera quest.
---
It's not griefing in survival.  Enter Survival at your own risk
---
On PC with every update you have to also update your Fallout76Custom ini to include the new items.
---
It's from completing Bucket List.
---
Yes but the explo Damage got nerfed as all the other weapons too. This nerf here was additional
---
I'd love to walk up on it stomping on liberators, and it sees one running away and escaping, so it lays down next to it and flicks it into oblivion.
---
The max cap limit of 25000 isn't cleanly divisible by the 1400 daily vendor stock either
---
The Wasteland Hero Statue seems to be bugged since the patch, after being placed you can not move it again. Selecting it in the build menu says "One or more related items are in use"
---
ok. Thanks.
---
You're not the only one buying things, low level players can use them too.
---
Yep, this. Tourist hunt. Boo.
---
I have a floating camp, but for a good reason. I needed the space for Razorgrain and other stuff. My camp area is 100% filled with water purifiers and vegetables.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt 
---
It just didn‚Äôt affect shotguns for the first time 
---
And that‚Äôs all 
---
They just did what they had to do month ago
---
You can now find the camera in random containers
---
I found two in the pioneer scout camp
---
I do this too! Those are, by far, the most useful CHR perks.
---
You can also buils walls on the bottom of floating bases, this leaves the dirt exposed for a garden thats protected, and your camp doesnt look stupid.
---
I knew that comment wasn‚Äôt going to be popular.  You do not make jokes about the fasnacht parade.  What about herding Brahmin with a shepherd‚Äôs crook?   Off limits also?  Ok. But I digress - why do you need to know if somebody is trying to force you into pvp?   You‚Äôre not really getting forced into anything. You‚Äôre getting tricked and murdered.  That would suck for anybody (including me) but it seems about right for a wasteland survival game doesn‚Äôt it?  Do we really need to sanitize this game any more than we already have?  I hope not. 
---
Survival mode?  That was a mistake.  All it is doing is fracturing the fan base even more.  If I go to survival I‚Äôm going to straight up murder you every single time I see you because I assume that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do to me.  That‚Äôs why the if you want PVP go to survival argument doesn‚Äôt work.  There are few, if any positive player interactions.  Some people like myself want both but are being forced to decide between two extremes because some people only want to kill other people (which I guess I understand because there isn‚Äôt one challenging thing in this game), and others insist on it being a camp decorating simulator with absolutely 0 risk from other players.  Instead of trying to find the best balance it‚Äôs become even more polarizing by trying to separating the games into 2 far from ideal choices.
---
The curve tables give me 38, 45, 52, 60 base damages for levels 15,25,35,45. Could you check if the rad and energy boosts are level dependent or not?
---
Thank you for telling me why you think this and clearly presenting your counter argument. Great to discuss that with you!
---
At the pioneer scout camp, first one, go there, beside the first scout leader who makes you into a tadpole. Building beside him, terminals with all of them. Beware, they‚Äôre difficult and annoying, but sometimes the answers are hilarious. (Like an option for ‚Äúbrute-forcing‚Äù a computer being to bash it with a super sledge, or ‚Äútake blood from his leg and put it into his arm‚Äù for a medical question‚Äù)
---
That‚Äôs awful! I‚Äôll poor a Nukashine out for you. Serious question though, seeing stairs are ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù for floating platforms, does that make your stairs immune to mob damage?
---
Not fun, ton of bugs as usually. With every WA updates, I felt first enjoyments and hopes, then disillusions. In the balance, for me, the good things they gave are wasted by silly decisions, nerf and bugs.
---
And who think it was a good idea not to be able to craft backpacks for secondary characters. I will definitely never do the challenges for my alternatives characters. Theses quests are not quests, it's just painful quizz and FedEx quests. And the fact that T. Howard said it is the best quests they have done sounds like an insult for me
---
Lmfao I used to have that issue.. I moved by Silo Alpha for a little bit until a bear ripped my entire downstairs apart while my turret went stupid mode. Moved quicker than ever
---
Or jumping off the drainage pipe at Grafton Steel
---
Ahhh - ok neat! Thank you!
---
Yes, there's even slot machine reels on the machine where you turn in the legendary weapons which seems to strongly imply a randomly generated legendary being returned. Hopefully you can at least choose weapon vs armor.
---
Pretty sure people are allowed to add what they want, they don‚Äôt have to just cater for you.
---
Ok cool thx!
---
Exactly. I don‚Äôt see why they would make it non tradable. We had to grind for tokens for Mr. Fuzzy costumes which were worth a ton before the duper‚Äôs came along and made them worth next to nothing
---
Even If this is the case then it was completely unnecessary since it wasn't op. It was solid and balanced to my mind
---
I‚Äôm enjoying it.  Yes I was initially bummed that I wasn‚Äôt going to end the day with a backpack but on reflection I‚Äôm impressed that they came up with things to keep us busy that are appropriate to the theme.
---
Like the other guy said, low players buy things too. I‚Äôd also buy a good low level weapon for an alt if I found one. Not everything needs to be BE or BSS.
---
Deep dish and signal splitter boosts are not level dependent.
---
Yeah same thing here
---
I knew I was saving mine for a reason! lol
---
It's kinda evil genius-ey.  Someone buys your junk with a 10% fee.  In order to not go over the cap, you buy someone else's junk with a 10% fee.  Ad infinitum.
---
He should have had a friend set a camp at the bottom with punji boards too. That would have been hilarious.
---
Nobody knows... Probably won't see the plans for it till next week
---
Piss off, buy it or don't, no one cares
---
I think it's...an odd idea, but not without merit (on paper).  If PvP was skill based entirely, you killing someone with a lot of points would generally be a good indicator of needing to move up the ranks.
---
At some point, I'd think it should turn into a ladder situation (when you kill someone, you move up the ladder to be above them, or you just swap places with them on the ladder...both have their benefits).  That works well for short-term, come and go situations.  But if Beth is going to be making a longer term (monthly?) leaderboard, there has to be some finite score that can be kept over time per character.
---
you're not my supervisor
---
I guess new people don‚Äôt exist.. also I‚Äôll buy up all your cheap level 20 2-3 stars more scrips for meü§ë
---
Oh boooo. Thanks for the heads up though.
---
I spent a lot of time last night roaming between all the camps on my server. All the 2 for deals where still up. All the one for one was gone. 
---
I'm not saying don't hold out for two, just maybe rethink the price if it doesn't sell soon enough
---
No, Deep dish and signal splitter boosts are not level dependent.
---
It's a visual error. I've seen some of my sales where they bought 7 fusion cores (all I had in the machine) but it showed like 58 in the top left. As far as I've been able to tell that's how many the recipient has on them now
---
I think it adds more excitement, will they shop? Or will they Rob me? Very immersive üòÅ
---
I also sell my stuff cheap and had the same thing happen. A player bought 2 weapons at 500 each then proceeded to sell the for 1k each... At least it cleared some space in my stash.
---
I have a full melee build I use a lever action.
---
as other comments......I'm sure this game has crashed my router twice.and the disc wont help....60 odd gig of downloads req.
---
Stairs like foundations are immune!
---
Exactly.!  There is absolutely nothing to fear in adventure mode.  Sounds pretty lame when you put it that way doesn‚Äôt it?
---
Ah so it now caps at 100% - no longer additional buffs up to 200%.
---
I'll do it. ManandGodandLaw_
---
Do you know how we can kill each other?
---
Same, despise wearing power armour, I had my resistances at 500/400 something which was nice.
---
There‚Äôs a terminal at the pioneer scout camp it has ever test on it. Have google handy when you do the tests as even though most questions are pretty obvious others are a little obscure.
---
This was more a heads up cause I thought in Survival that our places weren't shown cause that is what the pop up tells us for fast traveling. Knowing I can remove things and my place closes down from that is nice knowledge. Not saying people can't gun you down, just that these rules aren't being displayed to us fairly.
---
I went to where the robot said bloatflies would be. He was right, there was like 12 there. Started killing them all when I hear that infamous flapping of wings. Not 1, not 2, but THREE scorchbeasts swooped down and in seconds had blasted the bloatflies to smitherines. I couldn't find any bodies to loot until I slayed all the bat dragons. Needless to say I was quite low on ammo and stims after but at least I got some bloatfly glands. Made absolutely sure to not scrap them again this time...
---
I'm not gonna lie - I bought all the plans and crafted a fresh set of X-01 purely so I could put the Nukashine paint on it. Looks so damn good.
---
Fair point. These plans/packs are going to be really costly for awhile. Sell before the market gets over- saturated. Now where‚Äôs my marketing badge!
---
If you see a nuke inbound, server hop.  If you are on a team, log off, wait for somebody on your team to tell you that the nuke has landed, then get back in.
---
Actually sever hopped here for about 20 min this morning, no luck.
---
Im pretty sure noboddy will buy lvl 5 10 mm pistol in cranberry bog for 300 caps. Orr if you think its good to showcase 30 weapons you fast travel here, get stuck in foudation just to find out the giy iss selling 20 frag granades
---
That's my plan as well once I get time to gather materials haha.
---
I think this is by design, but I‚Äôd like the game to prevent any sale that would cause my caps to go above 25k.  We could get a message when that happens just like we do when someone buys stuff so we can then rush around and buy random shit to free up cap space.
---
Wow! That's a great deal. I wish I had found your camp last night to buy it then because these vendors have their prices flying in space at this point. I ended up buying a full Fusion Core priced at 50 caps just to say I did something with this patch.
---
[https://media.giphy.com/media/7Fg2CtxlEpz34bJKBC/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/7Fg2CtxlEpz34bJKBC/giphy.gif)
---
Yes there are. They are referring to the Deluxe which before could only be looted from the dead tourist. Now it's showing up in containers.
---
Do you actually play the game or just repeat what you‚Äôre told? Shotty were nerfed at the same time as other explosive legendaries. Now they just have to nerf it even more because their god tier ass-sent armor got a slight nerf.
---
I don‚Äôt play this shit game anymore but this sub is still good for a laugh every few weeks.
---
Xbox prices were ridiculous last night.  Gave up after visiting 12 camps.
---
No way! Honestly? I had no idea the drop rate was that low. Come to think of it, I don't really remember seeing that many. Meat I've always gotten - maybe it's a super rare thing? :/ Sorry!
---
You can't inspect items in a vending machine unless the owner is nearby.  I've speculated elsewhere about how/why, it's a code issue though.  If the owner is at the shop, you can inspect things just fine.
---
Also basic rad damage is 50, not 60.
---
Sure m8, im pretty convinced lvl5 10mm pistol for 300 caps in a shop loated in cranberry bogg will exploe from the loww levels wantkng to buyy here.
---
I think it's inspired me rather than forced. Kind of like tidying up before people come over irl.
---
Not fully no. I'm thinking maybe start the swarm of suitors event or something and let a mirelurk kill us in the water?
---
Well... I know now what Im gonna do today
---
They cannot be dropped. Trying to drop them tells you it will be destroyed, like with stuff painted with atom shop skins.
---
Thats another idea too, just ship some of it off.
---
Sounds like bloody fun!
---
Damn, dude. Everyone I've pointed in that direction has had success with the first or second try. I thought for sure you would score there. Sorry, man. Good luck
---
I've heard you can do it with mines. I'll bring some.
---
I agree with you man but just don‚Äôt let it bug you. You are gonna have a hard time in life if you get so easily irritated.
---
Over time the market will adjust itself. The prices will adjust over time, or they will have to accept never selling anything.
---
Same! I haven't noticed much in terms of this other than you can now fast travel around enemies as long as you don't die for 5 seconds. But that's all I've noticed QOL wise
---
The 1911 and the marksman carbine would be my choices.
---
PMing you a link that I can't PM you here, but it has suggested junk prices that are pretty accurate.
---
Alright sounds good
---
My aae combat I found in game
---
Can confirm
---
Might be the case. I bought some stuff from people that I found moderately useful just because I was getting so many caps from my own store. I'm spending frivolously to avoid reaching max. This really does encourage a healthy player economy though
---
I suck at games so it‚Äôs challenging for me to complete some of these tasks but I really want all of the scout items so I‚Äôm looking forward to putting in a ton of time to complete all these badges
---
&gt; In Survivial, remove all your "for sale" listings from your player trading booth, otherwise expect player neighbors trying to kill you all the time
---
In survival expect player neighbors to try and kill you all the time.
---
For a while mine did that and it also trapped people under my floor. We need fast travel mats.
---
It‚Äôs profitable just a little time consuming. And occasionally I‚Äôll find a legendary in the mix. Now missles..... screw those I just leave them where they are. Ain‚Äôt got time for all that
---
Was using combat explosive shotgun but just tried it and could hardly kill a lvl 20 thing with it.
---
Added. May need to double check the energy damage numbers.
---
Yeah i hope i dont fast travel to your camp then. Becouse paying 30 caps for a showcase of non legendary 10 mm pistols for lvl 10 is not cool.
---
Right, how was i supposed to know that you're bi/multilingual.
---
So this is why I‚Äôm getting my ass handed to me when I get mobbed. I didn‚Äôt even bother to look at my armor stats after the update.
---
Dude, you can have my water, they Will be replenished by the time i return. Honestly i dont get the need to lock everything. 
---
However, Can someone tell me HOW you lock stuff? It bothers me Not knowing
---
Some other places seem to have gotten a makeover too. The lighting inside the Watoga train station looks way different
---
I was hoping to start selling them for people who can't be bothered to people who didn't want to go through the tedious Scout challenges.
---
Couple options come to mind.  
---
1) If you are placing it next to your main house, you can extend the flooring from the 2nd floor outside of you exterior walls and create an overhang that way.
---
2) Try attaching the Triangular "half-walls" to the exterior of your main house, then place an angled roof on top of them.  You may need to temporarily remove one of your existing walls in order to get the triangles to snap properly.
---
I like the hunt to find my neighbors and systematically murder them personally with no tips.
---
I priced my serums at 250 (Market price),  two guys bought 20-30 of my serums and turned around to sell them for 800-1k. I have no idea how this market is going to behave.  The other subs will definitely be used to item to item transfers.
---
Upvote for the Archer reference.
---
You can power the machine up with a switch, turn it off when you want and your camp will no longer be advertised.
---
At least that's how it is supposed to work.
---
Lesgibson01 I'm about to send a friend request
---
Weird how No Man's Sky came back successfully from their awful launch
---
Even without that mod it seems the sledgehammer out performs both the grognak and super sledge in every scenario
---
I‚Äôll try that, thanks!
---
Excellent work as always, just out of curiosity do you plan on adding tenderizer as a modifier?
---
Holy shit, i actually laughed out loud at that. Thx
---
possibly, ive not gone past the begining of this quest, but 'stimpack diffuser', something in the back of my head says that I have seen this.
---
if i'm not a diddy,then its already in game ???????????
---
same goes for posts on hides......also sure I've seen deathclaw hide.
---
Agreed with the floating CAMPs, it's a cheap trick to exploit the game engine and makes a CAMP look just like shit.
---
Adding a couple now, I‚Äôd like to say its genuinely to help lower levels, but in all honesty it‚Äôs just to annoy you.ü§£
---
If they were catering to all play styles you wouldn't need to pay extra for items just because you lack time. It doesn't seem so much that they are catering to all play styles so much as capitalizing on certain ones.
---
The power just makes your place light up, it will be active regardless
---
Where were you last night I spent 3 hours üò¢
---
Ty for life tip m8 but im in my 30 and im good. Just wanted to talk about this becouse it seems everyone just puts unwanted scrap loot in vending machines and you pay for fast travel just to see this shit.
---
Thanks updated.
---
any recipie I don't know is sought after...
---
That sucks but still a nice weapon. I‚Äôve found a bunch of legendary explosive shotguns but just not aae.
---
Thanks, I've found the course. Do you have to activate it to start somehow? I've run it twice both ways but nothing happened.
---
Thanks for the help,. Speaking of luck, does that stat have anything to do with finding it? I'm starting to wonder, if I need to move some points around... Then again if that the case, I'm even more annoyed than before.
---
Always a few rabbits near the whitesprings service entrance up the the hill.
---
Scroll down!!!! There's one challenge left at the ski resort.
---
All my unused ammo for 1 cap each.... so far no buyers... but i was playing quite late
---
Got some stimpacks for 15 caps each. Then some other random meds.
---
Also some bulk copper, but i cant remember what price i set.
---
There would be an event where you have to protect him against scorched or super mutants.
---
Thanks to you, great job!
---
My gamer tag is the same as my screen name. I need to revive someone! I‚Äôll be on around 430 pm central time US.
---
Similar situation. Tried the Team Up Emotes without success. Then tried an invite whilst at the Scout Camp, but the invites are declined. Even tried dying, and shouting for help (just this minute) without luck! Understandably the game is an MMO but to complete this task to revive an ally, the explanation doesn't state if the person must be a team member or any character that requires help whilst becoming unconscious. If it's a latter than it's plausible to help an dying ally when facing the Queen Scorchbeast, but if not then I'll have to find a partner in crime.. (Parting is such Sweet Sorrow).
---
Got it.
---
Hell, I spawned inside the foundations of MY OWN CAMP once...
---
Nope, it‚Äôs a regular event. It takes place at Camp Adams, so you just gotta check there.
---
Agreed, at least on PS4 it takes forever to get anything done. I wanna play, not stare at multiple loading screens and pop-in textures.
---
At the Pioneers camp where you started the DLC. There's a cabin with a couple of terminals there that have them.
---
Sunnytop ski lanes
---
It was my favorite gun, now it's just another
---
Im pretty sure you can instead re-help those 2 robots, If you use the personal terminal it tells you that they are ready to talk to so I'm guessing they have a way to solo this stuff.
---
Thanks!!
---
Back at the location you met the scout leader
---
Sunny Top Ski Lanes is one of the courses.  You know the World Challenges sub-items need to be scrolled through to see them all right?
---
LOL  That's funny, evil, but funny.
---
It is clear on why I think that the lot of this subreddit is rediculous. You're spending money on a broken unfinished game that you already paid real money for and praising the devs for putting in content that was promised more than 6 months ago. they haven't fixed anything and they stealth nerf shit all the time to push more Atom shop content and break the promise of cosmetics only when they include QoL items in a FULL PRICED GAME THAT'S BROKEN AS FUCK AND KEEP BREAKING ITEMS FURTHER.
---
Being down voted isn‚Äôt the end of the world. Or how many followers you have on twitter or instagram. Fuck people, you don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs approval for your thoughts or opinions. Do your own shit, be your own person but most of all enjoy the little things, even if that little thing is wrecking other people‚Äôs shit and getting a bounty
---
If you move your camp, everything that you had built will now be under the stored tab and you can rebuild them without costing you any materials. When you do this, you'll see you don't get xp for placing them as you've already built them before. When the server forces you to move your camp, you'll get a temporary blueprint of your entire camp that you can place down one time (if it lets you), but I don't know if it does that same thing if you voluntarily move your camp.
---
Where have you seen that?  This is the first I have heard the 'random item' possibility.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out again when I'm home but I think this happened when I wanted to assign items that already have been in my stash. 
---
I also don't think that I'm at my stash limit but I'm pretty sure that I'm at my camp limit. Maybe the assignment doesn't really take camp capacity but even there's no capacity left, then any action results in error messages anyway. Need to do more testing.
---
It is simply not possible. For one thing, people are willing to pay hugely variant amounts based on what they need and use. For another, prices are constantly changing in relation to other factors. 
---
There is no blanket pricing for a majority of items (deep pocketed CA arms and CA legs plans will be similarly priced, but not necessarily the same as deep pocketed robot limbs and definitely not the same as shadowed or cushioned). 
---
With legendary items you will pretty much have to price each item individually because rules do not exist for it. I have a lot of experience trading very niche CS:GO skins like case hardeneds, low floats, and katos, and even with all the different trade subs it's pretty difficult if not possible to find consistent prices on most items
---
Not to mention that many of the higher tiers (like bloodied explosive, or sentinel armor before the nerf) was pretty much exclusively traded for other god tiers and not for caps
---
Yeah cant even put in a security light without it phasing through the desired wall or stating its cant be place "floating"
---
Far cry better than that arcade style ffa gear vs gear death match junk pile they threw our way.
---
sure, i need that one too, my Beth ID : Khaithan
---
I was only getting squirrels near there, when I was checking last night, but I‚Äôll give it another look.
---
Thanks I have no idea what to set my prices at.
---
This posts didn't age well.
---
Give it a whirl, it's what we should have had since launch
---
Maybe. Use the other boosts to prop up the damage percentages.
---
Sounds like a round about way of getting rid of the caplimit which is always a bad idea.
---
The 10% is going in the right direction, unlimited caps is the opposite
---
I know. But I wasn't on a team, and it was a Whitesprings nuke after all. Not complaining, though. Rebuilding the camp isn't too painful.
---
Lol its not like highschool...it's pretty indisputable that they look Unrealistic, and a lot of people like realism in fallout. When you're walking along and a big flashing barn propped up by a single stair case appears, it's shitty.
---
Yeah lol, there is speaker on one side of route. Click it wait and then run thru checkpoints.
---
More thumbs down from Shotgun users
---
I don't lock anything but a generator room with my Fusion Reactor just because.  The water regenerates automatically, I leave it open free to anyone that's thirsty.
---
No idea about the diffuser, I‚Äôve only completed the event once.
---
As far as I can tell Camp Adams is the only place for the event, so keep an eye on it.
---
That would be a cool endgame boss to add, a Communist knockoff version of Liberty Prime.
---
I just like how you get upvoted for that. Even tho inteligent person would ask first before insult.
---
Agreed! And all my food spoiled really quick from all the traveling. I thoroughly enjoyed checking out everyone's camps but man did it cost me.
---
One correction: 
---
The founding father who created a disk cypher was Jefferson, not Franklin. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson\_disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_disk)   
---
One addition from memory: 
---
Clean and Jerk is an Olympic weightlifting event (athletics).
---
Maybe it was a 2 star item. but that is besides the point. The fact I was able to buy it back after I sold it.
---
This post seems like a shill post that is being actively botted. The disparity between the number of upvotes on the post versus the number of comments and upvotes on the comments is much larger than you would expect with a post upvoted this much.
---
I put up a lvl 10 explosive 10mm smg for a few thousand caps....it sold within mins. Im in the bog.   Ill admit i wasnt expecting it...but its gone, along with most of the other stuff i put up. I was over max caps within an hour and losing them.
---
Im not even into the vendor thing that much, so people must be making tons of caps off this
---
I hear ya. My fav has been my bloodied pump, still a great weapon but not the same gun as five months ago.
---
I found the tourist whilst doing path to enlightenment at  landview lighthouse. They we half way up the stairs. I spent 3 days searching the water park, monuments and graveyards with no luck.
---
Awful.
---
7 days
---
Right because each piece is only 15% so with a full set you will be lucky to get the full 75% reduction . If only 2 pieces get triggered you only get a 30% reduction
---
It would be nice if you could at least select the class of armor you want for example.  I like to wear leather and sneak around so even if it‚Äôs still random it would at least be nice to say you want a randomly selected leather legendary,  because I would hate to get a gun of raider I would never use.
---
I thought you could just do the dailies again and complete it that way.
---
Your system doesn‚Äôt work because legendary prefixes and suffixes aren‚Äôt all on equal ground but trash 3* did gain value with the legendary junker
---
If you're on PC I could tell you, but IDK what prices are on console
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat!  Imposter sheepsquatch or the new real sheepsquatch even will probably be the best bet.
---
This really is the lowest effort location to find him.  Zone into the fast travel location (not the train station, the hotel proper).  When you're walking up to the entrance like you would to go visit the shops, you'll pass a red car on your right just before the overhang/columns.  If he's spawned, Ansel will be draped over the hood.
---
I haven't checked to be sure, but hang out long enough for the robots to spawn in, he may spawn with them (or he may be there before that, I'm not 100% sure).  If you don't see a corpse, log out there and try again.
---
Shouldn't take you terribly long, and you get plenty of tries in a short time frame if needed.
---
^  truth
---
The liberty prince robot was created before the war. It could totally be here, get destroyed, be found by the brotherhood, shipped to the capital wasteland and then you know the rest
---
Yes and this is another effective way of slowly removing caps. I‚Äôm enjoying traveling around looking at what other players have put in their machines. Doing so has also taken me to parts of the map I‚Äôve not visited.
---
I decided recently I was not going to hoarde legendaries, I will just scrap them as I get them. But I did put some that I felt were worth money in my mules vending machine. I am way more excited about that then the legendary eater, lol. Now to find out if the walking into the wall trick stil works to avoid getting kicked for inactivity, lol.
---
Or just buff them
---
Havent played with the terminal yet.
---
Im not sure what robots you are talking about... 
---
I was hoping to try a messenger quest and let the handy get downed to see if that would work.
---
I like the tests because I finally feel like I have to work for something. They could've at least given hints or answers somewhere in the game though
---
Lol I think it‚Äôs kinda funny how enthusiastic the newer players are in this game
---
Ive sent them several responses to the initial ticket and no reply. They are tight lipped about it and its suspicious
---
I seem to recall Kanawha County Cemetery spawns Stingwings...
---
Thanks! I've finished it now.
---
Power armor has the disadvantages of not allowing you to use legendary armor effects, requiring heavy fusion cores to function, and increasing your hitbox. Power armor should have significantly higher damage resistances than armor.
---
Really? I completed 3 and got squat. Hmm
---
Perfect! Thank you SO much. It didn't seem right that I'd have to "cross the world" to tear everything down but ,,, I feel 100% better knowing a definitive answer. Nuke On my brother (or sister as may be ) :)
---
For first tier
---
No im not, thats just your opinion man =)
---
Don't know what you're getting down voted, you're not wrong. It's a minor thing, but Bethesda still said they would only sell cosmetics. Repair kits are just a start, I won't be surprised once they start adding caps or scrip to the atomic shop.
---
Does this count as a floating C.A.M.P.?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/DsBNOI0](https://imgur.com/a/DsBNOI0)
---
Yeah, the way I play the game is the only correct way to play. Why do other people do what they want to do if it's not the same thing I do?
---
they were taking requests to replace the bag up until May 1st.  Slow your roll.
---
If I saw them 2 weeks ago , I would of bought them for my alt I started
---
For chems, I ventured to a vendor, popped grape mentats and Hard Bargain and priced mine in the middle of what they go from that to what the machine has it preset to. Been selling crap ton of chems, made 3k just in 2 hours.
---
Luckily, we can skip some of the challenges and still get all the stuff, right?
---
Go to challenges then world and look for tadpole there are no quest
---
So I guess a mod to mark all the correct answers with a \* would be useful to you?
---
I can't place my personal terminal. Says nothing is selected.
---
It‚Äôs a weird flow of things that‚Äôs for sure. I had been doing the overseers quest (is that still bugged?) and then I just have up on quests and did my own thing.
---
Ohh may 16 - I had read a summary somewhere else with no date
---
I picked a broken one up last night after the patch and it went into the Misc tab of the pipboy so you can't scrap it.
---
Yeah, I read somewhere about that but I had also heard it might be in the atom shop amd would much rather just sell it to newer players.
---
That's what I would expect. If you could pick and choose your equipment/effects, everyone would be wearing and using the same equipment inside of a week.
---
Ah, i see you are learning from me. Congratulations
---
At the legendary vendor coming next week as mentioned in the patch notes which is a pinned post at the top if this sub.
---
I do I just don't use obviously broken guns
---
Data mined values can't be wrong. They are literally the values pulled from the game files. What can be wrong is the interpretation of what those values mean, how they are used in the code, the way they are affected by unknown formulas, etc.
---
Thank you for answering ...I'll look again. Maybe I'm just moving too fast, who knows?
---
It's new, all helmets and outfits got it for some reason.
---
Honestly, the plans default price is good in most of those situations. It's lower than what vendors sell it for but still solid amount. The only ones that should really be reduced by any drastic amount are the ones that are suuuuuuuuuuuper common. You know, that one plan you get after **every single** SBQ.
---
Exactly, a floating ‚Äòhouse‚Äô is not creative.  Mine is definitely not a floating box with four walls.  Anyone could do that.
---
You need irradiated sugar bombs, not the ‚Äúclean‚Äù version
---
I think it may be a glitch. I was in adventure to see what it **was**, but then I was able to complete it in adventure. I would be more alarmed, but this challenge is perfectly doable - just as easy in both modes so I don't think it'll have too much effect.
---
What?  Was this an undocumented nerf?
---
Melee build minding my own business south of Fort Defiance carrying a good chunk of rare junk when suddenly two scorch beasts decide to spawn less then 50 meters away and instantly spot me, I decide to do a full 180 and retreat at full blast ducking under some decent cover I pull up my pipboy ‚Äúcan‚Äôt fast travel while enemies are close by‚Äù screaming in terror I start regretting my build entirely, thinking why I didn‚Äôt just go with the route everyone else took and deck out in explosive weaponry.
---
Needless to say this is a good addition to the game, very good.
---
These exams are terrible and one of the worst things I have experienced in a game.
---
I think you need to find the sweet spot you are happy with.
---
Obviously, you want to get the most amount of caps for the item (within reason).
---
Buyers want the cheapest price possible.
---
Your job is to find the highest you can put it up for, while the players will still buy.
---
For me, I set everything at the value it says it has, with a few changes.
---
Serums I set to 750 instead of 1000, and rare items like Mr. Fuzzy or Hunter‚Äôs Longcoat I set to about 1.5-2x the value.
---
I am currently sitting at max caps so I must have done a decent job pricing!
---
Ya and then 5-8 for the mods
---
I actually did this accidentally once.
---
You didn't always fall if you fast traveled but I always did if I logged out then back in at my camp.
---
Honestly, it's surprisingly easy to do.
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug, it displays whats left when someone buys.
---
Lol, nice.
---
It wouldn't let me review you when you fell into the deeper water.
---
You should sell things at prices people are willing to buy them at. Only the god tier weapons have well established prices, and what people consider valuable will depend on their build. I found all my bloodied stuff got sold right away at "default" prices. For example.
---
But yeah went to a level fifty camp and they were just selling normal stuff that I can craft for myself for free, I was like what are you doing dude.
---
Ill be on later if you haven't done it already by like 7pm east coast, name is the same as my Reddit.
---
Ah okay, thanks, still a bug tho
---
Probably bug gotten from backpacks
---
It should be more cautious as a system and simply not allow the sale.
---
Except that‚Äôs not what happened, Liberty prime was discovered by the BOS in the basement of the Pentagon.
---
I think it's just a visual bug and where it says that you sold more ammo than you actually have but i gotta do some further testing
---
I'm on PC, mind if I get a link? I got a lot of junk to offload
---
Assult rifle from 3 all the perks have that one and not the new assult rifle
---
100% next week somebody will write this again and it will get frontpage. I think i paraphased it wrong. But if you think selling  LVL 5 10mm Pistol ( non legendary ) for 300 caps in craberry bog is helping low level players, you should seek help too.
---
GT:   schenck80
---
I'll be on today around 7pm est for a few hours. I will not have a mic tonight so just send console messages and I'll reply.
---
Yep yep, and thats nifty because if lag hits you or you just click the wrong thing, your favorite weapon isn't gone forever and you're also not getting ripped off scrip to get it back.
---
GT: schenck80
---
All my ammo was gone when i went to check my vending machine.
---
what, it was fun.
---
Yeah it wouldn't let me revive you at all im not 100% sure how it works
---
This already exists for junk, ammo, aid, etc - recommended price list. Very helpful for pricing out your junk and ammo items, although a lot of ammo is still going to be trade only for a long time due to much of it being worth less than 1c per. It's listed in the Discord of a popular t-r-a-d-e (I know you're just waiting to remove my post automod, don't deny it!) subreddit's D-i-s-c-o-r-d. You can also ask for price checks there. Higher end items like BE / B25 / QE / Q25 / AAE / AA25 weapons, ass/uny/van + sent/cav armors, etc, are trade only.
---
Thank you, hero - I couldn't find where to craft that! .... It's frog time!
---
I'm level 260 something and rocking 2 level 40 weapons. Still kicking butt with em. Only thing I really notice is the durability is not as good as max level stuff. 
---
Don't know that I would go down as low as 25 but, for sure, level isn't everything.
---
that would make sense but when i went to check my machine, there was 0 45. rounds left.
---
I met a guy just this morning who had about a dozen of every serum for sale at 230 each. It was a good opportunity to get rid of the herbivore I accidentally got.
---
Lol it happens man it takes me a while to find them every time.
---
All backpack stuff is toon bound.  Dropping it results in the destruction of the item.
---
Oh good, that's what I priced mine at too. Had a few leftover from super duper, they sold like candy. May need to make some more, great sellers.
---
Do you need to be grouped up with the person or just revive anyone?
---
wait after patch 9 durability no longer affects melee weapons damage, is that only for under 100% or does over repairing no longer boost damage?
---
There are requirements that you can't fulfill. Like the Chef challenge requires smores. Anyone have the recipe for that? Probably drops during the scary stories event. The medic challenge requires stimpak doozie or something like that, that probably also drops later.
---
For two half walls, you have to attach the top one to something first, then you can place the bottom one. To remove them, remove the bottom one first.
---
To remove the floor piece attached to a stair, you need to build a 2nd stair, attach it to the existing piece, and most inportantly, after removing the original stairs, and the floating floor piece, **remove all them in the exact, opposite order** of how you placed them.
---
No its the looking for group button in the party tab of the guide.
---
&gt; vendung
---
I have yet to see a player vending that sells only raw fertilizer, which is surprising given how much bedshitters are there in this sub.
---
Good job, happy you fixed the .50 cal decimal misplacement.
---
I remember the bonus for over repair could be listed like a glitch to be solved in the Bethesda's list for bugs and issues. I think the "nerf" was expected since a few updates back.
---
The not very smart statement is true
---
Was googling this  - where can you find the plan to craft this?
---
Yeah and that's one of my gripes.  Everyone isn't rolling in caps, so you could easily go broke just traveling around the map browsing Vendors.  Should be a low nominal fee for visiting any vendor, anywhere.
---
Of course that an online game's way to keep you grinding to replace those caps.
---
I have installed an Inaccessible switch that will allow me to shut down the vending machines as needed while I transfer or spend Caps.
---
For now I would say to make sure no single Item has the potential to exceed your cap limit, as that behavior is typical of the game mechanics, and not likely to be changed.
---
I have a dedicated Plan Vendor Character, and I built 4 vending machines and started stocking them last night, players began showing up immediately, and were accessing them as quickly as I got them loaded. I started at around 12K but was nearing the 25k limit by the time I finished stocking the 4th vending machine, so I quickly transferred as many caps as I could to another Character (I use2 Xboxes) but was filling back up quickly.
---
I ended up having to shut down my vending machines and switched to my Aid Vendor Character, She will be opening up for business this evening with around 20k cap space, and I expect it to fill quickly.
---
I think another thing to consider is how these quests integrate into a playthrough through the main story rather than as endgame content. I can imagine these quests being something you do alongside the main quest as a side distraction that has a valuable reward at the end. For many of us who've finished the game, it feels like more busy work, but it's definitely something that helps pad out the game's lack of side quests and Toxic Valley content.
---
Im glad I read this so I know what to expect. Looks like ill have to put the legendary grind on the shelf for a few days.
---
But if you already have high str then you can use the shotgun cards to boost the damage
---
I would suggest archery running one and swimming
---
I have 1 of my 3 locked. It's the only in my camp that is locked. I don't even lock my lead extractor üòÅ I enjoy having visitors and like to think my camp is a helpful stop for people passing by.
---
Where is that event you mentioned? Let's go there?
---
Thanks for the tip! Now, am I dumb or is there not a way to see how much scrip  you have without going to the machine? I can't find it on my pipboy anywhere.
---
Oh yeah thanks for reminding me! I had already gone there a little earlier but I think you had to be level 25 to start the quest line but I forgot to once I hit the level. Sounds so useful though thanks for the tip!
---
I see the legendary scrip under stats, but don‚Äôt see any amount after I sold many legendary 1* and 2** items. Did I miss something??
---
Cap limit is a good thing. Imagine no limit. The prices would soar to insane pricing within a day or two. No thank you.
---
I just got disconnected. Coming back.
---
Maximum build height is 4 stairs
---
Not everything is for everybody. 
---
Some are for groups, some for solo. Some for high level, some for low.
---
That's happened to me as well, on multiple occasions. I don't usually trade with anyone but my friends so it's really been more of a frustrating experience where my friend says, "why'd you put that up for trade?" Damn it I meant to put up this other thing.
---
Considering the effort I put into it yeah, being able to provide a service to shortcut my friends and paying customers to get stronger gear is kinda the point of buying the plans and recipes in the game!
---
You sooner or later get to a point where you have pretty much everything and don‚Äôt have a means for caps. With vending out now, that might change.
---
Yeah, I didn't even think of that but how would they calculate you having .68 of a cap?
---
All good
---
Especially if you could add both talons and bleed dmg, the sledgehammer wildly outperforms most melees
---
&gt; what this game was supposed to be like.
---
Playable?
---
I'm seeing the same number of server disconnects before and after Patch 9.  Two days ago, disconnected just after finishing a complete workshop buildup - lost everything on restart.  This morning, disconnected just after finishing a complete workshop buildup - lost everything on restart.  In addition, noticed that my best weapon lost 50 damage points and 50 units in range.  :(
---
It is a nice cosmetic change, but "best part of this patch" is a bit of an overstatement.
---
My question is that if you place two machines, can a person buy what you loaded up on the first one.
---
it's just a guess
---
You dont do sarcasm well?
---
Kills Communists.... by selling things. Because a real American is an entrepreneur!
---
Farming enough legendaries to hit the daily limit (or the 1000 scrip limit) is going to be harder than farming for caps, or at least it will be once people burn through their reserve supplies.
---
Of course, some players have reserves that'll last them until the real apocalypse.
---
Apparently there's some new lore notes etc. too!
---
It could not have been 4 stairs. It felt like a lot more than that.
---
Not everyone cares to learn what could be considered trivia. I do...I love picking up basic facts and trivia. Now I know that there is an unofficial position in the NHL for brawling called an Enforcer.
---
A friend and I did it last night and it took longer than five minutes. I died twice without being able to call for help. Then I was in water too deep. Then we were out of local enemies so we had to wander around until we finally found a Ghoul to kill me. It was good fun but not a five minute affair, at least for us. It went a bit faster when we switched roles but not a lot. 
---
FYI either remove your armor or rad-up to save repairing it when you‚Äôll be the victim.
---
Go to the vendor look where your caps normally would be
---
Are you sure? I have a chameleon bos chest piece. The one where sometimes you go invisible if you are hit and I always wear PA and Iv gone invisible a few times randomly in battle.
---
I do.  Played it a lot. Like I said I think it fractured the community and will hurt the longevity of the game.
---
Can you doe of starvation?
---
means that what she sells will be not that expensive  
---
so good news
---
That counts as the most amazing tree-house my parents never got me.
---
still accepting invites?
---
If you just think of some challenges as group challenges--
---
Then you are asking them to remove all group challenges. That's not cool, group challenges are ok to exist.
---
I play alone also but I don't expect to get group challenges without getting out of my shack and grouping up.
---
3 chr is enough for me, a grumpy loner I am
---
Good call, also a weird decision.
---
I had trouble finding the brotherhood vendor. He's in the spa now and has replaced one of the 2 assualtrons in there behind the counter.
---
The one left is by far the easiest if that‚Äôs any consolation üòÄ
---
Your going to get timed out this isn't bdo
---
This is beginning to sound like a cult doing a mass suicide . Too bad they removed the punch bowls
---
Scripts appear where caps usually do at vendors in lower right corner of their box... 
---
It resets like vendors every 20 hours.
---
Yeah i'm not sure.
---
As i said if it is legendary, alien blaster or something rare? Ofc i buy low lvl item too. But would you be happy that you lost 200 caps for fast travel just to find frag grenades, min. Lvl weapons without legendary perks?  Also get stuck in foundations.
---
Do they have to be on your team for it to count?
---
Sorry but this is a game.  If you want realism go walk out your front door it‚Äôs kinda the new cool thing lol
---
Did you see my "fix" above. I think I found what might be causing the issue.
---
At least read the fucking patch notes
---
Crossbows aren't as good as I hoped they'd be.
---
For some reason with all the effects and perks on the calculator for my BE minigun it doesn't actually show the full amount of damage I'm getting. Seems like everything is ticked that would make a difference on damage but it doesn't match ü§î
---
Yea that‚Äôs my thought as well. I locked mine at first but then I thought... why do I care!? Lol
---
Same, actually. Where do you go for the quizzes? I did the goo clean up and bug thing but from there I‚Äôm like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è???
---
(Sorry to respond to a question with a question.)
---
No one is making you server hop. Don't like loading screens, stop fast traveling and stop server hopping.
---
They did that so people can't spam craft one star machetes for the script exchanger
---
I get that. When raids come out i probably wont be participating. I made peace with that when i chose to buy the game.
---
This is not a raid. Its a side quest.
---
Appreciate the help but why does this not work?
---
What do you mean?  Its just math.  I know lorewise it doesn't make much sense but the game can just store it as a floating point number.  Caps aren't a physical item in game.
---
Yeah I tried to rearrange my camp setup post patch to fit in the new personal terminal, and now I can't recreate my favorite camp setup. All because it won't let me place an upper corner wall piece for a slanted roof.
---
In your challenges menu, if you scroll down to WORLD challenges there are some in there that are tadpole scout badge challenges. You‚Äôll need to complete three of those to complete the quest. The easiest seem to be (based off of anecdotal evidence) athletics, hunting, and swimming (if you can find a buddy to do the revive in the water thing).
---
Yeah bro, ruined ALL auto-melee weapons entirely as over-repairing was the only way to "fix" their damage.
---
Rubber band in camera mode. This ain‚Äôt my first AFK
---
I‚Äôve been having the same problem with melee. Won‚Äôt let me use vats with it.
---
I missed that in the notes, thanks! I was trying to figure out how much scrip a four star legendary is worth to the vendor.
---
Look for low level players and follow them around, they will need all the help they can get XD
---
Yep.
---
Alright cool. Thanks for the heads up. You remember off hand which body of water you used?
---
1. Pull up map
---
2. Right on D pad to pull up challenges
---
3. Scroll down to world on left. 
---
4. Scroll down on right side till you see tadpole tests challenges. 
---
You compete those to get badges to complete quests.
---
I was wondering where all the stuff was to buy at the vending machines!!! Glad that scrip won‚Äôt go to waste in the near future.
---
Near the main robot there‚Äôs a building with pc‚Äôs in it, you take quizzes on there. 5 questions each for tadpole.
---
Samesies
---
I do the same. Only reason I use my PW is to get diluted stims and I use super duper and that other perk that lets you craft extra chems. I have a cliffside camp no house just open that barely has soil but where there‚Äôs soil there‚Äôs crops all over the place, anyone is welcome to use anything i have. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt build a house. It‚Äôs hard out there for a pimp lol
---
Yeah thanks Bethesda now my VATS don't work anymore! I get killed by the stupidest shit because I simply can't hurt them back for some reason
---
okay so in order to finish the scout quest you need to complete some special challenges, you can find what you need ot do in the challenges tab and go to world challenges and you should see them. you need to complete three of them
---
My water is to share with everyone. You can't steal what's already yours. Help yourselves!
---
Weird. I noticed my vats accuracy with a gun seemed unusually low too. I don't know what's going on.
---
No, OP doesn't do sarcasm well. If this was sarcasm, it was conveyed in a shitty way.
---
They are in Challenges under World Challenges. You might have to scroll down.
---
Honestly they should make these increase you damage by like 50% or something because they are so hard to get but they are basically useless
---
I did the same, upper floors and the metal pillars work great
---
I will admit I am finding the Pioneer Scouts to be an amazing content addition. Between that and this week's challenges, they really knocked this patch out of the park.
---
Yeah, the current Assault Rifle is just a big chunk of the screen to me.
---
Darn. Well there goes that thought. Thanks for checking in getting back to me though!
---
the all american would be fun
---
Right where you talk to the scout leader, there are computers inside the cabin on his right
---
Haha!
---
At least a few days unless you don‚Äôt have to worry about clocking into a job every day. It‚Äôs the grindiest thing I‚Äôve ever done in a video game.
---
Yeah I know but would it just display as .68 when you go to buy something or would you just not now what that decimal is and just hope you're lucky
---
Not completely. I did it a few times during Fasnacht and stayed alive if I was hidden. Even if so, my vending machines can still receive money if I‚Äôm dead.
---
Of the five I did, I thought they were entertaining.
---
No. You will be at 1 HP
---
And here I thought the exam was PSAT-level easy.
---
It was the odd instance where one bug fixed another. With all auto-melee being trash now they really have to give them an overhaul.
---
This happened to me last night when I hopped servers, all my vending items were removed from the machine but were back in my stash thankfully.  It was a pain putting them back in and re-pricing everything.  They seemed to stay in there after that so it seems like a random bug
---
Fashnact plans I didn't have for 300. Friend found a bloodied handmade for 1400
---
That gun?
---
the plans itself. do you know which vendor sells?
---
I'm working on my second full pie (14 total so far)
---
Yea that‚Äôs why I set them at 500. If no one buys them i don‚Äôt care but what f it if they want it it‚Äôs at no loss to me. My buddy has the recipes so we crack out a bunch every week or so. But I think one of the challenges for the possum scouts is getting serum recipe (if you don‚Äôt have it) and crafting serums. I‚Äôm going to have to find one before they sky rocket up to the vendor price!
---
What is your ingame damage &amp; setup? Did you lower the health setting to enable the Bloodied effect?
---
Floating camps help avoid trash mobs destroying it.
---
Explain yourself, potential evil-doer!
---
That‚Äôs extremely disappointing.
---
Sorry technically on HIS left, your right as you're talking to him.
---
i start to think it's bugged i've looked for guides online and they point you to the "power terminal" but even if you try to interact with that terminal nothing happens
---
Name a Lever Action Rifle the 'Lincoln's Repeater' I might do that myself.
---
Hahahaha this is awesome. Buys some ammo..kevin hart meh meh meh meeeeeh
---
Like this Asian weaver ant

The person you‚Äôre reviving.
---
Both? If they're in water you should have to be in water to revive them
---
it's just missing the sight.
---
Certainly risky. I‚Äôve been doing some promotion, telling people to check out my camp store. You‚Äôd be surprised at how nice people can be on this game. Lots of people have went out of their way to buy a few things from me. 
---
Good luck in your cap farming!
---
It's nice and rustic looking :)
---
NP. 
---
   Going to take you a while to gather all the required mats anyway.  I think I picked up the quest at 32, completed it about 38, but didn't build until 45.
---
Last date to request replacement was May 3rd, it is 4 to 6 months from that. It has been five days so far so relax.
---
Good luck! :)
---
You wouldn‚Äôt happen to be the person who made these AMAZING videos, would you?
---
BE minigun max lvl all three fully leveled heavy gunner perks nerd rage adrenal reaction level three of demo expert bloody mess 3 and I use psychotats when fighting the queen and I accounted for the 30% damage increase of psychotats. I get like 228 or something like that per bullet but it's reading 208.
---
It‚Äôs swimming alone, not in the dark. I‚Äôve finished that one
---
Player vending. Stocked my machines with 120 items at low prices. Legendaries, sheepsquatch plans and weapons, and dirt cheap basic plans, serums, etc.
---
I did not know that, thanks for the heads up!
---
No they do not.
---
Neither are cameras.  Made a few extra from pro snap cameras I came across to try and help people not having luck with the tourist body.   Scratch that idea
---
That seems like a nice easy fix
---
Yep. If you can do the same for me. IGN the same as here
---
Might have something to do with the fact they finally let us repair Grongak Axe beyond 100% caused it :/
---
If its all weapons it will most likely get patched
---
I totally agree with this. I had friends I used to play with but they all left the game for whatever reasons.. Which not only left me with a crap ton of charisma perks to reshuffle but now quests like these I am not sure when I'm going to be able to complete it.
---
Like who not only does in the water... But will be visible for me to find them
---
Use the intercom-looking box to start the test. Do what the voice says. For archery, hit the bullseyes. For swimming, touch all the bouys. I found both easy. 
---
I'm not sure what you're asking. Where are you stuck?
---
I‚Äôll use 5mm just to pull out my 2 shot GG and just mow for fun. But I‚Äôm not buying that shit. 5.56 on the other hand.....
---
Except for milking the Brahmin because sometimes it shows you can milk them but it doesn‚Äô do anything. I was trying to wrap that one up as my third last night.
---
i can help you, if you help me with that quest too lol
---
Ahh manipulate the low levs smart but the issue will still stand for other ammos
---
Start the archery test, at the scamp camp to the right of the scout leader. Hit the bulls eyes.
---
Swimming at spruce knob lake, must have a swim suit on. Hit the speaker by the Dock, swim to the bouies (spelling?)
---
Sweet, I added you, ign is frogow
---
*puts away ushanka hat and handmade rifle*
---
what are the requirements for swimming?
---
The real problem is that we need to be able to scap useless ammo for lead and gunpowder.
---
Lol same with a recipe for s'mores, guess we may earn these through daily or new event?
---
Joining you now
---
you go into build mode and it's one of the options when you try to edit the purifier / door / extractor - couldn't tell you which button it is, I just look at the bottom of the screen and it appears as an option. I guess even a basic tier lock is enough because anyone picking the lock will get Wanted status, so you'll know someone's been naughty.
---
Some guy is already helping me, I'll help you though
---
I dont know where to find the intercom üòÇ
---
huh ok
---
I agree. It‚Äôs not just something I‚Äôm gonna look forward to doing after 8 hrs of real work lol. Someone just pointed out that these packs aren‚Äôt tradable so no it just feels forced. I may just finish tad pool and get the basic pack and be done with it.
---
Where‚Äôs the archery test locators. Not the knowledge quiz the actual test.?
---
Not in front of my Xbox right now but I think that's everything. Also took into account the 20% health in the calculator.
---
that would be awesome
---
I really didn't find the quizzes that hard lol. 3 times at most to finish them. First try for the most of them
---
If you think you can do better with a rifle go with what works for you.
---
I tried a lever action first and it was just a pointless waste of ammo.
---
At least with the shotgun I can cripple the SBs and force them to land.
---
I... will admit to taking everything I can when I find unlocked extractors and purifiers. if it ain't locked... it's mine. If it is locked.. even with a Lvl 0 lock... I don't touch it.
---
I'm going to try it quick.
---
In my opinion, archer, mammalogist and swimmer are the easiest.
---
Unique weapons in Fallout 3 and New Vegas were great, there was a real reason to work for them unlike the 'uniques' in Fallout 76 and 4. A unique should be u n i q u e in both design and properties.
---
Nice
---
While those are very good points and I agree wholeheartedly that weapon balancing is all over the place; This patch made me feel like they do have the ability and the drive to turn this into something maybe even better than what everyone expected at launch.
---
*\*green pistol, green pistol, grey pistol, bomb, green rifle, bomb, green shotgun, grey pistol, bomb, bomb, bomb\**
---
Geez! Wtf!? Lol. That‚Äôs like the buy of the day in all of the wasteland! I get a lot of people don‚Äôt know/ care what they have but a tse testla? How could you not know that that thing is a gem!? Good buy!
---
Pc
---
Whats your ign?
---
i,ve had one, and that was fallout 4, wondered if it was a possibilty in 76, seems like it is.
---
cheers.
---
Play date where she tells you to go pick flowers... you get all 5 in the circled area and you return and nothing happens... she keeps looking for ‚ÄúLeslie‚Äù 
---
Not sure how to trigger anything else...
---
  Wasn't the movie Red Dawn about a bunch of high schoolers saving the world from Communist/nuclear attack?
---
Then there's War Games....how about a nice game of chess?
---
Same problem here
---
Personally, I'd love to have a Scoped Gauss Rifle that would actually kill something again.
---
Gotta agree with you there. Kinda shit to have a quest that requires a solo player to do something normally reserved for group play. I got lucky and just happened to have a Cryptid event pop up when I got it. Plenty of folks going down there.
---
At least you don't get stuck in the foundations of floating bases... /s
---
Here, I made a list for PC players  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm5zp8/psa\_pc\_suggested\_price\_list\_for\_junk\_ammo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm5zp8/psa_pc_suggested_price_list_for_junk_ammo/)
---
The archery range is on the West side of the scout camp.
---
Did you get yours?
---
sorry buddy you invested a lot of time and love into that
---
ITS SO BEAUTIFUL! MYYY EEEYYYYYEEEESSSS!!!!!!!
---
If they added the Lincoln's Repeater, it would be best if they made more guns with a u n i q u e feel.
---
Thank  you!
---
Hey don‚Äôt suppose we could help each other again? There‚Äôs another revive an ally challenge in the scouts challenges, except it‚Äôs ‚Äúrevive an ally while standing in water‚Äù.  Interested?
---
Iv been finding mags for like 10 caps each and bobbles for like 30 caps. I bought 3 vendors out on them just to get the trophy for each lol. Iv been finding people are VERY generous on there pricing. Did see one guy selling serums for 15k a piece. Guy told me over headset ‚Äú I haven‚Äôt been able to sell any what am I doing wrong‚Äù your price for starters. If I make a serum or is given one by one of my party members I‚Äôll sell it for 5k. I don‚Äôt need it, it‚Äôs a waste of space and someone can actually use it. Stop by my camp anytime anyone, my 3* are cheap. Like under 1k cheap, like I said I don‚Äôt need it, someone else can get a use out of it. Why jack the price up so NOONE will buy it and it‚Äôs sitting there not being used
---
I had no idea people hated floating camps so much! I did mine like that cause i thought it was smart amd as a newbie saw a lot of people do it. I have to say tho, not everyone is am architect/engineer or cares that your aesthetics are ruined.
---
Yeah it definitely worked if you wanna try again till I don't fully die that's fine
---
The when you repair to 200 percent damage you get damage increase was a bug anyway. Bethesda said so. They just fixed the bug
---
And the swimming intercom?
---
ah, that's what my problem with swimming was. How the heck do you revive someone in water???
---
I was hoping they would introduce bulk ammo, in crafting and ammo machines but it doesn't look like that's going to happen anytime soon.
---
If I‚Äôm PS4, you can use L1 or R1 to fast scroll a couple of thousand at a time.
---
Nope I'm advoiding it since you have to solve anime code
---
xXTrip\_HazardXx
---
Want to get my 2 caps in on this too.
---
I got this done last night, as a solo player, but only because I was hanging out in the scout camp when a guy came in asking if anyone needed a slave and would pay him to do stuff.  I had him die for me so I could revive him, and paid him 500 caps for his time.  Tried to get the "revive an ally in water"; he was knee-deep in the lake, but it didn't trigger.  
---
It's that last one, the "revive an ally in water" that's the real beast.  Hitting events like the scorchbeast queen, free range, or especially the Encryptid fight will give solo players a shot at reviving other players, but "revive a player in water" for the Swimming badge is ridiculous.  If you play with friends, it's probably not a big deal, for solo players?  Hell. 
---
And that's the issue; it's not \*difficult\*.  It's either dead simple, or involves awkward arrangements with strangers to jump through a pointless hoop.  Taking photos of all the bugs for Entomologist; fine.  Making a frog habitat; cool beans.  Cooking a bunch of stuff I assume I have to buy recipes for; totally okay.  Asking another player I don't know to die in water \*just\* so I can revive them?  Pointless and annoying.  It's an awkward ask to begin with.
---
If there were NPCs we could find on the map to trigger these two components, it would be different.  But we currently don't.  Say, any of those robots we have to "repair" mid-event or mid-quest; that could count as "reviving an ally".  Have one take place in water for the Swimming badge.  Or just eliminate that requirement, or institute a system where badges are a "complete 8 of these 9 requirements" thing.
---
Much like the Assault Rifle, I know what you mean. The new Gauss rifle just looks like a box that likes to take up a whole quarter of the screen.
---
Fair enough. Yeah, finding the intercoms is the hardest part. 
---
For swimming, go to Spruce Knob Lake. From the spawn point, walk around the lake to get to the broken dock. The intercom is on the dock. You may want to kill the mirelurk queen in the lake before you start (if you want it to be really easy). 
---
For archery, it's on the west-side of the scout camp. 
---
Good luck.
---
Nope, he's been around for a while. But the fun bit is that he sets up in random spots. I've seen him in both the mire and the forest, but I presume he can be found just about anywhere based on rng.
---
Couldn't agree more. I had to delete some decorations to put the vendors :(
---
Gotta find the body again
---
Im ps4 im going to use this as well. I pretty much already do for some, others i will certainly change. 
---
Thank you for this.
---
Not for the regular revive an ally part of the quest. Not sure about the one for the swimming badge, which requires you to revive someone in water, but probably not as well.
---
Get off my lawn!
---
The Anti-Material Rifle would be the best (Range should be at least 300).
---
I would also like to have the Elite Riot Gear, along with the perks it adds.
---
But the one I would most like to see added is the Mesmetron, after shooting another Player in PVP, you could add a Slave collar to them and send them to a location on the Map for 1 hour, if they didn't get there in 5 minutes, or left before the hour was up... Bye Bye Head!!!
---
Find one out in the wild. Bootleggers Camp in the Bog has one. Repair to 100% then shoot it a few times. Repairing it at 99% still counts as repairing it. Then for the third time you can over repair if you like. 
---
Also, don‚Äôt forget to remove gunsmith.
---
Not all players use reddit so they have no idea of current asking prices or even if it‚Äôs a meta item . I bought an ass/sent arm from white springs 2 weeks ago for 500 caps
---
I will also volunteer to trade dying on Xbox!
---
Dang so much for hoping someone else could stick a mod on my pack
---
Also the other pools have a good bag of coins, normally around 50
---
Yeah, that is nice but you skip past what you want. It would just be simpler to type in an amount. And on PC it is pretty slow
---
Thanks! +karma
---
Backpacks can't be traded/dropped/vendored.  For a moment I was thinking I should pass some on to my alts but nope.
---
Whaaaaat?  That's lame.
---
Dudes, Imposter Sheepsquatch is calling. He‚Äôs got a duck pond and a fondness for killing randos there.
---
You‚Äôre welcome :-)
---
recognize the name   . ps4 ?  I,m along the way at the next pond,also since dec.
---
no issues as yet.
---
Other people have jumped off a cliff in the Mire
---
Drink up, Johnnie. I honestly don't remember the last time I collected water from my purifier - get too much from in rewards from random side quests; last I looked I was carrying 128 in my inventory. Anyone who wants it is free to have it. Heck, I've only harvested from my garden to *repair* my garden the past two weeks. Everything in my camp except for the lead extractor is unlocked, and I'm thinking of unlocking that as well.
---
This loot table, does it say any event in the mire or just the boomer quest?  Or just specific events?
---
Okay letd go there
---
*waves barbed walking cane*
---
Love this. Glad to see you‚Äôre updating it more and more.
---
Would love to see the cryolator on here eventually. Particularly because the crystallizing barrel adds ballistic damage in addition to the energy. Approx twice as much, maybe a tiny bit more if I recall.
---
Lol, if you're on PC most people I know would agree to dying for you, though I understand your point. Try branching out if you've got a mic. I've met tons of great new friends on this game since all mine have quit, too. 
---
Have fun in Appalachia!
---
This was a very disappointing update for me atleast. The challenges are awful fetch/kill tasks that are way too time consuming. I was really hoping for an actual questline this time around.
---
Now I want Travel Agent to be a three level perk to give 90% off travel cost.  That 10% vault Tec cut is nothing compared to the fast travel cut.
---
Must of been a tough bug to sort out.
---
So ingame you see 208 but the calculator gives almost 228? Nerd rage level 1 gives me almost 209.
---
Prior to Patch 9, they could.  Lost half my caps this past weekend to a Lvl 189 who just dropped by to add to the attack crew just as the Defend Event started.  Hasn't happened after Patch 9 but I'm betting that's a "Yet."
---
Oh, I hadn't even thought about nukes used as griefing tools in the new patch world. Now that you can see camps, and clusters of camps, nukes may be the new way to level camps just for lols. Damn....
---
I could be wrong but, I thought it‚Äôs available to everyone right away. The thing that might be throwing you off is, it‚Äôs called the fertilizer producer. While in ‚Äúbuild mode‚Äù at your camp head over to the resources tab and it should be there. I‚Äôm at work now , otherwise I would post a picture. What platform are you on, I can come build one for you.
---
Same thing happening to me
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/034/yeahsciencebitch.PNG
---
For real? I got a really good 3 star sledgehammer roll a while back and picked up all the mods you can get at vendors but I swear it still did less damage than my All Rise. Maybe I need to revisit it.
---
I‚Äôve had radaway diluted at 9c, radex diluted 9c, disease cure at 12c
---
I‚Äôve also kept the armor about 20 caps less than what the listed value is. So for example, a Weightless 3 star chest that listed at 485 caps sold for 450 caps.
---
Yes.  Three times last night.
---
Don't have to be under water, just in water. My friend killed herself in a puddle and I got both updates for resuscitation.
---
anime code?
---
And here I sold 20K of it in 2 sales heh.
---
Yea same, I don‚Äôt have any laser weapons just 1 testla that I rarely use. So I usually drop them in a suitcase or something. Also I‚Äôve put a few things for free on my machine (like mutton pie!) and people generally just take 1. I don‚Äôt think any body got greedy and took the lot to my surprise.
---
You get the smores recipe from the Terrors of the Night event at Camp Adam üòÄ
---
I dunno anything about it being a trick or an exploit. I tried to use poles to make my old base look less like shit but they wouldn't connect end on end, so it was just floating about 10 feet over some water instead of being a nice stilt house.
---
doesnt seem like you need to find the body, i found 2 broken cameras in random containers yesterday(not the junk version, the actual ones to repair)
---
Looks like it doesn't work.
---
I'd think the mesmetron would be best for Scorched or Super Mutants, to try and speak to them, those are my thoughts though.
---
Elite Riot Gear would make a great outfit.
---
But for perks, it would be sweet to have it as armor if possible. Knowing Bethesda it would more than likely be an outfit.
---
Though I have complained that they can be tedious, I agree. It‚Äôs nice to have a dlc that takes longer than a few hours to complete. Honestly, it‚Äôs just such a shift from previous challenges/quests that it threw me, but I think after awhile it will feel like an actual accomplishment to get these badges.
---
We did it!
---
Holy shit. I rember when you didn't have to wait 10 minutes to die.
---
Duuude! I saw the plans but missed the paint. My man!
---
Athletics Exam: Lincoln likes wrestling.
---
Haha, asking for a friend. Classic.
---
Most kind.  As most of us do I guess.  I read so many stories about people losing their camps for one reason or another and it makes you wonder how someone can get so emotionally attached to a spot in a game and then it finally happens to you and you realize it's about alot more than just the time and effort you put in.
---
I believe they implemented a separate lighting budget in addition to the separate turret budget.
---
Hence you can only have X lights and Y turrets regardless of overall budget.  The benefit to the players is that the individual budget cost of lights and turrets was reduced.
---
There should be somewhere in the Camp Build GUI indicating x/8 turrets or something equivalent for lights.
---
I initially had the same problem. We died five or six times before we got it right.   
---
Our solution was to get killed by one and only one beast. If there's two enemies there, there's too much risk of the second enemy hitting you before your ally can revive. The gulper lagoon is a great spot to use. Have the soon-to-be-deceased kill all-but-one gulper, and let the last one down you. Make sure you die in the water. It worked for us.
---
I wouldn't mind being able to store a percentage of caps for  PVP or purchasing. I feel like Whitespring could be a good location.
---
Yes, but you‚Äôd have to be at his house to see his map, so you‚Äôd already know.
---
I dont remember if it was fallout 3 or not, but in either that or NV, I recall a fraction cap system. If I sold 2 of the burned books, it would be 1 cap, 3 books though was caps (as an example). I know it took longer to sell things to vendors because I didn't want to give them "free" loot, but I do recall this being a thing.
---
You can find them next to where the breastplate stretcher spawns.  Near Snipe‚Äôs BBQ, hunt around and you‚Äôll find it.
---
There's no such phrase as "must of."  It's either "must have" or "must've" if you want to use the contraction.
---
yeah it worked the second time, the first didnt register, you might of been counted as on a rock
---
Weird opinion, but I think fast travel fees should go to the camp owner. I'd be more inclined to use bases close to where I want to go if it means giving someone else the extra small amount of caps, even if it costs 5-10 more.
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound to bad for a Gatling gun to just play with when I get a lot of 5mm. I might need to do that when I get off work
---
There‚Äôs some of that inevitable of course. I‚Äôd do the same if something is severely under.
---
If you have friends that you play with, and set up a party, each goes to a different spawn location, and then all server hop joining on the first, my group has been able to find it quickly like that several times, most often at the Wacky Willard's Water Park, in the Parking Lot.
---
No way... this is in xbox itself? Only had mine for 3 years, LMAO.... things you learn.
---
make friends?...
---
Ok that‚Äôs better but that was too high lol
---
I mean the whole premise of the game is "Rebuilding America Together" not alone. I personally feel by making all the game soloable, they lost many opportunities and the game will never reach its full potential.
---
I remember very well as we spent so much time there! Toxic Lake I think it‚Äôs called, just south east of Wavy Willard water park. Watch out for the Mirelurk Queen.
---
Nice catch!
---
Theres a ghoul and a pond at the pylon site, lets go there
---
Rad. Rad battles.
---
Ok
---
im lvl 320 and find a sentinel or cavalier piece at least once a week..never found a god roll but pretty close to it
---
havn't got his far yet,and also play solo. Is this part of quest manditory, or can it be avoided by choosing a different path. ?
---
Thats the irony, because thats exactly what myself and my friend did initially. We took it slow, dressed up as a tadpole and enjoyed it.
---
Then came time for tests, and we both got 4/5 fives over and over and over and over again for a solid hour of wasted time. That is **with** googling after the first few failed attempts.
---
The problem I truly have with this test is that these questions are so heavily tied to America's real life situations that people from other countries either have to google, or suck it up.
---
The game, its world and lore should give us the answers to these questions, but they dont.
---
Any game absolutely fails at testing its players when the players are forced to rely on external sources in order to complete it.
---
People throughout this thread may find it humerous that neither of us assumed the Charleston marathon was 26 miles, but in the countries we both live in, which is two different, we have marathons of varying lengths, at least its the literal word used.
---
How are we to know that America only has **one** sized marathon, and not multiple like our real world locations do.
---
PC
---
Yep, pets can get murdered, and now that your camp shines like a beacon in the night, folks may just lure baddies to it. I came back from Tadpole stuff last night to find a jackass crouched on my roof as four level 68 supermutants were tearing my camp to the ground. Killed what will likely be my last pet and took out all the walls. Jackhole logged off as soon as I showed up so I never got a chance to ask if it was deliberate or not; after rebuilding I put up the first turrets I've had since I was level 25.
---
My takeaway from this is that Bethesda needs to create a wider space between "down but reviveable" and "INSTAGIB MFER"
---
Not only does it make these tadpole challenges super irritating but also makes revenant basically useless in any relevant contexts, like the SBQ fight or the encryptid event.
---
This is the best idea I have seen
---
Quality of Life changes are things like usability features that make the game less frictive - like removing building restrictions tied to placing foundations.  The kinds of things that make sense to designers but that make it harder for players to play the game they want to.  It can also be things like re-arranging the UI to make it more streamlined or simpler to use.
---
I own reptiles of my own so I know what you mean, luckily it‚Äôs not a real frog so I‚Äôm not too bothered by it
---
OR... There's an Iron Giant -style Liberty Zero Prototype in one of the caved-in sections of the Enclave bunker. Makes sense to me.
---
I can help GT BigBangTheory73
---
Oh I thought you were talking about a item in your camp
---
That's where you get the sky hook to right?
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
The lemonade stand arrived with Biv.
---
I mean, are you still going to poo in my base when I have 2 portapotties outside that are clean?
---
Thanks for that
---
I also fast traveled to a CAMP, as it was rendering, I got stuck in a floor that pushed me down through a rock and I ended up falling through and dieing.
---
I‚Äôve had some good luck with the legendary drops too. Did the sheepsquatch event last night and got two 3* legendaries, one from a legendary sting wing and one from sheepsquatch. They weren‚Äôt great, but it was back to back 3* which was nice
---
Yep my mire is no go either. And damn Iv noticed that with FCs. I‚Äôm burning through them. Even with all perks attached it‚Äôs still unnecessarily fast on draining
---
You can have a brahmin as a pet in addition to one from the brahmin pen. I had that for a while; it was before the milking nerf too so I had so much useless spoiled milk...
---
It fills up so fast honestly I probably won't even notice.
---
On PS4 and having same issue.  Gave up for today. Will see if tomorrow is better

 Possum: Electrician: Take a camera picture of a generator ---- take a picture of a fusion generator in the world; the ones you loot fusion cores from.

Fixed

There‚Äôs also: 
---
X-01 Ultracite Bracers
---
Bought it and only bracers show up, could be a typo
---
Holy shit I wish I would of saw that axe! Damnit! I haven‚Äôt found any gems like that yet but I‚Äôm holding my breath.   I‚Äôm have that same Tesla in my machine for 1k hoping that someone will stumble on that pvps or something.
---
make rippers and chainsaw useless again aswell.
---
craft one without perks and shoot it a lot?
---
Added. Let me know if you find the ingame number for the ballistic damage change.
---
The inspect item glitch has returned.
---
The new nighttime event at camp Adams
---
Oh no people aren't invulnerable anymore. The horror!
---
Cool..last night I was looking under 'misc' lolol
---
What platform you on!
---
Ok joining in world give me 5 minutes are we will start
---
I got it on my first try, and I answered swimming in the dark
---
No other way around. Plus or minus a few points of damage from 228 in game but in the calculator I see only 208
---
What bunker
---
WE STILL LOVE YOU BETHESDA!!!
---
move your camp thingy, or just rotate it. you spawn a set distance from the thing so even rotating it adjusts where you spawn
---
Yeah I noticed a guy slowly rising out of my floor. That was weird.
---
From the patch notes: 
---
&gt;Power it to advertise your C.A.M.P. to other players on the Map. Players can also Fast Travel to C.A.M.P.s that offer vending and appear on the Map.
---
Seems this is how they intended it to work, that only if the machine is powered will others be able to see you CAMP on the map and fast travel to it
---
I'm going 1/2 the "value" listed on stuff (cheaper for ammo and what not).  Not sure if its high or low but its still cheaper then getting it from a vendor even with perks.
---
The answer is simple.  Remove dropping junk and remove cap rewards in adventure unless you are "wanted".  If there is no benefit to griefing there will cease to be as much griefing.  Sure, some people are just born jerks but the game shouldn't have in place a system that rewards them for bad behavior.
---
I‚Äôm not saying they aren‚Äôt dicks. But if you want to be a dick and role play as a raider that just part of being a raider anyway. I don‚Äôt travel with any scrap and don‚Äôt play survival so dying isn‚Äôt really a big deal to me but can see it being annoying to others.
---
Thats a shame. Looks like this sub will be filled with lfg requests for some time then.
---
Forgot to mention it's got a tri-barrel attachment on it
---
It is kinda dumb. I literally play with no friends. Life prevents me from playing long enough each bout to even make friends. So this is basically just a quest telling me i cant have this backpack because i dont have friends.
---
Why not count the robot or npc repairs as a revival? Wouldve made things at least possible for a solo player. 
---
Considering fallout had been a solo game for over a decade before 76 came out i dont think its too much to ask to have a solo friendly way to complete the quest. Dont even care if it was super hard to do just make it possible at least.
---
The problem there is that I assumed America used the word marathon in the same context as my real world location do. That was the biggest mistake.
---
I get it now, americans only ever use the word "marathon" for the 26 miles, would've been nice if the game told me that earlier though.
---
You know if you find `&lt;&gt;` `{}` or `[]` around random characters in the terminal it will remove duds and reset tries right?
---
can you craft them?
---
Especially if you're level 200 or so.
---
"When did all the spawns get so hard!?"
---
I thought it said SHOOT a Yao Guai with a syringer, not KILL. That's what I did anyway. I shot it once with the syringer. Then I switched to my gun and killed it with a teammate. There were a couple of others around that we had to kill as well.
---
I did that a few times last night.
---
Ah okay I should def use a switch in the future then!
---
Welcome to /r/emodeathbang
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
if you dive into the geck it's all kept as separate ids, and with the way beth holds their servers they can hardly keep track of the thousands of items on at the moment. Have you fast travelled to someones camp and had it slowly load around you, only to find yourself trapped below or falling to your death ? The engine tools they use just arent really built for such a large scale multiplayer game, and their servers cant handle all the processes in the required time.
---
Pretty sad to think theres only a max of 24 people on a server at one time really ..
---
Underrated comment
---
Have my water, drink it, sell it, whatever you need, by the time I return it will have more, so it's going to waste otherwise!
---
He likes you ;)
---
Not a bug, it‚Äôs always been that way. It‚Äôs just a matter of two different items just being two different items
---
According to the data, there seems to be a box you need to activate in order to trigger this as complete.  There's also some reference to a "Field Trip" so maybe you need to first start the "Field Trip" in order to get credit for visiting.
---
It's my Dragon VATS critical doing all the work really. Before they patched unlimited critical and no reload it was all one shot.
---
Uh, maybe Grahm just digs the open road ‚Ä¶
---
The original 'Lone Wanderer'
---
Production  vendors in bunker
---
How do we get those possum coins ? Just got the quest done for the 1st packs
---
yep.
---
Unpopular opinion: I'm fine with floating camps. Considering how poorly your base can defend itself from mobs, and the fact that until yesterday any random passerby could destroy your base, plus how wonky camp construction can be at times, I completely understand building for practicality and not aesthetics.
---
Don't you have to finish the tadpole before that event spawns? Or does everyone get it?
---
Cap limits plzzzz
---
I had just killed a bunch of bugs and was carrying their crap when I got the quest, so I had no idea what parts were needed. Only showed me 2 things more that I needed. Next workbench I found I scrapped everything and then did some cooking. Now I needed 5 things. F! They should make it so that it tags the items you collect as quest items until it's over.
---
So there are plans for them somewhere? I guess I never came across any.
---
We just did this. Stay in show water and take off all your clothes.
---
Wood floors... seems I always get trapped...lol
---
They can be done.
---
It should hunt bounties lol
---
I fucking hate this game, do you have any grenades
---
Yea I think each piece is 50% less. So if you had 5 you could jump off the top of that tall elevator that attaches to the monorail!
---
&gt; Most of the updates were succesfull and brought good content. Meanwhile, the game already had good content.
---
hahahahahaha
---
Yes they did. I'm pretty amazed.
---
I know what you mean, Yesterday I came across a god roll AA Explosive Single Action  Revolver for offer at someone else‚Äôs camp, sadly they wanted 15000 for it and I just blew all my caps at his neighbors camp scooping up T-51 armor plans for a fraction of what they cost at standard vendors. 
---
Had to pass it up.
---
If the cost is reasonable it might not be so bad.  100 scrip for a spin at a random 3 star seems ok.  God knows what the actual cost will be.
---
Knowing how it's been it'll be 100 scrip for a random 1-3 star.
---
XBox...
---
I get the premise, and that‚Äôs a fair comment. I‚Äôm glad they made it soloable, if only because it means I can play it. I don‚Äôt play multiplayer games, and would miss out on all the good stuff in fallout 76 if it needed multiplayer. 
---
And now, I have started missing out on good stuff in 76.
---
I just repaired mine 3 times during the kill  enemies section of the same quest.
---
But I didn't know f it was referring o some real would event
---
QoL is Quality of Life, most the time its changes that aren‚Äôt based on balance or stability but make the game easier to play, whether it be a ui update to avoid misclicking, buttons or functions to speed up inventory management. One of the QoL improvements would definitely be the fast travel change as some mobs can aggro stupidly far and make it so you can‚Äôt fast travel at all.
---
Given recent developments it would seem that they are in fact listening so yep, I remain hopeful.
---
Well I'll be damned:
---
https://fo76map.com/?locationIds=1548
---
Definitely colt 1911.
---
wdym? Its completely reasonable to price a Mr. Handy Figurine at 25000 caps.
---
Well that's just showing off üòÇ
---
I have over 100 legendaries. I can only sell 150 scrip worth/day to the exchange machine. I also sell ammo, chems, food, drinks, etc.
---
Be careful how many plans and recipes you obtain. It‚Äôs okay to be strongish but only if you‚Äôre not stronger than other players though.  Because in that case you‚Äôre cheating or bought your gear off eBay.
---
Sometimes you see a deal and can't pass it up. I found a cheap bloodied Fatman. I don't want it but my friend might and if not I'll sell it for a few more caps
---
Yes still need it 
---
Also I am ready
---
Id prefer a larger build area
---
I actually just put it all in and it's showing 227 which is very close to what I get in game. Maybe I had bad connection earlier but it seems to be accurate. My bad
---
Ive spawned underwater at a few camps
---
omg ty
---
Exactly this. If communication is a problem in text  it is also a problem in voice.
---
After you complete the 4 tasks for tadpole, you will go back to where you started and be ranked up. Then you get much harder tasks to earn possum badges.
---
I found one at Tree Top. What platform? I think I still have it. PS4.
---
You are damn hard to kill :)
---
Follow me, I'm gonna go to the pond with mirelurks at whitespring
---
I‚Äôm unsure it does have to be nighttime for it to spawn however
---
Spent like 40K to buy all the X-01 plans last night. But made it back with vending.
---
Ok we have anouther guy with us I will let revive me we are trying to figure it out
---
I just don't know what causes it. It has happened with 4 different toons now.
---
Yet other people seem to be fine and get them normally.
---
Baffles me.
---
Athlete: 90 feet between bases in baseball. The sprint the athlete wouldn‚Äôt train for was the 10,000 yard/meter dash (forget the wording).
---
Where are the fucking bags Bethesda?
---
Can you boost STR with Herd Mentality, booze, etc. and complete the "Athlete" badge?
---
My rifleman only has 2 STR...
---
I‚Äôm willing to bet it ain‚Äôt the same guy. Captainoob is minorly known for his mod work on Fallout 4 and he doesn‚Äôt seem the type to praise himself so effusively. But, yeah, decent content and I‚Äôve learned a few things along the way.
---
He goes over legendary weapon effects in a mostly-consistent, if unscientific, and rather amusing fashion. There are aspects he doesn‚Äôt fully understand but he doesn‚Äôt pretend to be an authority and he doesn‚Äôt needlessly rant... often, anyway.
---
Worth a looksie, in my opinion.
---
I actually just found one. They are all over now!
---
I did it too, got it in adventure mode
---
Hmmm, it‚Äôs possible they have multiple correct answers then. Obviously swimming alone and swimming in the dark are both dangerous
---
Yep. Seems it can be unlocked in either mode. Though I don't think it's intended.
---
Mine's at the top of Seneca Rock, so maybe I'm safe?
---
I just look from the challenges then ?
---
Sure, I can appreciate Bethseda's efforts but I also cannot forget just how much of a disaster FO76 was at released and continued to be for months without any communication or support from Bethesda. Going forward, I expect better from them and they need to do better.
---
I like traveling to the bases and shopping. It seems more Fallout to be dealing with trading post type things.
---
They could pool the vendor bot stuff to a central area though. I hate looking thru vendor bot inventories for weapons and armor that people have sold and I may want, tho with the new legendary scrapper I doubt I will see many legendaries in bot inventories :(
---
I don't need a great legendary, just one that's good enough
---
Relax. It's not meant to be done in a day. We don't have any new content, saved for maybe Arktos, until June.
---
makes sense, events should show up for everybody
---
I just outright hate PvP, I fight mobs and bosses. I'm a trader not a raider!
---
apparently it was because when I died, I was overburdened..
---
This isn't about working hard, this was about an early release date. Blame the publisher who put them in this position, not the people who've put in the hours and labor since then to fix it.
---
I would fund this if it would wholeheartedly chase down roving packs of Liberators.
---
Yeah, I mean I know it is worth a hell of a lot more but eh, it's a yard sell the way I look at it.
---
Im sorry that other real world countries uses words more liberately than america do.
---
It's still the best pvp armor in the game by a West Virginia country mile. Nothing has changed. Power armor is still completely useless in pvp.
---
Mines a floating tree house in front of the Nuka Factory. I love my camp.
---
Looking for finish this quest on ps4. I‚Äôll pay 1k caps to revive you in the water. Psn name sv650y
---
I like it too but sometimes I just want the quick caps lol
---
Yeah there are two repeatable quests, the revive an ally task, then you much do 3 tadpole world challenges. 
---
To see world challenges go into your menu &gt; challenges &gt; world tab and scroll down to tadpole badges
---
all plasma weapons except the gatling plasma got a boost in the last patch, you should deffo come back and try it out
---
I went to Jamboree in 2007.
---
Unfortunately for me, it was in my own country... definitely lucked out there!
---
What an odd concept in an online game...
---
I got the S'mores recipe from the new quests/dailies/repeatables.
---
I've done this in the past and while it works for me, my friends still spawn inside my foundations.
---
Nice. Me and the other fella in this thread got it done down near point pleasant. Same idea though. Got my first backpack out of it though so definitely worth it!
---
Yes, player versus player. That thing that was included in fallout tactics. That thing were we would use this artifact of the ancients called a MODEM to call other computers with that would enable us to fight other players in head to head matches with.
---
Ok thx..I guess I still have zero scripts lol..don't matter they were awful legendaries like nocturnal wood arms
---
aw, man. easy come easy go I guess.
---
You sure?
---
Check new section on this subreddit, people are searching for partners for these challenges.
---
You can see person is selling 30 weapons, but you cant see that all them  are grenades + 2 pistols
---
To tell people still complaining about problems to just stop playing. Especially when the problem is no one else I know is playing. Besides that I like to keep track of the new content. So far it seems pretty terrible and there is still no point in playing the game again imo. When they stop adding new content I will give the complete game another shot. I got suckered into buying the game at launch and refuse to buy another half complete game. This game has changed my buying habits and ruined new releases by Bethesda for me for the forseeable future. If I don't explain why now n then and just do it I'll forget by the time they release a new mess.
---
Well aren't we America's brightest citizens. Those exams should be answered in a heartbeat.
---
And Drills. F
---
I was able to finish them all yesterday in under half a hour, which given how much trouble it caused some of my friends, i'd say it is an accomplishment.
---
Even knew a fair number of the answers either from my previous courses in college or from my time with Scouts.
---
Exactly! I am ok with the quest being super hard to complete. Just make it possible...
---
Hahahah yeah me too. Dude that got me my 3rd badge and the quest done. Got me my first backpack!! But holy shit the possum level challenges are insane!
---
Did it last night in adventure mode.
---
Or throw granade under your legs.
---
I agree! I‚Äôve seen sets of BOS plans go for 25,000 caps... crazy! I farmed mine but bought them to sell in vending machine so people can get them.
---
Its based on a random encounter location. Ive seen him a bit. Bought all the recepies as soon as I found him though
---
Easy now fuzzy little man peach.
---
Ya ever drunk Baileys from a shoe?
---
I feel the same way, I wish some real physics applied and buildings could collapse without support (even if they had support but it was damaged)
---
But I wouldn't avoid buying something well priced that I wanted over it.
---
Are you trying to tell me that I need different gear to combat the other people's gear?
---
 Either way it still feels like I'm playing a crapy arcade game with all the Bells and whistles.
---
 Leader board? No thank you
---
The game dings every time somebody gets killed? no thank you
---
Forced PVP? No thank you
---
 Being able to level up on easy mode and switch to Survival mode? No thank you
---
I find it hilarious it is called survival
---
What's your platforma and username?
---
Wow I'm surprised 1% makes that much difference. Also the amount of dps difference from tri barrel makes me want to change to accelerated. Although I'm not sure how that will change the weapon degradation
---
Agreeable.
---
Who gives a fuck?
---
Weren‚Äôt tse weps removed from the rng?
---
Damn you caught me
---
I didn't know this was actually a problem to some people. With how often they grow/produce water what the heck does it matter? Shit, I've got way more purified water than I'll ever need and constantly am unloading stacks of 50+ waters
---
That is why we are not going to get any real challenging activity like i RAID because people will cry about being impossible to solo it.   
---
It's fun to see people complain about things that requires more people to do in a MMO game. Why not play fallout 4 fot a full solo experience...
---
Same here would love to stop by when you‚Äôre actually online and give you all my caps üëçüèºüëçüèº lol
---
It is. You have to revive a teammate. It has to be "under water" if you want the Swimming badge.
---
Would it work to log in on Survival, attack a player until they are incapacitated, and then revive the player you just tried to kill?
---
I haven't started the new quest line yet, so I'm just throwing spitballs here to see if anything sticks.
---
Im fine with not raiding. Im happy to leave that to organised groups. Ive got too many obligations to organise my time around a game like i once used to.
---
This, however, is a side quest with a very requested item as a reward. By solo and group players.
---
Yes happened to me twice. And I couldn't pick the Legendary item up :(
---
RC
---
That worked thanks!!
---
i thought that too, but apparently not
---
I will soon have first badge, about 10hours grinding.
---
If anyone know where the fuck i can get 5 deathclaw hides tell me. Probably not in the game
---
Yeah this happened to me for some quests but luckily it was never something that I couldn't just do again. However, one time I did have a buddy doing the same quest and he was able to drop an item for me that was no longer available to pick up even though the quest marker thought the item was still there. 
---
Doesn't help you but your not the only one
---
Awesome dude. I'm only 4/6 of the way through my first World Challenge. I have a way to go.
---
I always take the water if im low on it. Iits not like i would steal from them they would missing and even notice. Thanks guys!
---
As if that lvl3 lock is actually gonna stop me
---
To be fair the communist poster makes it seem like Prime is a rip off of theirs.
---
I totally missed this! Thanks for the heads up!!
---
*crickets*
---
Has the budget gone up since December or has that been the only budget increase?
---
Why buy a MMO game in the first place?
---
It's so he can stand down in the ravine and resuscitate players for his scout badge
---
move the grand exchange to the west virgina wastes
---
What this guy said. The range is close to the cliffs on the west side of the Palace of the Winding Path.
---
The revive another player while in water for the swimming badge.
---
How would you ever run into a downed player in water through normal game play.
---
This would be nice to have sooner than later
---
My approach was to join someone at the gulper lagoon in the Mire, have them kill all-but-one gulper, and then let the gulper kill them. The water is shallow enough, and gulpers do the right amount of damage that you're likely to be downed and not straight to dead/respawn. Both of us were in knee-deep water. It worked.
---
I carry a stack of propoganda posters with me wherever I go, especially with this new update and camp hunting. Spread the good news to save the poor americans.
---
I‚Äôm sure there are better locations than the one we used. 
---
I think you want shallow water with low level enemies.
---
Place a second set of stairs first then delete the first set
---
Have you been unable to revive a teammate before? I played few times with my friend and every time we get the same bug. I am unable to revive despite having more than 100 stimpacks in my inventory...
---
Never team up with somebody that won't make mic contact with you first. It's something I painfully learned early on üòí
---
&gt; Im a loyal fallout fan
---
why do you have such low self esteem?
---
IMO, almost no ammo is worth more than 1 cap each and some of your junk prices are too low.  5mm and .50 especially since you craft them in bulk and they are used in mass quantities.  I'd just buy your cheap steel/lead and craft it myself.
---
I think ballistic fiber/springs are easily 10x your listed prices, because they are semi-rare and needed for weapon/armor repair.
---
Collections in stats.
---
Damn. Very good to know
---
Im on PC but there are many trolls out there !!!
---
I like redesigning my camp every so often. I get bored by the same scenery after a while, so I‚Äôm glad they add stuff I need to rethink positions and rooms.
---
I have 10 of the dirt ones 5 free, 5 for me. Help yourself.
---
i just want the backpack, and that's how you get it right?
---
because liking video games means you have low self-esteem, apprently?
---
Well at my house it's jerk then clean my friend.
---
Yea, corrected right out of another build option.  Really would like a free respect, and please the ability to unrank cards.  
---
Eagerly awaiting the folks that do the in-depth damage articles to show how really off these weapon types are now.  Last night it just seemed to not be able to put anything down without a pocket full of shells per mob.  Ended up equipping my rocket sledge and had much more fun.  Hopefully enforcer is still handy for SB's and SBQ.
---
Btw, sorry for the disconnect. I assume it's because I'm in Asia and you are presumably in the US or something. I rarely get disconnects these days.
---
All plans should go for not more than half the cap value
---
I shit on the game a lot at first to my friends etc, but they have really done a good job at coming back. Its not perfect, but i must say i'm enjoying it right now.
---
Yes. Archer, athletic, and swimmer seems to be the fastest meta right now. With another player helping you, by letting you revive them, it can be done in 3 or so hours.
---
And that‚Äôs cool. But, what about other people?  Why should they have that taken away from them  just because you hate it?  You can comprehend that if there are people that hate pvp, and there are people that only want pvp, there has to be a segment of the population that doesn‚Äôt actively seek out pvp but doesn‚Äôt want it completely removed from the mode or a server created where the only player to player interaction is fighting.
---
Owlets are mentioned in two places. Once when talking about food items, as their nuggets are included in a long list of cooking recipes. The second is in a short section devoted to critters (rabbits, chickens, etc) in the bestiary, where they have a picture. [Here it is. Feast your eyes.] (https://imgur.com/a/T5zjzMV)
---
The abandoned waste dump. 2 spawn in that cave everytime you visit.
---
I think most people are bringing their unwanted legendaries to the exchange. No one is gonna throw their 3* AA rifle in their vendor. The best way to sell high tier stuff like that is probably still fo76bazzar
---
Again, over time the market will learn they have to provide what is in demand if they want to sell their supply.
---
My outlook is why sell it for a absurd amount? I don‚Äôt use it, whatever it is is taking up space for shit i will actually use. Let someone else have it if they want it and I can still make some caps. Iv never had over 2k on caps at one tome but idc. One mans trash is the next mans treasure.  Ill plans sell for 75 caps and any recipes are 50 caps. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs rare, Iv I already learned it why the hell do I need to cram in it my vendor and try and gouge people?! At the end of the day we are all one big fallout family, some are dicks but doesn‚Äôt everyone have dicks in there family line?
---
Camps should be free to travel to.
---
Yeah there are those pipe things in electric conection section. But it is hard to understand how to use it.
---
Yeah that's a good balancing idea. Also maybe put somewhere very remote without fast travel opportunity.
---
You can probably find plenty of broken Pro cameras around Whitespring.
---
I didn't say was a 4 old I said talked like a four-year-old
---
Don't be too disappointed.  I'm sure there will be some new crap in the Atom Shop to distract us with "bright shiny objects."  Meanwhile, even though I bought this game because it was supposed to allow solo play, I've resigned myself to not being able to complete some of the advanced quests because they require multiple players.
---
Ditto. 
---
I just scrapped a wall of my shack to get a wire thru.
---
Communist detected on American soil. Lethal force engaged.
---
Hancock is a bit of an outlier though as he's a post-war ghoul, only got turned by an experimental chem. He's also Mayor MacDonough's brother so he's probs only in his 50s or 60s.
---
Yeah, but they drop only deathclaw hands, not hides.
---
So I could be trading in dozens of useless legendaries for a Troubleshooter‚Äôs Wooden Shoulder?  What a waste of time.
---
Liberty Chad
---
The metal pipe connectors will do this. The upside down ones go through ceilings, theres a tall pipe one meant for walls and another set for floors. 
---
They past electricity through them but they dont emit any ambient power.
---
I have used them to make a shed with switched in it to turn on and off specific things without the ambient power being thrown in a bubble around it like the normal connectors
---
SOLD!
---
I had to leave my front and back doors open and put arrows up so the people who spawn on my front porch could find the vending machine that's at the dock side entrance of my waterfront bar. I'd be surprised if most of them could find my purifiers under the nearby bridge or the crops in the adjacent woods because they can't seem to find the back of their own hands.
---
To be fair it's disorienting fast travelling into a location you've never been before.
---
It's just comical to watch people get lost in your camp like they're in a chase scene on scooby doo and there's a hundred doors in the hallway that all lead to each other.
---
i thought you cant drop quest items? well i hope i can finish the "an ounce of prevention" quest soon. as far as i can tell the game thinks i still have the feral ghoul blood and doesn't let me pick up another one although the quests now says i need one to progress. i noticed before the patch dropped that i could put the samle into the bowl that we got for free a few days ago. didn't do it but yeah...might have something to do with that?
---
I was about to say shit, I wasn't wearing pajamas, I'm wearing a bathing suit.
---
Athlete:
---
Animo acid helps build up the muscles
---
Im actualy having more luck with the vending machine, sold 5 3* weapons allready and im at 25 k caps now. It helps when im in my camp so ppl can check the effect son weapons.
---
It‚Äôs just that the pacing and frequency of the spawns apparently isn‚Äôt suited to my character build. Which it should be since I have most of my perks in Rifleman.
---
Now we just need private servers that can be modifiable. Then it will be the best game.
---
Just happened to me. 0/30. But they did go back into my stash for sure.
---
It annoys me that you have to plan to get every scrip.  I would be totally fine giving it a 3 scip item and only get 1 back so I can zero it out easily.
---
Only wish it was the game and not reddit, lol.
---
lol, so my problem is i have no friends
---
I've found the easiest way is to make a half wall, run the wire over it and then you can usually place another half wall on top and the wire just goes through wall, don't know if it will work for everyone but thats how I connected power to my cleansing station outside my house .
---
bash the enemies instead of shooting them, it counts as a crossbow kill and doesn't use ammo (can't confirm if it damages the crossbow more than shooting though)...  I made 2 crossbows (lvl 15 to save junk), forgot to remove perks I think they were 175% condition.  Bashed my way through 50 enemies and I only had to kill a few more to get the 2nd crossbow down enough to repair...
---
Thats the thing; i dunno what the game expect when they said ‚Äúin water‚Äù i mean how deep in water haha
---
If you find some let me know, I started going after that badge
---
My CAMP is just north of the Red Rocket in Flatwoods.
---
I have 6 small purifiers running.
---
They are unlocked and fre for all to take.
---
Use my instruments.  Use my bed.  Use my workbenches.  Have a rest at the bar.  Cozy up at the fireplace.
---
My home is always open to the weary wanderer.
---
Camp Adams but no idea how to get it to spawn.
---
That is totally accurate. My CAMP is on Grahm's path and I also run out like a kid hearing the ice cream truck music in order to find him. :)
---
My camp is on a cliff, it‚Äôs literally work benches, drums, a bed , camp fires ,water purifier , a few crops and my vendor. No walls, no roof, no traps just bare on the ground, whatever you want, take it, use it, farm it.
---
Thumbs up and a comment for traction.
---
I fully agree about the necessity of increasing the budget amount, since we get loads of new stuff from the Atomic Shop. Just this and upcoming month we're getting LOADS of new plants and bone statues... where do I put that?? I need my cactuses!!!!!
---
It was stuff directly from my stash couldbt be marked, i remived a door and a chair and then could mark stuff for sale again so it looks like it takes a tiny amount of buget
---
I think the first issue with it is that you can fast travel to them straight away. I hate seeing people randomly spawn in my camp at first.
---
Also agree on the floating camps, its ridiculous and just looks like Rust, Arma or some other bullshit game.
---
Yeah it's an annoying bug. Nothing a couple server hops at flatwoods couldn't fix
---
Seen a bunch of NV scopes on vendors too, plus other weapon mods I've been missing. Seems like they updated vendor pools. Have a reason to visit Phoenix and other far flung bots once again
---
Well, what else would Bethesda use the caps for?
---
Why does my crafted one have max 200% durability even when I don't have the perk equipped?
---
And here we see the importance of punctuation.
---
I dont think they have the mesh walls anymore from FO4, but if you dont have the advanced connectors, you could place a mesh floor above the generator and go up and over.
---
Honestly who cares?  I have 4 purifiers at my camp and if some random player comes by and helps themselves that‚Äôs OK with me.  Just don‚Äôt wreck my shit.  
---
When running low on H2O I‚Äôve helped myself at other camps.
---
I never understood it either.
---
I never lock anything.
---
it's not like they can steal my shit.  Who cares?
---
free states \* not brotherhood. And imo such a lazy spot that completely ruins the day spa idea =(
---
Anyone on ps4 want to do this in the next 10 mins? Add me on Brokeback-killer
---
The publisher is very close to the developer, it's almost the same company, there are no attenuating circumstances for this initial blunder.
---
Same with Starlight, if it's becomes clear it was released too early, it's devs fault.
---
Are you on PS4? The revive part takes like five mins. I can help, other wise search the sub, there is someone asking for the same thing every 10 posts or so.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if that ends up being the Lore or at least part of it.   
---
There's a lot of American Exceptionalism in the Fallout world that boils down to American Exploitation &amp; Industrial Espionage.
---
Time to get the 3star Quad Ammo Crossbow out......
---
Where is the start point for the swimming challenge at spruce knob or whatever it's called
---
Some people don‚Äôt have patience. I love this because these vast majority of no patience idiots won‚Äôt be running around with backpacks nor will they be running around with armored ones unless someone starts selling them.
---
You can either use the conduit that is built for wall pass through, or you can remove the walls, lay conduit on the floor and then put the walls back up. Either way you will be able to run electricity through the wall seamlessly.
---
I put in a window or door frame, run wire, then swap out for a full wall. Works for me so far
---
I have a feeling that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll get plans/recipes like stimpack diffuser and s‚Äômores.  Need those for the world challenges. Keep me posted if you figure out how to trigger it. :D
---
&gt; real physics applied and buildings could collapse without support 
---
I 100% agree with this. Would stop the bases that ruin the immersion.
---
Exactly, if you don't need it then why keep somebody else from having it? I'm all for providing help to new/other players for either free or greatly discounted. I mean about a month ago before vending I literally dropped 40+ plans and tons of aid at the overseers camp for some newbs. I like to imagine it helped them not die once or twice lol
---
I haven't set up a shop since I haven't been in game for 2 weeks but you can bet everything will be steeply discounted simply for the fact I want people coming through my camp so I can meet new players üòÅ
---
I did have to wait for him to finish the quest. Note that regardless of quest item or not - you can't drop keys. And yeah maybe idk
---
Don't have that mod yet, maybe melee bash lol?
---
Yes exactly my point, they basically use "Im a raider so it's ok" to deflect when people call them dicks. No impact to me either, i never liked PvP on FO76, but IF you are going to go down the "raider" route, you may as well embrace it fully. Raider armor &amp; basic weapons.
---
Despite this being a disadvantage, raiders were a threat due to their numbers, ambushing &amp; insane amounts of traps, not their amazing weapons &amp; armor.
---
I just get frustrated when I hear that stupid response because 9/10 times its just a dude in the absolute best gear crushing people and then going "LOL IM A RAIDER". No you're not. You're just a cunt. Anyway rant over! lol
---
The Frog Jar is in ‚ÄúScience Projects‚Äù in the Chemistry Bench. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but I‚Äôm assuming you capture the frog by throwing the Frog Jar at it, or interacting while it‚Äôs equipped.
---
It now just has more short comings. I honestly think they need to bring the percentages down overall or change the chance factor.
---
IRL I was a EMT. I enjoy helping people.
---
 I was able to get stable flux cobalt, fluorescent, yellowcake, crimson and violet for 15c each.  I bought all of them.
---
Relog and try again
---
i am, and will do. I just usually play solo
---
Maybe I've been spoiled by previous versions of Fallout, but it feels that like each Patch brings a new set of rules/conditions.  I'm pining for stability . . .
---
No, the game would have had to been designed from the ground up to support it.
---
Why would you ever write it so the virtual servers were in competition for resources?
---
If you'll pay 100 caps per ballistic fiber let me know, I have 1,000 of it to sell. Same goes for springs - I have 2,000+ to sell to you at 30c each. 60K + 100k. I'm gonna need to buy a 3rd account to hold all these caps, and my current 2 accounts are gonna be maxed lol.
---
Does the revive an ally require you to be grouped with the "ally" or can you just revive a Rando.  Discovered life saving doesn't count
---
nope. just super floored by his videos. this changed my entire perspective about builds and shit and has made me 10000x more excited about this game. mind blown
---
I actually leave my water purifier unlocked. You only get 2, so it‚Äôs usually full whenever I get back so why not help some strangers when I‚Äôm not there.
---
Lol I can't get my damn crossbow to break. That thing is damn sturdy.  I've unequipped gunsmith, so that's not the problem.  Any tips? Or should I continue to craft hundreds of bolts &amp; waste a few hours?
---
Unlucky! I picked up like 5 legendary from 2 ghouls, it was really insane!
---
Do you remember his name? I want to visit. I have 100% reduction from falling damage.
---
Yeah \*especially\* in Appalachia which mirrors the real life WV closely, scary close. There's a deep story behind the whole Great War.
---
Username is Hownny. I'll be on most of the day. Just let me know when.
---
hmmmm   cheers, thanks for reply.
---
I play late at night,solo, no friends (need ta think of sumthin) (use eor's voice)
---
Are you in PA ? try do it out of PA if you are. yeah super annoying also try hop servers and try different servers
---
Oof.¬† Now I feel bad for taking some water out of a camp I passed last week... Before the update... I'm not the water bandit.
---
I played 2 hours this morning and it dumped me 3 times from the server.  Ridiculously long lag times too.
---
it hasnt even been 24 hours since servers went back up has it?
---
Pretty sure this is yet another ploy to make the repair kits no one asked for more desirable.
---
Do you still need someone to help you out? I too need to revive someone on PC (ign: LocalCowboy)
---
Yeah, you're right. I keep getting them mixed up. They should've put the raider down with the chems and then free states into the weapons vendor. Would've made more sense.
---
You have managed to communicate with other players without a Mic? How did you do that in game?
---
Gotta be smarter than the build system. Just drop another set of stairs down and then readjust.
---
Right!? A new questline is a new questline. I shouldn‚Äôt be able to breeze through everything in 2 hours.
---
Stealing this idea when I go to bed. üòÅ
---
Be cautious, that message is server side generated so if you spam the sell/drop button, the action may complete before the server knows that the warning should trigger. :) I'm speaking from experience.
---
Thanks for this.
---
We are in a game where nobody complains that the Whitesprings and golf course looks beautiful, despite being hit by nuclear weapons multiple times a day, yet "floating camps" are "unrealistic"...  Excuse me as I go back to building heavy combat armor with some plastic silverware, some steel buckets, and screws from a toaster.
---
My customers spawn inside my cabin but I spawn inside rock; at least I can just walk out of it.
---
Based solely on the name it's probably a fancy bottle with some bamboo skewers jammed in the top that makes your camp have the sweet aroma of stimpaks. So, old blood and Lysol smell.
---
If it's each week, 150 per week is too low. We will see soon.
---
I lock my lead extractor but keep the water open for whoever. I've got like 130 water on me at all times lol
---
Well sed.
---
Because people can't stack crafting perks and craft ammo? Wow are you ignorant.
---
I agree, before this vending came out I never traded with anyone. I would go to the overseers camp and drop all gear 2* and 1* and if it was way beyond there level is tell them they can trade with someone to get something they can use now or sell for caps to get something now. I‚Äôd also ask if I could make them armor or guns if they were lacking. At no cost to them. The only thing I‚Äôd ask of them is to give back when they are able too. Iv dropped full sets of PA NUMEROUS times for people low level.
---
That would be awesome! Us solo players gotta stick together figuratively anyways
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt even think to try that first.   I (wrongfully) assumed the exams would contain information we learned earning our badges.
---
Add me on Brokeback-killer I'm happy to party too
---
Yeah idk how it works for sure. The server was lagging at that point, that might have had something to do with it. I heard a "waiting for response from server" notification while looking up one of the questions
---
I immediately noticed it looked different, but couldn't quite place what the change was. I already forgot they used to be diamonds lmao. Stars just look so much more natural
---
 I don't like it. Its why I bought Plague Rider for my X0-1, as it fits.
---
I never said it was a four-year-old I said they talked like a four-year-old. 
---
 Don't act like you have never heard teenagers before they hit puberty.
---
Fallout 76 is dead to many players but the game isn't completely dead.
---
That's a great price for a full FC. I'm selling mine for 130 caps, and managed to sell 3 yesterday. I'm just selling my stuff for the price I'd pay for them. I don't think I'd pay much more than that for a black powder rifle, though I'm selling my 3* Vamp Gatling Gun for 650 caps. Also, my camp has free purified water for everyone :D
---
Pretty sure it was mentioned.
---
The benefit of increased damage output has been removed however, so it's just a boost to durability.
---
For me it was Archery, Athlete and Swimmer.
---
I did this and ended up with 2 sets of stairs I couldn‚Äôt remove üòÇ. Ended up taking down the top two levels of my C.A.M.P to fix it.
---
There is electrical conduit in the connections setting. You place it just half way through.
---
I hope you realise that it only has to be slightly damaged in order to repair it haha. It doesn't have to degrade to 0!
---
Most answers are obvious, besides you can still use google.
---
long time ago you would have to open a book, but we are not in this era anymore ;)
---
Oh, now I have a first real build goal! Thx.
---
They can be broken by mobs.
---
Some of the challenges are tedious, but at least there's enough content to keep us going for a while. I just don't get the difficulty aspect of the complaints
---
"Wtf the burrows are so easy, my tse combat shotgun ripped through everything in 5 minutes"
---
"I don't want to kill a yao guai with a syringer, what a stupid challenge"
---
Hell, that's too safe. That place never gets nuked. At least I've never seen a blast zone there.
---
i guess even more than all that its amazing that he's able to make a crazy high damage build based on a good (even 1 star) legendary and perks alone.
---
he has a lot of weapon showcases where he has full unyielding armor but there are others where hes not even taking advantage of armor buffs. just crushing shit with weapon and perks
---
1) Many, like myself, are fans of the series, and will play anything Fallout related.  The series hasn't been an MMO and really, this isn't a MMO.
---
2)They explicitly said, you can play solo if you want to.
---
Really doesn‚Äôt fit Fallout, Liberty Prime was a satire of propaganda, nationalism, and capitalism. He‚Äôs not just some cool robot.
---
No, I live in my power armor so I never use ballistic fiber, but I donate any extra I have to my wife to repair hers and she uses a lot.
---
With the changes to heavy weapon durability springs probably aren't as important as they used to be but I still hoard them like gold and snatch up any I find.  I currently have a decent amount though so I'm not looking to buy any.
---
I know prices vary from person to person so I was just throwing in my opinion on the matter.
---
Agreed, the issue was that when you combined ass/sent with certain perks, you had literal godmode that no amount of damage could pierce unless you got staggered or somehow got VATS'd. And apparently certain combos gave you double the percentage reduction.  Just bringing it down to 5% for ass and 8% for sent / cav would probably have been enough.
---
He only said that because of the arrow in the knee joke in one of the questions
---
similar - my son asks "dad,htf do aim like that without vats, on a ps4 ?"
---
"wot ?.......you tring to tell me you can't ?"
---
"Nope"
---
I'm doing Athletics, Archery, and Herpetologist. It really depends on what you feel like doing. Swimming can be easy.
---
Your right!
---
Mine reset about an hour ago.
---
Holy shit... I'm an idiot.  Lol. Thanks, man
---
Yeah I‚Äôd say that not degrading it fully but just a bit by bashing a few low level things
---
Lol
---
Yep I have. Just a regular blue switch.
---
This has been a known predatory exploit for some time.  I'm sorry it happened to you, but glad to see it posted yet again as a warning to newer and experienced players alike. Just another way for scumbags to set someone up and steal their stuff. and make a few caps.  These types of exploits are being addressed by Beth with each patch. The Workshop team exploit just got it's teeth cut out with this latest patch. Hopefully they will address this one pretty soon. Eventually these types of players will have no recourse other than to leave and find another game to jack people over in.
---
*pulls out gatling plasma*
---
So I shouldn't tell Ricky to stop adventuring after he got an arrow to the knee?  Damn.
---
Lololololol. You troll ü§£ I don't even lock mine, the respawn rate is high enough that I don't care, plus I find purified water so often I end up selling most of it because it starts to weigh me down.
---
I like that it feels like you earn everything. You can't just finish the quest in 20 minutes by fast traveling around the map. It took me like two hours last night to pass all the exams. Now I still have to go finish off the other challenges to even come close to finishing the quest
---
If I'm not mistaken, in the boards at train stations there's a new poster about the pioneer boy scouts. I'm not entirely sure, cause I haven't done any quests, but I think the backpack is a reward in that quest line
---
So many options. If there‚Äôs a wall between the vending machine and generator, change it to a window or door, connect the two, then change it back to a wall. This is the easiest way to fin power through walls without using camp budget for extra conduits. 
---
If the generator and vending machine are spread out further, you can use a wires-through-anything method that hasn‚Äôt been patched. This works for wall conduits (using signs like the no smoking sign for example) and for floor conduits and pylons (using rugs or floor mats). I‚Äôll use the example of a mat and a pylon to explain it. 
---
Ok, so first put down a floor mat near your generator. Next place a pylon on it. Now connect power to the pylon. Select the mat and move it over an inch in any direction so it‚Äôs still green colored. Once you‚Äôve moved it once, the wire will stay connected no matter where you move the mat next. So move the mat/pylon combo with the wire connected close to your vending machine and it should be good to go. This glitch allows the wires to go through walls, floors, the ground,roofs, and even other objects. This is also a great way to hide your wires really well
---
The usual workaround... I started to feel bad about slaughtering my own brahmin repeatedly.
---
So then you want Bethesda to make more live-service games. Might I inquire why?
---
Floating camps are because of the stupid building restriction if one foundation so much as clips the terrain, they were a workaround for a broken mechanic, every taken the take to build your base then to log off, come back on an hour later and find out its been completely despawned because someone else make a base within that region? A floating base is easy to put down and you don't have to worry about one foundation clipping thus restricting your ability to setup your camp.
---
Floating camps are easy to destroy in pvp/grief scenarios, also they are easy to defend from mole rats which like to spawn in concrete foundations.
---
Think I saw on a YouTube video the Stimpack Diffuser was datamined a couple of weeks ago and it gives gives your team mates a heal when you use a stimpack.  Sounded to me like they are slowly trying to make "medics" a thing especially with the bump to fuel crafting for flamers.  Bout time too.
---
It‚Äôs fun.
---
I'll do as I wish, it's none of your concern anyway.
---
Yep, thanks for the update! Good to know!
---
Check into it, the extra DMG and DR were actually bugs themselves. The perk was literally just supposed to provide extra durability like it describes
---
Does the piece have a star on the description? I thought the chameleon power armor was just a mod and not a legendary.
---
Or maybe he could be some sorta wandering raid boss that is only hostile to enemies and players that damage it. It could give really good loot and respawn every hour or so.
---
There seems to be a lot of items getting these errors post-patch.  I was fine moving around things already there but a lot of floating/not selected errors when trying to place new things.
---
They were diamonds?
---
Group I believe, but not confirmed. If you revive someone in water you get two tasks completed at same time.
---
It was a shit game at launch. I appreciate Bethesda didn't drop it after a month or two. But at launch it was pretty garbage.
---
I was wondering why I felt so squishy.
---
I agree. No. I buy things to support the game. That's how it works.
---
Didn't work still says stuff is inaccessible. Still had to delete a whole floor
---
Are you at max CAMP budget? Go into build mode, scrap one thing, then add all the stuff you need to add to your vending machine, then replace the thing you scrapped. 
---
There's a bug right now that if you're maxed out on budget, it won't let you list stuff for sale until either you relog or do the above. If you enter build mode and move stuff around so you hit max budget, you'll get the bug again and must do the fix to sort it.
---
MUH IMMERSION, MOOOOOOM!
---
What time is everyone on?
---
there is no info to complete main quest inside game itself (no cypher details, only name of cypher)
---
And if they are looking to sell it then they'll eventually figure out if they want the caps then they'll have to keep in mind potential worth to other people
---
Agreed.  In game, we're america's brightest.
---
As a player though, some questions appear to be specific to american history/politics/lore/etc. (I haven't done them yet, but most of the ones I've seen seem easy if you have a basic understanding of that stuff).  
---
But, there are some that people not familiar with America's details might have to google a bit to find, and I can see even some Americans who don't have a decent understanding of trivia might not know off the top of their heads.  
---
The wrestling president one comes to mind...I'll admit that if asked straight out, I wouldn't have had an answer, but seeing the choices given would have triggered a *long*-buried memory.  I woudn't fault anyone for not knowing/remembering that one.
---
Bottom line though, this IS a game based on an American setting, and given the details of the questline, a little trivia isn't out of line, and it seems most of the information can be easily googled (plus I'm sure there are already posts/websites that have all teh answers posted by now).
---
I believe it‚Äôs a 1*. Don‚Äôt quote me on that though. I‚Äôm at work right now or I‚Äôd check. I‚Äôll let you know when I get home tonight at 6pm cst.
---
Then I'd have to monetize selling water...
---
Wait.
---
Agreed, as long as they keep to cosmetics (I don't care about anyones Repair Kit Rant), I'll continue to be tempted and occasional sucumb to the Atom Store.
---
That's pretty rich, considering much of your post history is about pirating video games.
---
Meh.  My purifiers aren't locked because I *want* other people to help themselves when they're passing by.  Have at it , Water Bandit!
---
Display stands and cases are planned and should be out pretty soon
---
If No Man's Sky which was based on overt lies can turn around in people's general opinion Bethesda can certainly do it with FO76.
---
Isn't that the point of MMOs? I still have tons of fun not 1 hitting every single mob, it's almost as if the game was intented to be more of a challenge than that...
---
Do you know what I‚Äôve started doing with fallout 76 that I haven‚Äôt done in probably 20 years? Making notes. You used to have to make notes in order to get through games, but games often hold your hand through everything now. Personally, I really like that aspect.
---
I'm on XBOX, but hey, I'm glad you are doing alright and have found a nice spot
---
I'm an over achiever and passed all of them last night.  My OCD kicked in, I guess.
---
Seeing Bethesda fail by making things they're not very good at is fun? Please elaborate.
---
They've been added to the RNG items in containers. I found an extra one last night. They are scrappable though, so be careful.
---
You can go onto the main trading discord / subreddit and offer to sell springs at 3c per and you might take days to sell any at all. selling them at 30c per? Forget it, no one will do that. They just aren't needed that much. Ballistic Fiber is needed, but again.. no one is going to pay 50-100c per fiber. Per bulk maybe. The issue is that many people like me and you don't use regular armor - just power armor, so all of our ballistic fiber gets sold. 
---
As far as ammo, I'd never pay for .50 cal either. I just trade ammo typically. Find someone who wants one type and trade my 5.56 or .45 for it at a 1:3 ratio or something. At this point I only use ultracite .50 cal though, and all of my activities are centered around crafting that while farming legendaries.
---
Yeah wait the possum challenges make me not care about the upgrades at all
---
I moved my camp to avoid this
---
Okay thank you!
---
i did, but nothing happen.
---
I purchased serums for 1000, 500 and 250 caps today. So 5k is still really High.
---
Yes, even 10-20% increase would be nice.
---
We all switched it to default just to mess with you.
---
Oh I read that wrong. No my chest piece UNDER the power armor is a cham bos combat chest. But I wear my power all the time and have gone invisible while being hit.  When I get home I‚Äôll look exactly what it‚Äôs called though
---
Whats the gun?
---
They honestly should be on the same location of ranking but no clue what they'd fhange to do that
---
They're soulbound
---
I would buy it for 25k lol not gonna stop me from a legacy weapon
---
Omg I wanna get this pet :3
---
Yo fam, we need the BB guns back!
---
When I first saw the tasks, I was wondering how I was going to complete it.  At the quest giver, a guy asked me if I needed someone to die for the quest.  When I told him I did, he promptly ran to the showers and was killed by rats so that I could rez him.
---
People are very willing to help out others, you just have to sometimes ask.
---
oh, that's a good idea.  note to self, do this.
---
Its the opposite for me. Before this update it was only the default image for all players. Now I see variety.
---
Thank you for telling me, I‚Äôll readjust my price when I get off work tonight. 300 caps it is.
---
~~Makes me wonder if you can get this done with life-saving armor.~~
---
BRB, adjusting my vendor pricing.
---
I knew it! 
---
Vault Dwellers... what a bunch of bastards.
---
Server hopped 3 times at Wavy Willards to get mine...
---
I went to actual vendor locations, not white spring ones. Vendors seem to have a lot more especially in production bunker.
---
Raiders....
---
Joke's on them, my camp is next to watoga. I have my own personal assaultron guards
---
Let me put it this way - what something is "worth" in terms of time investment and difficulty to acquire, and what someone will pay are not always equal. I find lead at 2c each to be a bargain for example, because it's not something I can easily farm in mass quantities (5-10K+ in a day), whereas Steel and flux I'd never pay for because I can farm those very easily myself.
---
or just use voicechat and ask people? first one i asked did it for me and i didt it for him
---
Yeah, the odds of getting a perfect roll are incredibly small.  The only reason Unyielding/Assassin Sent/Cav is as widespread as it is comes down to duping.  You can certainly find the effect yourself with a little luck and patience.
---
I don't know what you're on, but i definitely need some of that too!
---
jokes on them im based on senica rock
---
I‚Äôm in boyscouts, and the things you find on these exams are actually pretty accurate. Suprisingly. I thought it was going to be some weird bullshit, but nope.
---
I really enjoyed seeing everybody's camps yesterday. I could tell many people had been preparing for this for a long time. Some of the builds were really creative, too. My favorite was one built into a waterfall, very cool.
---
ALSO: 
---
Get rid of mutations that cause or can cause players damage if they attack you! Saw this yesterday a few times! 
---
Power Armor with reactive plates as well... seems they focused in on that.
---
Yeah if I was raiding a camp the purifier isn't something I'd steal from lol. 
---
I've only taken somebody else's produce once actually, and it was to make moonshine. We both have camps on the lakes south east of Vault 96 so I went over to visit and left a bunch of regular stims as payment (because I unload those constantly on vendors in big batches)
---
Waited until last week to pick this up for my xbox, going to take teh plunge tonight hopefully!
---
That's exactly what the guy at 7-11 said to me last night. Must be a Fallout player.
---
I‚Äôm not greedy lol I just wanna help people along. Mfw I gave a lvl 5 marsupial for free. That kid was bouncing off the damn walls like a kid on a candy high.  I‚Äôm in it for the fun and experience, not to gouge people on shit I don‚Äôt use or care about.
---
I will now get my shittiest 3-star legendary and sell it for 15k.
---
And I will NEVER get in my camp again! 
---
I invested too many points into intelligence!
---
This is what happens when you try to play God!
---
Should I be running around in full PA at this point? I have a frame and a few pieces, I have a handful of cores but not that many. Also does server hopping work still? I try it a lot to find power armor to get new pieces and I swear it never seems to really work. Thanks for all your advice.
---
Same, except that I found I don‚Äôt even need Lone Wanderer, except maybe for SBQ fights.
---
Another case of false advertising... I just feel bad for the developers who try their best just so the guys at the top can screw up things with their inability to make a simple decision.
---
Totally, sure. Until they drop more rifle skins, and then all bets are off.
---
You've at least got to appreciate the effort it took.
---
But seriously, a lot of people still use the default icon. I just had a quick look on my map and about 2/3 are default.
---
Can you link it?
---
Yeah, it's a MMO. You can play solo, don't mean everything. You can play Destiny, The Division, Warframe solo, but not every activity.
---
Ive yet to list an item for more than 1k caps. I have too many caps, and would rather people be armed when I team up with them. It's just the right thing to do especially if it helps bring some casuals back to populate the servers.
---
Correct, but regardless of what platform your bought you get the PC of the oldies
---
How would set a price for mods? Example: X-01, now you can purchase the plan(s), if you were stocking up the calibrated shocks, jet-pack, reactive plates, stealth etc... Do you price them to sell cheaply (because you can purchase the plan) or do you aggressively price them because said player only needs 1 (or 2 calibrated shocks possibly)? For my self, I'm selling for a little above cost, because I want my stash weight back.
---
Now I have to find a piece of life saving armor....
---
I bought a damaged one from the watoga faction vendor in whitespring.  May have been player-sold but he also sells the plans for it.
---
It's hard to imagine how it could be worse, short of just chucking the items into a river and trying to fish them out. Too easy to get ripped off, too hard to make high value transactions, too easy to accidentally back out. It's just awful. This is much better.
---
Well, I would suggest that's all the more reason why you would want Sent/Cav instead of something like fall damage or water breathing as an armor effect.
---
The benefit of being able to breathe underwater really only comes up in a couple places, Kerwood Mine, Quarry X3, maybe The Burrows.  Negating fall damage is convenient for making a quick getaway in the Savage Divide, I guess.
---
The worst thing is; you can't inspect them guns. This makes for an easy hit-or-miss buy, if you take risks buying that shit.
---
Plz that OutRage culture is ridiculous, GTA 5 online wasn‚Äôt even playable for the first 3 months like at all. And it didn‚Äôt get the scrutiny of Fallout 76 or RD2. Not held to the same standard. Like when Lebron has 1 bad game in the playoffs it‚Äôs the End of the world, he sucks he‚Äôs not clutch. But when Golden state drops a 3-1 lead meh. Be consistent with your outrage. Not you specifically. In general.
---
Only explosive energy weapons. TSE ballistic weapons still drop.
---
lol  i think you're part of a simple few that don't  get it.  It's ok.  You'll come around.
---
There‚Äôs a cabin with a dock leading out into the lake. You should see a speaker stand on the dock and red buoys in the water. I found a swimsuit right in one of the containers alongside the cabin.
---
It‚Äôs like WWII all over again.
---
Still got it?
---
I just think the weapon effects in PVP are outrageous. Fights end in like one second 90% of the time.
---
You sound like the dream vendor that resets rather quick, but is hard to catch.
---
I should probably add you and visit your camp to buy some of the legendaries you dump into the vending machine.
---
They should make it so that you can kill someone and then revive them. I agree, I hate the forced non-solo element. I also hate that doing the archery quest means I need to repair this crossbow 3 times when it was built it had 200% durability. I'll have to kill like 500 things with it until it degrades in durability. No resources online say if any spawn or locations have degraded crossbows laying around. I chose the wrong skill with archery thinking it would be one of the easy ones.
---
Where are the machines located?
---
That's going to be an issue if you have overly slow or high latency connections in any online game (at least any with a dynamic world).
---
Unfortunately there's not much you can do locally to fix it.  Make sure you're on a wired connection (not WiFi), and that your bandwidth is as clear as you can get it - someone streaming HD Netflix while you're playing will cause issues.
---
Graphics settings can make some things works smoother, but your connection isn't something you can easily fix.  You could try a different DNS server set if yours is not performing well (not something we can easily diagnose over posts), and you could try setting up the port forwarding to see if that helps, but you're kinda stuck without being able to upgrade that connection.
---
Thanks, I wish more people in this community where as friendly as we all say it is in this 2k+ upvote threads
---
The point still remains, we are thanking Bethesda's developers. The publishers didn't work on these patches, the development teams did. And anyway we all know the person who made the final decision to go ahead and release in November was Todd Howard. This shit where gamers blame everything on "the devs" is wrong the majority of the time, including here. Put the blame where it lies. The actual developers have been busting their asses trying to get this game into shape, they're the ones who deserve our thanks.
---
Yes it is pretty fascinating that someone who doesnt support corporate foolishness/greed and prefers to pay for things when they are actually worth money asked others to not support corporate foolishness/greed and only pay for things that are actually worth money
---
ooooo thank you!
---
Reselling is what I'm worried about. I'm in the Forest and have some meds and a few level 5 legendary weapons for sale cheap so low level players can get them, but I don't want anyone just grabbing them to resell. I think I priced them right, but I suppose someone with maxed out Charisma and all three Hard Bargain perks could probably turn a profit.
---
Haven't seen queen of the hunt in months, which sucks as it's garunteed spawn for cryptids.
---
After the patch though, a bunch of dailies/events I hadn't seen in awhile popped up, so seems like they've fixed some things
---
Well I mean he's both a symbol of 50's-esque anti-Communism hysteria AND a giant cool robot and while it'll never happen I think it'd be darn neat to have a 1:6 scale assaultron-sized helium-voiced Liberty Prime prototype terrorizing the heathen commie squirrels and possums of rural Appalachia.
---
No. üëå
---
I was wondering if we were gonna see "Mall of 76" now with this patch, where everyone and their mother has their camp near the vault because free fast travel = more business.
---
Yeah I would try again. I got lucky with rabbits and squirrels spawning there.
---
Spruce knob lake *
---
Anyone know where the bow blueprint is? I cant make one to do the challenge.
---
At most, I sell for half. Usually 1/3. Magazines are 5, ammo is 1, exotic ammo is 2-5
---
Splurge on the mutation recipes.
---
This too. TTK is far too quick. If I see you and you don't see me, you're already dead. Opposite also holds true. And that kind of crazy fast twitch pvp is OK if everyone dies that quick. I don't think it's fun but at least it's "fair". Problem is ass/sent could tank hits for 20-30x longer than someone without that gear.
---
lol same. I don't like how the staircases work in this game.
---
This is the worst take ever. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy stuff, even if you like the game, because it‚Äôs not what ‚ÄòI‚Äô want‚Äù. God forbid a company try something different and appeal to a different demographic.
---
Oh, what a relief, I thought you had caught me with my pants down!
---
Thank god I'm not the lunatic who's been stealing purified water from people's CAMPs!
---
This also sucks. Having to go to reddit just to figure out how to do the challenges. They need better in game tool tips and guides. A marker on the computer terminals for the challenges is all we need.
---
yeah that‚Äôs.... what i‚Äôd said originally?
---
You bought a skin for the backpack what you need to unlock through quests
---
Found it too, thanks guys!!!!
---
I know, but they‚Äôve gotten some of the answers wrong which doesn‚Äôt help things and we really shouldn‚Äôt have to google them. It‚Äôs literally impossible without outside help. The obvious ones like how many digits are involved in binary are fine but some of the others are just troll attempts.
---
Yeah, but by making it only a durability difference it makes them that much closer in value to each other to the avg player.  The 100% difference is now only a QoL increase.
---
And yeah, I will still be 200% on everything cause weapon breaks are a pita but the free from the queen in game ones bumped to 200% would pretty much obsolete the perk unless you just needed to burn some levelups.  And it would piss a lot of people off they wasted 3 levels worth of perks that could have been spent on a dps increase etc.
---
That‚Äôs just a skin
---
Ohhhhhhh I see. Do you know what quests I need to complete?
---
did it work?
---
I try to swap it for each character... based on their "role".
---
A stimpak for my support/doc character. A knife for my melee character. etc.
---
Prior to the "everyone is default" thing, I noticed I would get a LOT more team requests when I had the stimpak icon up.
---
Yesterday I near max caps... Today I got a whole 200 to my name. Player vending is probably the best thing they've added to this game bar none.
---
Sounds like what I often experience with my melee build, except I'm also always overencumbered.
---
Probably their way of trying to balance melee weapons and legendary armor vs power armor. I doubt it's a mistake. Hard times for the guys who had the god roll armor sets for pvp though.
---
It's more incentive for me to play with zero DR outfits and berserker weapons though, so there's that.
---
It sucks lol hence why effect stacking needs to give us actual percentages in terms of how its working
---
I see now. Do you know which quest I need to complete?
---
be careful. the assultron beams can hurt camps. so all they gotta do is smack one with a camera, duck behind one of your walls and wait
---
This is an unreasonable statement no matter what your reasoning.
---
There's a really easy solution here: DON'T PLAY THE GAME. Shut it off, break the CD into 100 pieces and get on with your life.
---
I already did all task for two ot them (not counting exeams) 6more to go :D i am craaaazyyyy
---
I had to lock the room with the switch controlling my vendor power because people kept turning it off when I was away. XD
---
Nw üëå If you on the right location,its easy to find
---
Nah, I'm going to spend some atoms now.
---
You bought a skin. The actual item is unlocked through the Tadpole quest.
---
Free scrip haha
---
You do you.
---
The only thing I listed over 1k was serums and I listed them at 2k. But someone else informed me that he‚Äôs finding them around 800 so when I get home I‚Äôll adjust the price to 300 or 400 even. I don‚Äôt have many caps because I buy stims a lot to dilute them with super duper and that other perk that gives more chems. I just wanna have fun and occasionally team up with people to wreck strong bosses. For the most part I like exploring and playing alone and only teaming up for the SBQ a nuked area or even the fake robot sheepsquach thing ( I‚Äôm sure spelling is off) but if I don‚Äôt use that item ever, I‚Äôll sell it cheap because hey why not I don‚Äôt need it someone else can take it off my hands and I can buy more stims or plans or recipes. It‚Äôs a adventure
---
You learn the recipe when you complete it, the backpacks aren‚Äôt scrappable.
---
I was planning on making this very same complaint. Bethesda needs to change this. I'm not going to put myself in a position where I might get a panic attack just because of a quest. I'm not that hardcore.
---
haha "whelp you look like you need help with these lvl 68 super mutants that showed up all of a sudden"
---
If you have a few caps to spare you‚Äôre welcome to stop by my store lmao
---
Don't forget to keep an eye on nukes. With camp locations advertised on the map, launches can target clusters to do maximum damage.
---
its even better with PVP camp protection
---
What if what they want to do is kill you and take your shit...
---
I get it was a bit overblown at first, but I wouldn't say by much. Especially after so many fiascos involving Bethesda afterwards. I defended FO76 at release a lot. But after a few weeks the optimism faded and it just felt like a hollow empty mess. 
---
How is comparing one shit show to another make one less of a shit show? Bethesda releases glitchy unpolished games all the time, and it's getting old fast.
---
This lol. 2 accounts maxed. And I even blew 40K on all the x-01 plans last night. Time to get a 3rd account for caps storage I guess?
---
Psuedo-intellectual. Look it up.
---
Xbox of Kaisers Curse.
---
Are you thinking of buying it all up? lol. 
---
Im not even sure if its high or low prices, but more than willing to part with it all.
---
Theres some excess fusion cores too and an X01 jet pack mod currently sat there until I get the plans to build them
---
Yeah, and I was worried about maxing out (I was close last night) my caps but that's definitely not happening anytime soon.
---
hah!  Yeah... I was lucky to buy a damaged one from a vendor then accidentally repaired it to 200%.  At the end of the required usage it still had about 195% remaining CND.  Luckily, a buddy had one that wasn't over-repaired and I was able to complete the challenge.
---
just found the cabin ^ ^
---
They are super aggressive, and the pathfinding is surprisingly good. The assaultrons run right up to them. The only issue is I can't keep a brahmin at my camp or it will instantly get beamed
---
Honestly the possum challenges are too tedious , i have my level 50 backpack and I guess I won't be modding it lol
---
Get the free player terminal in the shop, write in there the things that are half price and to message you or use area chat. Thats what I am gonna do today.
---
this is sad because this is gonna make people even more weary of accepting legit party invites :( it sucks we dont have text chat or anything. sometimes i wanna play with strangers and i send random invites to ppl around my level and now i can see them being like 'no way fuck that guy' when i send em
---
you mean the one that would glitch, and wouldn't let you finish it?
---
The DMG increase was a bug though so you can't blame them for fixing it. The perks say nothing about increased DMG or DR so it makes sense
---
someone on here mentioned another way, where two players on a team are in PVP mode and I think actively fighting each other. One of them invites you to join their team, which automatically switches you to PVP mode and then their colleague attacks you for full damage.  Be careful about teaming up without a mic, and make sure you have stored all  your junk before you do.
---
That's never really stopped Bethesda before. See, cryolator.
---
How do I add punch to my bowl?
---
Add me I‚Äôm on ps4. I can‚Äôt promise the legendarys I sell are amazing but if I don‚Äôt use it I‚Äôll list it. I‚Äôm on usually after 6pm cst when o get off work. Work 7-5:30 everyday but sundays. User name is same as my name on here. If I‚Äôm busy wrecking monsters just send me a message and I‚Äôll hop back over to my camp so you can inspect the items descriptions.
---
Bethesda: Adds bugs in that weren't there before
---
Playerbase: Complains in a justifiable manner
---
Bethesda: 
---
Playerbase: Complains justifiably about lack of communication
---
Bethesda: Doesn't add content
---
Playerbase: Complains justifiably that nothing changed
---
Bethesda: Doesn't fix issues reported in feedback
---
Playerbase: Complains justifiably about issues that often benefit a small amount of the playerbase but negatively affect the rest.
---
Bethesda: Listens to feedback, adds a ton of content, fixes outstanding bugs and communicates clearly about what is changing both in an outline ahead of time and in more detailed patchnotes as changes are finalized
---
Playerbase: Still finds something to complain about.
---
Trial and error. Try different things out, see what works
---
You‚Äôre aware that micro transactions are what keeps the game financially viable for Bethesda and Zenimax right? Because without them we would have to pay for the DLC and likely have significantly less content overall, and reduced life span of the game.
---
The money we spend in the atomic shop helps pay the programmers and engineers that develop new content and fix the issues with the game. I'm not saying it's a perfect game but it's 100x better since launch. With our help and support we can achieve the game we want. And if that requires me spending a bit of my real money for in-game content, then so be it.
---
Guess I better get on this before they fix it. My best current gatling is a one star two shot (that was great when it was double damage and had extra crank speed with the bugged melee perk but hasn't left the stash since).
---
Same. Spent close to 25k caps yesterday lol. I needed that space. Never thought would actually keep non legendaries in my stash box waiting to sell to the vendors. Now that I don't sell those 1* junk to the robots I have to find other stuff to sell. Changes my entire farming method.
---
I have a Gatling plasma with explosive selling for 25k.
---
When you walk up to your own pu ch bowl there's an interact button, then just mark it like you would to store in stash.
---
I‚Äôve spent money in the atom shop and will continue to do so when I see something I want because I can. You‚Äôre not going to convince people otherwise.
---
Yeah the title could have been better
---
I swap between Hard Bargain and either Lone Wanderer or Tenderizer.
---
On PC, its the bethesda launcher hiccuping the mouse programming to its confined window area when loading the game, making the game‚Äôs mouse area the size of the launcher window. I usually minimize the launcher to the task bar to prevent it.
---
Wonders if Mysterious Savior works
---
Caramel melted fritters? Yes, still good.
---
Yeah, I'm kind of lukewarm on the quest myself.
---
For starters, I think it's really obscure how the challenges are, in fact part of the Challenges menu, at the bottom of the World category, and there's nothing that really tells you that.  The Challenges always struck me as a kind of meta, disconnected from the game itself, so having a quest that ties directly into them didn't come intuitively.  The scout badges really deserved their own Challenge category.
---
I also don't care for how you have to do every last thing in each challenge to get the badge.  It's weirdly rigid compared to other challenges like this, which usually have an abundance of options you get to choose from, and it creates problems - as we've seen - when players reach that one step that simply doesn't work.
---
As a result, there's a lot to each badge.  More than is possible to mentally track, so for all practical intents and purposes, the goal tends to be "Take photographs of every creature you find."  Which is odd considering the continued rarity of the camera itself and how it isn't a guaranteed drop for all players.
---
On the other hand, I like that it's not something most players are going to bang out in a day.  I don't recall seeing anyone with a backpack yesterday.
---
I put the plans up depending the value of how much the robot lists. Common stuff like the chem table and stuff are like 5 caps, but the BOS under armor I sell for like 500 caps.
---
I put this 2&amp;2 together but what about the RNG. I would hate my level 4  Alt have all these scrips and her RNG sucks because she has no SPECIALs and my main is just doomed. The struggle.  
---
If someone has a good Fallout RNG article or video please pass onto me. Thank you.
---
But you get caps in other ways. This is the only way to get scrip.
---
Doing GOD'S and the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA'S work
---
This is true so I don't understand the downvotes.
---
Are you not supposed to take that? I figured if I can loot it I should.
---
Shhhhh let folks capitalize before Beth fixes it.
---
PSA the "Welcome Home" Sign also fits perfectly on the gas sign
---
MSRP is lower than vendors? Fascinating. Thank you
---
I sell on the market subreddits..not using player vending at all
---
Im just worried about getting past the revive a player part cuz im usually solo.
---
Of course, perfect situation I want each perk, armor, and weapon slot dedicated to damage. 
---
However, some of those armor pieces are hard to find, while perks are practically automatic if you are patient enough.  Therefore I tend to prioritize perk space.
---
Isn't this how industries/conglomerates get in trouble for price collusion? ü§îüòÇ
---
you can, but probably don't need to.
---
There are well over a dozen PA spawn points in the forest alone, with varying numbers of cores and parts.  
---
For example, Camden park may have up to 5.
---
One for completing the quest there, one in an ammo box, one in each of the 2 generators, and one in the PA suit that sometimes spawns there.
---
Charge leves range from 25 to 100.
---
Any place that has a fusion generator may alos have a core in that generator.   In earlier levels, I made the rounds of most of them, more than once.
---
You should be able to start miner miracles, which is how you get the full set of excavator. 
---
Of course, making the rounds of the spawn points, taking out the enemies that guard them will give XP, which means leveling up....
---
There are market subreddits for this game
---
where are these tests at?
---
It's happened to me. I got stuck in a wall today. I had to fast travel to my camp to get unstuck. 
---
Not likely anything you can do aside from move your camp, which may not work.
---
I spent close to 25k last night buying all player vendors legendaries. My main guy has only about 500 caps to his name now. I bought so many items everything under 500 caps. Occasionally I ran into a few 3*s for 1k so I snagged them up. I traded what I could for scrips and saving the rest for when it resets.
---
What do you mean? You cant find my username?
---
Well yes, but at the same time I wasn't talking about 'the devs' as in the lowest level people who code. I was talking about Bethesda as a whole - we should not be thankful to them (as OP said), we should demand they do a better job at releasing the game.
---
That's awesome. I've seen a waterfall camp too I was very jealous of :)
---
Would you rather pay for story DLC or expansions and have a fragmented user base as to what regions of the map everyone can access? Or if that's also bad, the only way for Bethesda to monetize would be to keep luring in new players, and that stream of income would dry up quickly.
---
I'm not the biggest fan of games as service myself, but with almost 800 hours of Fallout76 under my belt, I do not have the slightest problem with paying Bethesda a little extra from time to time, as long as they work this hard and deserve it.
---
And the cosmetic stuff just gets better and better. I'd never pay for  anything non-cosmetic, though.
---
never heard of this game but just looked it up and this looks fucking amazing
---
Honestly as a medic main this would kinda piss me off. What was the point of me getting level 3 team medic if everyone is going to be able to give healing with the Diffuser?
---
Yup priced to sell cus otherwise I'm hoarding
---
Lol. Raiders ‚Äústealing‚Äù my berries
---
Good whale. Bobby Kottick is proud of you.
---
Athletic, Archer and Codebreaker take ~1-2 hours if you try
---
I moved near a train station so it serves a few purposes should someone make the trip.
---
Easy or hard, this is a post-apocalyptic recycling simulator... not a fucking school simulator. This was just a poorly-conceived time sink.
---
Love how everyone is downvoting you. Fuck PC players amirite? GET EM BOYS! We don't need no stinkin PC users in here. SMH.
---
FWIW I agree, we need to be able to just type it in. It's 100% lazy design because consoles sell more games, so they designed this game console first, and you can 100% feel it, just like with Fallout 4. Unfortunatley there aren't mods to fix it for PC like there were in FO4.
---
Sony kiboshed any possibility of x-play functionality during development. It'll never be implemented retroactively.
---
I‚Äôm nervous to lock anything in my camp with this new update, and here‚Äôs why:
---
Camps are protected from damage as long as players are not hostile to you. If you lock something and have turrets in your camp and someone tries to break that lock, they are hostile to you and your turrets will open fire. A player can then destroy the contents of your camp. And now players know exactly where all the camps are.
---
Not sure if it works this way or if pacifist mode can fix it but that‚Äôs just my thinking on it. Take my water lol
---
People are selling all kinds of things at various prices ranging from absolute steals to absolutely absurd. Travel to a bunch of camps and take a look at what they‚Äôre selling and for how much. Then either set similar prices or try your luck with higher prices. If people are desperate enough for what you‚Äôre selling, price won‚Äôt be a complete dealbreaker. For example, I bought adhesive at a way higher price than usual last night because I needed it and no one else was selling it. I‚Äôve personally been having a head time finding resources for sale. Basic ones. But sell them all a decent price please
---
Same.  As-is, it seems impossible to get all mods/plans with the number of available challenges.
---
Go to a train station and look for the new poster there. Or in the atomic shop... Be warned... Its a twat
---
You're no friend of mine if you leave the job half finished
---
Ditto. I'm seeing a lot more variety now than I ever have before.
---
Jokes on them, my firecracker berries fight back.
---
The fact they've built their construction-system on an inept engine isn't a really valid reason. 
---
As you say, there's only 24 people on a server, some with CAMPs barely made of a few planks and the workshop.
---
Mine allows me sometimes.
---
It's fine.
---
Do you have high luck?
---
It only spawns at night. Just wait till dark and walk up to the bonfire. If someone else triggers it before you, it'll show on the map as an active event.
---
You can only repair to 200% with a perk that specifically states that it does that, so it's probably a bug that this functionality is gone.
---
Thats because the spawn point for others is where your C.A.M.P. unit was placed at the time you claimed your build spot, not where it is located now.
---
At Train Stations
---
Nah. Just a ridiculously large amount of liberators
---
I refuse to live in a wasteland where the top 1% have more scrap aluminum and bulk cork than the bottom 99%.
---
The crafting a frog in a jar didn‚Äôt grey out for me :(
---
What were the herpetologist challenges? I never checked them.
---
I'm not against this idea of face, but I wouldn't use it. I price to sell, and if that means people are buying my items and reselling them for a profit, then good for them. It doesn't affect me in the least. I suspect there's been a couple of times when I priced far too low and the item sold almost immediately, so lesson learned and I'll price higher next time. I don't need to milk every cap out of every sale, and I'm certainly not interested in price controls (not that you were saying that necessarily). 
---
What I did do was log how much bulk junk sells for at the vendors under different levels for Hard Bargain, so I know what store price I need to undercut, since those are constant competition. If another player wants to sell for less than I do, then that's just good business on their part.
---
I *understand* that.
---
People are so creative, it really is impressive
---
How is it failing?
---
Yeah I just did it during the day and got a 1 star furious 44
---
thanks sounds delicious
---
I'm still looking for somebody for help if you haven't found anyone yet? (Xbox)
---
Yeah, they sorely need one.
---
Bethesda:
---
Playerbase:  Complains justifiably about issues that often benefit a small amount of  the playerbase but negatively affect the rest.

I am interested completing this as well. I recall reading about this diffuser somewhere, but do not have a clue where to learn the plans for it.

You don't have to completely break it in order to "repair". I basically bashed a few enemies, checked that it had a tiny bit of damage, then repaired it.
---
Costs the same amount of materials, which is dumb, but saves on the grind BIG TIME.
---
just discovered this guys page. I IMPLORE EVERYONE TO WATCH THIS ASAP

What are the other 2 quests?

Yes I unlocked it this morning. Now I can never wear PA besides nukes :-)

Just don't take my razorgrain and corn. I can't make any moonshine without them
---
or just stalk a low level player, judge if they are bad or not. if they are bad wait for them to fall and swoop in and be their iron clad guardian angel
---
Scout badge exchange
---
Camp fire tales event
---
My door is always open, unless someone closes it. I hate having to open it all the time. My water and crops are available for everyone. They respawn frequently and I am usually not at my camp anyway. Everything at my camp, visitors are welcome to.
---
Meh... I don‚Äôt think that qualifies as ‚Äúraiders‚Äù that‚Äôs just a cheap scam done by someone who‚Äôs just thirsty for caps or something.
---
There are terminal at the Pioneer scout park
---
Ditto. Honestly, the only annoyance I've had so far was that one question in the entomology exam without a correct answer (and that's more because my biologist brain was screaming "IT'S ANTS DAMNIT" than anything else). Other than that, I'm enjoying wandering around snapping photos of the wildlife and stabbing wolves in the face.
---
Ok thanks :)
---
You could do that. I prefer my method tho
---
thanks!
---
Just use the owlet trophey and position it so the back is invisible then you got a lil living owl buddy
---
Or the damage buff was never intentional to begin with.
---
Agreed.   Everyone has to eat and pay bills.
---
So uh funny story. I keep my water purifiers, lead collector, fusion generator and the secluded stairway to my private residence behind a pin-locked keypad door so I've never felt the need to lock my purifiers. But once player vending went online, my visitors keep materializing in my private bedroom so I've had to add unlocked doors and arrows showing then the way out cuz the first few visitors clearly felt I made some sort of wasteland escape room and not the homage to capitalism I intended it to be.
---
But thanks for reminding me I should probably lock my purifiers.
---
This made me so happy that the vendors have there own place. The little signs that talk about buying local. Made me so happy.
---
Unlikely. As stated, Sony kinda screwed the pooch on that one. But even that aside, the difference in play experience between console and PC would create a level of contention with which I don't think Bethesda is prepared to deal.
---
Lol leave the sink running.....
---
its what i did.. but then again i love giving gifts to newbies. this one was garbage. so i left him with some stims, rad away, bullets, and a few plans
---
It could also be that the player had an alt and wanted it for that reason, I guess.
---
I noticed this too. I got it the first day it was out, and I don‚Äôt understand why.
---
Anyone around to help complete this challenge? I'm on PS4 too
---
Had 3 L80 SB gang up on me last night.
---
Tried to use the Dragon for effect.  No ammo. (Doh!)
---
&gt; Why is this lvl 200 stalking me? Better server hop to make sure he doesn't grief me...
---
~Low level player, probably.
---
Lmao I‚Äôve actually found gems on Xbox. Hundreds of plans I don‚Äôt even have. I got almost all the Faschnauht plans because I didn‚Äôt play during that even for about 50 caps a piece
---
Moving the camp device around seems to help.
---
I get that you‚Äôre trying to be clever.  It needs some work.   But, by your comment, I can see that you haven‚Äôt read anything that I‚Äôve wrote on this post.  If you had you‚Äôd have seen that my opinion is that survival mode is detrimental: to the state of the games and the pvp element should remain integrated in adventure mode in‚Äù some way, albeit with some balance changes.  
---
Do you want the game better for everyone, or just you and people that play like you?
---
How someone answers that question says everything.
---
X-01 has had the bug since the lauch were you could buy the plan to make HUD yourself, but it would not attach if you try. You could, and still can buy ready mod from enclave )rare chance finding it) and that can be placed/attached to your PA helmet np.
---
Okay the patch doesn't say much about performance, how is it on PS4/Pro these days? I've not seen any performance analysis since the 47GB patch dropped, and it still kinda seemed like a mess then, has it improved?
---
Sell stuff to vendors. Don't just automatically scrap everything - some stuff has non-trivial resale value.
---
The way camp spawning works is where ever you place it THE FIRST TIME you move your camp, that it the set spawn, placing it and then moving it won‚Äôt do anything, keep in mind your spawn point is different than friend/customer spawn points
---
I love the idea.
---
Yesterday I found a guy selling serums for 300 caps a piece. I cleaned him out
---
I played the game until level 100 or so, and I can't tell you how many crashes, loss of connection or party problems we had. It was a requirement to log out and back in at least 3-4 times per play session because something would go wonky. That's not even counting random server disconnects or game crashes. We also saw a ton of bugs from missions not triggering to broken weights based on when you got in your power armor.   
---
None of the complaints were mythical in nature.
---
Well we don't even know if it works yet. I mean grinding legendarys is just normal but I would not go out actively trying to find one until someone confirms it works.
---
I lock my purifier but there's a cooking station outside so anyone who needs water can get some from the pond and boil it.
---
Give me my Vim power armor...
---
How can Bethesda get good at something if they don‚Äôt try? Sure, some tries will be counted as a failure, but it does seem they are learning or at least trying to do better. Many people enjoy this game despite its flaws. Most every innovation in gaming was a gamble when first implemented. I choose to reward Bethesda for taking that gamble. They did not fail at creating a unique and interesting game. The rest needs refinement.
---
Where did you get the stimpak diffuser?
---
Gatling Gun.
---
I'm close to a station too, but a vault would let them free travel, and then cut way down on the subsequent fast travel/run
---
I have seen the mod plans for Raider armor and also power armor plans, but yet to see any standard light, sturdy, heavy (Arms, Legs, Chest) raider plans for crafting those Raider armors. Most people I have spoken with said they may have received a raider armor plan from Rose‚Äôs quest line, but that is about it and that doesn‚Äôt appear to be guaranteed either.
---
Even on survival it‚Äôs a pretty easy challenge to do and you have a week to do it. Hope you enjoy the gun.
---
Because at no point was this marketed or sold as an MMO experience. This game has been marketed as "Fallout - but with online" and at all times they've said "Yeah, you can totally play by yourself if you want".
---
That's why people get upset when it turns out you can't actually do that.
---
Pretty much in the same boat as you, Send a request to Hardcoded, usually on after 7pm MST
---
Setting our own journal would work too. I'd probably come up with SCP numbers for the cryptids, and the last entry would just be an ASCII of the Ok hand sign that just said Gottem at the bottom.
---
wow thanks for this tip I hope most people figure this out, I bought a gun last night on half blind faith 3 star I could only see the instigating it was still a bargain turned out to be decent roll for sure got lucky.  i hope this gets patched soon but I haven't seen to many hotfixes yet But It will give me incentive to play the tubu on the porch while people look at my weapon selection with full visibility
---
Hey, DnD is always a good reason to stop something.

*rolls d20* now I have to go slap my boss because I just gained the initiative

My playtime is almost exclusively dedicated to doing daily/weekly challenges to earn Atoms to decorate my camps.
---
There are others like me.  Together we form what is called a Market Segment.
---
Todd and Bethesda provide a product geared towards this Market Segment, we purchase it, and they derive Profit.
---
Do you not like Profit?  Are you a Communist?  You know what we do with Communists in Fallout?
---
Your house, your door, your responsibility
---
I'm sorry you are having such a bad day. Hope you are feeling better.
---
The best place to find a damaged crossbow is at the palace of the winding path. If you go through the entrance, and stay towards the left, you will find a cliff side with an archery range. It usually has a crossbow on the table there.
---
could i get the link to the discord channel?
---
I feel like this is only really a problem right now because everyone has so many legendaries stashed away. Once every unwanted legendary gets turned to scrip, I don't think a lot of people are going to be having this problem unless you get Four 3-Star weapons on a daily basis.
---
Throw up another foundation on the ground outside of but next to your build, and then stairs down (or up to your floor). Will let you move the original stairs.
---
It just reset.
---
This actually is the best thing for Bethesda, you already bought the game, now they don't have to worry about you playing and costing them the steady cost of your character needing to be maintained and tracked. Breaking a product you already paid for doesn't hurt the company you bought it from in anyway, you just fucked yourself out of a product you bought
---
It‚Äôs 2 badges. I have it and it looks really cool.
---
I have 6 Industrial water purifiers. Always keep them unlocked along with everything else in my camp.    
---
Water replenishes so fast that I welcome anyone who needs the refreshment. Hell, if I could set up something like a fridge and dump my excess water in it for everyone to use.
---
They are not tradable unfortunately
---
Didn't know I could do that I'll have to try it out
---
I'd personally judge it based on how structurally stable it seems. If you built a mansion on thin pillars that's some minus points.
---
&gt;Broadhead Point for hunting.
---
But I like the mechanical broadheads
---
added
---
I can help you if you help me.
---
Yeah, i noticed the overlap too.  These are one shot craftable items from what I understood so your perk card is superior unless you want to craft and carry all over hell and back yet another stack of aid items.  No thank you.  I'm hoping that all the medic related perk cards get a look at though to make medics more viable.
---
Is there other military paints for like t60,t45 and t51?

I mean if he is that accident prone, I am sure it would be in his best interest. But no, let his metallic idol break the news to him.

Upvote for appreciating and upvoting the Archer reference.
---
Omg... people like you are the reason that The burrows don't have any challenge.
---
Yes? Survival is the PvP mode..
---
You can craft people then can‚Äôt you?
---
Yeah, I just finished it. I ran it backwards first to trip all the traps and it was pretty easy.
---
don't tell me how to play
---
You no word so good.
---
I own a piece of lifesaving armour and can confirm it DOES NOT work, tried it both in water as well as on land.
---
I found a basement area I either never knew about and missed earlier in my playthrough or it was added lol I'm usually pretty thorough exploring.
---
Get ~~good~~ **Gud**
---
not a bad idea. I may start selling a slew of lower level items now for super cheap.
---
Please Bethesda! A 1.5x increase in budget would make me so so happy! I love my current camp and want to add all the new stuff (vending machines, brewery station, ...) but I just dont have the room. I'm basically waiting for a big budget increase at this point...
---
I must have hit 100 player venders last night.  A good 20% involved fast travel glitch failures ‚Äî me stuck in or under foundations, between literal rocks and hard spaces, underwater, or on a cliff.
---
What!? Really? That‚Äôs weird and unnecessary! Hopefully they fix that issue then and Yea now that you say that I did have a sliver of space left in my budget so I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt see that. Thanks for the heads up tho so I can make sure I have space in advance.
---
How I got my revive for the start of the Pioneer quest was while at the location for it. I saw another guy there and thought might as well kill myself with the explosive shotgun I got, so I took off my armor and proceeded to blow myself up I died and he revived me, he then proceeded to try and return the favor by jumping off the cliff there until he died. 
---
Wasn't expecting him to return the favor. Really cool of the dude to do that instead of just wandering off.

---
This game repeatedly has some of the laziest game design I have ever seem
---
I love how they act like they're economics experts. It cracks me up.
---
Just put it up for sale. I put up my 3000 5mm and had someone buy 500 of it.
---
Thank ye-
---
Great changes and all, but i was wondering if I was the only one that sometimes can only respawn at one location upon death, it gets really annoying?
---
As a mid-level character (close to hitting level 50), I actually like that the new photography and scout quests aren't something I can go do in a day or two. They are actually taking me to parts of the map I haven't even been to yet, and are challenging for my play style -- solo mostly so the "revive an ally" task is a challenge. I want to have to work for it, not have it handed to me. They are indeed a challenge for me, so while I may grouse about it a little, ultimately I prefer it this way.
---
I just tapped R1 on my 3 stars, set the price to 1.2-13k.
---
Ammo prices are 3-4 caps per.
---
Lol i found the little kid that had mommy buy him his game xD
---
If you use the grounded mutation with class freak it previously wasn't reducing the negative effects (energy damage -50%).  Supposedly it was fixed in this latest patch.

It was only in the bunker and specifically for X-01. Haven‚Äôt seen any other plans for other PA

I hope I find you're house one day so I can heard all manner of critters into it.

I literally have 10 industrial water purifiers running in my camp. Come take some, I have plenty.
---
Just any new rifle, bored of using the same guns since 2015/16
---
Haven't started yet, but I'm on PC and willing to help out (since I'll need help eventually as well...).
---
kay_wall

Yeah im only level 73 and still pretty new to trading as I played almost all solo until recently. I had someone ask if they could get some fusion cores from my power plant I had been harvesting. I said I'd trade them. They didn't offer anything up for trade or suggest anything so I marked a few of them at 100 caps figure this was well below what I saw them for sale at vendors for 350. They were not happy and killed me! I didn't know about pacifist mode til after but it was at my workshop and my turrets started shooting at them anyway. They were if. 180 something and killed me with one shot. I respawned and they killed me again. I lost like over 100 caps from dying as well as my junk. I sent them a message and they said that the price was way to high. I replied to them saying I didn't know and if they wanted to ask for cheaper why didn't they just ask? Ever since I don't trust anyone.
---
F them twice for killing my shotguns again.  Bastards
---
Aw, well that sucks
---
Do people tend to shoot up empty bases? I haven't had a camp placed in a very easily accessable place, so idk.
---
Mmm did you visit a guy who spoke spanish and little english?
---
I'm grumpier than you at 2
---
I usually build a level one with all the fixings, then drop it and all the ammo I‚Äôve stocked for it on a newbie.
---
Yeah I'm just having a bad build day. Lol.  Now I cant place walls because they are floating when I can clearly see it's not. It also tells me walls are intersecting invisible objects. Maybe I should give up today and go kill some stuff.
---
Lmao. I guess...
---
I feel the exact opposite, I can‚Äôt believe Bloody and AR synergy hasn‚Äôt been nerfed.  Any weapon becomes devastating with these builds.  Sprinkle in Nerd Rage and survivability stuff like Emergency Protocol, dodgy, serendipity.  It‚Äôs really not a hard build to play and great payoffs.
---
interesting, where is the base?
---
I found a wide swing in my travels, most using bullets as interchangeable currency, lots of legendaries put up but no way to inspect them, and I'm not dropping 6k on a bloodied gatling plasma unless its also explosive and something else shiny. 
---
I put my prices at bargains, easy to find or farm plans for 50 caps, expensive chem recipes up for usually 50-100 caps off the suggested, and hilariously, everybody and their uncle has weightless gear for sale.
---
Honestly looking at all sugestions I'll probably just drop it at the vault when someone leaves it
---
No sorry the plan the plan to make them was auto taught and it‚Äôs only mods you can buy
---
Stop please I am still getting over the Anthem shitstorm, you are making me itch to return to Fo76...please don't give me hope!
---
Ah
---
Might help all those people selling Chem station plans for  hundreds of caps each.
---
It‚Äôs been fine for me this update, using a handmade on pc.
---
Half the player base would be destroyed.
---
Which is really what he said if you read his sentence again. Not sure why anyone would downvote such an innocent question lol
---
Thats why being able to sell it for a cap each or not at all is broken thats what breaks the economy
---
I did, wasn‚Äôt even trying.
---
So you think if someone is a jerk in the game then they must be a jerk IRL?  And if someone is a jerk in real life, they must be a jerk in the game?
---
How about this?  If there is no penalty for dying (caps or junk) then why would somebody be afraid to attack another player?
---
Why was it locked away?
---
No, that encyclopedia came with a game.
---
Sure, add me, username medlilove :)
---
I'm going to go drop a $20 at the atomic shop  right now because the warm, salty tears of your desperation are soooooooo delicious. Do continue your rant.

I buy a lot of flux and pay 70 each‚Äî100 for violet.    I think your prices seem a bit high for those.
---
Omg this
---
You mean the perks? Just.. level up, they'll appear in your Int perks eventually. They have minimum level requirements for each level.
---
i found someone selling a two shot exploding Western revolver, max level, for 200 caps last night.
---
snatched that bitch right up
---
Funny thing is, the reason it got locked away was an F, that only counts as HALF of a grade. Not a big deal. Latin ain't hard this year
---
Found it thx
---
No worries. If you need any other fashnact plans lmk
---
AI, even flying insects, can open doors in this game.
---
It‚Äôs a Gatling gun, pretty nice I think. Way better than last weeks knife.
---
Its the in game version of the News Page in the main menu basically. I imagine we will get a message there everytime there is new content.
---
Yeah there are more disconnects but give it a few days.  There was probably a massive influx of people yesterday since this is a big and widely anticipated content update.
---
Over repairing isn't giving a damage boost after the patch.
---
Oh okay.
---
ur the worst kind of player to deal with haha
---
How do people not get this? Fucker throws nuclear bombs like footballs. How can that be read as anything other than a parody of American jingoism?
---
I'm not that fond of it.  As much as I like having a quest that has some longevity to it, I'm not thrilled with the rigid "You must do these 8 things" design of each badge challenge because, as many have seen, some are simply bugged or - as far as we can tell - not even implemented.
---
And considering how many players are still frustrated by the inability to get the camera in the first place, having a quest that relies so heavily on it is a bit provocative.
---
There‚Äôs a missing legendary effect on melee weapons, where you reflect 50% of enemy melee damage when blocking. Also, The rolling pin can‚Äôt be both chefs and spiked/bladed in the calculator, even though you can do that in-game.
---
I give away my .38's, sell shotgun and 2mm ammo at 2 caps each, ans all other ammo is 1 cap each. Don't really care about market rates. I've been chucking my unused ammo on the ground since last November. Getting any money back for it is a profit to me.
---
Why did you do this though?
---
You can get the plans at the Whitesprings now and don't need to be low level either.
---
I mean for the new quest
---
I haven't even thought of adding my treasure maps to my store, I must have a hundred or so saved up. Oh my god, I'm gonna be RICH! /s I guess I'll settle for 249 caps apiece then. ;-)
---
Workshops, quests, and/or make them yourself with chemist and the level 3 super duper. If you're not up for PVP then take one over, defend it once and server hop.
---
That cool robot took out the institute
---
One correction the number for the marathon is right, but the units are wrong. It‚Äôs 26 miles not feet.
---
I knew it would sell well.
---
It's the Campfire event that only occurs at night.
---
Same. I dont lock anything in my camp except an empty 1x1 room i use for bag transferring stuff with friends. Whenever i run across a completly locked up camp i think "thanks for nothing, jerk. I could have used a stash and crafting table right now"
---
You didn't have to go to Watoga lmao
---
Is it just me or do we see these pop up every time a moderately successful patch comes through?
---
I know some people have wanted this ge to fail since the announcement, but I have to say the level of dedication to hating this game is almost admirable if it wasn't completely wasted.
---
I know live service mtx games are a bit of a sticking point right now but we all need to have a reasonable talk about how they should be done because they are not going away.
---
I also found squirrels just north of here fyi.
---
I want this so bad but I am afraid of the technical implications
---
I always have about a hundred purified water on me at all times so I dont care if someone takes some
---
I play fallout like i live my life. Lock everything, nobodys aloud in or to have my water.
---
I only do it because one day my whole camp got destroyed and now every other player has to feel my revenge. (I only destroy camps at whitespring)
---
I TF'd to a camp and was trapped in a tiny corner inside behind a green Deathclaw shaped shrub.  Had to FT out.  Couldnt buy anything :(
---
This would be so cool. Would be fairly easy for them (I think) and would appeal massively to the players that RP. Especially if people could read your journal entries.
---
It's really good. Get your grades up, it's worth it.
---
I'll be on whenever I get off work around  4ish need to do this too
---
Are you saying that 10,000 caps is unreasonable for a Chem Station?
---
I used the lighthouse by vault 76 (0), sunday brother‚Äôs cabin (1), appalachia antiques (2), and grafton dam (3). You can change worlds to reset the terminal so you can get 3 of each.
---
I would love to be wrong, but I checked numerous vendors including Raider vendors and only saw raider mod plans and raider power armor plans. I also did numerous server hoping just in case it was random availability, but no luck for me. Not sure if anyone else can confirm their availability.
---
I can‚Äôt log on to look at the numbers, but it seems that this would relegate fast attack melee to uselessness.
---
Thank you changed it
---
Ive completed one of the exams and got nothing from it, are they pointless?
---
Really? Didn't know that! Either way, would be nice if they put it in the patch notes, to avoid me having to make this post in the first place
---
Several suggestions have been made, but none implemented:
---
* Bulking ammo so we can sell it to vendors
---
* Scrapping ammo so we can change type
---
* Fractional currencies so we can sell cheep shit
---
But in the end, the only way we have currently is to throw it away, give it away, or use it. So put it in a machine for 1c and see what happens - even if the market says it is not worth 1c a player with plenty of caps and not much time may decide it is worth their time to buy at that price.
---
jokes on you, i trained the local mole rats to go tinkles in my purifier.
---
Bethesda continues to be one of the better quality AAA devs. The internet just overreacts and circlejerks stuff into oblivion. I've never heard horror stories out of them either, so from what I know it's a great place to work, too.
---
Not only do I mostly prefer to play solo, but whenever I team up and use private voice, my in-game sound dies. I teleported to someone at Wavy Willard's, found they had area chat on, and asked them if they wanted to knock out the revive swimming objective together. 
---
Hijinks ensued as we proceeded to unknowingly kill ourselves in overly dramatic ways that did nothing to help our cause. We died by Mirelurk Queen, deathclaws, drowning. Finally, a reddit tip led us to simply irradiate ourselves to about 10% health and jump over a bridge onto a puddle.
---
10/10 experience.
---
You're missing out. I'm still holding my big ticket items, but you'd be surprised how many 1* bolstering/vanguard/unyielding and bloodied/anti-armor stuff I've unloaded for 300-800 caps.
---
I made 13k last night from that and throw away ammo.
---
Some friends and I tested this tonight.  We could do no damage to bases.  Not sure if this was a glitch, though.
---
I'm reading on this sub people making manual records of items offered and sold.
---
This all seems a little to close to real life and running a business but I'm loving the Vendors though. I've bought a couple of sweet weapons, currently rocking my +40% Swing Speed Mole Miner Gauntlet and a two shot hardened combat shotgun, worth every cap, thanks to the vendors... excellent buys :-)
---
So what does it destroy it?
---
Exactly, let's cut off the support so that all our time in game is wasted. Exactly when they are starting to put the accelarator down on the fun train.
---
God forbid they keep up the pace of dropping decent balancing decisions, new quests and events, new Bosses, new stuff on the map to explore. Vendoring. Legendary Scrapping. More tweaks to survival to see what the community likes.
---
ah okay. Well those bases in whitesprings are a SOB ;)
---
I get that, i really do. I want to wreak havoc to every player who ripped my bum open when I had no good pvp gear.
---
Yeah like atom shop items
---
I know but if the door isn't already open they just attack the outside of my camp which is easier and much cheaper to rebuild. I've lost my decontamination shower and one of my vending machines since yesterday and I've NEVER had an AI go inside my house before. I'm just saying, why is it so hard to shut a door, like for real? Takes literally 1/100 of a second to click that button
---
let's use reddit chat to communicate
---
Damn. I was happy I made 3,000c.
---
I think there's a lvl3 terminal at camp venture.
---
I just bought $40 worth of ‚öõÔ∏è  in your memory
---
It actually doesn't.  A little of people think it does, due to poor wording choice in a message that states 'your camp is full", but that's not what the message is actually referring to
---
Yes free states my bad
---
Apparently I like to make things as difficult as possible...I had no idea it was there as well. At least I've got some fast travel points over there now I guess.
---
God sake, I really want it lol can you help?
---
If you have a friend get the free terminal and have them build it in their camp(if they don't already have one), lock it then hack it.
---
I don‚Äôt know about, ‚Äú deserved to be crucified‚Äù but yeah I get it. The game wasn‚Äôt great at the start, you had the handbag thing, and Bethesda went on holiday while the game was in its dark stages. I get it I do. The games they push out like Rust, Elder Scrolls, Fallout are big demanding games. Quite literally impossible to come out polished and bug free. They want PLAYERS to ‚Äú break the game‚Äù to begin the process of patching nerfing etc, to a much larger degree than most other games ‚Äòtis tru... but you grind it out and play thru cause at the end of the day very titles would have a player base stick it out until they can address all these things and they still don‚Äôt turn out perfect. Any other game and we‚Äôd delete and be like man that was trash. But Alas we know the the potential is there, and we keep coming back for more. Skyrim riddled with glitches bugs, won awards for years. Trust the Process.
---
Undercutting you at 24,000 caps!!!
---
But don't vendor bots sell plans for like 3-4x the value it has listed for them? Why wouldn't it be fair for someone to ask more than the listed price but considerably less than vendor bots?
---
"perfers to pay"
---
active on r/piracy
---
pick one...
---
bad troll is bad
---
The whole point of caps for me at this point is the infinite loop of buy plans, get caps and repeat. At this point that is what end game is for me.

I have only moved once. I was in Flatwoods up the hill across  from the ag building for a long time, was exploring the very southern tip of the savage divide one day and found a spot and thought it would be a neat place to set up a camp. I considered it for a while but never actually moved. Then one day a friend had the su shine meadows workshop and was attacked by a group of griefers that didn't want the workshop, just wanted to fight, they somehow found our nearby camps and destroyed them both. At that point I moved, I love my new area, it's literally on the water, not much bothers me down there. Problem is, a YouTube video showcased it recently and now more and more are moving down there. I did set up a Flatwoods camp on 2 alts though.
---
This might be me and I did not do this on purpose. I will move my vending machine back a little further. By the way are there turrets and two water purifiers there?

Equip the Pharma Farma perk, available at L3 for a 40/60/80% improvement in your chances, and hit Whitesprings for a good mix of all chems.  Arktos Pharma, Watoga EMS, and AVR Medical are all good.  Anywhere there are crowned (location) enemies, they have additional loot and often its Stimpacks.
---
Otherwise, buy the recipe from the med vendor in the Enclave bunker.  I thinks its 125 caps.  Recipe needs 2 antiseptic, 1 steel, and 1 blood.
---
Happy harvesting!
---
so what would you price an unbuyable plan set for? say, the x01 power armor quantum paint? 
---
theoretically, everyone can get it for free. in practise, not everyone knows how to, or don't want to server hop a thousand times.
---
Do you also know how to decrypt the atomic missile code sequence?
---
I don't think this will work, as prices change all the time, and what today costs 1 caps, tomorrow can be sold at 10.
---
It's a healthy world of marketing possibilities.. If someone has something another player needs, he is free to set his own desired price. It's then the buyer's decision, whether he wants to spend this particular amount of money or not.
---
When demands are high, prices will go up - it's absolutely normal.
---
Think Uber for a second: when there is higher demand for cars, prices go up substantially.
---
I appreciate the possibility of travelling for an hour, server-hopping, losing caps due to jumping from camp to camp, and then finding some rare recipy or a plan for a much lower price - it feels fun, rewarding. It's a world of trade and it doesn't need to be regulated.
---
Well thats really weird if they do lol. Especially considering legendaries like Perfect Storm and modded melee weapons like the burning pitchfork that actually cause burning dont work.
---
No, that was not what I meant. We had difficulty having the game register the reviving.
---
Yep! I'm working my way through the F76 side of things right now and enjoying it. Really love the depth there accumulated in this series / world.
---
Are you gonna be on in afew hours?
---
I haven't tried these yet, but does taking chems or food that buff strength work? Just a thought not sure if it works
---
Tick blood with butcher's bounty.  Make into blood packs with Chemist and Super Duper then into stimpacks with chemist and super duper.  Tick blood can be found around vault 76 at the lumber yard and the moonshiner's shack.  It also spawns at top of the world as well sometimes.  Make sure you purchase the stimpack recipe form the medical wing at the enclave bunker in whitesprings.
---
Maybe use some chems or alcohol?
---
I'm sure they're aware by now that the original release was a mistake.
---
I think my ini files are causing me to find Vendor camps with no floors and the vendors just disembodied heads and hands, creepy and annoying, I hate editing ini files but love the two mods I have.
---
Look what you did you little jerk.
---
And thus, a new PvP Meta was born. (Assuming they add it)
---
Read: Inflation
---
I did that back when the plan was level locked. Don't listen to the "WS, lol!" chucklers; more of an adventure to go the long road for it.
---
Wait, are people upset about that? It's gonna regen by the time they get to their camp anyway. Go ahead and take all my water and crops lol. I have a farmhouse for a reason

Yeah using a melee on Xbox currently &amp; it‚Äôs more than bloodbugs any flying enemy has a 0% chance no matter what you do. Not sure if it‚Äôs a glitch on my side or other melee people are experiencing it.
---
Well, time to build myself a little shop i guess.
---
Sounds rather difficult to do, it would take a lot graphs and opinions, but I really like the idea though
---
Maybe with the right equipment and aid items you can get your strength up with out having to respec skill points?
---
Just look in your local dumpster and search under the piles of babies.
---
I used this wedsite: https://nukacrypt.com/
---
Plans were always .25
---
There *was* something about ghouls vs. clothing in patch notes
---
The helmet thing was subject to change at some point no matter what.
---
I also think there was a small boost OR the cost of things was adjusted
---
I could be wrong but it seems like I'm getting a bit more out of decorating the camp post-patch 9
---
I know somewhere in the southwest ash heap there is a little group of shacks with some cats. Squirrels or rabbits can usually be found north of the whitesprings bunker. If not, I know that wilderness east of whitesprings/top of the world has squirrels from time to time
---
Haha you will never catch me!!
---
Always squirrels on the way into Whitesprings from Whitespring Station.  Head towards the parking lot.
---
Yep, scrappable and unlike things like bottles that don't automatically scrap with "scrap all" because they are used in crafting things like molotov cocktails, the broken cameras scrap with "scrap all."
---
OK, don't compare cross platform prices, they are VASTLY different. You can actually buy GG end game weapons and armor on PS4 / XB1 for caps. You can't buy those at all on PC. In general, PC prices are inflated a lot. I don't know why that is exactly, but it is (maybe more duping of nuka colas for free caps on PC has inflated the market).
---
Got locked in a house last night. Had to fast travel to the nearest location then walk back. Was a nice house too.
---
I have one room locked at my camp, a shed with my generator &amp; switches powering my stuff.
---
Definitely worth putting your camps power switch, if one is used, behind a lock. Can easily turn off someone's beacon.
---
I have absolutely np with the difficulty or grindy aspect of it.
---
 My only main gripe that still havnt gotten around is having to need another players. that one revive in the water... So far no luck. I have been waiting next to the camp lake where you start the quest but people just leave when they me wave and beckon.
---
I dont mind them. They're usually guys that like to travel around with their camps and got sick of not being able to place them down. Personally, i think They're ugly and i want my camp to be be a sexy home, but i totally get why dudes do it. Immersion be damned, we're here to have fun in our own ways.
---
I never thought of that. Thank you for the idea
---
Interesting, I didn't notice plans weight before
---
They said they changed the clothing for the ghouls.
---
Haven't noticed the headwear change, but I'll look.
---
Plans always weighed .25 ;)
---
I knew it! You had me second guessing myself, like maybe I did over exaggerate. I got all embarrassed and went into hiding.
---
I still could have over exaggerated though. It just felt like more than four stairs.
---
Repairing over 200% durability no longer gives you weapon or armor a boost in dmg etc..
---
My chainsaw is only doing 4 dmg again at 200% where it was doing 30+
---
Finally a use for that Diner Door!
---
Not free, they should validate your parking stub tho
---
You think that‚Äôs bad?  People leave the lights on when they leave my place.  What am I?  Thunder Mountain?  Electricity ain‚Äôt free!
---
I wish I could get a self-closing door. I‚Äôd pay atoms for that.
---
I‚Äôll try it. Thank you.
---
Has anyone noticed that repairing weapons and armor past 100% no longer increases your damage resistance and attack values from the base value?
---
Lock your virtual door in a virtual game because someone didn‚Äôt virtually close the door, really?
---
yep. Elevators were cool.
---
Supposedly they want you to submit a support ticket directly to Bethesda, but yeah, that requires either stopping to document a ton of stuff or popping entirely out of the game immediately to file a ticket. It's simply not a solution many people are going to use. In-game reporting is the way forward.
---
Come back to light, all is not lost.
---
I‚Äôll try that. Thanks.
---
But where do I have to enter the code?
---
Reflect melee: out of scope, as are the mutations that trigger on melee enemies.
---
Rolling pin: wikis have sparse or outdated data about mods. Please post any relevant ingame info.
---
This is me as well. I made a ton of caps last night, and then spent 50% of it, buying new plans from vendor bots.
---
But I can craft heavy combat armor now, and hasty 
---
38 recievers for combat rifles, even though I've never needed to before, but just in case! 
---
I may have a problem.
---
I wish it was a little darker OD green but still like it!
---
&gt;Yeah, kudos to them, but maybe - just maybe - next time they work this hard BEFORE the release?
---
They did. The Creation Engine was an engine solely for Bethesda's single-player games, so when BGS Austin and Maryland set about working on the engine to overhaul it to support multiplayer, it was an enormous task. They had to completely take out the Atlas component of the engine core and then had to insert Quake netcode. I believe Jason Schreier noted all of this took a good chunk of the 3 years that went into making the game. Other developers have noted how difficult it is to turn a single-player engine into one that supports multiplayer.
---
(Humorously enough, Creation was forked off from Gamebryo, which itself evolved from NetImmerse which was originally used for MMO's. Goes to show just how much has been changed and upgraded over the years.)
---
The game launched in the state it did not just because of engine-related issues, but also because Bethesda as a studio have had zero experience with multiplayer games and even Austin hasn't really done anything on this scale when it was Battleborn from what I could gather. Bethesda's luck with spinoffs also seems to be rather bad, what with Redguard and Battlespire almost sinking the company before they made Morrowind, and then ESO and 76 both originally having such troublesome launches before being turned around.
---
&gt;INB4 Starfield is an utter disaster like FO76 and needs two years to work even remotely close to the advertised product...
---
Considering that wasn't the case with Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 or 4, I doubt that's gonna happen. All of their games have always been and will always be buggy (but even that is something they have consistently improved on for their single-player games, with 4 having far less bugs than say Skyrim or 3) but those issues were exemplified in 76 because the genre is simply one in which that kind of QA stuff matters a lot more.
---
Is that inside whitesprings? Also thank you!
---
Dang. It got dirty before evening mentioning the other Olympic Weightlifting event... the Snatch.
---
Coz enemies can spawn inside if unlocked
---
Hope it works for ya good luck man.
---
Yeah I think it's a typo, because I didn't see the plan for plain old Optimized Bracers
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a backpack mod?
---
They would have probably said the price was too high if you had priced them at 10 caps.
---
Griefers gotta grief.
---
What ones are you looking for? I have a ton of mods, if I have them you can have them. I can also watch out for them.
---
You have to follow the quest inside the missile silo.
---
As PC users I think we've got it probably the easiest. I've actually backed mine up, mostly as I was using a few as desktops on other computers. 
---
Not saying these are bad ideas, but the consoles have a strict photo limit &amp; iirc PS4 isn't very easy to get screens from.
---
....and gone
---
You can find rabbits and squirrels near the WS maintenance entrance/bunker. Cats can be found milling around a billboard near the tracks by the WS train station. I think it‚Äôs the one on the hill behind the mine where uranium fever is. I‚Äôve seen cats there before but I didn‚Äôt yesterday when I looked. Maybe someone has a definitive answer on the cats.
---
Dang son, thats some serious ammo eating.
---
Good God I can't believe Bethesda hasn't fixed this.  More unbelievable is the fact that it was in the game to begin with. So much of this game is copied and pasted from Fallout 4, so why couldn't they have just copied and pasted the building mechanic? This crap never happened with stairs if Fallout 4.
---
The Leaf-eaters rejoiced when they no longer had to watch their backs in the nuclear wasteland.  Pity. They could have become stronger but chose the path of weakness.

Don‚Äôt use them unless to make diluted. Healing Salve is free and my go to.
---
PS4 here and I had the same issues
---
I'm up here you big horse's ass!
---
Mine is tick blood (butchers bounty for more) then chemist and super dupe. 2 tick bloods have the chance of turning into...not sure on exact number but a lot of diluted stims lol
---
I like it. To a degree.
---
Finding out stimpack diffusers aren't acquirable part way through doing that challenge is annoying.
---
Making a frog jar and captureing a frog, only for the challenge to not update when i create frog habitats is also annoying.
---
Having spent several hours and lots of literally crossing from one end of the wasteland to the other and back again getting pictures of various things, only to be held up by a bug... Not fun.
---
If it had worked, and I was able to unlock the last part of the challenge, then yes, it would be very enjoyable.
---
As it is... its annoying.
---
Shit. I have my camp on a northwest cliff. I didn't even think about this when I set up vending, last night. I've had it there for a good while now. I have been thinking about rebuilding, so this may be a good excuse to demo and start from scratch.
---
That's most likely when Wastelanders is coming out
---
They also said the atom shop would be cosmetic only. Don't "expect" the truth from them. But conversely give them credit when they are honest.
---
&gt;And anyway we all know the person who made the final decision to go ahead and release in November was Todd Howard
---
Um, we don't. Todd isn't even on the publishing team and he wasn't even game director, I don't know why you think he was the one that decided to release the game.
---
It sounds like the backpacks are non-transferable, which doesn't make sense for immersion, but is necessary from a gameplay perspective.
---
I'd not bother now though mate, with camps being visible (and non destructible) I think I read that a griefer could pick your lock to become hostile just to smash your camp
---
Its a junk generator
---
Harriers are dogs
---
Mom?  Mom, is that you?  Sorry, I'll close the door next time!
---
Ha you‚Äôre wishing. I‚Äôve put mine at 10c and not sold one.üò¢
---
Yeah.  If only it wasn't silent when it opened/closed!
---
I think it's at 8.
---
I‚Äôll help with that one now. I need it too. Adding.
---
Still need it? In sv650y on ps4 I need it too
---
It's priceless. 
---
I would trade for an entire set of top armor. For me it would be Unyielding combat armor with +1 strength and the working +25 rad resist.
---
Dream big.
---
Because he's in charge of the company and this was the company's biggest release of the year. There's absolutely zero chance it gets released without his sign-off. That's how major product launches work in product management.
---
I am online
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar
---
Once you craft a frog jar, when you aim at a live frog, it will show the option to Collect the frog.  Then you'll have a Captured Frog.  There are also frogs at Twin Lakes.
---
Explosive energy weapons don't drop
---
Xbox and PC possibly
---
How do you get healing salve?
---
They're called a barn star
---
How did you have the plan learned for bracers when it wasn't available before yesterday?
---
Are you on PC?
---
yea they don't show up under the daily tab , but like i said my quest is completly broke it didn't even give me the scout uniform or the frog jar unlockable cause it thinks i had already started it
---
Yep, I wasn't too pleased myself when they dropped that phantom nerf, I re-read the patch notes several times to see if it was mentioned but no they did it without mentioning it to see if anyone would notice.
---
My chainsaw is as good as trash now and my 3* hunters mole gauntlet not only has a drastic dmg reduction it is also no longer as effective against most large creatures like deathclaws etc..
---
Blood leaf, soot flower and boiled water

Google mounted wendigo plans. You come across a bunch of cats on the way

Hi there. As someone who's been a part of MANY MMOS with unregulated economies let me just say:   
---
**Welcome to HELL.**   
---
People often forget how bad it can be in games where the devs aren't manipulating the economy via the prices on certain key items that can only be purchased via NPC vendors.
---
You have NO idea how happy I was to discover that the crosshairs line up with the metal sights on my Gatling Gun!!! This has been an issue since day 1.
---
You've never spent any time in the country, have you?
---
I knew there was a reason I stayed in PA even though it's worse than useless against enemy players.
---
Um
---
What system do you play on
---
Did typing out shoulders to the wheel sound right to you?

Gonna be honest, I‚Äôm rethinking my decision to go into development

I may change my mind on locking, but I‚Äôve learned the hard way that mobs can open unlocked doors. (Even 4 legged ones)
---
I haven‚Äôt had a griefer in a couple of months, so not real concerned about that but I get a slow but steady stream of random enemy spawns in the field by my house.
---
Mutants, Scorched, Mongrels, Mole and Rad Rats etc. if I‚Äôm afk for a bathroom trip or a beer run, I don‚Äôt want to come back to my corpse awaiting respawn.
---
I do have the camp set up for visitors on my team with multiple armor stations, crafting benches etc, water purifiers and crops (all inside) , maybe I need to be more welcoming in that regard, but I tend to think there won‚Äôt be water or harvestable crops when in need them if the place is open. 
---
Food for thought.
---
I believe I have seen them mention it in the past though I am not 100% sure
---
I was wondering how I was going to complete the revival task since I only play alone these days. Sheep Imposter event popped up so I joined and almost instantly had someone I could revive to fulfill the requirement.
---
Not sure you understood what I was saying.
---
Currently people are forcing other player to pvp to steal their caps and junk.  If there was no reward they would just be spending countless hours breaking their gear and wasting ammunition.
---
Currently there is also small subset of players who believe that they can explain away this kind of poor behavior because the believe they are "raiders" and being a jerk is what raiders do for a living (stealing resources from other players).  Again, no reward means they are literally just being a jerk, hence my comment about some people are just born jerks, not everyone, just some.  Cause even without a reward some people are only happy making others miserable and will kill other players using exploits regardless of what's in it for them and what's in it for them is they get off on others misery.  Cute, I know.
---
Now if you want to roleplay a raider and you only do this on survival then, men, whatever, its survival.  I actually applaud you, go nuts.  But when you use exploits to kill other players on adventure that dont want to pvp at all that's the problem.
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense. As long as caps are being removed from the economy through fast travel, tax, and cap sinks like sheepsquatch, a limit doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
On Xbox, I haven‚Äôt had a single issue and the group I play with hasn‚Äôt had a issue aswell
---
Yeah, as a former lifeguard who did Olympic weightlifting and the throwing events for Track and Field, I was pleased each time I saw a question that let me use my knowledge.
---
Thats dope. I have a ton saved from when all the duping was going on, including a TSE Laser Rifle that I never sold to market so it couldnt be duped.
---
As for price they used to go between 6-8K, but if you can‚Äôt find them anymore Id say double would suffice.
---
Im no expert in the current economy though.
---
And here I thought it was an Easter egg for starfield and we'd be piloting barns thru worm holes in intergalactic space.
---
good bot
---
Unfortunately; VATS with melee has been broken for a long time
---
far as i remember the only ones you cant find anymore are the tesla, flamer, and cryolater with ts &amp; explosive rolls.. the reason was because they werent ballistic weapons (no shell/bullet) a gauss rifle can still be found as a TSE.
---
You on Xbox?
---
[](/celestiahappy)Personal Computer, my friend.
---
I personally sold a ton for 250 each.
---
As far as the American centric questions, the game setting is in america, it makes sense for the questions to based on american history. 
---
And the solo thing, if you participated in events I hear it is easy to get the revive an ally. The theme of the quest is in part "helping others". So you have to look at the theme of the quest, before determining if it is not a good design.
---
Did you have film in it? You have to reload the film like a clip of ammo.
---
Yeah, i was actually only thinking of the fusion core extractors. People think I don‚Äôt see them lurking lol
---
Weird, I haven't had an issue until now.
---
Lmfao someone was selling the white sheep outfit (body 5k, helmet 3,999) I truly am mind blown
---
Dude if this game gets people into a library it is totally made of win
---
&gt;Because he's in charge of the company 
---
He's in charge of Bethesda Game Studios at Maryland, not Bethesda Softworks as a whole. You are right that he obviously did also give the go-ahead, but the lead doesn't take sole decisions and most of the upper management and important stuff has to do so. The lead for this game was Austin studio's head anyways, Todd just served as a producer and not the director.
---
That‚Äôs true. Man.
---
No on Xbox
---
[](/celestiablush1)Your addictions don't go away when you die now, so it's pretty bad ass.
---
Yeah, I had a full clip and a few extra
---
Won‚Äôt be able to help you sorry
---
It showed up on the PA stand when I crafted arms... bracers was already there. 
---
Bright headlight and the one for chest (forgot name but adds +1 strength)
---
4ish what timezone?
---
I've sold a bunch of bobbleheads at 100-150 depending on their use value. I would say maybe 60-80 caps for a fully charged fusion core. Not sure about magazines, haven't gotten around to them yet, but some are far more valuable than others
---
No worries my guy
---
Not only does it bug out and not allow a swing when it should, leaving it at 0%. Sometimes swings just don‚Äôt even connect or do damage when they clearly should.
---
Thanks big pharma.
---
Will delete the post
---
.305 ammo is a popular ammo i believe. I sell pretty much everything way under what its recommend price is
---
I was making room for the new vendor add ons and trying to build a couple floors - walls. They wouldn't attach even though they had the green outline and I had the materials. I would exit out of workshop and then back in and it would work. I was finishing up and added a wall then my system crashed, it was sorta crazy. I was disconnected from the server then I had this weird error code window pop up then disappear.
---
I started on a new server and it was much better! I felt bad for the folks that just launched a nuke I was going to go to, thank god I didn't. But yeah just one big crash and that was it. I rarely have any crashes PS4 but when I do it's usually when there are new quests, new additions to the game, lots of folks playing..
---
I saw a video of someone playing recently and it looks really dumb now. Dudes moon jumping in spot in pvp. It‚Äôs so damned cartoony seeing that.
---
Motion-Assisted Servos
---
Ps4 has native social media upload feature to facebook and twitter.
---
Does it pop up randomly or is it triggered upon arrival..??
---
I failed the archery exam like 5 times in a row and  I am still laughing my ass off
---
In fairness, your price list is not platform-specific.
---
I used to have a sign up next to my front door that said "Close the damn door when you go" for this very reason. I don't care if you take some purified water, just close my door man!
---
i‚Äôve had the same problem a lot, i have it favorited so i just switch weapons and try again but even that doesnt always work. ‚Äúreloading‚Äù usually works but when it‚Äôs full it sometimes breaks completely, hope they fix it soon
---
But mom, my OP gear isn't OP anymore....
---
Their effect on super mutants is laughable.  It‚Äôs a silly concept and now a niche joke weapon kinda like a ghoul slayers gamma gun.
---
I thought it was all energy weapons from what I was told
---
It‚Äôs only a bad nerf if it affects you personally, in reddit. I felt the same way about the tse nerf so I‚Äôm not judging
---
Friend request sent! Thanks bud!
---
That's a great idea! It would kick ass to have him as a boss raid!
---
Agreed. My focus is selling stuff, not earning a buck
---
What is the going rate for fusion cores I have like 50 at 100% that I want to move. 100 caps fair or too much?
---
It's ok, I sell them to Canadians at lower prices, to offset what you're paying.
---
I'm not sure it is intentional. Mine has been locked for a long time when Camps were attack able. I spent some time putting up and decorating a vendor area outside of my locked building last night, and it is still locked. Why? Only because I forgot to take the lock off.
---
Please yes. When you have 4 vending machines down that's 120 items you have to set using a slider that under/over shoots on each item. 
---
\*Great patch tho. Would be a great QOL improvement.
---
Invest in calibrated shocks.
---
Use the Whitespring Service Entrance once you've completed the Bunker Buster quest to provide access.  Quick right turn down the stairs and it's the second hallway on the left.  There are signs once you're in the bunker, and they're probably better than my memory!
---
And everyone I talked to said it's a legacy weapon
---
I actually though the same thing as you, just assumed that charity marathons have some specified length.
---
Unfortunate.   I have some junkies swingspeed stuff but I am PS4.
---
Sure, they can try whatever they want. That's my point.
---
About 8K of it was ammo I have saved up over hundreds of hours. It won't be like this everyday! First 20 minutes somebody cleared me out of my several thousand shotgun shells.
---
Good to know. Thank you
---
But did they need to make so many junk legrndaries? I saw a guys post where he gave ideas for 10 legensary effects that weren't OP at all but more on par with the good ones like blooodied, AA, furious, ect... 
---
The fact that most of them are trash seems like a concious descision. They only want a few good ones in the loot pool. That's why we'd all be clones if we could pick our legendaries. They're horribly imbalanced.
---
I wish I could play on a private server that's invite only. It could be like F04 and a person can have numerous settlements and instead of other players that introduce NPCS. I wish they would have done the game like that. So you can play it like it's FO4 and invite a couple of friends to your world where you could all play together in your unique storyline.
---
As long as i get more money from AI vendors
---
Sell serums for 500 a pop. I can't spends caps fast enough to dump. Had to take them out before I maxed.
---
I'm not sure it is intentional. Mine has been locked for a long time when Camps were attackable. I spent some time putting up and decorating a vendor area outside of my locked building last night, and it is still locked. Why? Only because I forgot to take the lock off.
---
I lost way more than two camps, but I never put effort into my camps early on because I knew I‚Äôd lose them.  I‚Äôm upset because they were meant to be permanent now and the game STILL took them away from me.
---
It literally says PC Suggested Price list in the title lol.
---
Yeah its been fun setting up my shop and looking through others. Found a few deals on my end but only sold some stealthboys last night. The issue I am having is that I am not putting out my better gear in the vendor because their sale would insta cap max me. So most of my 5k+ gear sits.
---
On my way to your server
---
That's a weird bug.
---
I am fine with people taking whatever. I even have a table labeled "donations - free!" with a paper bag of stuff I don't want. Last night though, a guy got into my power room, and I am not sure how. It is behind a locked door and has a switch in there to shut my place down and close all my garage doors in case of pvp. He just kept turning my switch on and off, which was shutting my vending machines down and opening and closing my garage doors. I had like 8 people at my camp trying to buy stuff and I just had to l log off. What a jerk. There was no benefit to doing it, I give away stuff for free and none of my doors are locked except the small power room. He was just doing it to be annoying. That is not courteous or respectful of my camp.
---
You won‚Äôt survive if your can‚Äôt adjust. Applies to real life too.
---
I‚Äôd feel worse if you didn‚Äôt spend half of this post trying to pick a fight with non pa users. Honestly dude I hope you guys get a refrigeration slot, idgaf. Takes nothing from me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yep that'd be the cause.
---
Saw suggested on here, after the patch is installed go into the Fallout76.ini &amp; copy the relevant line (sResourceArchiveList) and paste that into the custom.ini making sure to retain the mods ba2 file names.
---
Your more than likely missing one of the 05XXXXXX.ba2 files required by new update. I was missing 03 for awhile causing strange issues. I did the steps above last night as I couldn't place anything in CAMP &amp; it sorted it. Also had issues with melee hits registering before that was fixed by correcting the ini.
---
Some kind soul usually will post a PSA here about the new additions to the ini file as well after a patch goes live. The mod authors on Nexus are very good about it as well.
---
That gear really wasn‚Äôt that bad. A crit could go through any of it, and it doesn‚Äôt work while being staggered. Bloodied builds could just be Gamma Gunned. 
---
Now the issue is there is absolutely no defense to the most powerful weapon in the game. People with AA handmades now rule the wasteland 100%.
---
Not bugged for me. Which one u cant finish?
---
I run around in power armor almost exclusively. Excavator -w- shocks named Uber. Give me a backpack and I can carry the world.
---
Yep. I saw that and was like "I'm out".
---
Could care less about the water.   Just stay out of my corn!
---
The damn things only bear once every few hours!
---
Mmmhmm use travel agents goes down a bit!
---
Vault 76 is the only free Fast Travel vault. Your workshops are free though, once you claim them.
---
[](/celestiahappy)Well, I appreciate the thought man.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha
---
Is that before or after the quest?
---
This always happens to me when I die... I can only ever respawn at the vault
---
That has too be my biggest question. What is a reasonable price for things? I have been a solo player and never sold things to anyone or really bought anything from people but serums. So i jumped from camp to camp and saws somethings i based my prices on. 
---
Legendary's are a different sort. i saw one guy have 1 -3\* going from 1 - 250 caps. Then a bunch of others looked like they were selling 1\* for over 1000 caps 2\* for over 2000 caps and 3\* for over 3000 caps. 
---
Hard to gauge what to sell things for. :(
---
Shite I better get on that. 
---
I have way too much saved up. Teslas, Lasers, Gauss, Gatling etc
---
Entomologist, as i said before, bought the wing but didn't complete the challenge
---
Insta-kill for melee?
---
My advice is to craft them. Blood packs are the hardest but that can be farmed with tick blood at Point Pleasant
---
Quests or crafting.
---
I irradiated myself to low health, threw a frag and skirted the edge of it's radius. Killed me first time, downed the second. My friend couldn't manage for whatever reason, so we did encryptid and he went down to robots in the little pool of water.
---
What I just did was I got my friend - I attacked him and he attacked back - then he ran into the water to go down - then I added him to team and it let me revive him!
---
The flamer mods make them shoot fire like the flamer, blue and green no less. The green fire is very striking honestly.
---
I just want my flaming chainsaw to heal honestly lol
---
I just sold mine for 15k
---
Way to expensive for ammo
---
Yup! I see major price drops coming! BOS combat armor plans are at vendor in Grafton now  for 95 caps each... people were paying 5000 each last week!
---
Hunger or thirst don‚Äôt actually kill you, they‚Äôll deplete your up to next to nothing, but you won‚Äôt die. Not as long as you‚Äôre somewhere safe from enemies and preferably crouching with chameleon armor on. Rubber banding is just going into camera mode and literally putting a rubber band around your thumb sticks so there‚Äôs some constant input. This keeps you from being kicked for being idol too long.
---
I wonder if it's an Autostim armor or something like that
---
Camps can still be destroyed is why, lmao. It's even easier now with enemies spawning on fast travel
---
I just keep mine locked up when not needed

You have to be in shallow water. Wavy Willards or the little lakes around toxic valley work.

come get the wing from me. Go to vendor, sell it and buy back from the vendor. Thats how i did it. Thought vending machine will work.
---
Really isn‚Äôt any adjusting to being demolished by AA-Handmades with the armor, and now that it‚Äôs gone, still being demolished. There isn‚Äôt many good defensive options in this supposedly ‚ÄúRPG‚Äù game
---
Go on? I‚Äôm interested in this new game!
---
I wish I knew a hundred percent, it'd be a good debate to have on here or if the Bethesda to actually chimed in
---
Gotta find someone like that in real life and retire early.
---
So that‚Äôs what jealousy sounds like.  Good to know.
---
mammal - 5' 7" bat wingspan, blue whale, humans stand up straight
---
So gonna leave it open and some food on your bed for rad roaches
---
Dunno but I'll be fixing them and selling them on Xbox
---
Be right back
---
I tried to experiment with this just briefly yesterday, and I found no difference post-patch.
---
Will have to give it another shot later.
---
It is pretty strange when you compare it to how we used to be.
---
Nice can you tell me the stars and effects?
---
Turns out he is currently abusing Thor in Endgame
---
Repairing to 200% no longer raises weapon damage; confirmed on multiple melee weapons. My guess is that by fixing the Grognak‚Äôs Axe, they may have broken the repair process.
---
Did you get rid of the custom ini too?
---
Monster!
---
Should that be the case (blech!) then these things better be damn cheap!  
---
I originally hoped for some method to build your own custom legendaries... that hope went South long ago.
---
Then, with the daily Scrip limit, I worried that good weapons would be incredibly expensive (similar to Serums, say) where you'd need to farm Scrip for several days before you could afford one.
---
Now, adding in the relatively low max total (compared the daily acquisition limit and max total for caps), I think you're correct: this is going to be a "pay and pray" system for dumping three-star rolling pins at our feet. And, if that's the case, a single "roll" needs to be pretty damn cheap (at *least* less than the daily acquisition limit).
---
Sad, tho'. Assuming this is the system, it's only perpetuating mindless legendary creature grinding even more, not less.
---
Lmao
---
Ah yes making the process even slower by slapping ‚Äúbeta‚Äù in front of the title for longer. The beta is what started the hysteria friend. I can joust with you forever but I‚Äôll leave it at this.. ‚ÄúEnding‚Äù the beta sooner was a form of damage control for the massive wave of negative player reviews and hysteria surrounding it. I don‚Äôt agree with the method whatsoever but oh well right? No game is finished at release, and that 60 dollar price tag line gets thrown around a lot. Would it be acceptable at 50? 40? 20? At what point do you stop being pissed off that the game wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfinished‚Äù at launch. It‚Äôs not a game with linear story or some crap, the conversation of FO76 is a fluid one and crying over launch isn‚Äôt gonna help anything. And if it‚Äôs soooooo horrible that you just can‚Äôt bare it any longer..... go play Minecraft.

"let's nerf everything to the ground until nothing's effective anymore and the game's even more of a chore to play"
---
bloodied doesn't even affect pvp, why the hell you want it nerfed?
---
Good job Bethesda for hitting a blow to the idiot griefers who destroy user C.A.M.P.s to piss people off.
---
You may want to add that they autoscrap when found...
---
Wow thats sounds really cool. I might have to try a science build next. Flaming Chainsaw with heals would be epic.
---
Yes! I love quests. I want achievements. More more more!! I even loved the quizzes!
---
Are we not able to make caps if we are not online?  I was assuming that your CAMP is still there even if you are not online.  and its not until you log back in that it moves to a new server.  Am I dead wrong?  
---
I guess I'm basing this on the idea that I have never seen a CAMP disappear.  Seems so silly to me now that I think of it :)
---
haha
---
Random worked for me
---
Or if the bumpers worked with a bit more predictable jump. 25 or 50 or 100
---
Mate I'm not jealous of being a petulant ignoramus.
---
I am actually finding that players spawn at the center as well. Its the location that you initially set your camp down on. Oddly enough I find that I do not spawn at that position at my own camp.
---
I‚Äôm having tons of fun my build is great barely worry about armor repairing
---
What tests do you have to do in the game?
---
They should make it a torso mod.
---
but u got the backpack already, why u doing the tadpole challenges?
---
Worked for me yesterday. I'm on PC.
---
Came back after leaving Appalachia for a bit. Issue still there. \_le sigh\_. Guess i'll start an Alt to try out the PVP servers...
---
Not me.  Unfortunately for you I will still be around.
---
But near the scout camp is a great poison water that fast kill you. Is it a bad solution?
---
/u/LadyDevann Now that we have Frog Jars, can we please have Firefly Jars, too?

You can't inspect? I could've sworn I was looking at this yesterday...

They do drop Deathclaw Hands, maybe that was the onscreen message?

Place mines in your field. It's great fun.

I'm saying this as someone who is the director for products that are responsible for $10m+ of annual revenue at my company: if you're releasing a marquee product at your company, the head of your company gets to decide the release date. Product managers, like game directors, get to have input. They don't get to make the decision.
---
Here are some ideas to help.
---
1) Build a few foundations and walls around them. Hollow inside. Keep the door locked. Make the walls windows so no one wants to break in. Just boring crops. I do the same for my junk extractor.
---
2) Don't setup a vendor. After yesterday, everyone is finally visiting camps. It's a good thing. 
---
I'm gonna keep taking all unlocked crops and water to make my own booze and adhesive. Thanks for your contributions :)
---
Yep, these are the 3 badges I ended up completing last night.  It is possible with those 3, and likely the fastest route right now?
---
You're welcome!  I left the purifier unlocked.  There's also one inside the house in the basement.  And a junk extractor.  I literally can't harvest them fast enough to keep them empty, so help yourself!
---
To get tokens, with them i can complete the Tadpole collection
---
&gt; (But I'm gonna pass on the 250c treasure maps and 500c bobbleheads, sorry.)
---
Damn I thought I was over charging with 100c maps and 100c bobbleheads and 50c mags
---
Taxation is theft
---
If you combine it with Bloodsucker it totally should.
---
So 3 less people exploiting broken shotgun damage? 
---
Oh, noes! I now has the vapors!
---
You can't (in any way that I've read about) set your spawn point.  You can only build around it IF you are setting up a new camp for this.
---
I have a camp (and I'm sure a lot of people do too) that is site-specific, and can't be readily adjusted.  If you're visiting a lot of shops, I guarantee you'll see plenty of sites where the shopping experience isn't perfect, but there's nothing to be done about the landing zone short of tearing down and rebuilding.
---
I don't use doors, but some people do (I know I'm crazy) ... but I do like to shut them after I go in to prevent various animals from romping around and destroying your inside.
---
Fire breathers requires an exam which was easy but still tedious. 
---
You have to literally go to the DMV.
---
You have to take three exams for the pioneer update.
---
Yeah they definitely disappear when you log off and no transactions are possible til you log back in
---
Do you have 4th issue of astoundingly awesome tales by any chance ?
---
so this isn't free?
---
Consistently every 20 minutes for several hours. I'm sure it's related player vending. I also noticed once I put something on-sale I couldn't scroll down the just of items‚ÄîI had to get out and go back into the vending menu.
---
You could just lob a grenade under your feet in semi-shallow water, and that should down you I believe, I mean you still up for it? I need to do both revive and Revive in water, Pc right?
---
Oh you're totally right. I could have sworn 96 was free travel too, but it's not.
---
One of the camps I dropped in on yesterday had a pack of radrats. I killed them, but that's what really reminded me to check the doors. If I'd not been there and those got inside, instead of attacking the crap outside they might have wrecked the rad shower, etc.
---
You need the wing back ?
---
I haven't scraped anything. I can't even do the mission anymore it's disappeared
---
I just met up with that guy today and got a 2nd, scrapped it, can now make them.
---
Yeah part of the new scouts thing.
---
Haha. I'll take water and crops when I see them too!
---
I think there's a misunderstanding here: I didn't Todd had nothing to do with the project or that he didn't sign off on it. I'm saying Todd Howard was *not* the game director for this project, that would be Jeff Gardiner. He was the executive producer, and while he did sign off on it by virtue of being upper management and holding that position, it wasn't his call alone to make or his fault alone. The rest of the management signs off on it too.
---
It‚Äôs been so nice staying stocked up on crops and purified water since yesterday‚Äôs update though! Just traveling to about 15 camps got me over 50 purified waters to sell to vendors
---
Yeah I got the bag relatively quick yesterday with a few friends. Just the green and tadpole skins are non-AS skins right now that I own
---
Yeah I'll be maxing out my TA card because of this.  It wasn't a priority at all until yesterday.
---
It was shocking to see how long it took to kill a level 5 super mutant with my explosive shotgun lol I could usually do it with 2 shots from a distance now it's like 5 shots from a distance. I will check out other weapons for sure now and change it up..
---
yea, sure
---
There are connectors that easily pass through ceilings.
---
There are 2 different kinds I use that work perfectly.
---
They look like a regular power conduits ( The ones you can stick on walls or ceilings or floors) but the have 1 tiny pipe Sticking out of it.  One of them points upwards 1 of them points downwards .
---
 If you connect them together you can usually get the one that points downwards sticking down through the ceiling,  Connect that 1 to your generators. Then just connect a wire to the one sticking outside of the roof to  Whatever you want powered.
---
Play around with them. If you connect two of the ones that point downwards together you can usually get it sticking down through the ceiling further.   Once you have the one that points downwards where you want it delete the other 1 and reconnect 1 that points upwards.
---
Sorry if that's confusing but it's the best way I found to run power lines through a building
---
Ok that should work for me. Cya then
---
Imagine those are school students.. still trying to find their way home. It's been so many years, and the last points of sanity they have are being spent on keeping themselves on track and sticking together as a group.
---
Shallow copies of their former selves.. never to find peace.
---
this musician challenge is bugged...sad
---
This needs to happen. I would love to see the design implemented.
---
I think what's happening is you're at a camp where the owner has logged out but the camp is still persisting. I camp a fairly popular spot, and sometimes at log in I'll literally watch someone else's camp de-render and then mine render in. Probably has to due with Bethesda wanting our camps to persist after we log out in some future update. I visited one or two camps yesterday that I couldn't inspect or buy anything. This is just my working theory.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs a communist robot so it probably doesn‚Äôt work....see what I did there?
---
Imagine being a game developer, having to cater to millions of people like them... I remember when Infinity Ward and Blizzard would get death threats when they nerfed things.

I appreciate the heads up!  As of now, I can't get the machine to reload its (empty) scrip bucket.  I wonder what the reload rate is.
---
The ultimate shopping spree!
---
You don't. People trying to team you from across the map probably have ulterior motives, but if they're in your base or close to it then I'd say always make contact first. 
---
I view it kind of as a lore extension of the game, since if I were trying to survive the wasteland and knew of raiders I'd be damn sure to be vet visitors or just avoid people altogether
---
Opposite here, after yesterday the game is better than ever! 
---
PvPers have their very own server to do whatever floats their boat! 
---
Adventure mode now is more challenging knowing it will take people more than 2 minutes to kill a SBQ... 
---
Game is better than ever.
---
When someone leaves their doors unlocked, I make it a point to unlock anything they have locked, kite the enemies that spawn on fast travel, and have them wreck as much of the base as possible.
---
This update has made it real easy to do it.
---
Yeahhh I‚Äôve noticed a few glitches since the recent patch, but nothing that extreme. Def gonna be watching this subreddit closely to see if there‚Äôs any reports of that kinda thing happening
---
I see. I had the quest disappear on me one time and just reapplied at the test terminal. The quests came back and I had lost no progress. As far as the bug parts, you may just have to relog to get a fresh batch of spawns.
---
no.
---
It's so fucking dumb. I didn't buy this shit to take exams.
---
You‚Äôll be so glad you have these plans. This gun has so many mods to unlock and can be great as a semi or full auto rifle.

I‚Äôm with the other poster too, keep making and scrapping the low level ones a little here and there and when you finally have a legendary one drop for you‚Äôll be able to mod it up into beast.

RIP my chainsaw üò©
---
Oh I understood.  What you‚Äôre saying is they should remove or change a core aspect of the game because a ‚Äúsmall subset‚Äù of the game is abusing it.  
---
Should you not drop junk when you die from a ghoul?  Anyone can come pick it up before you respawn so maybe that should be changed?  Sounds abusable.  
---
I mean it happens once then you know it can happen so you don‚Äôt fall for it again, right?  They should change the game because it happened to you once?  Sounds extreme doesn‚Äôt it?
---
What if I get attacked and killed, lose my junk and some caps but want to get those caps and some extra junk back in the process?  I can do that. The game gives me that option. Or maybe I‚Äôll just die again and lose more caps and junk.  Oh well I‚Äôll just make some marine tactical helmets out of the 800 fucking pounds of junk I have in my stash box and sell them to a vendor for more caps!  Like 30 a piece!  Wait a minute.. I didn‚Äôt even have room in my stash for that junk I lost anyways. Time to move on and continue enjoying the game instead of letting something so minor, in a video game no less, ruin my day. 
---
Take my junk or die trying.  Either way it‚Äôs of little consequence.
---
You can‚Äôt be in danger while trying to take photos
---
I've got one ..
---
Can‚Äôt do challenges, can‚Äôt do tadpole quest for backpack, lose my daily and weekly challenge atoms. Seems like a sneaky way to get people to buy atoms instead of grind.
---
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. No.
---
Half the stuff I have in the vendor is for 0 caps so I'm not nervous.
---
The owner of the machine has to be in the area in order for you inspect.
---
No problems so far. I had 6 machines up simultaneously between my main and my 2nd account.
---
You can set prices to 0, but not easily, so just pay attention.
---
I use that already with ionized meat. I carry other foods for buffs, like angler for max AP, various str, agi, and endurance boosts, luck bosts, etc.
---
You need any other magazines except the 4th issue of tales ?
---
I'll try that then to see if it works
---
OK, just checking because you mentioned Fallout76.ini but not Fallout76Custom.ini. That's all I got for you, sorry. Probably need to [open a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10).
---
yep tried to fast travel a couple times to some guys store only to be caught in a wall fast traveled to close spot and walked over some glitch of where they decide people to spawn at camps.
---
The Grinder? It had "recipes" that limited the output. You could *ensure* a gun of a certain type or a shield, etc. If this offers something similar, then I'd be good with it. If it's literally the same random generation as a creature, then, yeah - that's bullshit.
---
Even if they don't introduce Legendary power armor pieces (and it looks like they will), the chance that you'll get a specific weapon or armor type are what, 1-in-100 or more? With power armor it would be 1-in-130 or so? Then you have the actual legendary effects which are even less likely to be useful to you specifically.
---
Add to the equation that the system promotes the destruction of drops not useful to you rather than putting them directly into the world's economy and it's a recipe for mass frustration.
---
If you're talking about the slot machines, then yeah - they were fun and purely random, but also exceedingly cheap and didn't require the destruction of in game items. They were more to provide high level characters a chance to dump excess currency. I wouldn't mind seeing something similar in FO 76, but it shouldn't be part of this system.
---
just started messing with it but it looks fun so far and you can think of a few fun ways to extend the concept and expand on it in the future.
---
It does sound like it
---
I'm guessing no, as it's not permanent.
---
Yeah seems strange, maybe its a bug
---
Ah okay! I should have plenty grenades!
---
There's a bug currently where over-repair isn't buffing damage.
---
No. There are so many things I hate. But if I rattle off too many I get downvoted and called a whiner
---
Over repairing on melee and armor no longer ups damage/protection after this patch. Have you checked that?
---
Post is 149 days old.
---
They probably nerfed It.
---
üí´
---
&gt; But the plans were on display‚Ä¶‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúOn display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the display department.‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúWith a flashlight.‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúAh, well, the lights had probably gone.‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúSo had the stairs.‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúBut look, you found the notice, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Arthur, ‚Äúyes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‚ÄòBeware of the Leopard.
---
Those are also for sale at Grafton now,
---
someone said overrepairing doesn't work anymore? I don't know, don't use melee.
---
I was some on Xbox, I figured it was everyone trying to set up the trading posts all at once
---
Same, any bug fixes or triggers?
---
Bruh that's a scam, most people sell serums at about 250 caps.
---
its a solid contribution. looking forward to what the game looks like by Christmas with Wastelanders implemented.
---
I get invited, then I just follow them around with whatever quest they are doing and assume 'follow leader, kill shit, loot shit'
---
I cooked some of mine the first time. Realized how stupid that was. 
---
Collected them again. Then scrapped them.
---
Yeah, but I don't use either of those. I had to make a Twitter to easily get the shots &amp; that's all it's ever been used for. 
---
I'm seeing these xboxdvr links, that seems genius in comparison.
---
Got mine a long time ago too but good to know, I can send people in the right direction

I‚Äôm my experience. It doesn‚Äôt count till you are close enough to where the name of the subjects are shown in the upper right when you are zoomed in camera mode. So finally getting some use out of the 2x lens

I am sorry but your opinion only matters if you used shotguns or owned sentinel/cavalier armor.  Are you qualified to speak?
---
I just snuck up on a ghoul down by the bar near Biv's place and punched it bare-handed and it worked.  No power attack.  No weapon.  The objective really say "land a sucker punch (unarmed sneak attack)."
---
Imagine he had no idea and is sitting there thinking ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I ever get customers :(‚Äú
---
how do you do the course at the bridge (for the athletic?)  the one course i did do had a start button, but i can't find the button for the gorge course.
---
Hmm idk. I think I'll give it a week before I put anything of real value up for sale

I have an old pic that shows 91 / 39. But I can‚Äôt remember what my exact perk combo was when I took these pics. I want to say 20% HG and 15% BM... this may be too dated to be useful though.
---
The explosive one does weird things to the stat screen and hides the ballistic damage that the barrel adds. So it‚Äôs unreliable for determining true ballistic damage.
---
Next time I find a normal one I‚Äôll take a peak at the stats. I‚Äôll save this post so I can let you know what I find. I can also craft one so if I have materials to spare for SCIENCE! I‚Äôll do that
---
Anyone in the enclave like in FO3... so all players.
---
East side of the gorge has another button, follow the flags
---
Thanks, but we need water also
---
Point is they promised this would never happen. Yet it happened. I'm done giving them money, it's just a slap in the face to me.
---
Now all we need is for them to scrap Blades
---
Wait they become wanted? THIS I did not know
---
I agree with you on the separation between Adventure and PVP.  I don‚Äôt care for PVP myself.
---
That takes a long time to put up and would take a little budget. Also, who's to say that people will believe the sign?
---
Its glitched badly. Only works part of the time on legendaries.
---
Don‚Äôt know bout that.
---
I love my brotherhood-branded t-60, and yeah I'm a little miffed that they explicitly stated the backpack would work with pa, then backpedaled like crazy on patch day.... but I also kinda get it. An additional carry weight armor slot that applies also to pa would be a little on the unbalanced side, given the fact that pa can already benefit from an increase in carry weight. It could have even been technically infeasible given that there's already a mechanic in-place that prevents armor slot benefits from applying while in pa -- that might be a far more complex change than whoever made the original statement foresaw.
---
Over repairing a weapon does not give it more damage.
---
That shows you made an effort. I at least won‚Äôt leave poo at your door.
---
heavy incinerator would be cool as well as the riot shotgun and more options for suppressed pistols like the 22. cal but a bit better statwise
---
really think there should be more pistols and expecially shotguns as shotguns are done pretty well in fallout 76 but there is just a lack of options 
---
would love to see something like the handmade shotgun from fo4 creation club (but not as an atom shop skin or something)
---
all in all id be happy with bringing back a lot of weapons from older games as the options are pretty limited atm
---
what bugs me is that pretty much every new weapon in this game that wasnt in fo4 has no mod at all or like  one or two really basic ones
---
PSN is xShiroe-_ should be on in a few
---
hmmm, maybe i was at the totally wrong course then!  I didn't see any flags at all, just obstacles that looked like a course.  thanks!
---
There's a vending machine for each scout tier, tadpole, possum and squirrel. The currency for them are badges, so if you'll complete every tadpole challenge you'll have enough tokens to buy everything from that machine, the same with other scouts
---
I‚Äôm not that nit picky. üòÇ The only ones that really irk me are the giant floating Minecraft monstrosities.
---
lmao fuck outta here
---
Add me we can help each other: DaveBlazko
---
It did before this patch for melee weapons except for the Grognak ax which could not be over repaired. What you say is true for ranged weapons before and after this patch.
---
Just sell stuff your not too worried about for a time?
---
I'd haven't had any issues, sold a buncha Supply Requisitions as a test for a few caps each, got my caps &amp; a considerably smaller stash of those.
---
I did see a post about not getting full caps for selling ammo but haven't tried myself. Sitting on 10k 5mm but also too many caps to sell AL that currently. 
---
I was a bit concerned when I went to get scrip, got a CTD after pulling out 3 meh 3* I was saving. Even said to myself "welp those are gone." Thankfully my pessimistic side was wrong.
---
How about the riddle. Has it been solved yet?
---
Regarding plans I've been pricing mine as follows. 
---
Common drops from.the world or workshop are 25 caps. 
---
Anything from events where you have to expend ammo and fight I usually do for about 50 caps.
---
If it's something like the nuka quantum paint, where I'm saving someone the hassle of fast traveling to 6 or 7 locations if I remember correctly, then I'll do about 200 to 250 caps. 
---
If it's a rare plan drop from an event, then max I'll do is about 300. 
---
I look at effort it would take to obtain it on their own.
---
Beat me to it :)
---
That's a good perspective to have!
---
I am in until the game gets shut down.   But extending that time requires not driving off the fanbase.
---
I built a room on the back of my house that is enclosed and locked but has no floor, except around the edges.  I was able to plant corn and razorgrain, and even fit a Brahmin in there.  The smell is unbelievably bad, but it keeps it all safe from mobs and greedy raiders.
---
I slide then stop where it lands. Too much work to add and extract.
---
There‚Äôs a little shack in kanawha county cemetery that is filled with bags of cement
---
Let freedom ring
---
I totally agree. I hate the spawning. I run before the base loads in
---
On my roadside bar I made I got like 6 water purifiers on the side of the road open and for free.
---
I'm setup for vending with items loaded but I had 25K caps before I started!? so until I use some caps my vendor station will be in the dark..
---
Okay immaculate step out for a smoke and then I'll be back on. Add me and I'll take you where it's easy to die in shallow water
---
Over repairing weapons to 200% no longer provides a dmg boost. I imagine that's where the reduction is coming?
---
Oh wow well that's kinda weird... I thought it would be more of a set it and forget it kinda deal.
---
\*Slow clap\* Well said. 
---
I remember seeing some maps with "MURICA" in the middle and Russia cut in half making it the centre of the world...
---
I love the Fallouts and I get they are based in USA but I wish there were more flags from other countries as well. As there are other people from many different countries living there as well.
---
Put some support beams on it and you won‚Äôt be door pooed. 
---
It‚Äôs all in good fun, really.
---
Yeah that would be great
---
Yes. On PS4 I disconnected more last times last night than I have in the entire past three months.
---
What happens when you sell for more caps than you can hold?
---
"It just works."
---
Lol.
---
Games get balanced over time, all the time. "Should have been balanced during Beta"... pfft. As if any beta will find all possibilities.
---
"if you're gonna nerf my OP stuff, put in more stuff that's equally OP to keep me OP"
---
Yeah it does feel like that
---
I read this thinking it was me, lol. Though I don't necessarily bounce from camp to camp, just grab it while it's available (if no one is around). I figure there's enough time for it to restock if they are out and about. My four are unlocked, I didn't even know it was stealing, I thought it replenished per person. Oops!
---
Btw, how do you lock a purifier down, certain level or something?
---
Eh, it's no big deal.
---
If a person doesn't lock something then it is their fault.
---
Personally, I keep three medium purifiers, some food, and a cooking station out in the open for anyone who stumbles upon my C.A.M.P. since it's in a pretty early area in the forest.
---
Yep it's weird that it's a "ghost" 1DR. I can't find it anywhere. Did the same as you. Still have 1DR. And with the 200% repair not adding to the damage anymore. Sorta sucks atm.
---
5.56 and 3.08 are good to sell. .45 to a lesser extent.  I could see full fusion cores listed at 60-75 caps per.
---
Thanks guys!
---
is this true?
---
I don't bother to perk myself out to over-repair weapons.  Typically I'm running at 100% or below condition.
---
You can be a sheep, wolf, or a shepherd in this game.  It‚Äôs really up to you.  Whatever you choose just own it and realize that there are pros and cons to each.
---
gee, if only i‚Äôd have thought if that!
---
Wow, who put scorchbeast droppings in your sugar bombs?
---
Thanks, this is useful.  Maybe you should play the way you want to, and others will too.
---
If someone paid a lot of real world money for ‚Äònever die‚Äô armors and ‚Äòbest pvp guns‚Äô and now found out it will take him two more shots to kill someone he used to one-shot, and his unkillable armor has a 25% chance of failure, he deserved to cry a river, and hopefully his mom will comfort him and buy him the next metas.
---
You mean this isn‚Äôt Fallout: Hoarders Paradise!?
---
our liberator prime has been in service for decades before the American capitalist pigs sent in their spies and stole our finished blueprints! 
---
the Americans never had to suffer through the constant fusion leakage, combustion and self-destruction the liberator prime suffered through production and prototype.
---
It isn't somebody else's job to save you from a lack of math skills.
---
Same, happened to me too. Also...having to hunt around for the vending machines at some CAMPS was kind of a pain.
---
proving to be more frustrating XD, btw can you hear my mic?
---
Add second set of stairs, make sure there is a foundation under both, if not add one, delete old stairs.  This doesnt work for the big stairs with the floor and supports attached to it just the regular stairs and atomic shop stairs.  The foundations do not have to be connected but they must be at the same height.
---
90% of the weird building rules are just to keep people from making sky bases the NPCs cant attack.
---
(oh also do you have any .45 ammo i can buy, u/Fo76AmmoTraderr?)
---
Armor and weapon base values no longer increase when repaired to 200%. Not sure if that's a bug or intended but I lost about 100DM due to it. üò¢
---
You spent money on a meta build you knew was broken. People very likely told you time and again it was going to be nerfed. And frankly, if you didn't come to that conclusion yourself, then you really don't need to be lecturing others on their "capability." Build a bridge and get over it...
---
&gt;What the fuck is jingoism?
---
-Average gamer.
---
You few salty dudes really overestimate yourselves, don't you? Every game... every damn game... there is always the teensy little few, that scream loudest, that think they will sink said game if they aren't around.
---
Think so, if you have a buddy might be easier one out there, but solo definitely found this was the way to go.
---
Epic bro
---
The two star stuff you can see in the description.  It might say two shot combat rifle, then underneath the picture "bullets explode for area damage".
---
Xbox?
---
Purified water is an extremely easy way to make caps, so you can bet like hell that im gonna steal as much of it as i can get
---
Yeah, I did like 4 items and I just quit
---
I feel like there are probably less drastic alternatives they could take first. Like learn that they don't need to carry around thousands of bullets, hundreds of aid items, or tons of junk.
---
Understood; that's absolutely right in that others have input on it, but ultimately the buck stops with him. The director gets to say "I don't think this meets our quality standards yet" and ask for a delay. I do that sometimes, when necessary. I also get to say "This meets our standards", but then we have a whole QA process and beta process that will likely validate or invalidate that before we decide to pull the trigger on final release. It's upper management's job to take all that input into account and decide if we go forward with a public release. It might be that Todd Howard played 100 hours of Fallout 76 before giving it the Go/No-Go, it's possible he just listened to the status reports from Jeff Gardiner or others and said, "Sounds good, let's go!" or "I don't care if it's not ready, we're releasing when I said we're releasing and we'll fix the problems with patches" and didn't really play the game. Either way it was his call that the game came out when it did and he deserves the overwhelming amount of blame on it. It's up to him to determine who within the company could have done a better job.   
---
My big problem is that I see gamers eagerly trash "the devs" without any idea what they're talking about, and that has real-world impacts. BioWare had a huge exodus of their best talent in part because of the hate and harassment that was sent to "the devs" after ME3 came out, and now the company is a complete shitshow. I know what it's like to be someone who worked their ass off on a project for months or even years, to have it come out as a disappointment due to no fault of your own, having to deal with the disappointment of that failure and THEN having to listen to a bunch of doofuses with no clue what they're talking about trash your work and you, sometimes behind your back but sometimes even to your face. It sucks. It makes you miserable. That kind of toxicity makes you want to quit and go live on a boat or something. It's one of the things absolutely eating away at the games industry right now and I worry for the future of our favorite pastime because of it. We need to hold people accountable, sure. We need to hold the RIGHT people accountable, though.
---
Its gonna take forever to get the increased capacity mod for backpacks.
---
Fair is whatever someone is willing to pay.  Welcome to capitalism.
---
Ok thank you!
---
I don't lock mine, it's not exactly a scare commodity.  People are free to take any excess I don't use.
---
I think thats how it was intended to work, but I noticed if the camp owner was present in the area you could inspect. If they weren't there than you couldn't inspect.
---
Well a problem with this while I agree something needs to be done about the camp spawning, assholes could literally have you spawn in a locked room or god knows where and potentially screw you over. I saw another post how someone built on a cliff and people were spawning in and falling to their deaths. Pretty ingenious way to steal junk from the unsuspecting.
---
As if Berserker wasn't bad already.
---
I have bird bones so i never die from fall damage anymore.
---
\#hotcakes
---
LoL... sure, I'm totally convinced you were an Atom high-roller. They already got your money, dude.
---
Why is this a post
---
Nah, it's good because now you actually have to earn it on each character. No duping or trading or easy ways. If you have a backpack it's because your tenacious and can actually think without a little quest diamond telling you what to think
---
So why make the good players adjust instead of the kids who suck?
---
These attributes were in F4.  They had plenty of time to think them through instead of nerfing 6 months later.
---
why we die without reviving?(
---
underrated comment
---
pc :(
---
I get what you are saying but no reason to be a dick about it. I live in the country in Asia, but the game is based in America. Two people replied to respectfully and you shit on America. 
---
If you hate America, play a game based in your country.
---
Yea man, you definitely got scammed because you didn‚Äôt know the prices on mutations. When looking for something in particular, look around for average prices, in case someone is overcharging
---
Maybe your tighty whities now have an inherent 1 DR? Technically, they're still an article of clothing.
---
Pls make it happen
---
EPIC RAD BATTLES OF FALLOUT
---
Hancock vs. Insult Bot
---
Agreed on this point. Bethesda is trying to cater to very divergent groups and it is not possible to please them all.
---
I need to move a stash outside. I like the idea of a locked front door from, like, an RP standpoint. But now I just leave the door open so folks can use my stuff if needed. I should just unlock it, since nothing can be stolen anyways, lol.
---
Yup, some guys at a WS nuke zone acted like they owned the place and killed me (pacifist) because I dared to farm there as well. Plague walker in my case; can't really avoid catching glowing pustules at that place...
---
Also, removed all locks at my vendor camp to avoid nasty surprises now. :-/
---
@OP: I often farm that deathclaw at the substation and always wondered about the camps right next to it. Does the DC not attack your camps regularly, anyway? And I'm sure those nasty ants can take down a brick wall just the same. And then there is the random encounter point a few yards to the north, that should spawn aggro mobs all the time, too, right?
---
Just asking because my camp in the Mire gets attacked by mobs (supermutants, radtoads, anglers, crickets, ghouls, mirelurks, you name it) all the time, and I live with it (from time to time they drop some [great legendary](https://i.imgur.com/3SFDQrz.jpg) ;-)). Maybe store your decontamination showers away while your shop is active?
---
Where's that vending machine at?
---
Move your C.A.M.P. device to a different spot in your camp and it changes the spawn spot.  I had people falling off the cliffs behind my house, so I moved the device to the side of my house and that's where they spawn in now.
---
And yet, you got caught flat-footed on an outstanding issue that everyone here knew was going to be addressed at some point. That's pretty much the definition of "ignorance."
---
3.08 is good? I‚Äôve been leaving it behind
---
I need that 2 methman holo tapes from the magazine, dobu have that
---
THANK YOU!!!!!
---
Pioneer scout camp and Camp Adams, might be in some other places but idk
---
It's almost as if you are telling people not to use features in the game. You know, the features put in game so they can enjoy it better. How about the game isn't for YOU because you can't be entitled of it and tell people to not play a game their way.
---
It's because people kept breaking the free states vendor's legs :(
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/oentityy/screenshot/12092764
---
What do you mean "when"? Devs still get death threats for nerfing things.
---
That's why I love my quad but you gotta reload each bow for consecutive strikes
---
The only door I lock is the one to my small fusion gen shed. Nobody needs to go in there anyway. For RP purposes I should really lock all my doors - my character is a security conscious, mildly paranoid mobster.
---
&gt;here is your vendor? e
---
"Ever thought of going into advertising?"
---
hahahahaha!
---
For real though, more like tighty off-whities, amirite?
---
Oh I understood.  What you‚Äôre saying is they should remove or change a core aspect of the game because a ‚Äúsmall subset‚Äù of the game is abusing it.
---
Should you not drop junk when you die from a ghoul?  Anyone can come pick it up before you respawn so maybe that should be changed?  Sounds abusable.
---
What if I get attacked and killed, lose my junk and some caps but want to get those caps and some extra junk back in the process?  I can do that. The game gives me that option. Or maybe I‚Äôll just die again and lose more caps and junk.  Oh well I‚Äôll just make some marine tactical helmets out of the 800 fucking pounds of junk I have in my stash box and sell them to a vendor for more caps!  Like 30 a piece!  Wait a minute.. I didn‚Äôt even have room in my stash for that junk I lost anyways. Time to move on and continue enjoying the game instead of letting something so minor, in a video game no less, ruin my day.
---
Apparently the caps go poof.  It's definitely a concern, but Bethesda did say this in the patch notes.
---
This is when you look back and think.....  
---
"Am i disabled?"
---
PSN??? Mine is CaptainModrah
---
13k üòÇüòÇ
---
You must be from the marketplace. Generally decent players aren't charging anything close to that, maybe closer to the bottom 1.3k
---
Please be on PS4 I want to visit your camp
---
I was thinking steel because it's commen and thats what the in game ammo boxes are made of
---
Glad I'm not the only one. I was doing the same, putting the last slanted roof up on a building and couldn't place it. I've also found that 2nd level (and higher) floors are way harder to place, with similar errors and something like "removing that will make part of this inaccessible".
---
F4 is a solo game. "balance" is irrelevant in a solo game... shit just is what it is.
---
here was have a game, wherein we're seeing some very common builds, built around the same gear... over and over and over again. That is unbalanced. That never would have shown up in beta testing.
---
Seems like someone else should stop playing
---
Some do, some don't.
---
Make a deal with her, ask to do some extra chores or like a side project to show you are putting the effort in.
---
Thx for helping me!
---
Noice.
---
I‚Äôve been putting in plans and those have been selling. I‚Äôll try chems to see how that goes, thanks for the advice.
---
Its weird they put the plans at the armory and not where the mods are sold. The prices for these plans besides the paint are so dam expensive lol.
---
I visited a guy‚Äôs camp where he was selling 1* - 2* BOS combat armour for 15k-20k a piece. lol
---
Oh, fuck that. I'll drop it in a bag before I go below 1 cap.
---
Slocum Joes FO4 creation club content added those. They were a good send, but bloody irritating in build mode.
---
I mean... The dragon takes 2 hours to reload, what is "furious" gonna do to it when you should be killing on the first shot with that gun.  Seems like you overcharged.
---
Just leading the market.
---
Nah, a decimal point point got lost.
---
I thought about doing this, but I'd have to rebuild my camp from the ground up.
---
On XB, hit the XB button on the controller, then "Y" to take a screenshot. You can access your captures using the xbox mobile/PC app to share or upload to an Imgur account, which can be linked here.
---
Heres hoping!
---
Dude I love this I‚Äôll be visiting later today if you‚Äôre on üòÇ
---
Thanks it was great)) 
---
P.S. I tried to hear your mic but i dont. Caps doesnt work, and in settings i didnt fint anything for help
---
I stand behind that. Let me keep my excavator perk but make it look cooler. Not like a fat blob
---
Yeah, that's my thoughts but super-chieftain up there jumped right into the deep end...
---
Also a good travel trip, put your camp in the middle of the map then warp from there. I did that and it's not too expensive with travel agent.
---
You eventually get all of them anyway. Don't worry about it.
---
My bad. I just thought you were another person gouging prices, I've seen some ridiculous crap out there already üòë
---
We‚Äôve all done it.
---
I built a wall of those tall concrete barriers along the fenceline, as well as a concrete perimeter around my camp. As long as I stay out of sight on my side, the deathclaw doesn't aggro and it kills the ants pretty quickly. I can usually handle random mob spawns pretty well, if not I lure them to the deathclaw and then use my chameleon set to sneak away.
---
No worries get it next level up.
---
Thanks I'll do that tonight.
---
Same as u/. Just sent you a request
---
as much as i hate to say that because i know there are a lot of players that like to pvp but the core focus of the game is was and will ever be pve wheter one likes it or not
---
pvp was an extra option from the beginning and thats why balancing doesnt really take pvp in account that much
---
to kill another player that is build to pvp is way harder than pretty much any enemy in the game therefore if you have weapons or armor that can easily kill a pvp player or survive his attacks its definitely broken for most of what people do in the game therefore pvp tactics and weapons of choice will for as long as the game goes on always fluctuate between different buffs and nerfs i know its a frustrating realisation if im correct here but its a core problem with the game trying to make a good pve game but also trying to balance pvp.
---
I usually go off what it says it's worth, sometimes price increases or decreases depending on rarity of item.
---
You mean some guys trying to sell the hard lemonade recipe for 2k or more? Fuck those guys.
---
My water purifiers exist to be molested my needy hands.
---
I'd volunteer, after that screed.
---
Lol I‚Äôm not mad, I learned a few things last night with my good friend google üòÇ having no interest in sport and being in the U.K. I guess, I had no idea on baseball questions but if ever the question comes up on a tv show or trivial pursuit about the distance between baseball bases I‚Äôm going to pipe up with the answer like a smart a$$ now all thanks to Bethesda lol
---
Wow damn ok. Thx for the info
---
You can‚Äôt damage camps in survival. Even if turrets are shooting you. Fucked up
---
    if (meta != 'the BEST') {
---
    meta = 'the WORST';
---
    }
---
OMG I love this. I wish I was on XBox to try. But this gives me ideas of my own "SAW" like puzzles.
---
Ima call it couch cushions
---
That is some sneaky wasteland sh*t right there my friend. Just as sneaky as giving nukashine to the low levels XD
---
Haha Haha
---
Since they buffed the LMG it's pretty coveted. 3.08 doesn't drop much at any given time and the LMG burns through it really fast.  
---
Shotgun shells are selling for 2 caps a piece as well!
---
Yeah, but the queen was already a bullet sponge no point in making it almost immortal. Thats the reason everyone hated division for bullet sponge in Tom Clancy world that based on immersion. So, seeing a queen take missles and mini nukes to the face and does nothing gg.
---
I believe the Morgan town railroad has them.
---
Berserker's always had a huge jump from 0 to 1 DR, so that part is unchanged. All the little DR sources are new though.
---
Not a glitch. Can confirm. Can‚Äôt even damage turrets shooting you.
---
Ahh okay, well I think in Audio you have to Voice Chat mode to "area", but I wouldn't advise since you hear a lot of people who don't push to talk on breathe heavily through their mics, creepy! XD
---
I agree, I think it's time we had the ability to take fabric and ammo to craft bulk "Boxes" of ammunition to sell to vendors and inside CAMP vendors.
---
Pistol calibers like .38, 10mm, .45 and .44 are commonly found in boxes of fifty rounds.
---
Rifle calibers and shotgun shells are most commonly found in boxes of twenty rounds.
---
Larger ammo like cannonballs and rockets could take wood to make a case.
---
Then there could be a second bulk option, taking steel to make an ammo can with more rounds, like 250 or 500.
---
 \+karma
---
The movie goon,  awsome movie about that position.
---
You have an issue with disabled people? Read some seriously dumb things on here, but this, sir/madam, takes the cake. Kudos to you.
---
Oh shit i think you are talking about me...
---
Who wants to pay a cap a round for 5mm or 50 cal ? If you find someone let me know I usually have 20k 5mm on me glad to sell it all for a cap a round.
---
Wow, thats a bit fucked up, but great to hear the base cant be rekt
---
I built on a cliff for the view, but everyone always spawns off to the side, safely on firm ground.
---
Honestly, I was kinda annoyed at the prices people were putting on their cast off garbage.  Who's ever going to pay 1200 for the shitty legendary that you don't wanna use?  I saw one guy who didn't have an item worth less than 300 and he didn't have anything I'd use even if they were free.  Why are you putting every shitty recipe you find in there?  We all got a dozen and threw them away because we keep getting them.
---
Keep your prices reasonable, think about what YOU'D pay for something, not what you think the dumbest idiot in the world would pay for it, cause if every camp is like the ones I've visited so far there will simply be no in game economy at all.
---
until 3 central
---
This is awesome üòÇ I‚Äôm gonna be giving you‚Äôre camp a visit whenever I see that you‚Äôre online!
---
Yeah that's really annoying. I'm done with college and 7 yrs of exams
---
I want some damage reducing underwear IRL, though, just saying.
---
I love the game, but I am a bit disappointed by the recent ‚Äúbalance‚Äù changes; that‚Äôs all. 
---
I‚Äôm sure all of these things will be addressed. AA rifles will be brought in line eventually, I‚Äôm just disappointed that they nerfed defense but didn‚Äôt do anything about offense. You might as well be a bloodied unyielding build at this point since there isn‚Äôt really any drawback at this point. 
---
Anyway, you don‚Äôt need to be an asshat
---
If something is overcharged, just pass, it's only their waste of trading slot in their machine. No big deal.
---
Same! A guy on Xbox was selling them for 200! You can sell them for 400 at a vendor lol.
---
The system should still allow you to inspect the items, regardless of whether it is listed in the name or not. It should be fixed by the Bethesda team, not a back end resolution provided by the community.
---
So detailed I like it.
---
Had a bad guy show yin my unlocked camp. Wouldn‚Äôt leave titI followed him then he ended up killing me stole my caps. I lock it so it‚Äôs my sanctuary.
---
Do I have to have the camera or can I use default photo mode for it??
---
I might take you up on this, Im on pc and solo as well. Once I progress to that point i'll give it a try. Thanks!
---
stable or unstable?
---
I had to google some of the answers &amp; either knew or guessed the others. Thankfully they don‚Äôt have a time limit!
---
Not the worst. I have a couple of potentially good Berserker weapons, but compared to other legendaries it simply isn't worth it to run around the Wasteland naked.
---
You gotta remember that not everyone who plays fo76 is on Reddit, the weird prices ( drastically high and low) are probably ppl who just honest to goodness do not know wtf the prices of stuff is, and even if we as a sub come to agreements it won‚Äôt matter unless it‚Äôs through Bethesda.
---
That being said do you REALLY want Bethesda to enforce caps for player vending? I mean I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs what you meant cause I don‚Äôt think it is. But in order to get everyone on the same page Beth has to do it, and after looking at the vendor prices that already exist I would prefer Bethesda just let us have stupid inconsistent prices rather than paying like 7 caps for 1 5.56 bullet because Bethesda thinks that‚Äôs a good deal, and waiting for them to lower prices in a patch  after backlash from us.
---
This could explain why I have yet to see  a single water in my purifier .. ;) ;) Enjoy the resources! Luckily this game is full of them.
---
lol you can just google most of the answers they are real questions
---
I think you have a good point about these changes acting to separate player bases who are there exclusively for PvE and those enjoying PvP as a style of play and ultimatly their end game content.  
---
If they are only interested in one style of play or the other that's fine, I'd rather that they be able to play how they want instead of forcing them to constantly interact with overly hostile (greify) and paranoid players in Adventure, or possibly causing the Survival Beta to be so softened and blunted that players miss out on a true PvP experience, either option will lead to large numbers of players feeling marginalized and quitting the gam, and that will kill the sustainability of the game far more.
---
Its trial and error......I HATE BETHESDA
---
I've appeared beneath someone's floor and stuck in someone's foundation wall. I think both were accidents.
---
The floor I had to fast travel away, but the foundation there was a banjo I could reach to free myself.
---
I'm sure there are in game books and notes you can read to find the answers but I mainly use the internet.
---
Actually weapons that got damage buffs because of over repairing was the bug lmao
---
I must be blind I've been to 10 translations, see Medical and ammo vending machines, but no Legendary? what am I missing?
---
lol i just used google and finished all of the tests in like 30 min
---
i think people are referring to difficulty because of the enemies not because of tedious challenges. If i wanted to spend 30 minutes answering questions I wouldn't be playing a fallout game. The encryptid event is a great example of what people are looking for, a difficult event that's rewarding when completed and not tedious to try.
---
UGGGGH.  
---
Completely utterly ruined opportunity.
---
I was in survival yesterday to get the weekly legendary and the were skulls around this one guys camp/ store
---
Both lag and then server crashes.  Also it seems right before the crash i can't interact with anything such as doors or terminals.  When i see that i go ahead and logout back to menu and back in before the crash comes.
---
I mean it is for me. I'm sitting around 17k at all times due to travel expenses , resell profits and finishing my collection of all plans and recipies.
---
I do the same. Free food and scrap for wanderers.
---
I support the "support post" posts!
---
Dolla dolla bills y'all, capitalism is dope shiznit!
---
You don't have an extra one? You don't need caps either?
---
and I like the view from up high.  it feels safer in the trees.
---
As someone running a drunkard build: good, keep the damn stuff, I get too much of it as it is. I used to run a water purifier at my CAMP until I realized that Party Boy triples the hydration of alcohol, too. I stopped purifying my own water and I still will wind up with 20+ of them after a few hours of exploration. Almost no use for them since I can't, say, make soup with them.
---
Ive seen other posts where people have said they have completed Survival quests on Adventure out of the blue. Think one guy said he completed one and got a really good weapon by placing 3 fences at his C.A.M.P. Must be a bit of a glitch in the code
---
Most of that is basic understanding and some civics 101.  And it's not like there isn't already a precedent for this elsewhere in the game.
---
Now, *some* of the questions are pretty US-centric and might require a good 10 seconds of googling to figure out (and some seem downright random).  But they're not terribly difficult to go through 1 time.
---
Not this time, buddy, I'm on PC ;)
---
I don't think the X-01 plans are obtainable. Only mods.
---
Yeah, bethesda should copy all the other survival games like rust and ark, were if you got stairs supporting your huge base it collapses lol.
---
People who think ‚Äúbalance‚Äù should matter equally for PvE and PvP frustrate me. 
---
Who cares who can kill the SBQ faster? It‚Äôs basically playing FO4 with friends. Balance in PvP should take priority and these changes really blew a huge hole in that.
---
I put a crit .38 receiver on the Fixer (by choice,even!)and use it in the lower level areas of the map just to save on .45.
---
Seems like a lot of work and costly with fast travel cost.
---
&gt;It's upper management's job to take all that input into account and decide if we go forward with a public release. It might be that Todd Howard played 100 hours of Fallout 76 before giving it the Go/No-Go, it's possible he just listened to the status reports from Jeff Gardiner or others and said, "Sounds good, let's go!" or "I don't care if it's not ready, we're releasing when I said we're releasing and we'll fix the problems with patches" and didn't really play the game.
---
I'm far more inclined to believe the former was what happened. Given Bethesda's sheer inexperience with multiplayer games, the engine issues for a multiplayer game on a single-player engine and the fact that 76 is one of those games where the true issues with the game don't come to light until thousands of players have their hands on the game. I don't think anyone at BGS launched the game thinking it would be as problematic as it turned out. Unlike something like Anthem, this game was in development for just 3 years, and they absolutely could have delayed it by a few months if they wanted to. It makes no sense for them to rush it out if they were completely aware of all the game's issues.
---
&gt;My big problem is that I see gamers eagerly trash "the devs" without any idea what they're talking about, and that has real-world impacts. BioWare had a huge exodus of their best talent in part because of the hate and harassment that was sent to "the devs" after ME3 came out, and now the company is a complete shitshow. I know what it's like to be someone who worked their ass off on a project for months or even years, to have it come out as a disappointment due to no fault of your own, having to deal with the disappointment of that failure and THEN having to listen to a bunch of doofuses with no clue what they're talking about trash your work and you, sometimes behind your back but sometimes even to your face. It sucks. It makes you miserable. That kind of toxicity makes you want to quit and go live on a boat or something. It's one of the things absolutely eating away at the games industry right now and I worry for the future of our favorite pastime because of it. Posts like OP's here are things that make those people's lives a little easier, that make all that extra effort fixing the thing that somebody else broke worthwhile. We need to hold people accountable, sure. We need to hold the RIGHT people accountable, though.
---
I absolutely agree with this. I just don't think that it's fair to trash one person alone (not saying that's what you're doing, since you cleared that up), especially given the circumstances surrounding the game and said person's experience as an upper-level developer. He's directed like 9 games out of which 8 were GOTY. Few studio heads have that kind of record, and it is very hard to believe that this game was a product of mismanagement as compared to say Anthem. I think it's just sheer inexperience more than any sort of poor management,
---
I am learning how to build better camp but it takes real dedication. Want to add a second story and leave my workstations open on first floor
---
...that has nothing to do with a cap limit. You‚Äôre spending money on cap sinks. You‚Äôd be at 17k whether the limit was 25k or 45k.
---
You got new challenges, their are pain and you must make tones of them.
---
I too always take the hard road. Not sure why. Even irl. If there‚Äôs a easier way you can bet your bottom dollar I‚Äôm going to forgo that
---
Thinking a persistent online game like this would not constantly balance gear, like every other persistent online game, yes I would say ignorance.
---
To be able determine prices to be both acceptable by buyers and sellers we need bids on items (or cross-server / offline auctioning), but for stuff like legionaries with their variants bid can't be easily placed (but that stuff not for caps trades anyway)
---
I wish more people would do this. Got to love how you log in. Visit 2 other camp vendors. Com back to 1/2your base defenses and all your crops destroyed by 3 sniping super muties. Come on people. Coming courtesy would be to kill the mobs you spawned. Do you just leave them to destroy your camp?
---
[Mine are very well guarded](https://i.imgur.com/phj1yCh.png).
---
YES
---
But we have trading while busy options as of yesterday
---
Holy shit. Didn't know that. Well..... Ok then.
---
Added should I come to you?
---
I always take the water from every camp. I don't have enough room in my CAMP budget for my own purifiers so I rely upon the kindness of strangers... lol.
---
Ikr guess someone has never played a bethesda game, everyone hoards stuff; even in F03 gotta get all that junk to eventually find out it isn't worth caps lol.
---
Nah I'll join you, in not doing anything
---
Have you tried logging back in from desktop or dashboard ?
---
I was selling a bunch of leftover ammo for guns I don‚Äôt use for 0 caps, hoping to help a brother (or sister) out.  Someone swooped in and emptied all like 2k pieces and immediately ran back to his camp.  Concerned that he had just emptied the entire repo, rather than taking what he needed, i went to his camp and found all of it for sale for 1 cap.
---
Last time i decide to be charitable in my shop.
---
Z and C jump big chunks of the scroll bar.
---
I spent 25 caps to fast travel to a camp yesterday
---
It was a floating camp
---
I turned around and walked away without even looking at the vendor.
---
I‚Äôve done that with a super mutant before. Makes me smile.
---
That's what I did. Someone triggered the imposter Sheepsquatch - TONS of opportunities there to revive someone.
---
Naaaa got mine from inviting random people in game and completing the quest . You can do it too
---
what's wrong with that?
---
I don‚Äôt even care if the water bandit steals mine, it free public water for the people that need it.
---
Yeah that is my problem when ammo and aid items are there and I just gotta get it, too bad I always run out of 5mm or .50 but never run out pistol or .308 rounds lol.
---
Aha.  Saw some people using the vendors as a lure to camps that were 95% turrets while the owner hid inside, they were almost invincible in there.
---
Lolz
---
You're worried about other players breaking the laws of physics in a game where armor and weapons magically give us superpowers?
---
Fast traveling never was and never will be a cap sink. You never felt its weight on purse and now you don't feel it at all.  Whole day I spend server hopping and traveling between vendors and yet my stash keeps rising. I am buying things I don't need for a price of 3-10 times higher than they are worth, just so that I wouldn't hit cap limit.
---
you could pretend you are in the real world, and not fast travel. Waiting for hours if not days to find the animal to photograph...
---
Then you would spend no time in a loading screen.
---
But seriously most of my time is looking for the things in the area, if they even exist...
---
I envy you being able to do it so quick that the loading takes almost as long.
---
Hmm, checks out, my SIL must also secretly play 76.
---
I haven't seen that guy, but i believe i was just victimized by him. People like him need to burn in hell. I'm here at my camp, rested up, just got tuned up, went to get some water for the road and start my adventure... and nothing..   my purifiers are empty.  I just checked them and they were FULL, WTF!!!  I didn't even see it happen!!.  What really ticks me off about these SOB's is that...   oh wait.  There's more water now.   NM  cheers.
---
Deathclaws to not drop deathclaw hides ironically enough...
---
Personally my concern is that bethesda is going to cater prices of legendaries and trade-in value to the people who play non-stop, leaving players like myself who can only play a little bit each day to fend for themselves.
---
I really wish there was a subscription we could pay to get an improved radio, maybe even a live radio channel.
---
Its amazing when people get stuck in your base that is locked trying to get to your vending machine that is outside.
---
I‚Äôm trading a guy government holotapes for shells. The super mutants or scorched in the lake bed usually have some 3.08
---
Really? Then why doesn't the game tell us this?
---
Indeed. Right across from my house. Whenever I get attacked I make sure Murgle is ok.
---
i thought the prices i saw were pretty good.. cheap even..
---
i guess i should go take another look around
---
I understand. It just isn't for me. Thank you for your response. It is appreciated.
---
You have the plan?
---
Yeah there was this huge floating camp and they could have had their vending machine at the bottom stairs but nope I had to climb ton of stairs to the top to see the machine smh.
---
How in the world did you not understand I didn't litterally mean best part of the patch? You'd have to be extremely dull to not see the sarcasm here... It was a good change... OBVIOUSLY a small cosmetic menu change is not the "best" part of a 3-8gb update with new quests. How was it not obvious to you that it was a diliberate overstatement?
---
Can you even get 100k caps?  What would be the point if you could?
---
I've found the opposite to be true.
---
Hold on I just cashed
---
r/gatekeeping
---
M7c n5dcfmf
---
You actually need to hit enemies for the durability to go down
---
Wouldn't he fall and die when traveling there too though?
---
&gt;I did see a post about not getting full caps for selling ammo but haven't tried myself. Sitting on 10k 5mm but also too many caps to sell AL that currently. 
---
Not verified completely, but there is a bug in the display when you sell ammo (at least), where the amount you see that you've sold is *actually* the amount that the buyer has in inventory.  So while it looks like you've sold 2000 rounds, the person actually bought 500 and now has 2000 total.
---
I haven't seen anyone check the caps vs. actual number sold yet, but the display bug has been verified.
---
I noticed that mods that increased diamond‚Äôs before don‚Äôt show up / count when scrapping (sacrificial machete mod)
---
Yeah- couple hundred I think. Beats scrapping dozens of armor pieces yet still learning no mods
---
No, if i wasnt spending 10% and 20c a jump ode easily be over 21k atm. Thats exactly my point
---
White springs vendors have counters
---
True, kinda like how symmetra trolls in overwatch would put teleport next to a cliff to edge their teammates to death, but they eventually fixed that. In this game don't think bethesda can do that with how huge scope this game is. Only thing I can think of is the spawn point has a radius around it and if there is a cliff or traps in that spawn then the spawn mat can't be placed there.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll look for that.
---
Post a pic of your map. Also is it possible you camp couldnt be placed?
---
&gt; But yes, they definitely should not try rushing their games again, it doesn't turn out well for anyone.
---
That's all you really had to say.
---
They should release when the state of the game is overall bugless, with tiny issues here and there.
---
This studio seems to NEVER learn from their mistakes. For that reason alone I never buy their games at more than 20% of their release price as that's their true value to me.
---
I really wish they'd let us have multiple camps yet only one can be in use at a time. I'd love to have a few different style camps built in various places. The one camp slot per character really hinders creativity and the overall quality of camps. Having to tear down or running the risk of messing up your camp just to experiment a little is an awful experience.  Having 3 different camp slots to choose from and build at would be a joy with no additional hindrance (i think) to the servers. 
---
Another option would be to allow players a 2nd, active camp, at say, 25% of the budget of the main.
---
I really like how the tests have more than 5 questions and aren't all joke questions.
---
5 characters per account, 25k each = 125k.
---
For those who *cough, cough* have 2 accounts, that means a potential cool quarter of a million (if only there weten't still so many unknown plans...).
---
It actually very simple and basic...go discord, open lfg channel, write that you wanna trade revives or just ask if one wants to help you. I think much bigger problem is that how bad the challenge tracking is.
---
Xbox and I had the same issues.
---
Upvote for screen name üòä
---
Yes, I am. I am tired of the miscommunication setting expectations that get dashed at the last minute.
---
Bethesda really needs to improve their communications.
---
Also, they have added some additional lore.
---
It's a bug,
---
The seller has to be nearby for you to inspect the items.  
---
It's been reported and logged
---
But the latest patch broke favourite item scrapping alerts and it still has weapon switching stutter.
---
So they couldn‚Äôt fix the ripper damage hack and decided to nerf all weapon damage? Damn. Hardcore.
---
Help yourself to my lead, water and crops! Heck even play the grand piano or sleep in my bed- just DON‚ÄôT forget to close my cabin door!! Freaking rad toad slime in the sheets
---
Yeah, see, the problem is they've had issues with bugs since the first TES: Arena. Daggerfall was for example dubbed Buggerfall, then there were Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 3, Skyrim, Fallout 4 - all of whom had tremendous release-day bugs. I can cite sources if you want me to elaborate on this further.
---
How'd you wire that? I have the same setup, including the code posted on the door, but the only way I could figure to get out was to build a terminal inside and "turn on all switches."
---
Capture workshops is pretty easy.  A good farm-able way is to equip the pharma-pharma perk and search all the aid kits, and bathroom mirrors.  You could also check the player vending. I'm sure they are for sale there.
---
When I finally found someone to help me do it he kept dying instantly instead of going into downed state for revive. Then when I completed it finally the game trolled me and server crashed, rolling back the challenge completion and we had to do it again. :|  Quest goals like that shouldn't exist. Also it doesn't even make sense. Why can't they drown themselves and the game allow me to pull them to shore and give them CPR?
---
They specifically said it wouldn't be visible but the effects would be applied. Then they totally changed it.
---
There are 3 challenges you can do without the camera I believe, someone else can comment as they did it without a camera, I think Athletics, Archery and Swimming .. 
---
For the camera, you have find a location and basically server hop, watch a youtube video on the location, I suggest do it at Bolton Greens as the body is right on the fountain in front of the building, pick a location which is a short run to the body and you know exactly where it should be a you server hopping.
---
Maybe energy resistance is being calculated into Berserker?
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why anyone would argue to keep these weird, easily abused, mechanics in the game on Adventure Mode.  I also dont know how anyone could enjoy being griefed as it looks like that's what you are saying?  But I wont make assumptions about a stranger either.  Just sounds like you would be happier on Survival.
---
Same boat üò≠
---
I had someone revive me once and it wiped out all the RADs in my Bloodied build, not sure what perk causes that, I was grateful but kinda annoyed at how the system just did that.
---
That is great for excavator, but there are many other power armor types.
---
I have two. One for me and one for you. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Also Eagle Scout here, I was never required to know anything about computers to advance ^^^back ^^^in ^^^the ^^^70s
---
Nothings wrong. These over priced weapons will sit stagnant, and they'll wise up and lower their prices if they want to actually sell something.
---
yep.  lots of people know.
---
If you are spending 250,000c, or even 124k you are taking this way too seriously.
---
Raise the cap to 50k have it shared among all characters on an account. Release higher tier gear the next week.
---
imho, 200 is actually really good.
---
Some weapons are suprisingly heavy.  I ran across one last week that's nearly 50#.
---
Do you have packrat and/or other weight reduction perks equipped?
---
I would collect the mats you need to create L45 excavator, then do at least the motion assist servos on the torso (+2 Str).  Plans are sub 500 caps @ WS vendor
---
If you dont have batteries included, consider it.  It will drop the weight of Fusion cores.
---
I wish there was a Last Laugh 1000 DMG mine in a bag so that you know.......open......BOOM!  the lulz would ensue
---
Don't use a garage door. Had some asshole trying to close in my shoppers.
---
So I know it‚Äôs repeatable but do they act like daily quests.?
---
"I don't want to interact with another player in an ONLINE game I bought, therefore it's bad"
---
Raider power armour!
---
I have a brick wall, with no code, but 8 know it works with codes as well.
---
 Inside I have a power point connected to the plate then the plate to the door
---
Outside I have a code pylon hooked to a power sources, then connected to the door
---
That's a possibility, but I'm being an optimist
---
Probably. Depending on how you got the items I‚Äôd sell them for 25-50% off don‚Äôt sell it by the recommend
---
The game tends to randomize the questions on the test from a pool
---
Can you even get all badges? Like medic badge requires making a stimpak diffusor and not everyone has the stimpak: super recipe which I heard requires doing death blossoms but the material is given to party members not participating in the event.
---
I hope that‚Äôs not an unpopular opinion.  It‚Äôs also hands down the easiest way to have a camp you like that you can move.
---
No idea. I got it the first try, just make sure your swim suits still on?
---
Jesus, is that what's going on? I witnessed back-to-back attacks on my camp last night for about twenty minutes.
---
I know, but this would add to those random encounters players have with each other, and it would also add an easy way to put items you find somewhere other than your inventory if you find that you dont want to keep that item.
---
&gt; pay attention to your visitor spawn! It is right by the C.A.M.P device
---
TIL. Been playing for 300 hours, and didn't know this.
---
Now can you do it too?
---
There are certain spots where a tourist will spawn with a broken camera and a note (pick up both).  They are really hard to find so I recommend going to the Colonel Kelly Monument and then walk to the Philippi Battlefield Cemetary.  If a tourist is not at one of those two spots, then server hop until he or she is (it's going to take some time).
---
One sec I'll get this serum
---
It's not that it's hard. It really isn't. It's that they force you to rely on other players.
---
Not everyone wants their work to be public.
---
If you spin your camp it will spawn you in a different location most of the time.
---
Haven‚Äôt checked out the update (And I‚Äôm on PS4) does the game not allow for keyboard input on this? (It should)
---
I just think it‚Äôs odd that they can‚Äôt just have people spawn where I would when I go to my own camp, I literally always end up outside, right in front of my camp, yet friends and visitors spawn under the building in the ground lol
---
Would it be possible to add the shredder mod for the minigun as a melee weapon?
---
I‚Äôll be crafting them.
---
&gt;when the state of the game is overall bugless,
---
That's the problem though: With the way their games work with the number of systems that mesh together, it is pretty much impossible to do that. No matter how much you try, no amount of internal QA testing will ever catch the amount of bugs that the wider public made up on a few million players will. It's an unreasonable expectation to have in the first place given their scope. I don't recall single massive-open world game like theirs which wasn't at least slightly buggy. Be it AC Odyssey, TW3 or anything else. The only thing is their bug issues are not as major as Bethesda's or Obsidian's.
---
&gt;This studio seems to NEVER learn from their mistakes.
---
Hard disagree on that.They have evolved a lot in terms of game design since the Morrowind days. Heck even in Skyrim to Fallout 4 there's a huge and noticeable jump in QoL and game design matters in several areas (e.g. companion quality). Even in terms of bugginess, they have constantly improved. Fallout 4 is nowhere near as buggy as Skyrim because of QA.
---
&gt;For that reason alone I never buy their games at more than 20% of their release price as that's their true value to me.
---
Okay dude.
---
Oof one sec
---
Kind of, you can activate them from the personal terminal that they have included in the patch. You can also activate Bivs daily quest this way but the original daily quests can't be activated using that method.
---
Yeah, my CAMP budget is almost maxed.  I only added two vendor stores, but with new stuff being added I'm being de incentivized to purchase new CAMP stuff so my ATOM purchases will dwindle if I don't get more CAMP budget.
---
Hell, Dogmeat could always open every single door.  And then proceed to stand in it so I couldn't get through it or around him at all.
---
I was the opposite last night. I was falling asleep but people kept coming by. I had to patiently wait for everyone to leave before logging off. I guess some vendors just don‚Äôt care ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
NO PAIN NO GAIN
---
That. Blows.
---
You are the world's worst tadpole. Google fu skills are important.
---
Ok well price them reasonably but make sure you profit from it. I find plans everywhere that I already have and I just want to get rid of them so I sell them at half price. Armour is different though
---
All y'all "fast trav'llers" deserve wut ya git.
---
Hmm... hadn't thought of that. I'll give it a go on my next login.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this same thing. If I see anyone at my camp, I wait until they leave.
---
I wouldn't say that these scout quests are difficult. I mean you can literally do them by taking pictures. Since when is taking a picture challenging? They aren't difficultly, they are tedious. And they aren't tedious because you have to go and take pictures, they are tedious because you are forced to deal with bad UI/UX. If challenge tracker actually show detailed list of what challenge requires, it would makes these challenges a lot less tedious.
---
The only thing I have a problem with is the 'revive an ally' as that forces you to have to interact with someone.  The others can be tedious and time consuming, but they shouldn't have made that a requirement.
---
Tbh i just googled them all. Most of the questions are based on actual facts.
---
Yep luckily I found one next to the porta loo there, il have to give it another spin later and see if that was just a one off
---
&gt; Fallout 4 is nowhere near as buggy as Skyrim because of QA.
---
Yes, because they managed to create a game that was even more shallow than Skyrim in terms of storytelling and RPG elements. It was almost reduced to a shooter with story elements, building and crafting.
---
Comrad! There are no communism here. You are being the paranoid. Now let us take the selfie, maybe by your fusion reactor, no?
---
Poor design really -- they should have put that step later if they were desperate to have it in. People aren't exactly looking for a reason to play F76 rn.
---
Are you PS4?
---
The problem with that is people will do pvp and drain your caps.
---
If they buy a lot of stuff or an expensive item, I usually drop them a modded sheepsquatch staff or something to say thanks
---
As far as legendaries go it is really going to depend on the item. Some stuff is just better than others. Just do a bit of browsing on the trade subs and check out prices other people have up.  Once we figure out how the legendary vendor works I'm guessing that will change values too.
---
As far as aid and ammo......as long as you under cut the robot vendors you probably will be good to go.  I've seen ammo listed at 1 cap per and shotgun shells at 2 caps per. Again just check around a bit.  Good Luck!
---
Hold on I need a grenade
---
That's a great idea! The gold revolver would go with that set pretty nicely too.
---
Ohhh! That explains why it worked for me when I visited one vendor and not the other!
---
I spent all last night hopping around to vendors, didn't have this happen to me once but yeah, it's bound to happen but there's no better way to deal with it tbh.... Otherwise it would be too easy to cause a duping exploit, giving the player leaving the item and potentially also the money for the item and either a second duplicate version  in the buyers inventory or caps deducted and no item ending in a buyer getting tricked out if money and getting no item. 
---
If you really want something you could always msg the seller and ask them to stay logged on for a moment or mag them after they left the server (you can see the player name on turrets, camp, etc) and ask them if they can log back in or join their current game if they also just server hopped.
---
I feel like it would be better if it would change to be **amount of items per amount of caps** so I could put 20(5mm)/1(Cap)
---
&gt;Yes, because they managed to create a game that was even more shallow than Skyrim in terms of storytelling and RPG elements. It was almost reduced to a shooter with story elements, building and crafting.
---
Disagree on that too, in terms of story and dialogue I thought it was better than Skyrim, but you do you.
---
Not at all. I love the interaction with people in this game but I'm not gonna try and say this is anything other then what it it's meant to be. The dialog is funny but this is another grind that's all. Cool beans but that's all it is no great story to be had lol pretty funny scouts are cleaning up toxic waste and launching nukes lmao
---
I actually learned some cool stuff from the athletic exam that I wouldn't have known otherwise
---
I was trying to get rid of my 3\* Medic Minigun for 4k (cheap IMO) and nothing. 
---
Its going to take a few days before people get a base for pricing items.
---
Guy, I‚Äôm saying that the tax and fast travel costs are effective cap sinks combating inflation, and a limit of 25k is pointless. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if I can have a max of 25k or 40k. If caps are being removed from the economy through fast travel, tax, and cap sinks, there will not be inflation.
---
Final Boss= Rogue Enclave version of liberty prime
---
Ah. I build the one with the keypad on the actual door object. Power to the door is controlled by an integrated switch on the other side that cannot be manually activated.
---
This new patch has literally been educational.  Players need to have (or google) a level of knowledge of history, science, survival skills, and even mathematics, to progress through quests.
---
Glad to know this I haven't sold ammo yet since I'm selling plans still, was going to but now I'll wait thanks.
---
Assuming it's like caps right? You spend them and thwy are gone?
---
I've picked up and moved camps I've spent hours working on just because I decided to place some stairs that couldn't be removed
---
I have 2 water purifiers one is locked. I actually made my front door have no lock due to the fast traveling - vendor becoming wanted issue if the player unlocks it from the inside. I think I'm going to go without any locks for now on :)
---
Yesterday for the first time, I had no water whatsoever and was dying of dehydration. My little water purifiers will now stay completely open. But my copper extractor will stay locked.
---
Vending machines in the camp
---
I'm surprise that doesn't make people wanted.
---
Well i have two caped mules, for two months or longer. And now i put 200 plans in vending machines, do you know hos much that is? :D i am glad people are not buying too much so i keep under 20k caps.
---
Maybe my loading screens are long!
---
Bruuh
---
6969 caps for a cola
---
Earn badges for the possum scout rank, trade in your merit badges for them at the pioneer scout camp vending machines. There is also a NV camera lens mod
---
Dense mod for torso could be very popular with PvP players.
---
I don't know why it's not working tho
---
Dont use explosive weps
---
Are you on PS4
---
I think so - though the hostile actions vs players have changed recently, I believe picking a lock to a players camp is still counted as hostile... which should make them wanted? If anyone has actual recent experience here I‚Äôd be glad for confirmation either way
---
Me: "Bethesda this event is crashing the server"

Once the legendary vendor happens I think 5 star legendarys will come out soon after. So we will see what happens in a week
---
Which shop in the bunker?
---
Nevermind I saw the title
---
That's why I drink: ***Inert Flux! \****

Yes, Inert Flux, the new drink for the discerning mad scientist. Find it in you nearest nuclear disaster!

You're talking to people who leave bags of spoiled meat lying around the hotel when there are trash receptacles RIGHT THERE! Good luck getting them to close a door. "Best and brightest" my ass.
---
So far almost every update has just handed you the new thing after a trivial quest.
---
And I can see why. Literally any sign of challenge and people here start whining and moaning that it's too hard.
---
Ahh yes....I see. I do have plans but not for the marine stuff. But since I can build all the Marine sets I thought folks might benefit and I can deep pocket (among other mods)
---
Thanks! I think I will. I got bored playing melee only.
---
It‚Äôs from last month btw üòâ
---
I haven't tried it myself, but couldn't you mix a pressure plate with a powered door?
---
Guy sold a Marsupial serum plans for 8000 caps and t-51 jet pack plans for just 750 caps.
---
I saved so much caps buying them from the players vending machine.
---
Wheres snipes BBQ ?
---
Wait til you roll 3 stat points over for a different perk style and realize you don‚Äôt like it, and have to roll it back!
---
I think Macdonough would be like in his 40‚Äôs if that. Not that many wrinkles and the grey could just be from stress of being mayor. (Until he was replaced‚Äù
---
It wasn't previously, so if it changed it should be verified by Bethesda.
---
Production vendor, all plans for X-01 are there.
---
Yeah I been disconnecting all week when I went to do the camden park daily it disconnected me losing that quest for 24hrs sigh. Thought it was my internet.
---
If you go in to build mode and select your camp and spin it barring trees or structures around it should spawn you in a different area. Only time it won't work is if there is a static structure too close to the spawn point.
---
Yeah but the weapons aren‚Äôt eye sores. Floating bases can look good if the have a reason to flow eg being on a side of a mountain
---
I thought you were going to say "The amount of people asking for exam answers" or "The amount of people asking others to price their vendor items."
---
I stopped using turrets at my camps because they always aggro any passing SB and I am too weak to kill them so they end up griefing my camp till I hop.
---
good goy
---
You're not the only one...Fell off the stupid bridge twice yesterday doing the athlete challenge and it would only let me re-spawn on the wrong side, so I had to run back over to the other side to, in turn, run back over to the other side. It was a vicious cycle.
---
I never saved any legendary items for scrip. Yesterday it took me an hour at the whitespring to get my scrip limit. That was two different characters. My luck character took about 20 minutes and my other guy about 40. Three star trash is 40 each .
---
Did electrican and archaeolog. 10hours. Idk which next i could do, most have some bug. Need 8 for increased carry weight mod. Haha
---
*Bernie would like to know your location*
---
I spend hours building my camp and then I see a square box floating in the air and it‚Äôs disappointing
---
Weren't they .10 at some point.
---
Technically this would affect only people running Berserker weapon builds.  Nerfing Berserker would be kind of dumb, though, given how broken Bloodied has been.
---
LMAO imagine not buying a gun you were looking for because the base didnt meet your standards on what it should look like xD.
---
seem like a silly thing to get pissed over.
---
An easy way to do it is just jump off of a ledge into shallow water. May take some time to figure out the hp level to start at to achieve it but it's fairly simple. My buddies did it at Blackwater Mine and used the radiation to control the hp so it was easy.
---
Ah I did not know this. Every bowl I came across yesterday was undrinkable.
---
Even though there's a spawn nearby, I've never had a SB at my camp somehow, I've been there for a while.
---
It was super laggy last night in my experience. Especially in the trade menus and the stash menu. I have a ps4 pro for what it's worth.
---
Yeah
---
Assuming that's not a joke, it's always handy when the assholes self identify.
---
? Its Javelins not throwing knives.  Also its Lactic acid that builds u not amino.
---
Yes you can, it destroys the item though
---
I apologize. I didn't realize any drink that were in there remained, but once its gone you won't be able to add any more.
---
This thing is great bro. Looked up your posts and your Legendary RNG calculator is cool too.  Any chance to get the missle launcher and Fat Man listed on here? Probably tricky with the explosive damage being buggy. Good stuff man!
---
I've never had enemies actually get to my camp. Couple low level enemies walking too close got taken out by turrets, but within 20 minutes of setting up my vendor, I cam back to camp and my frog was dead, some level 100 asshole standing in the middle of my camp with a level 5 super mutant punching him and wrecking my shit (and killed my cow).
---
Yup. You'll eventually get enough to buy everything currently there, but you only need a few to get the plans. Don't really need the non plan outfits.
---
Yup! I sold just as much as I bought... lol
---
That doesn‚Äôt directly affect me. I can ignore the deluge of reddit posts about that.  But when I get screwed out of something I want, that‚Äôs when I get bummed out
---
oh noez, you lost supplies that automatically replenish themselves in minutes.  Gosh, what will you ever do?
---
If you dont need it, sell it! I dont use chems on my toon, so I just hoard em as I get em and sell them off when I get a chance.
---
I'm having a hard time finding her.
---
So will these start the quest for others if it is broken or fixed?
---
I deleted all my doors. My house now has an open end. Not even walls. Like there's no point. I used 2 layers of doors and still some dogs ate through them and destroyed all of my benches.
---
Better tax the people who survived the nuclear fallout.
---
My camp is there. My C.A.M.P. is not.
---
So I have a nice stash of throw away legendary gear on a few alts, but the cap being so low actually makes it pretty easy to hit the daily limit.
---
Last night I got so busy with working on my new camp and quests, I nearly forgot to scrip some gear. I keep my main fairly clean and needed to grind up. Took 3 server hops through white springs (4 counting the time nothing spawned) to scrap enough junk legendary to hit the 150. Even though most of the one star armor pieces only got me 3 credits.
---
It's tough for lower level players who can't just waltz through whitespring for sure, but with the amount of player vendors selling 1-3* junk at their camps for face value, it's a small investment.
---
GL HF
---
Yeah that is what i was wondering
---
Did it work?
---
Hopefully now that people will be visiting everyones camp, more people will care how it looks. Mine is my pride and joy. I love when people come see and shop my wares.
---
I did. When I get home from work in a few hours, I'm gonna try to do a little grid search. I mean I guess it's only mainly used for the repair all function, but it'd still be nice to have.
---
Get some friends. This is online. You can do that now. This sub has open to many opportunities for friends.
---
But its a game, so it should either give you the information you need at some point or the questions should be based on the game lore.   
---
why create questions that are easy for Americans and frustrating for everyone else. I don't play fallout for any interest in America, i like the post apocalyptic world. Baseball and American presidents have nothing to do with this game.   
---
And i think the point was that you shouldn't design quests like 'helping others' while saying the game can be played solo, that is bad design. The quest may be great but its bad design if it doesnt fit in the game you are advertising.
---
Awesome
---
good point.
---
If you are on PC even a cheap ssd will speed the load time up.
---
Unless you have slow internet, the amount of data FO76 can chew through can be impressive.
---
Yeah. Thankfully it shows you recent players you interacted with on your social tab too so that makes the process a bit easier.
---
pc, sorry
---
Mine's much worse.
---
Oh yes, please.
---
Nukes it to hell
---
The bees didn't count when I tried it just now.
---
Yes. If owner is at camp I could inspect. If owner was not at camp I could not.
---
There is a difference between belaying and a belay device.  When I went through Army Ranger school in 1979, all we had were snap links and rope.  To rappel down a cliff required someone to control/belay  the rope to stop any falls as you mentioned. One simply wraps the rope  around their back to be ‚Äúon belay‚Äù as we said. 
---
Technology gave us fancy belay tools that are in use today and I think this is what the test is alluding to.
---
Of course. Fast Travelling is the only currency-sink left in the game.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know it did that. Thanks mate!!!
---
Thanks man, you gave me the impetus to go check and my Fallout76Custom.ini was missing the post patch edits so I've updates the (sResourceArchive2List) line you mentioned.
---
I'm just a lazy SOB :/
---
I did.  In at least 2 different locations.  Before and after looting the core.
---
answer here please

have to check each vendor.
---
You got the glitch where you could still use your armor and power armor. Pretty sure it got patched out though.
---
I have that perk, and it'd fairly handy for me and my friend. He doesn't have starched genes so it's one of the only ways to remove rads from him and keep his mutations! But also I do forget that it's on sometimes 
---
(it wasn't me cause I haven't revived people I haven't played with since I had the perk)
---
Sorry Charlie.  Not happening.  I never minded guests coming to my camp and that's why I built a guest facilities shed out on the edge. I keep my water purifiers unlocked and you are welcome to all the food you want from my garden.  You are welcome to look through the windows of the main house, but unless I unlock the door, you can't come in.  Some of us are just wired that way I guess.  I don't like people I don't know poking around in my stuff in the virtual or the real world, even if all they can do is look.
---
I just did it on another character. My BETA character was level 155, and I just decided to say F-it and made an alt...which I finally hit 100 on during the double xp weekend. Not gonna lie, leveling up a second character to 100 was torture.
---
could be. chances are any vendor will often have something better than what customers currently have.
---
awww man I thought that was a benefit super sadface I love the over repair buff I used to get.  The one bug I really like and it gets patched :(
---
Same. Mine is just a two floor house with garden and garage but I make sure to decorate every room. I also made the garage available to everyone along with a bar and beds
---
Imagine watching someone with a high bounty get their house blown up by a yeeted nuke from Prime
---
Fun House of Horrors ... sounds like a cool camp build!
---
Haha, I have 3 variations of Gunsmith for different build variations I run, 2‚òÜ, 4‚òÜ, and 5‚òÜ. That's 11 points just for one stupid perk.
---
üòÅ thx!
---
Yea finally
---
You have to have the item to use the skin? You cant buy the power armor skins and not have power armor to put it on?
---
Wire all your doors to a terminal and put the terminal behind a locked door
---
Too bad that free atom shop information terminal doesn't record your items selling that could be a good temporary selling history for that server. The thing I hate is people can still buy items and get you to max caps, so you can lose out on caps, was hoping the caps would be stored at the machine and you had to manually collect them to avoid max caps.
---
You can move your CAMP device around inside your build radius and it seems to affect where you spawn in. Presuming here, but others seem to spawn in at the same location.
---
So it becomes like the old white springs where one stray bullet ends your life
---
Calibrated shocks(and other mods) were our answer to deep pockets and legendary effects (and still sub-par at that).
---
Backpacks just push the balance even more to non-PA
---
I can see 4 bullets for 1 cap deal but not 1/4 cap alone...
---
I bought a few plans from a camp with no one in sight. not even close.
---
Oh ok cool yeah I‚Äôve only used the standard belay and grigris/grigri+
---
I came across a camp that you literally couldn't get into unless you have marsupial mutation. Only entrance is like 10 feet off the ground so if anything gets broken it's just a floor piece. I thought it was cool idea but I went ultra realistic on my house so it sits flat on the ground. I have gates around my doors and usually that keeps everything attacking my exterior walls instead. However, in the last 3 hours I have had to go shut my doors 17 times cuz people keep leaving them open
---
Awh man. That‚Äôs a bummer. Then f that I‚Äôm forgoing my PA.
---
I know too.
---
I'll just put a door on the side. Simple fix.
---
Nevermind found her!
---
That was a surprise when I fast traveled to CAMP to look at someone's vendor and "surprise" I'm inside the building.
---
Why can't we have home plates like FO4? Was that just too simple?
---
Soon there will be a legendary vendor where you will be able to spend/exchange them.
---
The mechanics are still not clear or confirmed.
---
There was a really good post on that a few weeks ago.  
---
I just think the legendaries all need to have a use.  How awesome would it be to actually need the breathe underwater card?  Or maybe a tough boss that only shows at night. This would make nocturnal stuff actually useful.  The imposter was a good start.  The trouble shooter stuff is really good against him.
---
The legendary vendor drops either the 16th, or 23rd of this month.
---
I have the rifle . True flamer barrel mod .long scope .true capacitor and stabilized stock.
---
Can anyone explain why there is a 10% tax on sales? If those caps went somewhere sure, but those caps are just going away. And people will just add the 10% they would lose to end up at the price they want. Seems dumb without those going somewhere or towards something.
---
I went to an advertised CAMP, browsed the inventory, didn't buy anything. Loved it.
---
Passive multiplayer. 10/10.
---
I've built into a narrow creek canyon, on a significant slope.  I don't think that's going to be an option (and I *really* need to remember to take some pictures of it...)
---
The best I could maybe do is move the site and place the device where the foundation piece is now, but honestly as much as I have the build shoehorned into the canyon, I doubt even that would work.
---
I do have Starched Genes 2, is your Perk not supposed to wipe out my RADs, was that just an anomoly do you think?  I've had many  many other revives especially during Encryptid lol without those RAD wips
---
Thx for the reply.

Only if players or the environment could kill Brahmins and make off with their stuff, but with corresponding wanted level depending on the quality of goods ;)
---
The game has new life, loving it!
---
I think it's a work around to the bugged daily quest. Example I placed it down looked in it saw the biv daily quest and shortly after the heart of the enemy quest popped up(which ihavent been able to do since the first time  I did it. So thumbs up!
---
Keep an eye out for the Leader of the Pack event at Tyler County Fairgrounds. It spawns hordes of wolves. And the hill over Whitesprings Bunker usually spawns rabbits.
---
This thread is hilarious because out of context it reads like people giving each other helpful safety tips
---
Calibrated shocks exceed deep pockets and Excavator Armor adds even more.
---
1* bloody walking cane = GG PvP
---
75% chance per piece to give the 15% DR. So instead of always having 75% damage reduction all the time, it's 56% on average. That's someone you can kill now.
---
1 cap each or more?
---
I sell all my plans for 50-70 caps. Got them for free, don‚Äôt need that many caps.
---
Ouch, the possum challenges require a metric fuckton of travelling. Good luck, little tadpole.
---
*man. A WELCOME MAT like the one in FALLOUT 4 would come in handy. A mat that could SPAWN YOU IN THAT INTENDED LOCATION WHERE THE WELCOME MAT RESIDES. HMMMMM ü§îü§îü§î.*

---
I don't think so. After a week, id be after a two shot mirv fatman, or try seeing how far a super legendary pool cue could get me. After i have what i need to do most of the game with ease, i can finnaly get back to exploring and messing around.

There are many different Belay devices and systems each geared for its own purposes; I am mostly familiar with Petzl gear.
---
Or you could not put up more for sale than you have cap room to take back. Math isn't that hard, people have been doing it for thousands of years.
---
Yeah the Atom shop item is just a skin. They were really not clear about that. I checked because I was about to flip my lid backpacks were in the atom shop.
---
I dunno; I just stumbled across it one day and went "ohhhhh yeah, these work to flip tabs/categories in the pip boy and trade screen, makes sense". Just tested again and it still works, tapping either key jumps the slider up or down by ~400.
---
this new quest is clearly bullshitting us all with fetch quests
---
Hovering over camp on map gives everyone a total amount of your items, however they have to use each of your machines to view them all.
---
I‚Äôm really hoping for fast travel mats too.  Too many times I‚Äôve loaded into my own building, and friends coming to my camp too.   It just seems like it should already be a thing, since they‚Äôre available in workshops.
---
Someone visited my shop and I plugged my mic in and asked him to jump off a big staircase I built from my roof. He did it!
---
We just need a nice, simple, easy to program chart like this. Shouldn't be too much work, right?
---
https://i.imgur.com/jOVIDtL.png
---
Well they do lot of stealth nerfs and changes like how over repairing doesn't change dr and damage now. So, its possible they either gave every naked 1 dr or energy resistance converts to dr for berserker.
---
Every vending machine has it's own unique, 30 slot inventory. To see everything, you have to visit each machine.
---
Me and another player had this issue. The way it worked for us was when we stashed away any armor with extra strength and carrying capacity perks
---
Near Big Al's there is a large patch of grass over that expressway.  I was wandering yesterday after hitting Biv and there were a half dozen wolves there.
---
Have my water. It literally says "DRINK THIS" on it and I have a Vault Boy cut out pointing at it and my Uranium extractor. :D

Just tried it out it doesn't work

Funny. I did this and got absolutely nothing.

I‚Äôve still got to do this too but won‚Äôt be on for another 1.5hrs. I‚Äôll message you once I‚Äôm on gt-Greekerzoid
---
You can buy whatever at anytime you just can't inspect it if the owner isn't there.
---
Some of the things for the quest were applicable scouting skills. But there was a ton of propaganda in there too. I think my favorite was like ‚Äúwhat is the biggest threat to coal mining in WV‚Äù 
---
The correct answer was shit you not ‚Äúcommie lead labor unions‚Äù
---
Nice dude!! Thank you!
---
They could just make it spawn at the vending machine, since that what all people really care about, besides using vending camps as spawn points lol.
---
&gt; Upon attempting to purchase the item, the player leaves the map, and my purchase fails
---
That sucks, it's happened to me. But I imagine that not allowing the trx to go through is best so people don't lose caps or stuff. 
---
It needs to be handled more gracefully.
---
People are saying that it's to help the ingame economy but really it's just BS.
---
I regularly traverse the map on foot. I'm somewhat excited to do these challenges to get me back to places I seldom visit. But you're right, it will probably take me quite a long time!
---
I don't think anyone would buy just 1 round maybe 100 or 20,000 rounds
---
Funny you should mention the 2-shot fatman. I've had one in the past and dumped it cuz "Eff carrying around mini nukes and, when am I really gonna use it?" 
---
But I hadn't fought the queen at that time. I think full Demo Expert plus a 2-shot Fatman would be better than my current options.
---
Mic drops an atom bomb on it.
---
My camp has four of those unlocked and some corn too.

So if you play on PS4 and visit a camp with neon letters saying ‚Äúfree water and food‚Äú, grab what you can and/or enjoy your stay.

You are welcome :)

I got the 1st from quest that gives 20 cw . Bought the skin ftom store and then i could craft lvl 50 that gives 60 cw . Dont know if bug or supposed to be like that
---
Honestly anything other than legendaries Id go like 50 percent of the value. Legendaries are more up for debate. Some legendaries are trash to some and pure gold to others. I personally am selling my bulk ammo, and explosives that ive been hoarding (Im a melee main) and selling them all for 1 cap a pop. Stimpaks im selling for 11 caps each. Those are all Ill probably be selling for the most part. (I can make about 100 stimpaks an hour)
---
I'm selling Stable Fluorescent Flux for 75 caps per piece. No one bought it but some other dude bought a bunch of my useless armor. Visited his camp and he had made some serious modifications to them and jacked the price up 100-150 caps. Guy was in the 200's but damn. I hadn't thought of that idea.
---
It's plague
---
Pro tip: a lv0 lock will still make someone wanted. You don't need to spend the extra junk for a lv3 lock.
---
I'm kinda shopping around if I can be bothered fast travelling,but I've bought a few items for obviously inflated prices because there was so much work put into the camp and just because it was so cool I just purchased stuff to support the vendor, hope I don't start doing that IRL :(
---
I'm going to have to set up a shop to sell all the junk I'm buying from others shops.
---
I am yea, was a hardened reciver but now .50 does more dmg
---
3 star instating  rifle already silenced and scoped with two decent other mods faster moving and limb dmg for 1500 caps
---
Look up on the wiki, that's how i did it
---
I can't even use vending because all 5 of my characters are max caps. That's 125k and I'd be lucky to be able to buy a good set of armor for it.
---
I believe it is 2x damage for taking advantage of weak spots. That makes three points of concentrated fire better than three points of a weapon damage card. I run a low weapon perk/ high bonus modifier rifle build and can tote around 355 to 497 damage per shot with my 71 damage combat rifle. Considering it shoots 7.5 rounds per second... That's a lot of DPS.
---
I have 182 mini nukes on my mule.... so id try for the two shot, faster firing thing and have fun doing something ludicrously stupid. AND clear out my inventory space.
---
In the challenges list under the world category. New challenges at the bottom that reward merit badges.
---
That happened to me for a while with launch codes... Then with heating coils
---
The duplicates weren't real, they were just showing up like that for some reason.

Try dropping them to see if they're real or not

That's the going rate for most good armor sets nowadays. Bloodied explosive handmades are hovering around 50-70k
---
*Solid as a rock!*
---
And no one will buy those shells for 2 caps each.  I‚Äôve been to a dozen vendors so far and no one was selling shotgun shells for more than 1 cap each.  Not to say someone won‚Äôt pay 2 caps each, but good luck with that.
---
You're being trolled. There is no such thing as a breastplate stretcher.
---
Liberty Vandal
---
The reddit and marketplace prices are high. Player vending prices are all over the place. Best deals are random finds in game now it seems.
---
I'll look there, thanks!
---
People can already do this, though, so it doesn't work as an excuse not to.
---
Hit me up gt theziptieguy
---
My handmade does 136 damage with all rifle perks, tank killer 3, demo expert 5 and bloody mess 3. How in the world is that owerpowered??
---
cool story brah
---
8000 is a shit ton for a serum..
---
I have no idea how people are struggling so much on the exams. They're mostly common sense, and you can just google the ones you don't know. Took me about 15 minutes to do all of them.
---
This is why I made a pressure plate electric door
---
People probably have a little heart attack everytime they spawn into my camp, since I have a pet deathclaw right where the spawn point is.
---
Revelations 6:8: I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
---
The last armor is the Pale Rider, as opposed to the black rider.
---
I'm not telling them not to use them. When I read about a guy who hasn't sprinted since week 1 of launch that makes me sick to my stomach.
---
&gt;  Today I have had to fast travel to my house to shut my front door 17 times in only 3 hours.
---
OCD much?
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty nice option imo
---
Good to know that, thanks.
---
Is it in the pip boy?
---
Data mining suggests a 1,000 scrip cap per character. 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm27me/psa\_you\_have\_a\_max\_cap\_of\_1000\_scrip\_per\_character/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm27me/psa_you_have_a_max_cap_of_1000_scrip_per_character/)
---
I'm not gonna lie, idk how to do that.
---
Don‚Äôt take my word for it but I‚Äôve read the enclave plasma has slightly higher base damage. Not sure what the comparison is after the patch though.
---
Also you can‚Äôt find enclave plasma guns as legendary. Unless that‚Äôs been changed now too, but I kind of doubt it
---
I fuck with the gatling gun and 50 cal machine gun
---
I would gladly take both
---
Calibrated shocks exceed deep pockets. Backpacks tip the values the other direction. And no PA has any legendary effects- 20% weight reduction legendaries, anyone?
---
Excavator armor is a very limited exception.
---
Joining right now
---
So move it to a bank character and be able to move. Doesn't seem like that innovative of a concept.
---
I do 1 cap. Most i have seen is 1
---
its me.  I'm the water bandit
---
Wow the pale rider looks like shit lol, thanks for the link, definitely getting the black rider now
---
Nice to have met you, Good luck out there.  Remember this is just a game.
---
You?
---
what I was trying to say is if I can purchase a skin for my power armor which I have and then just apply it why shouldn't I be able to do that with a backpack skin.
---
It's not an OCD, if I leave it open too long I come home to creatures in my house and destroyed items in my camp.
---
They must‚Äôve fixed it. It worked a month ago when I posted this
---
Huh. I was unaware. This is important to know. 
---
Currently I can add to it, I guess I'll have to keep it well stocked.
---
You might be right but after all it's not called - Americas clean and tidiest... Exept you RP a maid.
---
Or Raider maid - because immersion
---
Grognak‚Äôs axe was bugged, although you couldn‚Äôt overrepair it at all. 
---
Pretty much every other player in the game (used to) see melee weapon damage go up when overrepaired. You would be a unicorn.
---
On no, that was the intention, I'm a great buddy ;)
---
They could use something similar to the item rename system but with just numbers
---
I remember a time where you could only place one turret if you wanted to build a small shitty looking house with all your crafting benches. Then they changed it and you could build three turrets for your shitty little house. Then they. Hanged it again and your shitty House was now big enough to be considered mediocre! Just wait gang, eventually you‚Äôll be able to make what you want
---
Okay?
---
It depends on your surroundings. If you're in an open area it will change your spawn point. I've done it tons of times. It won't put you to the T but it will change what spot you spawn in at.
---
It's a good side arm for just about any build, but it wouldn't be good to base a build on.
---
Eh, probs
---
Because there was no adjusting to that. Just get the same impossible to get OP god gear, or a super cheesy build to counter 1 set. Either way isn't healthy for a game.
---
Yep!
---
&gt;It trivializes things
---
and the problem is?
---
not to mention, we'd be fighting scorchbeasts with stones and sticks otherwise because that's how most weapons/legendary mods feel like in this game.
---
That‚Äôs what you got from what I said?  Clearly, I need to work on my communication.  
---
Hey man, listen. There are actually people on this thread saying things along the lines of, ‚ÄúThis is the post apocalyptic wasteland. Not everyone is friendly and there are opportunists out here waiting to catch you slippin and take all you shit‚Äù.  
---
And you‚Äôre basically saying that you‚Äôd rather the developer change the way the game works rather than you change your behaviour even though you‚Äôre now wise to it?  Just so you can continue to be ignorant?  Take some responsibility for your own actions.
---
Deep pockets + weapon weight reduction beats calibrated excavator. It‚Äôs just a lot harder to get a set of it.
---
The lack of raider armor support is what bugs me the most.
---
There are definitely plans for "Brahmin pen". I bought then at one of the train stations. In build mode it then becomes Fertilizer Producer.
---
Are you online now, I could do with some help :)
---
So they quit after they couldn't play easy mode anymore, good riddance. Maybe if people hadn't constantly been griefers in adventure and stuck to survival .
---
I would have doubted that you would get buyers for non-legendary weapons and armor, but then I watched the oddest stuff sell like hot-cakes out of my shop yesterday, and now I'm convinced that nearly anything can sell for the right price. I'd price them to move and see what happens. If they sell cheap, then up the price a bit and do it again.
---
I never spawn anywhere near my camp device, always on the outskirts of my camp. The camp device is in the utility room by the generator.
---
Yes, but it's because I have century Link ü§£
---
Can we sell plans and recipes in our shops?
---
Players can still buy from unpowered vending machines. Power only broadcasts the location on the map.
---
The was never advertised as being a solo game. It was advertised as a multiplayer game that ‚Äúcould‚Äù be played solo. If you look at all the advertising and such, they are all based around TEAM play. Hell the premise of the game is rebuilding America together.
---
Yeah agree with other comment, don't build specifically for this item but I could see you using it as a sidearm. So-so roll
---
The 4 riders are plague, war, black and pale? Not death. Or am i mistaken?
---
You told them to quit the game, which is not using them. If someone wants to be overencumbered, it's in them solely. Fallout is a hoarding game, but limits you in 76. This game makes you choose 800 reduced weight perks, or better gameplay perks.  Without any of my unyielding armor and carry weight reduction perks I weigh 800+. Some people would rather have more damage perks, and other bonuses. But telling people to quit over self accrued back pain is wrong. It's better to offer perks or food that helps fix the problem.
---
Oh cool, Ill have to play with it and try for myself.
---
Came here to say this
---
I have been hearing more frequent server disconnects since the patch, so quite possible that it's not intentional and it's the server getting stressed with the increased interaction.
---
So go buy an executioner's handmade or gamma gun for bloodied builds or an AA handmade for everyone else. Heavy guns with stagger could also kill assass sent in a couple bullets before they could even hit you. It wasn't hard to PvP. You just needed a little effort. Plus from the sounds of it most of the people whining don't even PvP so I don't get it if I'm being totally honest.
---
Thats a good idea to put a stash box out side.  my house is usually locked up, but i have a Garage thats accessible to the public with a PA station and armor bench.  maybe ill throw a third stash in there lol
---
But that‚Äôs literally what you do with the backpack too? Once you have a backpack, you can apply the skin. It‚Äôs the exact same situation if you didn‚Äôt have power armor and bought a skin. You would have to get power armor in order to use the skin, ex. the Excavator Power Armor quest. I‚Äôm still not sure I understand why you‚Äôre mad about the backpack skins working just like every other skin.
---
Stalkers is ok for this. Helps maximize the one shot it has before switching to a fighting gun. 2nd perk is hilariously useless as it is only a 1 shot clip (no offense. There are actually people who collect these "ironic legendaries").  And third perk is meh. You're not gonna be aiming long with it. 
---
If nobody is interested I would trade to legendary vendor for a bunch of the quips or whatever legendary currency we have.
---
Maybe you ate a food item that increased carry weight before you logged off. I don't think that would explain a 50 pound change but it could be part of it.
---
I had found a hidden update upon entering safe mode not sure if it is going to do anything
---
You are a sad strange little man, and for that you have my pity.
---
I hate it when they fix the bugs I like...
---
Just use the powered doors, write the code to the door with the small letters set. Once a player goes through it it closes by itself
---
 I live not far from you and I never close my door. My Fusion Generator has a 0 lock on it to keep my Scorched neighbors out but everything else including my Water Purifiers are open to my fellow Vault 76 dwellers. ;)
---
 You understand we were all together in the Vault. Some have gone off the rails, but you are all my fellow humans in what is now, a harsh place..
---
As best as I can tell, Adrenal+SiN is finally working properly (even gives BONUS damage when teammate is mutated).
---
But all weapon/armor overrepair bonuses were removed. 
---
I haven‚Äôt checked SiN with twisted muscles/talons yet (they were both negatively affected by SiN when i checked last patch)
---
Yeah, same. I think I have like around 60 purified water on me at all times and it's been ages since I took any from my camp. I just grab them when I come across them during my scavenging trips.
---
I was going to cash in a 3\* Plasma rifle yesterday, but it wouldn't let me because I was already at 109 for the day, and it was showing 60 Scrip.
---
I have a couple of 4\* Machetes, I'm going to check that as soon as I get on this evening, also I can Craft 1\* machetes all day long, I wonder if they thought of that.
---
I'm on PS4 sorry
---
It was just one of those things that is just downright uncomfortable to look at. Personal tastes, I guess.
---
Just rotate it. Moving does nothing. If its aimed north aim it south.
---
Thanks for the reply. I did check Grafton vendor. I only saw raider armor mod plans and not the standard armor (light, sturdy, heavy) plans
---
Yeah, the BP weapons are cool-sounding (especially the rifle, the shot echo sounds like thunder), but the slow as fuck reload times and the fact they're single shots makes them poor at close range after you've been engaged, unless you're shooting radroaches. I'd keep it and have it as a secondary on the favourite wheel
---
How about powered gates. One of them you type a code into shuts after a few seconds.
---
Yeah it works sometimes but not always.
---
Last time I checked it wasn't a post apocalyptic wasteland outside, so that's really not a valid comparison. It's funny that you complain about "high school" and then post a catty response like some snarky teenager.
---
Im hoping since DAI was def a improvement over 2 than 4 will just continue that trend.
---
These menus being slow are a real drag. I scrapped 2 items by accident. how is everyone so happy yet not seeing this?
---
I'm on PS4 with a wired connection so that's telling how a single state system is being affected.
---
Not everyone. Watched those movies every year round Christmas when I was a kid.
---
I agree a lot of is up to chance, but for me it‚Äôs been an experience of becoming more familiar with certain mob spawn areas and visiting locations I‚Äôd normally have no reason to go back to. Tedious indeed, but creative
---
There are some doors in Whitesprings that slam closed in your face without being touched ... either its haunted (likely) or they have self closing doors (far less likely)
---
On that point, I do agree.
---
Yep. Anybody who tells you camps are safe is lying
---
I keep a turret inside my camp specifically for these instances.  And for wolves who don't seem to care if a door is locked.
---
I agree.
---
I could see that working actually. Set a reward and they could deposit what you need to your vending machine? That could be a good way to get some resources... a request items for x amount of caps option in the vending machine could probably have similar outcomes but I think the contract is a nice touch and I like it.
---
Lol. I was racing to buy things before my shop sold things to put me over the cap. It felt like an old gameshow.
---
I got some new tent and then recipe for S'mores that you need for one of challenges. Also i think ot gave me one badge
---
Honestly when the game first announced and we started getting more info about it this is exactly what I thought was gonna happen in this game. I think it‚Äôs still very possible
---
I could be wrong then.  :(  I'll test my teammates after work.  She still has some in her bowl.
---
I'm seeing lag in the item management menus. Trying to sell and scrap cost me a T-51b head piece with a targeting HUD and custom head lamp.
---
Its a little trickier than that. Renaming items and getting the game to recognize values you input are a little different. Itd be nice if they did a number combination style slider where you change each digit like a bike lock. They could replace all number sliders with it.
---
Pretty awful considering how far along we are in this game and Bethesda can't make anything stable. Really disappointing.
---
i thought most robots (assaultron, protectron) had "combat inhibitors" that are weak spots?  
---
sentry bots have the fusion core (but blowing that i think stops fusion core being lootable)
---
We should be able to do price per item as well as price per stack, so we can bulk sell.
---
Have seen this with just pc people, pretty sure its most likely an outdated ini file issue or mods issue
---
BFG
---
Food buffs. Drug buffs. Mutations. Diseases. Flux spoiling.   Tons of things that can fluctuate in a small amount of time making it feel like a glitch. 
---
As far as carry weight glitches, I believe only common one is something with excavator armor accidentally buffing too much weight sometimes.
---
Right, I know how the camera works I just can't find the right pool. The first chance I can hop in game I'm going to find it. Thanks for the tips.
---
they are usually on the side of the building facing towards the tracks, they look like a weird grinder thing that some pre-schooler made
---
I think it's a limit set since it's at it's infancy. Just like the 200 caps per vendor at the start or the stash limit. They need to see it live and in play to value how good or bad the limit is.   
---
Although Scrip cannot be shared across characters per the patch notes. We would have to see if any level muling character can purchase max lvl items. If so, then your scrip cap just went up to 750 per day.
---
A real bank for people to put their caps into would be amazing. Another amazing thing would be some sort of middle man machine that would allow you to pay more than 25,000 caps for a weapon and have a 2 step verification to avoid selling the wrong items. Just another idea that probably wont happen.
---
Buying the PA skin doesn't give you power armor. You still have to go find the PA or craft it. In fact, both the excavator and xo1 pa is gotten through quests.
---
Enjoi the free purified Water compliments of Vault Tec!
---
Wait so water doesn't go automatically to the stash box? I think I'm being robbed!!
---
On what system?
---
Dude. Duh
---
75 caps is a reasonable price for fusion cores. 100 caps for bobbleheads. 
---
Can't go wrong selling cryolator and flamer ammo.
---
I found the cat (in ash heap) and rabbit (near WS Bunker Entrance) but I cant find the squirrel
---
So you want to have them sell backpacks in the atomic shop ... pretty sure that would be them shouting themselves in the foot with pay 2 win stuff
---
I concistently have been running around with the same stuff for weeks now outside my aid changing thru use, I only have one character so I know how it normally is. I used to be able to have Hella aid items now I can't have any cause my armor and guns takes up all my space even tho nothing in that department has changed. I haven't changed any perks either, It's weird idk if maybe a perk card was wonky and they fixed it and that's why or what happened.
---
That is a great idea! I like that better than mine
---
Another great solution to this miniscule problem
---
Gotcha, thanks. I keep spawning under the dumpster in my C.A.M.P. and its starting to feel like the game is trying to remind me that Im trash.
---
Use a garage door with a pressure plate. It's like having an automatic door.
---
Quadruple like
---
They do- their heads *aren‚Äôt* their weakspots (hell on the protectotron i think it‚Äôs a hard spot...)
---
Didnt get PM yet
---
I got you bro.  I'm always happy to kill myself for another player
---
He should wander and seek out wanted people lol
---
I mean, it's fine in vats, but it's taking 8-10 shots center mass at point blank to kill a super mutant these days. That's not ok.
---
&gt;frictive
---
?
---
Yeah I just didn't want to have a keypad lock cuz it would be harder to get people into my house to trade.
---
Wait, seriously? I don't have time for that :p
---
I think there are a couple in the National Radio Astronomy Research Center. You can try there.
---
Judging by your responses, you are ignorant and mental. It functions the same as PA skins. You buy a PA SKIN, you still have to FINRDD PA TO USE IT. Same with the backpack. Literally the same.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen once but through he Market. Needed adhesive and the person needed some time to ‚Äúfill the order‚Äù. They said they regularly will take in big materials sales then farm all day to complete the order. We just traded caps and I was charged over double what we agreed on! But I didn‚Äôt care. If you‚Äôve got a fun and charming thing like this that you role play, I‚Äôll pay extra or give a good gift as a bonus
---
While i agree with what you just said i agree with the cap limit. Thats because i play wow and near limitless income gets out of hand quick. 
---
I believe the single and i do mean single reason prices of player items are where they are is 100% due to the cap. If people could have 100k caps then 3 stars would be selling for much more, but because players want to not lose money due to the cap limitations and availability of items they are selling thing for reasonable rates.
---
Cool story
---
If you are on Xbox, I can help. Struggling with this as well.
---
I have no idea how to include that.
---
Oh, I'm gonna get so many bounties from insisting on seeing the inside of people's camps.
---
I use the good ones from the queen on my guns but only use my junk to fix armor. Guns are more expensive to fix anyway. And the bat is pretty damn generous with them.
---
Now if they can just stop taking my damn water lmao had to put locks on them cause every time I tried collecting they were empty
---
I've placed them both in my camp - I thought it was just a cool freebie.
---
If you are on xbox, I'll help you with it.
---
full transparency tho, I'm horrible
---
I see you eyeballing my desk fans!
---
Lay off the Nuka Shine and walk more don't fast travel the pounds will shed off
---
punch bowl doesn't work for me. Nothing happens when i press transfer on it...
---
Forgive my asking since I haven't played 76 for a few months now, but what's a yeeted nuke? Did they add a new type of nuke?
---
I was worried about this too. I might just sell them the old fashioned way if a low level shows up at my camp. I was thinking of having lots of low level stuff for cheap but I don't want people snapping it up and putting it in the legendary grinder.
---
Orrrrrrrrrr put the vendor station outside....just a idea
---
Yup lol
---
Yeah, you've been able to get serums for a couple hundred on the subreddits for a while. What a bummer. :(
---
Lmfao if you could buy the backpack while FTP players had to do that tedious ass quest there would be a fucking riot. Get over yourself
---
Yeah but if an enemy steps on the pressure plate it still works and they get inside. Trying to find a copy of the keypad door plans for sale.
---
The club house, the room in the middle of the bottom floor. On a small desk towards the little kitchen area
---
just spam map team invites until one sticks.  then send them a message
---
I used to have this exact problem.  Now I use pressure plates and automatic doors.
---
But then fix other melee weapons...
---
Gets destroyed after 20 or 30 minutes, did you even read the post?
---
That is ea tho. Hopefully Bethesda treats they‚Äôre employees a bit better
---
I noticed the same thing I logged in and idk what's heavier I went from a solid 186 on Monday night and now I can't get it below 200
---
When you spawn in to Whitespring (not the golf club) go right and head toward the maintenance area. There is always one squirrel there in the sidewalk right before you get to the first ghoul lying in the ground by the dumpster. Where did you find the cat in the ash heap?
---
I could probably get the listed explosive damage, but I have no idea how it works ingame. For example, some reported the same explosion can hit multiple limbs and deal way more damage as listed. Also I have no data on explosive resistances of enemies at all.
---
Pressure plates activate when an enemy stands on it still so it "works" but I still find critters in my hosue
---
"Cannot assign item: The workshop's budget has been exceeded."
---
Still, I'm not sure if they consciously can path that and it's on a slight delay to get in (and sometimes a delay to activate). You really have to want and try to get in through that method to succeed.
---
Theyre are self closing doors....
---
Use the powered doors with a pressure plate on the inside, I use the ones without code inside my house with a plate in both sides. My doors are always closed
---
Being online doesn't mean I have to play with others. Especially when Bethesda said I can play this game solo.
---
I have this and its great
---
Sorry misread your post as robots not having weak spots somehow
---
Wear a fedora. Aquire bones.
---
Do you need someone to help you get that revival?  if you are on Xbox, i got you
---
Wear a fedora and pick up bones
---
Same here...
---
I'm planning to get some BOS modded combat armor in my vending machine by the weekend myself. I spent about half an hour this morning modding out different pieces for it. üòÅ I'm really looking forward to seeing what will and won't sell.. is my location going to work against me? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This is exciting stuff!!
---
Nuke zones, events, farming high-level mobs, etc. 
---
Personally I couldn't give a crap about levels past 50 aside from finishing up my build, you don't really get much aside from perk cards past 50.
---
It was my understanding that if it's not locked it's up for grabs.
---
Nifty, thanks.
---
If the door is open, leave it open. I've fast traveled to camps since vending started and found myself spawning inside, trapped because all the doors are locked, with the machine outside. So I can't get out and buy, and I have to wait to travel away because of the random enemy spawns.
---
I did. Twice actually. Nowhere does it say the vendor got destroyed. It could have been assumed with how you worded having nasty neighbors but you know what the say about people who assume. Maybe make it more clear next time
---
No biggie bro. I'm slowly working my all-explosives build and it's tricky to plan out. Good stuff either way! Thanks.
---
Thanks, I put the post 50 there to explain it‚Äôs an existing character that I need to get new weapon skills in.
---
Any item with bones in it ?
---
I tried picking up mole rat teeth
---
You have to wear a fedora while a bunch of guys give you their ‚Äúbones‚Äù
---
 *idle unless there‚Äôs a costume I haven‚Äôt found.
---
I just added you. My IGN is Xschtief. Let's help us out together.
---
1 cap per percent is fair, slightly cheaper and they will move quicker.
---
People need to stop hoarding every junk piece they see. Problem solved !
---
Cool!
---
Do anyone know where to get deathclaw hide?
---
Shhhhh
---
Maybe some consolidation instead of one mega function bench.  Combine weapons with armor, chemistry with cooking.
---
I am OK with learning new things but that is hardly the point. If the game tells a story and then asks questions about it - fine. But asking real life questions unrelated to the game is poor design in my opinion. It just feels like a chore.
---
Power armor is affected by this too. They all have much lower defense without the extra. My non pa character has more defense than my pa character now. The only reason to use pa now is stabilized for armor pen.
---
I think you'd sell some, but would do better at 85,
---
Liberty Valence? üòù
---
It literally says it‚Äôs a skin in the description.
---
Probably like skulls and tibia. You'll find plenty around where wendigo and super mutants are.
---
I will if on Xbox
---
What 10% are you taking about?
---
Now that's what i call "formal"
---
Also nowhere does it state 20-30 minutes. Not being a dick I just don‚Äôt assume things. I see what I read and nothing more. I hate grey areas. I apologize if I came off dickish. ‚Äò‚ÄòTwas not my intention
---
Dude idk what the fuck it even is lol
---
I think if a player sees that the average price for an item is x, and then he visits a vending machine and it's listed for 2x he could make a well informed decision not to buy it.
---
Ah, thanks,
---
Saving and up voting cuz I'd love to know!
---
I've never had that happen.
---
Do people drink alcohol for the stats often? I‚Äôm assuming melee builds might us it, but I‚Äôve always looked at booze as something you chug 10 of sometimes to complete dailys, but otherwise has no purpose. I‚Äôd gladly sell alcohol cheap if people us it.
---
GOOD BOT
---
They could add an "in search" into the player vending. Set an volume of whatever your looking for, along with a cap amount that you're willing to pay for said items. That way, players can buy and sell right at your camp.
---
A printable LIST of all these damn exam things would be 409857340928374509234875 % better than going back to the in-game challenge listings....pain in the nuts comes to mind leaning towards fuck this shit. 
---
When things go good Beth excels but when things go bad the Beth bites the giant big one brutally with total fail sauce jeezus.
---
Nope.  It‚Äôs opportunism.  Not my thing but they‚Äôd never catch me more than once so I wouldn‚Äôt change the game because of a few people.
---
You on pc? Might be a mod issue
---
Yes I‚Äôm on did you still need help? Just figured the mic does not work but I can help you. What did you need?
---
Oh, well if you don't have many caps then yeah go build your fortune. Gota take care of yourself first! I gave this lowbie 40 stims earlier and I think he followed me for 45 minutes XD Feels good to give.
---
Take my water OP, I have enough inert flux to last several lifetimes
---
You‚Äôd be surprised. I sold nearly a hundred 10mm rounds at a cap each out of my machine earlier today. I threw them in there because my only other option was dropping them. I had the space to spare, so I figured ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù They sold to the first guy to come to my CAMP.
---
did it 2 times so far, first time only bugs kept spawning(glitch) while you need to keep the fire lit
---
second time completed it but never got a recipe/plan.... :(
---
dont know what the cooldown period for it is tho
---
Liberty Beta
---
So you're thinking you can get new skins from the challenges?
---
He is right, take one of 200 white fedoras you have in stash and go thru west tek 2times. Loot all bones from suprr muties. Done.

Still there. Great little spot lots of traffic. Come say  hi. I have the wooden 3 story covered in Maerica. With 2 Pip boy/girl outside. Everyone feel free to use all my work benches. See u guys around üòÅ
---
Wish I was that lucky. I switched to a switchplate powered door and still had 2 scorched in my house when I got back.
---
I've been to every treasure map site at least once and the best thing I got was a Dragon. I sold mine for 15c each because any more than that and you could just buy the kind of stuff you get from the, not to mention fast traveling.
---
Ah, I see now.  My bad.
---
And yes, I am.  The griefing will never stop so long as there is a reward in place for doing it.  Today it's this, that gets patched, tomorrow it's something new.  This has been a problem since launch.  And it isn't just a boo hoo I got griefed once, it's a daily thing.  As I said earlier there will always be jerks in the world, the griefing will not stop entirely, but currently they are being rewarded for making other peoples game experience shitty.  Try to justify it any way you like.
---
Oh no it does wipe out rads! I believe the wording is removes all rads from a revived player.
---
That's the point. But it won't remove any mutations. So my friend who is mutation heavy but doesn't have starched genes 2, has limited ways of getting rid of rads without getting rid of the mutations too.
---
Awesome! Thank you for this. It's such a hassle to game to keep all this stuff in order.
---
So far all of the shops I've stopped in were very reasonable... and actually more on the cheap side. I saw a two star two shot gatling gun for less than 1,000 caps. (just a 2 star... and I'm not sure what the second effect was but still!! Those are fun and it'd be totally worth that if I hadn't had one before)
---
Only got one coin i think
---
Did you drink the moonshine before doing it?
---
WV lumber in the top left has lots of mutants, as does Wade Airport.
---
There are also a number of mutants at Grafton Dam, Grafton Steel, and the Penetentary.  All have at least one PA spawn - Wade has 2.
---
Here's one of my fuson core routes starting at Wade:
---
&gt;!Leave wade airport, drop down and do the teapot event.  If posiedon is not owned, go there and check the table next to the core processor.  There is normally a plan and a 100% core on the table.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Leave there and goto the train station.  Check to the right of the workbench.  Pick up the box of screws thats usually there.  Take out the 3 or so mutants across the tracks, then head back to the red bridge, take out the Grafton Monster on the way.   !&lt;
---
You may find Graham nearby.
---
&gt;!Cross the bridge, go to the Hornwright HQ and do the quest.  There's usually a set in the basement. !&lt; There are lots of scorched here
---
&gt;!recross the bridge , go west to the nuka cola plant.  Theres a PA spawn in the basement, as well as a fusion generator.  THere is another generator on the roof.  Leave there, goto camden.  Make sure you pick up a key - you'll need it later.  !&lt;
---
&gt;!Clear that, backtrack to Nuka plant.  !&lt;
---
Depending on how long your play sessions are, next time you log in, reverse course all the way to wade, then head north for those PA spawns.  I would go via the gorge bridge and the Pharma plant.
---
OR
---
instead of heading north, go east and head toward the SE side of the ash heap (The other mining HQ building) and start on the excavator quest.  It's going to take time to collect all the mats to make excavator.
---
Theres at least one side quest you'll find that takes you to the ash heap.  So will part of the overseers quest.
---
You'll be able to collect most of, if not all, the mats you need for excavator in the ash heap. (of course, raid the PA stations there.)
---
They should have the amount of caps for camps
---
Presumably, from Deathclaws! You can find them all over, but a guaranteed spawn is at [Deathclaw Island](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/0a/Deathclaw_Island_map.png), in the river at the top left of the Forest area.
---
Wierd they must have changed at some point.
---
Yeah I tried that, enemies still seem to get in so I'm looked for coded plans now
---
So you have a plate the visitor steps on after entering that closes the door?
---
yup, the whole update is a way to claw resources and caps from us, it's really tranparent. We have to server hop to complete some, like killing X amount of enemies in X place, which uses up food and water just by relogging. It's just grindy and annoying really.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve only got like 5k caps right now, and I‚Äôm not gonna blow it on the first decent item I see going for that price. I plan on shopping around to get a feel for what prices are, maybe find a bargain. It‚Äôll take some days for everything to settle in.
---
How did you get the stimpak diffuser?
---
Yeah that pic is the plague rider.
---
Items that you can't sell to the vendors:
---
--plans at 50/100/200 (according to rarity/power)
---
--ammos at 1caps each
---
--alcohol at the components price plus a small benefit
---
Items you can sell to the vendors:
---
--drugs and chems at 100/200/300 caps (psycho/psychobuff/psychotats)
---
For the rest go with what please you but I'd advise not selling legendaries as long as the vendor has not been implemented...
---
Exactly this, I'm thinking maybe there was something that affected the weight of weapons but im not 100% sure
---
Yes, it counts. I done it with.
---
Ahh ok thanks for clarifying, makes sense now :)
---
Checked Grahm today, he didn't carry the plan nor the item
---
Yes, my mic doesn't work either.. I just need help reviving someone in water. Thank youu
---
There is a redditor that created several fun ideas that now that shops are around have new relevancy. He's where I got the kill room idea. And he did a maze that sounds like the Saw idea you have.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab2l7h/welcome_to_murder_church/
---
Yes, but you can only find them from random drops. I have a serrated bowie knife, I think in my 350 hours of playing I've maybe found two of them. A dataminer said something like the mods exist but are bugged to not spawn as physical mods or be possible to attach as crafting recipes, so you can only get them if an enemy drops the weapon with it already attached
---
You're real sick, Marv. You know that, right?
---
I would also be cool with being able to convert Ammo from one type to another.  I mean they have this in friggin fallout *3*.  they could have it in 76.
---
Just make it always a material sink, but let people convert to what they actually want to use / sell
---
It's no different than the Refractor perk which gives 40 Energy Resistance. There's a mutation that gives you 100 Energy Resistance which makes the perk essentially useles.
---
I should get rid of most of my crops. Just keep mutfruit/tatos/corn for a steady supply of adhesive.
---
Melons, gourds, and blackberries serve no purpose I can see aside from being worth 1c or making beverages and I have plenty of water for that.
---
You will. Not everyone wants them but those that do, DO.
---
currently bugged and doesn‚Äôt let you.

---
Team up with me if you like
---
&gt; The was never advertised as being a solo game. 
---
Not advertised as a solo game but Todd Howard said it can be played as solo. This DLC can't be played as a solo player. Just another lie added to the pile.
---
When does this event happen?
---
Xbox one
---
I'm pretty sure you just tippy tappy some code together and it spits it out.
---
Wow, maybe the rocket turrets I have help (they distract the enemies). My base is across from the antique shop near Watoga and that's a scorched spawn point (usually have a couple near the shop that notice the camp and rush it).
---
No, in the map menu with all of the other challenges (daily, weekly, character, etc).
---
Maybe pets are included in the CAMP protections from players.
---
No problem! I was really struggling to keep track of it all while writing out lists by hand, so I figured this would make things at least marginally easier. :D
---
Use the non coded brick door for your outside door, then put a code pylon on the outside. That's how I did it, not the best looking but the best way to wire it
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right, I just looked it up the guy said you can get it at the harpers ferry vendor. I want to say, I must have picked it up somewhere. Sorry for the misinformation.
---
Doesn't work as far as I could tell, it seems more like an appointment book to me.
---
Awesome thanks man
---
Ah, you're right, that was my other post. Sorry to assume but yeah, it gets destroyed quick outside. I think enemies go for powered objects first
---
I didn't do the medic badge I did Archer, Athlete and the Mammal one. they seemed like the easiest to me, and you only need to do three initially
---
You are... LOL
---
Then make your own to mess with victims... err... customers.
---
You don‚Äôt need it to get a backpack. Choosing archer, athlete, swimming worked pretty quick for me. Few hours. 
---
Also bashing with the crossbow breaks it faster btw.
---
That works! Thanks
---
Ah ok awesome ty
---
When you fast travel you land relative to the camp, though I‚Äôm honestly not sure on angle and distance, but you may be able to extrapolate if you have an alt or two with a camp.
---
No, they step on the plate outside, the door opens long enough for them to walk through and closes automatically.  Then on the inside, there is another plate that does the same so they can get out.
---
Yep. Lone Wanderer and travel agent are all I need space for. Hard bargain when I buy/sell
---
OK, on my way. How does it work, you just kill me in water and revive?
---
High jacking this to say anyone on PS4 needs someone to die for them send me an add. PSN: tbz709
---
I maaaay need to change my privacy setting so you can do so but I‚Äôll be on in 3-4 hours so hold tight
---
Nah makes more sense tbh. I‚Äôve seen players create similar systems in DnD. 
---
If you could just buy the best weapons immediately straight up, it‚Äôs too fast. You‚Äôd get geared and be done. This just lets you re-roll trash into something potentially good. Hopefully it‚Äôs just not too much scrip per roll.
---
I can help you now if you want, just send me a dm of your gt
---
I would just appreciate different skins but that take up less space just like the small cooking station. Or have them be stackable like a combo washer and dryer
---
Ayup, 12 hours.
---
I have turrets but I get shot at from across the river out of my turrets range so they aren't very helpful
---
&gt; Pvp is the only reason I play this mess of a game. 
---
Wow.  I mean... seriously?  Do you know anything at all about the history of the fallout franchise?  I mean, look, I have nothing against PVP as a concept. But anyone who has followed this franchise for any length of time knew that this game was never going to deliver the same kind of PVP experience you see in games like Call of Duty.  
---
I guess what I am saying is that, if PVP is your top priority, there are so many other games that you could be playing.
---
At night, just server hop there it will trigger.
---
This happens in practically every online game, though.
---
if you played the past fallout games, liberty prime would throw his nukes like a football, hence why he yeets it at commies
---
camp adams during night time, i think someone has to go there for it to trigger tho. if it's night and it isnt triggering i assume someone already did it and is in the cooldown mode
---
Agreed ... seems logical!  Hodor.

---
That‚Äôs worth looking into. Thanks!
---
I just rebuilt my base somewhere pretty (on a waterfall) but it frequently spawns me under the water stuck beneath my water purifier I hope no one thinks I'm trying to be cute.
---
Wasn't a ammo converter in the files?

You have to follow the link to see all 4
---
They removed the ability to add stars with sacrificial and scorched mods
---
*Pulls out rolling pin*
---
"YOURE IN THE SHIT NOW!"
---
There's a line though.
---
Like, here's a quest from Borderlands 2 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZKh8puhzg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZKh8puhzg)):
---
1. Collect 139,377 brown rocks
---
2. Defeat Ug-Thak, Lord of Skags
---
3. Pilfer lost staff of Mount Schuler 
---
4. Defeat Destroyer of Worlds 
---
5. Dance for my amusement
---
By the way, it's a joke. All of it. While the NPC giving you the quest lists all the objectives, a panel falls off revealing the quest objective. You click it, and it's done. It's funny.
---
Other games take this a little too seriously. As in, "Kill 5,391 elite enemies, while wearing a blue shirt, at nighttime, in Judicial District". That's...a bit much. 
---
Also, a distinction must be made between "difficulty" and "tedium". There's nothing difficult about performing a mundane task 500 times. It's not difficult, it's just tedious. Simply taking a piece of content, and artificially drag out how long it takes to complete by making it as tedious and obtuse as possible is not a good design. If they want content to take a while...then create enough content so that it takes a while! I know, mind-shattering, right?
---
I die in the water and you revive me
---
Personally wouldn't be a fan of some kinda deus ex machina bench. Now if they allowed players to assign multiple functions to a bench, *as an option*, then fine. I personally love my giant workshop.
---
Dude I killed 1000s and know that. AA didn't magically kill a full build, and stagger is the dumb stuff I was talking about to counter 1 build. And the price of the stuff to come close is obnoxious.
---
 I literally get paid to play a competitive shooter and can tell you sent/ass was a joke with almost no counterplay. Handmades could be tuned down though.
---
So, I haven't played since the Beta last fall and that was because someone was kind enough to give me an extra key. How much have things changed with the game (Bug fixes, QOL updates, etc.)? Also, how often does the PC version go on sale?
---
Thanks, it was delicious and refreshing.
---
I didn't realize that, I may need to move them indoors, that way I can close the shop while I transfer caps, I'm running out of space, so it looks like I'll be starting another account this evening for some added Cap Mules.
---
Wondering the same , got myself a pack wich gives 60 carryweight. I dont know how to motivate myself to get more badges
---
Dans_4777
---
I did it 3times. First i got plan for some tent. Second i got S'mores recipe. Last i got nothing.
---
Also i think i got one badge for first one. So maybe it gives you daily badge.
---
Damn, I didn't know that. It sucks that we don't have the ability to attach a mod to a bowie knife that we actually like. I hope this was just accidentally overlooked and Besthesda actually fixes the problem. :( Thanks for answering.
---
Got that "not selected" when trying to place a wall I had just selected to move. I was trying to put it back in the same spot.
---
I exited build mode and went back in, then it worked fine.
---
Yeah, I feel my tse shotgun and lever action are kinda useless, my tse with anti armor perk card and bloodied rifle do more damage for me. I miss days when my other tse were able to do damage.
---
What were the recipes and plans.?
---
Our group bought 11 recipes for 9500 total. 8000 is a lot for one recipe
---
Sounds more like the Mystic. You go to her shop, pick an effect you want to change, and RNG will bring up 4 options to shoose from
---
Yup yup, I'll take a look. Thanks!
---
Some tent and S'mores recipes. Gona grind it for more info
---
I think a way of looking at it is that these badges will be obtained in time, not something you farm out over night (most of them at least), simply because that is too tedious in most cases. You can get up to 100 carry weight to my knowledge.
---
P e r h a p s
---
But it says it's  a skin
---
Please dont say it can go over 60lbs lol. I need motivation lol
---
Good answer \^\^
---
Zooming never seems to work for me, I don't know why they bothered with it.
---
I‚Äôm enjoying it much more now than I did at release. I find myself looking forward to new content (Photo Quests, Scout Quests) and meeting new friends.
---
Better be more than 20% longer duration. Should at least try to rival 1-2 perk points of Good With Salt
---
It seems like you have to be completely still. With things like the lurks, it also helps if they're dead and not trying to kill you. :p
---
Dont be lazy. Read the patch notes.
---
Yeah same bro
---
The pioneer scout camp right?
---
Fallout 76 is mentioned in the article.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious, and yes, they‚Äôre totally a dick. 
---
My CAMP is near a cliff, and for some reason no matter how I repositioned the ground floor the fast travel point was *always* right on the very edge of the cliff over a fatal drop. Like, your character‚Äôs toes are hanging over the edge.
---
I always have to remember to stop and pan 360 before I try to move, or ‚ÄúSpawnicide Leap‚Äù claims another victim.
---
It's really not about the extra weight. I primarily wanted the refrigeration mod. Mostly it's the principle though. Todd told us we could customize our legendary items with the new vendor - probably a lie. Then backpacks could be used with power armor - oops, sorry, yeah that was incorrect. I mean they even went out of their way to say that backpacks could be used with power armor. They could have just left that fact out if they wanted to downplay it.
---
There seems to be a bug on xbox. In my inventory the cross is almost broken but at the weapon bench it is full durability and I cannot repair it
---
I don't have Grounded, just Speed Demon, Marsupial, and Carnivore. Their negative effects are nothing to worry about.
---
76 is mentioned in the article as well.
---
I've thought for quite some time now that perhaps the majority of the bugs and glitches in the beginning hit players who teamed up harder than solo players.  I've played solo 98% of the time and didn't experience a fraction of the problems people playing in teams did.  Not saying they didn't happen, just that they weren't as bad for some players as others and offering my theory as to why this might be.
---
Wait did they change those armors were you run or stand still to have 25% chance to not negate the damage? Cause that be awesome.
---
Here are screenshots from a data mine of each: http://imgur.com/a/iiCn6Nt
---
But they still have the keyboard that pops up on screen that you can navigate right? Haven't played console for a few years so idk if they got rid of that
---
There is no reason to screw people, really yourself for items that can be found thru some grinding areas and seeing some of the other prices, I will say I will do what I can to undercut their prices as much as possible.
---
GREAT Find on the G-Axe I have only seen others with them I have never found one and with he TS Combat Shotgun, I bought a TSE Handmade around in February for 3000, I had the caps and was tired of only finding crappy boards and knives.
---
I was wondering if the "Who Pooped the Bed" was going to be more of a thing after the post a couple of days ago, Good Job Sir!
---
Actually no, you're every wrong. It's right in the patch notes. C.A.M.P.s no longer take damage from attacking players unless the defender attacks back.
---
It‚Äôd be nice if it stopped the condition or at least double to spoil timer but I bet it‚Äôll be 20% like you said
---
Lol you can have my water :) take a corn cob too while you‚Äôre at it.
---
Yeah, I saw they added push to talk, which was a big problem for me at the start of the game.
---
No. You're still wrong according to the patch notes.
---
One of the devs said it on here right after they banned everyone
---
That is why they should have made survival fresh start.
---
OK :) 
---
So what would a reasonable price be then?
---
i have no idea.  but it *SHOULD* be if it isnt.  they can literally just re-use the assets from an old game, just like they are already doing for everything else.
---
I didn't get a badge from that event, but you do get one from Treadly for the bug parts quest. I think it resets everyday at 8pm like biv.
---
End-game crafting materials are always a for sure sale. Bulk amounts of springs/screws/aluminum/ballistic fiber, etc., at cheaper-than-vendor prices are a sure sale ime.
---
With the sign I was hoping to go for more of a Dusk Til Dawn House of Horrors vibe. But the inside doesn't hold up the vibe. Hard to decorate a Fallout strip club though. If only they used the New Vegas model set...
---
I agree, Its just the only content I have left besides vendoring and that happens passively.
---
Of course it is.
---
You have a point but it's hard with those high capacity backpack mods staring at me
---
Locked doors no less.
---
Seems more like somebody cheated themselves out of 5k to me.
---
I also killed 5 behemonts.
---
Went thru west tek looking at blood balls.
---
Checked most of hunters cabins.
---
I find zero deathclaw hides, in whole day plaing.
---
Thats why i am asking multiple times.
---
I bet you have that sexy picture of Mr. Pebbles on the wall don't you? Who could resist?
---
I‚Äôm inclined to agree with you on that, I notice my turret gets wrecked while my crops and signs before the turrent get left alone. Maybe they are ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù to energy
---
76 is mentioned in the article as well. I think our awareness started at EA as the article mentions, but the awareness didn‚Äôt stop there as more companies adopted similar models.
---
Why did they remove it?
---
Thanks I'll try it
---
I really enjoy these challenges because most of them can be done while I'm doing other things (like taking pictures of various creatures, or crafting stuff.) It can't be done in an hour which seemed to be a complaint of the other new quests. This is something that will actually take me a few days to complete.
---
Also I've sold a bunch of plans and mods from my camp I am LOVING the new vendor system!
---
The tests are silly but I don't mind them even if I get overconfident and wind up having 1/5 correct and realizing I'm dumber than I thought.
---
I haven't been focusing on one challenge I just have them tracked and get happy when something gets completed .
---
This isn't a race, guys. Especially if you're one of the people at high level bored with nothing to do. Maybe don't fast travel? Go for a walk, explore some people's camps, take some fucking pictures and enjoy some scenery.
---
because it's a fun game, and I think most people enjoy having fun from time to time?
---
L
---
When you find an efficient way to get something semi-expensive its rather easy to get 1400 daily - from a single character - which totals to 7000 per account for most industrious cap farmers. You only need one leveled up toon to craft/farm the stuff for sale, and a buddy to drop it between chars.
---
Only someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs jealous puts 10+ emoji‚Äôs buddy.. it‚Äôs a game.. with fake online currency.. you do know that right..?
---
Damm , cant recall any other places i would have seen em
---
I‚Äôve got 5 characters.  Having too many caps?  Sounds like commie talk!
---
1 character is going to collect all power armor mods.  That will probably take me the rest of the year.  Other 4 are mix matching serum recipes and stocking up on furniture.  Getting all furniture plans can cost you a fair amount.  
---
So in other words, running out of things to buy?  Roll another character!
---
And yet all of them were successes, some of them enormous successes. This one wasn't, because they screwed up.
---
Right nae bor ya fucking cactus
---
In player vending trades 10% of the caps dont go to the seller, I stead they just disappear
---
i built my camp as a public rest stop months ago, but nobody ever came despite it's location. and even when people did come, i had issues with people agreeing to barter with me.
---
now people come by all the time. buy my wares, have a beer, work on their armor, rest in the bunkhouse, play some guitar by the fire.
---
SpaceZombie's Rest Stop is finally a successful business!
---
Hey i also have this problem times five as i have five end game characters who all need to do this
---
Help each other out?
---
Like something out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. A Liberator panics and starts running for the hills. Liberty Not-Prime just stands still for like a minute, calmly takes out a nuke, and throws it, which lands directly on the Liberator (who's about 5 years away from him at that point)
---
Hey if you are still on, i'll send you a friend request in 5 minutes. Thanks a lot!
---
Thanks mate I‚Äôll do that next time I‚Äôm on.
---
No it's not.
---
I don't know, GARY. AM I?
---
I saw a guy at the Kiddy Corner cabins and said on voice "hey, can we team up real quick and you get hurt so I can revive you?" He did the nod thing (mouse up and down).  I had that part completed in 5 minutes.  Just ask someone, this community is generally pretty helpful.
---
Here is feedback. Your ai has misinterpreted intent. Even without the context of what is hapening in game, its the "for" not "because" that gives it away.
---
That being said. I am happy it exists and that it safe rather than sorry.
---
I went on a shopping spree yesterday, hopping servers several times and visiting all the camps with vending machines.
---
Pricing was all over the place, I bought good 3\* Weapons and Armor for 150 caps, and saw lots of miscellaneous Junk at higher than vendor prices, and even found one with several worthless 3\* weapons listed for 15k each, I'm guessing they were hoping other players would not be able to inspect them.
---
That can be the case, cause i have one of each badges more than challenges done and i did today both those daily thing.
---
idk, my Excavator adds 300 pounds lol
---
I never really end up using much of my aluminum and bulk sell it to vendors. Looks like I'll have to set up my own scrap shop.
---
Area-wise, I am assuming near Whitesprings?
---
Any idea how much extra carry weight??
---
If it's a stealth nerf, maybe it's really a fix? Where does it say condition relates to better stats? Other than berserker/opposite effect?
---
Yeah sure why not
---
Player name is: martynbez
---
just make a wall with a window, pass the wire through, then change the wall to a solid piece.
---
Well eventually each of them was polished, maybe even this one will be. But they have become a laughing stock at this point. If they fail with Starfield, there might be a heavy price to pay. They really should have no appetite at releasing broken games.
---
It amazes me that people like OP exist.
---
He can't kill you unless you attack back, or unless you're on a survival server.
---
can you get the pemmican recipe?
---
Need help with it too. 
---
PSN: ArachnidArcader
---
Absolutly no :D
---
I‚Äôve stocked my near to flatwoods camp with low level fully modded weapons and armor, even a few low level legendaries. Want to really go to town with that fully auto pipe rifle with the big mag? Well there‚Äôs plenty of 38 ammo for sale as well
---
Thanks, that limit seems really low considering we have to wait awhile for the new vendor. I hope that vendor prices aren't insane, like 500 for 3 star good stat item/weapon.
---
Give me my Vim captains blend
---
yeah got 40 scrip for it
---
I've been exploring the whole map while very low level - like running into level 70 enemies at level 17, lol.
---
I ran out of adhesive from all the repairs I had to do, so now I have the farm to supplement.
---
Currently I have way more than I need, but I'm still edgy from that time when all my armor was broken and I couldn't repair any of it, haha.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll have a go at the workshops, how do I get access to the burrows?
---
I see. My buddy posted the pictures on our discord, but I dont seem to find a way to post them in this reddit, basically his bloodied level 25 buzzsaw went from above 200 damage to 40 damage. Both picts show the weapon was at +200 durablility. So if the additional durability was amplifying the damage that makes sense.
---
I was really happy to see the buffs to the other weapons. I wanted to use them but the damage wasn't good. Here we go, I will be in the market for these:  
---
* **Hunting Rifle:** Increased the damage bonuses provided by the Prime and .50 Caliber Receiver mods. These mods now respectively grant the highest and second-highest damage increases of any Hunting Rifle receiver mods.
---
* **Plasma Guns:** Damage increased by 30%.
---
* **Enclave Plasma Guns:** Damage increased by 10% to 30%.
---
The tears are real, the laughters not.
---
Yep, this is the best way early on. After you've played a while and have some caps, you can buy them from vendors, too.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean, like a 2 for 1cap type deal, I could see happening but not 1/4 or any other part of a cap unless quantity is factored. 
---
I bought ammo yesterday and don‚Äôt mind paying at all!
---
spot on mate booting game up now
---
IGN smokeyninjas
---
Saaame. I have spent so many hours perfecting my church, and making it into the perfect sanctuary for people. Having hundreds of stimpaks and aid items readily available for people to buy was the final pi√®ce de r√©sistance.
---
IDK that area matters a ton, since your vending machine puts an icon on the map as soon as you power it up.  Near 76 might be better, if only because players can fast travel there for free.
---
Sidebar - put your machine on a power switch. :) Turn it on when you‚Äôre ‚ÄúOpen for Bizness‚Äù
---
I‚Äôll make sure to keep an eye out for those events. I just wish this character had gotten more perk cards I didn‚Äôt need at the time so I‚Äôd have more to go with lol.
---
That would be pretty cool!
---
Sorry, I was born in a barn.
---
Oh shit lol. Thanks for the heads up üëç
---
I was about to give you shit because this blew up way more than i thought it would and i cant keep up with the comments, so i only saw your quote at the start in my notifications.
---
I agree. Special checks should not be a requierment.
---
PvP is still frusterating at times, PvE however has had so many small QoL upgrades and so many bugfixes that it is actually, very enjoyable.
---
Not everyone has trusted people to transfer stuff or 2 accounts of this game lol. And joining a friend to dump stuff in a world chest and switching characters doesn't guarantee that friend crashes or leaves the server or your items stored are safe.
---
I have a camp pretty much a 45 second stroll South of vault 76, and it **always** says there's enemies nearby.. which could be a squirrel or who knows what kind of garbage.
---
 Having to run in some direction for 30+ seconds and hope I find a spot without "enemies" just to be able to fast travel was always annoying, I'll take having to wait 15 seconds instead any day.
---
If you head to my camp I‚Äôve made something to chuck yahself off lol
---
So was I but they shut the fucking door first lol
---
Pioneer bots at Kiddie Corner Cabins and Dolly Sods Wilderness.
---
bruh, stranger danger. life rule 101.
---
Nice. Now a legacy pet deathclaw since you can no longer befriend one. Don't let yours die.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs southern most building, near the lake.
---
Idk how much it updates . I hovered a camp that said it had like 2000 ammo . Checked all their vendors and not a single 1 had anything under the ammo tab
---
I really wish tracking the challenges would have them show up on your UI. I'm also on possum and there's just so much to keep track of...
---
Good point on that. I figured Whitesprings because of all the new vendors, but since the vault is still free fast-travel, people would definitely appreciate the discounted checkpoint.
---
Also could do a noob-friendly establishment with lower-leveled gear and mods made for cheap and sold at a hefty discount :)
---
Yesterday, I found two broken prosnap (sp?) in various places, like suitcases and such.   It feels like they added more drops to help.      I was going to sell one to help, but they don‚Äôt show up as an option for me, unless it was a glitch.
---
This is exactly why I'd hoped the vendor interfaces would just be click to pop a trade window from the map. Social aspect is cool - had a couple of nice conversations with folks dropping by to peruse my wares - but on the whole the cost of them tromping through my camp might be a little high after I've made it through the parts of my stash i want to get rid of.
---
You are totally right, I should see for myself, and I definitely will when I have time for it. I feel as reviews and other videos won't represent how the game is fully and I just wanted to get the opinion of those who still play it.
---
If you are on Xbox then do a hard reset by holding the power button down. This is what fixed something similar for me at the Whitespring.
---
Liberty Dave
---
Have you seen which skins you're giving me  hope man I saw that the main skin was in the atomic shop so I got a little worried I mean I don't mind dropping a couple bucks since I enjoy the game but 500 atom points is pushing it for a backpack skin
---
this might be good for me though the quest is bugged for one of my characters.
---
It goes to your main account, I was hoping it stored at the vending machine since I had 22k caps and someone was on a buying spree and got me to 25k, so I think I lost caps, I think caps that go over 25k should be stored at the vending machine. Had to go buy mutation plan quick.
---
Ps4? Lmao I found a few teddy bears lined next to my bed onetime when I went to rest and went afk to smoke a cigarette outside. No one was even CLOSE to my camp. I tripped out. Every time I go back to my camp I look at everything to see if he struck again
---
Why? Are you gunna come tell me to kill myself too? Be jealous on your own time in your own posts.
---
As I said, I recognize the work around - but that's what it is, a work around for a bad system.
---
Can you provide s source for when we were told we could customize legendary items through a vendor?
---
Yeah right about the time they were to release repair kits.
---
ps4
---
Nooooooo. I‚Äôm role playing a commie
---
My apologies again, I was reading the wrong posts comments. I hadn't meant to be rude, and I'm sorry. I was overwhelmed with responses and misread which one this comment was from. A lot of hate out here, hence the short fuse. Thanks for the convo though and have a great day!
---
Fuck that, free market. I'm selling everything at dirt prices to move the product. High volume sales makes up for low prices. I'm the Cosco of Apalachia.
---
I'm using my own business model in real life, give distribution prices, move the volume, and those who buy can turn around and make money. I made over 15k in caps last night in about an hours time, sold everything I had. Now I spend a day restocking, then the sale is on again a day from now. BANG! Take it to the bank!
---
But when you just look at first glance it says "backpack"
---
Sure... "roleplaying"
---
You don't have any friends, do you?
---
I agree with you. However the constant nerf stuff is annoying.  I would rather have them buff enemies than nerf my stuff all the time.  
---
I think they need to take a hard look at the weapons and armor in this game and do some re-works.  The legendary stuff in particular.
---
Interesting. It‚Äôs worked for me and a couple of other people I‚Äôve told about it. I have no idea then. I‚Äôm sorry though!
---
Not needed. Knowing your life is miserable is pleasure enough for me.
---
Oh my god, all you people just need a subreddit for hating floating camps. It might not look the best but it is the most practical.
---
lol I'll make sure to man, thank you! I just hadn't had time keeping track of the game, I just see JuiceHead constantly post update videos saying they were "gigantic updates" so I got curious of the condition of the game now.
---
How is that any different than following a game guide while playing any other game?  It takes 5 seconds to look something up on Google.  I like it, it's something different.
---
i was in grafton to do it of a building but if you got something setup i'll come to you
---
Anyone getting a glitch where once you put in a piece of armour it won't let you scroll down unless you exist the vendor?
---
I feel ya. Reviews will mostly bash this game but it‚Äôs way more than the sum of its parts. Those that play regularly have had to defend it non-stop since launch and I think we‚Äôre just a little tired of that. It‚Äôs a fun game. I definitely had no intentions of sinking 800hrs into it but that‚Äôs where I am. And I don‚Äôt have any intentions of slowing down.
---
I removed some of the Concrete Defensive barriers last night to facilitate working on CAMP modifications, but now I am unable to put them back, also several things are unable to be placed anywhere, the game says "Nothing is Selected"
---
On another not, does anyone know where to find the Bar Items in the menu?  I purchased them but can't find them anywhere.
---
Yeah I could make a post telling people how to manage their weight properly but honestly this community doesn't deserve my help. So instead they get my ridicule and pity.
---
Something like taking pictures mirelurks and building a frog habitat at your camp
---
Do you get anything for doing them?
---
Well we then moved to a trailer park. And now I live in a van down by the river. 
---
With the doors open.
---
Also, my camp has no walls or doors.  ;)
---
Not a problem man. I completely understand. You take care. Maybe I‚Äôll see you around one day. Ps I‚Äôll shut your door for you üòâ
---
We need to push for zip lines in the next patch. Build them in your camps. Or, glowing red door handles that make you take a bit of damage. Bring the Home Alone pack to the atomic shop.
---
I literally never see him anymore. Anyone else?
---
This is my pet peeve in this game. God damn I hate floating bases.
---
Wow, all you can do is resort to personal attacks rather than using logic for your argument. You really are a sad pathetic excuse for human excrement.
---
I've been told the spawn placement is relative to where you place your camp workbench, maybe try moving it around before moving everything next time
---
ah....
---
"Milk Brahmin successfully (0/10) ", i tried that whit a glowing lv40 radstag, didn't end well :/
---
Must have read it wrong the first time :(
---
fyi I had some trouble with this working while wearing the dirty fedora. Putting on a battered fedora worked.
---
Huntersville is a good spot, the bones you get off super mutants count.
---
I will have to do some testing when I get on this evening.
---
My shop has a wide selection of all things.  It so far has only sold non perishable food, chems, aide and plans. 
---
Hardly any weapons were/are sold. My guess is with market forums and the like are holding that monopoly. Plus people are likely holding their weapons and armour for next week.
---
I have my purifier locked so i can sell my water, this is america after all. You know ultra capitalism and all that. 
---
Every opportunity to make coin matters.
---
Do those challenges give 1 badge each? Is there any daily that say gives 1 a day if in no hurry ?
---
Once I've cleared out my stash I'll just power off the vendor until I have stuff I want to sell again.
---
Just make a thread asking. Not hard.
---
Everyone without the perks is dumb, cool.
---
It's almost certainly a bug. There's nothing about the bowie knife that makes it too good to let us mod it
---
Disappointing, I can look past some of the more questionable design decisions since I can get the game for like ¬£12 now, but if it can't hit an acceptable minimum performance level I can't see myself enjoying it
---
Upvoting for awareness.  Pretty sure it was stated they‚Äôd work in power armor.
---
I am so going to do this
---
Eek. Good tip. I'll have to be careful.
---
If i can be sold, sell it. Don't miss on the Opportunity.
---
bird bones lol
---
Dude thank you for agreeing, I loved the game and I just kinda weened from it cause I was busy. But I kinda got hit by all the negative press and decided to not come back to it. I'm probably gonna be putting a lot of time into the game.
---
Awesome. Share a link when you post details!
---
If you're letting strangers use your bed, something tells me that that's NOT radtoad slime on your sheets, friend....üò£ü§¢
---
Yeah if it‚Äôs a robot or a ghoul I just blow their legs off, walk up to them while they crawl across the ground , point my revolver  between their eyes and whisper ‚Äúgoodnight you POS‚Äù
---
Wasteland improvement tax
---
Yeah I feel like unless you're holding a unicorn legendary, that people would only buy cheap to get scrips that you would rather just get yourself.
---
Did not expect food to be a hit. Maybe it's time to start up my juice stand again...
---
Yeah, I had thought that might be the case too.  I just got mad when I couldn‚Äôt change things, and decided to move back to an old spot I liked better.   I freed up a lot of camp budget, so it was worth it
---
Now I've found the god of farel gouls it's walking on air
---
Can anyone share links to some of the most viable builds in the game right now? I would also like to come back but have no clue where to even start. 
---
Last time I read up on builds Melee reigned supreme but I think it was nerfed?
---
That's hot. That's a hot way to live lol. I wasnt born in a barn but I have actually lived in a van by the river so thank you that was amazing
---
I went around last night buying any mags or bobble heads if they were 50 or less just to make people excited and I could get those trophies.
---
I can if you can do the same for me ha! Gt terryboff
---
You need to complete all the tasks for one category to get a badge. For example, you need to complete every Gardener task to get one Possum badge.
---
I put 1 cap per Rd on it last night and sold over 2k.
---
Nope. Went to all vendors and still can't see it :(
---
Hey thanks. Hopefully I'll have powered doors by then but we will see.
---
Craft a flamer, get 100 ammo. Break it down to learn mods. Repeat as necessary for ammo. It's supposed to be far easier way to get the ammo. I haven't tested it, but far too many mentioned it for it to be false (unless they nerfed it?)
---
What do you even do to get this? Nothing tells me how.
---
Ok... where's the improvement? Still seems like a dump to me.
---
3000 shotgun shells is like my dream lol.
---
Psn loudboy007 I need help too
---
I was afraid of that üòû thanks for clearing it up . Gonna stick to my +60 pack
---
Sure, whatever floats your boat.
---
My vendor selling a stealth Bowie knife. I'm on gay xbox though.
---
The ones I had sell quick were the  vegetarian ham, Cajun rice and beans, imitation seafood. Stuff like that. Canned food. And nuka cola. Mainly the quantum, grape, and orange.
---
Thanks, will doing it once count for both the normal "revive" and also the revive in water ?
---
The water im selling.
---
Why yes, I am on PS4. Unfortunately I don't believe I've had the pleasure of lining teddy bears, so I'm not your culprit, but sounds like a beautifully minded individual!
---
Whoops sorry about that
---
It was in their Known Issues thread on the Bethseda forums.
---
if you think having conversations with npcs is even remotely close to answering random trivia questions on a clunky terminal there's nothing I can say to help you understand the main problem I'm referring to
---
I have to deal with [this blurry bug](https://i.imgur.com/Zo8lSaU.png), visible mostly on cliffs. Looks like missing textures. If I move the mouse it smears image artifacts around on those spots. No mods or custom.ini
---
No idea how to fix this.
---
How would that be a scam? The same people purchasing on Reddit can also lookup similar items on Reddit to determine the market value-- thats their responsibility, not the seller's. The whole point of offering items to sell is to earn caps. The fact that someone more than doubled their money isnt fraud, it's being a savvy player.
---
I bought a max level Plasma Rifle last night, Furious, +50% Vats Crit Damage, &amp; FFR, for 150 caps, but I'm not selling it.
---
A lot of people in the industry, like any industry, are forced to eat shit by poor management. They literally can't afford to stick to their morals and ideals or they'll lose their house or starve. I can't blame them at all.  
---
If you CAN afford to stick to your morals and ideals, and you're the kind of person that wouldn't put out a product they know isn't good enough, you SHOULD go into game dev, because we sure could use more people like that, even if you're making smaller projects.
---
This is correct, durability damage bonus no longer applies.
---
What are talking about when you say you were griefed because maybe we are talking about different things. 
---
In the 1200 hours I have played this game, I have yet to be griefed as far as I know. 
---
Have I been attacked by other players?  Of course.  I‚Äôve been unknowingly baited into a 1 on 3 and got lit right up.   Then had my base destroyed by them.  Pretty crafty those fellas.  And it came down fast let me tell you. Do you know there is a perk card called wrecking ball that helps people destroy bases faster?  These guys must have had that card.  So if there‚Äôs a card it was intended to be in the game and can‚Äôt be considered griefing.  If the same people did it again on a different day on a different server well I guess maybe that would be griefing but fortunately that never happened.  Probably wouldn‚Äôt have went down the same way regardless. 
---
Had my base destroyed maybe 3 or 4 other times.  Here‚Äôs how I handled it.  I walked over to the camp module and pressed repair all structures and went about my day.  Done dillio.  Had too much junk anyways. 
---
And you know it might happen again tomorrow or it might be a month from now but you what?  One button press.  Grief level - Ultra Low
---
You know what I do now if someone attacks me?  I kill them and take their caps and hopefully a bit of junk. Hopefully.  But if not oh well.   Seek revenge please.  Grief level?  Ultra low. 
---
Or maybe they kill me and I lose a couple caps and some excess adhesive or a desk fan.  I probably needed screws but I can get more. They are everywhere.   I now have a choice. Seek revenge or normal respawn, cut my very minor losses, and go about my day.  Grief level?  You guessed it.... ultra low.  It‚Äôs up to me, not them.
---
Idont think it's a bug. It was posted in the patch notes that the prior statement that they would work was wrong. They are not meant to work in pa
---
I don't get why anyone actually cares about this.  Only a portion of people probably participate in things related to FO76 like reddit outside of the game.  It will fix itself over time to be what it should be.  If your stuff is not selling, your going to lower your prices if you want it to sell.  And if people continue to sell things for lower then you think they should be, it will force you to lower your prices because people won't be buying from you.
---
They‚Äôve added a lot. Player vending has completely changed the game. Lots of new events to grind for plans and stuff. Lots of quality of life improvements. It‚Äôs fun solo, and easy enough to team up with randoms for specific events.
---
Excuse you. There is only one true god. The interstellar house cat himself. The almighty rocket kitty. The feline of freedom. Mr. Pebbles. Only a commie would worship a false idol such as mothman.
---
Also just noticed that it's the same for armor. Brought my armor rating way down
---
I've been playing since launch, but thanks for the warning.
---
Well good to know.  Well then I hope they let us add an attachment to power armor for them!
---
Apparently the current meta is to get a keypad door and post the code above the keypad using small letters set. Door shuts after activation and enemies xant just open it up
---
Once I sell all the plans and legendary stuff I've been saving for players, I'll be selling crafted and 200% repaired power armor parts. At the moment I can only sell a few random parts here and there from my set collection. I'll also be providing modding services later down the line when I get more.
---
I had enough to place two machines, then I go to fill them and can't even fit a stimpak in one.  I found a new camp.  It still looks classy but not like the mansion I had before.
---
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt sell god tier items , you trade them for items you actually need
---
It gives me a reason to set my bar/restaurant back up so I love it
---
Why not both?
---
Is the jet pack in there? (It would be a real kick in the teeth because I spent WAY too long server hopping to get that.
---
At least if you have one, have it for all.
---
Considering its new
---
Theres technically only one human in the wasteland (so far)
---
Said human probably cant heard or teach mutants to rebuild
---
Robots arent really suited to do it
---
...it might be a while.
---
Same with grahms house üò≠
---
Looks like I'll have to start using less detailed names :v
---
I‚Äôm working long hours until Friday afternoon. Would that be good?
---
Nop, no mutations.
---
The people that are selling Fasnacht masks for 20caps, and godroll legendaries for 5k less than they could, they‚Äôre players I want to play with, because they‚Äôre more interested in having fun and sharing that fun. The people that farm these meta‚Äôs, and the people who buy them for inflated prices are almost playing an entirely different game to me. The chase for the current meta, the min-maxing... that‚Äôs just not fallout to me. Might as well be fortnite or whatever other online shooter thing folks play this year.
---
What are you spending your earnings on??? I'm saving up for better armor pieces and enemy specific sets.  Getting ready for vault raids.
---
I'm setting up mine to sell quality legendaries and stuff to help out low levels.
---
Haha that is fair!
---
you fully died bud no revive option
---
I know that
---
They‚Äôre just going to skip 4*?
---
It is/was a lot of fun. Investigation missions are no joke if you don't just google the solutions XD
---
yes
---
Nukashine + youtube videos. I can just set it to autorun until I get to where I need to go, and do other stuff in the meanwhile
---
Serums and 5.56 ammo.  The surest way to riches.
---
I know, this sucks.
---
Do you get possom badges or tadpole badge though
---
Looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the sleeping bag this morning.
---
Think as I was in my camp
---
Is it not ultracite for gatling laser?
---
I run an arcade and buy and sell holotape games.
---
Saw this on the one I killed at Deathclaw island yesterday.    Just the luck of the drop I guess
---
What if you could pick between 3 or 4 build area sizes, and each one had a different build limit?
---
cant revive under water man needs to be shallow water
---
I been hoarding most my life, living in a rad storm paradise...
---
Oh, there are so many "why can't we" in this game.
---
I've had to start two builds over on more times than I care to tell you because of these issues, end up just moving my camp a tiny but to reset it.
---
WHERE'S MY REFUND
---
I'd say so.  With the latest patch (passive camps, backpacks and vendor stations) I'd say the game is finally coming into it's own.
---
Amen.  Pass the water and praise the ammunition
---
Ultracite fusion cores are used in Gatling lasers with prime receivers. I have heard they are still usable in power armor also. So you can get extra use out of your fusion cores if you learn this receiver from SBQ.
---
Are you on now?
---
"Of, relating to, or caused by friction."  Friction in design is generally when a user is confronted with an interface or affordance that appears to be intuitive but delivers unexpected results.  Too many button presses, inconsistent results, confusing snapping in the build menu, over-elaborate UIs, etc.  Some friction can actually be useful but generally you try and remove it.
---
Did it work properly? I had a guy trying to suicide by grenade right at the scouts camp and it wasn't giving me an option to revive
---
Honestly, Im not really sure. Im a melee/healing main so I have no need for ammo or explosives. I can craft about 100 stimpaks an hour and Im good there. Probably just for those god tier legendaries thatll fit my build. Id love a healing one handed, and definitely some better armor pieces.
---
Wait what?
---
Let's be honest, this plus excavator would be really OP.
---
Happened to me too. I spawned under someone‚Äôs deck today helllllp meeeee
---
 At no point am I saying anything about it being American centric... nor am I complaining about it being American centric.
---
I asked a question, had it answered by a couple of people, and also got a smartass speculative response from one, to whom I responded with the above.
---
Once you are opossom you can craft a lvl 50 backpack with 60 base carry weight
---
Game needs more players that think like you.
---
Ya know, I'm not sure :O Never tried it
---
It's 16th. They reconfirmed that the made it sooner in the patch notes.
---
So in the WORLD section of challenges, there should be these tadpole badges, if you complete three of them that is like 1/4 of the tadpole scout quest thing that you should have in your data, it's not super hard but just a bit long
---
yeah same 
---
I've got an alt I'm leveling up to be a stealth vats rifle build, should be able to fold in plasma rifles
---
I luckily found another person who was interested in dying as much as me, and we helped each other out XD
---
You mean a game that has a literal cartoon character as its logo and 90% of the in-game icons has cartoon perks/aspects? 
---
Who could have seen it coming!!
---
I found two yesterday.   The one I remember was close to vault 76 in a suitcase just downstairs of the vault to the west.   I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs random though.
---
Pioneer Scots! FREEDOM!!!!!
---
Best results are near existing player hubs: 76, Watoga, Harper‚Äôs Ferry. Whitesprings got clapped with a no-build zone by the clubhouse, jsyk. But elsewhere on the course should be fine.
---
I‚Äôm posting up by Gilman Lumber and see great traffic in the late afternoon/early evening. Net about 2k a day, trading scrap and medicinals
---
come to grafton
---
Its a bit of a slip.   
---
If the vendors owner is on site, they'll be visible however.
---
I do this regularly. 
---
Works every time for me as long as all the floor pieces are connected.
---
I think the patch is horrible for high levels and finally pushed me over the edge.. Don't know if I'll be playing much longer.. Yes they fixed some bugs and added a little content and that's great but they also released everything to everyone in the game... 
---
          Almost 2,000 hours playing this game and I have nothing to show for it over someone who just started playing a month ago.. All the time spent doing quests for the rewards,  Picking up thousands of crappy weapons to scrap and unlock mods, and everything else has just been a big waste of time because you can just go to any train station and buy whatever plan you want... 
---
      I was able to mod guns better than the average guy which is only right since I put so much time in the game.. Well not anymore... I have nothing to show for my time spent grinding to get all these things.. Time spent trading, searching Reddit every single day. People would trade and look for treasure maps for plans.. Not anymore
---
      They should change the name to call of duty the fallout edition cuz that's what players they are catering too..not the true fallout fans.
---
    Just like the call of duty players nobody has to bother doing quests, Picking up and scrapping weapons, gathering materials so they can craft ammo or anything.. Every camp vendor sells that junk... All there is to do is buy ammo off people and go around shooting people in the face, respawn and repeat.. 
---
         How would everyone feel if they just released every legendary weapon to everyone? You can have whatever you want Just for a few caps.. That's what they did with all the plans.. That's what drive me to play and a lot of other people.. I have spread sheets and binders to keep track of all the plans and mods I know for every armor and weapon... That's all trash now.. The legendary vendor isn't out yet so maybe people will be able to buy any weapon they want... What is the point in playing if you have and can do everything.. There is nothing motivating me to play now.
---
      Thanks for ruining what fallout has always been about.. I guess I'll go play red dead cuz all my time invested has been all for nothing
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be a form of pay to win?
---
Sadly, they can't be sold. I've got a spare, modded and everything. Alas, alas.
---
I‚Äôve always put my CAMP on cliffsides for the view. I just learned to always be there in power armor.
---
Well it has been like for player trading since patch 7, I believe-- its nothing new.
---
Wait. It still works if they're dead? I might have to try that
---
does ANYONE know if you can reroll?  I am holding on to several pieces because of this possibility, but the patch implied you can't... while Todd suggested (a long time ago) that you could.
---
You don't buy legendaries at the vending machine, so I don't think the slot machine feel is necessarily a clue to its function.
---
I hit the limit regardless of how many letters I use on last two items.
---
If you are in your camps vicinity it will allow people to inspect your gear.  This was written about on a previous thread
---
Does let you. I did it twice last night rebuilding my camp vending.
---
Power armor not having backpacks isn‚Äôt a bug, check the inside the vault they say it in the last article
---
My camp was still there after the update until, well, now
---
Now game don't ask me about the conflict, it took me a few server hops and finally discovered it just gone, maybe related to the server crash I think :&lt;
---
At least game not seems like to charge me 40 caps for the new placement I guess, I was just wondering if I shall redesign my camp to fit the new budget(ikr, it's camp from ancient), guess game sense  my thought lol
---
Like medic's stuff or vamps?
---
The plans for the xbow arent there. Anyway to make them spawn or get them from another location?
---
If you fail the test and keep retaking it without leaving the terminal if you get repeated questions that your previously answered correctly the answer will stay highlighted. Just something I found out today doing my last quiz for the mammologist badge.
---
My point exactly. They somewhat fixed it for 1:1 trading though. So the fix is clearly THERE, just not implemented in their (arguably) biggest addition to the game since launch.
---
This shit is why I drink.
---
Lucky B. Turrets are like homing beacons to my camp for SBs. Guaranteed to get carpet bombed within the hour. Tried fighting back once with my sister. We spent half an hour dying and respawning before we ran out of ammo and had to hop worlds lol. Though I guess that's what we get for setting up camp near Watoga at lvls 20 and 17.
---
Yes. You can sell mostly everything.
---
I think the confusion stemmed from the use of the term ‚Äúyeet‚Äù
---
I put my chat on area and then asked google home for the answers
---
Pretty funny for the other five people waiting their turn
---
Are you on PC using mods?
---
Good to see the old floating exclamation point again, I didn't even know that was still part of the engine. Haven't seen it since New Vegas.
---
I usually price things lower then their default values but no one wants my junk. Starting to sell nukashine see if that works.
---
I drink because I have crippling depression due to poor life choices because I drink. *cheers*
---
Yup. My vendor's in a sealed room with a neon sign and garage door operated by a switch that can only be accessed via the only locked door in my CAMP. Turned on, garage door opens, "OPEN" sign powers on, and I show up on the map. Turned off, door closes, sign goes off, and I disappear from the map.
---
They quite literally are playing a different game and man it seems exhausting to me.
---
I am just glad there is room for everyone
---
Have you logged out and back in?
---
Do you mean it's now showing 198 of them but no matter what you do you cannot remove them from your stash?
---
*All Hail The Free Market*
---
Yea mate joining you. I have quite a bit of steel on me... plz don't steal it when I down myself for you to revive me ha
---
But of course. :)
---
The place where you spawn in, and the place where guests spawn in is different!  In my testing moving the CAMP device only changed where I spawned in at, not the guests.
---
so you have to watch where people arrive at, and build around that,   the best I did was to fast-travel to a friends camp, and NOT MOVE, he could then see where and in what direction I spawned in, and build around that, and then he did the same for me.
---
Some where between thrift store, junk yard, and dump. 
---
Whatever I've got excess of or a weapon that shouldn't be thrown into the scrip grinder. 
---
I'm still too near to 25k for much interest. I've been running around buying up stuff (like 10 plans I didn't know at the first two CAMPs) but still didn't make much of a dent after I sold a bit.
---
Yeet=ejaculation
---
Also, Furious caps much lower than 150%.  My tests on it indicated somewhere between 30% to 40% after 9 or 10 shots. After that there were no more damage increases.
---
This would be cool if they added pet companions. They could have varying types like brahmin for weight carry/vending. Or an attack/defense companion.
---
Mine as well! I saw a couple last night perusing vending machines and they are just so aesthetically unpleasant. Just make a simple box house or something idk people
---
This will affect where you spawn in, but not the guests, I think the guest spawn point is hard-set when you place the camp.
---
Take pacifist off and shoot someone . Pretty sure it still makes you wanted
---
I have my original 29 in my inventory but the 198 are stuck in my stash, I will try relogging now I was just waiting for people to quit shopping.
---
fusion generator at camden park got it for me
---
This happened to me last night when I logged on, after the patch. I had to unequip my perk cards, the re equip them. Then my weight went back down. I thought I was the only one!
---
I sent it, try this one https://youtu.be/nxfBtxr0Z0M
---
usually people refer to yeeting as chucking something
---
Well yes, that's what I meant, but I play fallout and blame it on in game stuff.
---
*hic*
---
Glitched for me today to the point I had to delete my camp and move.
---
Hopefully when you log in all will be normal, last thing we need is people duplicating all the best weapons again.
---
The stationary shop at WS has at least two on the table when you walk in. And another can spawn on the counter from time to time. The gifts shop can sell them as well.
---
Using time to describe distance?  What a time to be alive!
---
How do you lock things like that?
---
Do what us old people do and look it up on urban dictionary, it's definitely what I did. 
---
Sometimes my back hurts when I sleep on the ground now. 
---
Life is pain.
---
I bought an item worth 15k for 20 caps.   But I will use it, not flip it.  They had numerous other undervalued items (perhaps intentionally) which I did not buy because it would only be fair for those that would use them be the acquirers.
---
I like that idea
---
Born Survivor DOES NOT work as well.  My teammate accidently left it on and she didn't get credit for the challenge.
---
I'll have to try that! I hope that's it tho if so it'll be a bummer that I tossed so much aid üòÇüòÇ
---
Better than a Sentinel Hunter's Metal Condom
---
I probably would for no more than 300 per limb and 500 per chests, but only if I was attempting to put together a unique look. 
---
I‚Äôll be selling stuff like this too, however. Probably lower level stuff. A great set of non legendary armor or a weapon around lvl 20 can be a boom for many levels until you find the legendary gear you need.
---
Yes that one i have atm
---
I just checked your profile and your last 5/5 posts on this sub have been nothing but crying and bitching . Maybe you should quit this game?
---
Bring back the Junk Jet!
---
I 100% agree thats why I didn't want to list the item as it's the only one I've seen do it.
---
Psychotats!
---
I did this earlier today and was wondering about this. I thought maybe it was a one time reward for the event
---
Nice!   Good plasma rifles are so hard to find.
---
die in the shallow water
---
Killed 20 and havent seen one. But if you say so, i will grind it one more time.
---
Take it. Take my crops too. Fuck my wife while you're at it.  
---
But if your junk extractor is unlocked; it's fair game.
---
5.56 seems like the rarest ammo in the game lol. I  opted to not do 5.56 just because you dont find handmade rifles early game.
---
yes... totally where my mind went too...
---
I dont think anyone actually *knows* anything yet.  but like many people I hoarded trash legendaries, so with any luck the big pile of scrip ill have when she comes out will actually be worthwhile.  if not, then oopsies dead content i guess
---
Nope, it's a free market.  You put your price down, if someone beats it you lose the business.
---
Pyschobuff, defense is sort of crap at the moment in pvp. I‚Äôm using a ironclad life giver evasive serendipity....helps a little but the best defense is a good offense in this situation
---
I can do this
---
Nah man, this is good. Otherwise it'd be pay 2 win.
---
Be careful what you wish for.  There's some guy going around leaving fertilizer in bags on people's beds.   üò±
---
Its there, but someone taken it from you.
---
Go to middle mountain cabins. It is located between west tek and whitespring. You can pick crafted crossbow in one of houses.
---
I only had to go back twice, only 3-4 flies in the spot they send ya to
---
Alright i'm going online now
---
I‚Äôm over by Poseidon, not far from Whitespring (and on Graham‚Äôs path, when I‚Äôm lucky) 
---
I got traffic last night, was pretty cool
---
I thought that but it's a separate peice of armor. Still same stats.
---
I tried deleting my stairs last night because they were taking up room and it wouldn't let me lol I have the marsupial so no need for stairs :) when something wouldn't attach I would leave the workshop and restart it and it was fine.
---
And a thank you too EggsScrambler who helped me and vice versa.
---
I had many more disconnects than usual last night. Had one with someone right at my vending machine. Probably related.
---
Hope you don't mind, added this bug to [Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 9.0 | 05/07/209 Wild Appalachia - Pioneer Scouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm96og/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_90/)
---
I was thinking it would be great if we made caps on being a transport station. Someone uses our camp to get to us, then we get paid.
---
i just want cranberries
---
5 3* weapons is over the daily limit, and 25 puts you at 1000...  completely possible to hit this limit before the vendor comes
---
Medics. Vamps is nice but that just helps me. Ive got a vamps assaultron blade and 2* vamps war drum with 40%faster swing speed that is pretty kick ass. Id like to do healing to my team instead though.
---
&gt; go to third party sites to find someone in the same predicament. (i hate doing this in any game)
---
You're literally doing this RIGHT NOW.  In a fraction of the effort it took you to toss up this rant you could have found someone willing to jump on your server for ten seconds and bite it so you can get them up.
---
I think the point of not having the ability to wear a backpack in power amour is to give a little buff to people who don't like using power amour, you get a bunch of defence and increase carry weight, especially with the calibrated leg things when in power amour and people who don't use it are left with nothing.
---
If he sees you he attacks you unless you‚Äôre part of BoS.
---
Everyone: ‚ÄúBethesda, all servers have crashed and no one can play.‚Äù
---
Bethesda: ‚ÄúNo more overhead costs!‚Äù
---
This is fantastic!  Thanks so much!
---
They spawn inside a locked building too. I have a generator hut that I used to keep locked thinking that would help, but scorched, mongrels, and mole rats spawn inside the hut and just sit there attacking my generator. The locks just don't make any difference.
---
I was wondering that, circumventing the quest for the possum bag
---
I can carry 380 no power armor. I meant a no cal shocks suit
---
Maybe fluid was too big of a word for you. It‚Äôs an evolving conversation? Is that better. Crying about launch and early play had nothing to do with current game state. You haven‚Äôt played since the start that why your words carry no weight. That‚Äôs like talking about someone shooting trash at the beginning of the season and basing his whole season on that. I‚Äôm not a shill like you suggested, I just base my opinions on the whole and not on bits and pieces like yourself. And are you serious? Games like Minecraft have the luxury of being in their development stages for 2 years. With big name titles there are no such luxuries. It‚Äôs be the shitstorm sweepstakes. Especially with people like you who want that game perfect initially. Begone Knave.
---
just like i did their bud shallow water
---
It‚Äôs called a cup lol
---
This is great! 
---
What about the Beam Splitter for Gatling Plasma?
---
Thats really cool! Have you been collecting the holotape games for a while?
---
Yes, I was buying an item and crashed to the earth right before consummation.
---
Sent you a request. Thanks!
---
i'm hoping it was added to one of the campsites after the update and as i had already gone over all of them i didn't re-examine them again for an added recipe. i know its not at the whitespring and not in the scout vending machine.
---
Nawh i think i have it second time i will tell if i make egouth for capacity mod
---
‚ÄúThat was, like, some bounty hunter guy in the first Star Wars movies, right?‚Äù

SpaceZombie's rest stop is a humble, simple establishment. while there are vending machines, they are really more of a pawn shop the owner uses to sell his unneeded items. however, there are plenty of public facilities as well, free of charge. our first floor is a tavern that functions as a public kitchen as well, the second floor houses all of our workbenches that the weary adventurer may use to maintain their equipment, and the third floor is our bunkhouse, with multiple beds for anybody who needs to take a rest. there are also open water purifiers and a farm for people to get their hydration and food (say hi to our Brahman, Tessie!), plus a campfire and some instruments to wind back and relax. and all of this is conveniently located south of Whitesprings, so if someone fires off a nuke, you'll be just outside the blast radius and get to enjoy the fireworks!
---
SpaceZombie's Rest Stop: For when you need a space to relax after killing everything in sight
---
Oh, so you guys are the HOA who post snarky passive-aggressive letters in the laundry room about the neighbor who replaced their front door with a door different from the other doors and how "disrespectful" it is to everyone for miles around. Gotcha.  
---
You don't live in it. It's not your house. The game allows - if not almost requires - it to save people hours rebuilding everything if they move because bROkeN. Get over it.  
---
Also, my floating palace of joy is a testament to the power of ergonomics and ease of use. One staircase up to an open room full of anything anyone needs. Safe, sturdy, and convenient. Get off my lawn. You guys aren't welcome here. :D
---
Last two times I was griefed:
---
Fighting a large pull of Supermutants solo. Griefer comes up behind me.  Punches me over and over and over till my mutation goes off.  Kills me because he got to hit me 6 times before I could turn around.  Gloats about it on mic.  By the time I get back he is gone with 250 caps and my junk.  I know it's not a lot but it just took playtime from me when I dont have a ton to begin with both in running back and the incidence and the time I have to put in to recover what was lost.
---
Remove mutations, wont get griefed again tonight right?
---
Next guys, repeatedly shoot me in the back and body aggro every single mob in the area while dropping their camps.  Finally lag me out and i die.  Being shot in pvp even when not flagged sometimes glitches you out and you can only spawn at vault 76.  Cant fight back here either, all logged or crashed when I get back.
---
Rewards for pvp just doesnt belong in adventure mode.
---
What messed up currency system do you use, where 6554 is not a standard increment?
---
Didn‚Äôt give me a chance to call for help! I‚Äôll try again
---
The relog fixed it thankfully, thanks for that.
---
Dude. . . I don't know how to break this to you, and I know you can't see it, but you have an arm growing from the middle of your back. . . and it's waving at me. I kindly removed it for you. Kinda creepy. May want to cut cut back on that good ol' Appalachian water, lol.  [See](https://media.giphy.com/media/Ut0KjWDAgyMFy/giphy.gif)
---
Here is some canned dog food. Please son you have to eat your wasting away.
---
You don‚Äôt get perk cards every time you level and a pick every 5 levels?
---
Yeah, I always wanted to build a sort of player hub out of my camp for people. I really want high traffic, even if it is low profit
---
Water is for paying customers only buddy!!! Jk have my water. I built it for the occasional crafting atoms challenge and weary travelers.
---
I have several Dedicated Vendor Characters, and last night I first set up my Weapons Characters shop, but then realized a level 4 character is unable to sell max level weapons, so I moved on to my Plan Character, I have lots of Plans so I set up 4 machines, and began stocking them, I sell most plans for 50%-70% of list price, some even less, and only the most rare for more than list.
---
Before I could finish Stocking the second machine a player was buying from the first, and they must have then told their Friends because by the time I finished the third, there were 5 players there and the caps were rolling in so fast, I nearly panicked trying to move caps to another character before hitting the max.
---
The next hour and a half was a constant circle around the machines to keep them fully stocked, I eventually had to log out at only a few hundred caps from the limit, and switch over to my Aid Character, Her shop will be opening this evening, with mainly Aid, but also some materials, everything will be selling for 50% or less of list price, so I am expecting a busy evening.
---
Nah, it's just cheezy as fuck.
---
Suprised?
---
Well mr. new Vegas could as it‚Äôs just a computer. Could easily create a voice like they do now with the bots. I highly doubt they have a real voice actor for all the bots.
---
Oh and Trust the Process.
---
Agreed, everyone upvote this!
---
God that is awesome. I setup a machine with all my leftover plans already because I figured that is one thing I will always dump caps on. I normally would sell weapons a bit lower than list and I would sell home/CAMP plans for heavy discounts.
---
Sounds like you need to be in a large empty room with a bullhorn to hear that fabulous echo
---
Maybe someone on Bethesda see this post and fix it. Let's have some faith :D
---
It was the hive ones that worked for me ages ago. So that confirms that they‚Äôve fixed the glitch
---
maybe just kite some ghouls at whitesping?
---
A little bit
---
I'll gladly pay an extra 10% for this!
---
Me too - make it more social. Water, plants, crafting... like, why not?
---
Dunno why it wont let me be revived... just automatically going to respawn. Sorry man, hope the other guy helped get the badge.
---
The Wise Mothman is displeased with your insolence.
---
But also very pleased with your praise for his humble servant's establishment.
---
He has decided this evens out and shall forgive you.

I was referring to high school in the sense where if you don‚Äôt conform, you are a black sheep.  If you‚Äôre not inclined enough to see my main point then maybe you should read my comment again.  Games are for entertainment,  not for people to judge you like when in high school.  Creativity is what I respect, not the run of the mill standard basic house which I can see if I walk out my front door.  If you want realism then turn the game off and go outside.  I like to see floating camps because it shows people thinking outside of the box.  I‚Äôm a leader in real life, not a follower so this is why I feel this way.  I get sick to read threads like this because it sends the wrong message.  ‚ÄòDo what everyone else does or else you will be scrutinized‚Äô it‚Äôs bullshit
---
i'm on xbox one.
---
Sorry forgot to mention.. PS4
---
No worries. I am us. I still get kicked occasionally though
---
Thank You LC for the kind offer. I'm always available. (IGN: Same as Reddit Username).
---
Do you apply this same entitled philosophy to every aspect of your life?
---
People were saying it was a destroy on drop item.
---
Been playing 6 hours straight and haven't seen this event. What triggers it? During night time i guess?
---
Wasting your energy. This is same pointless as the "don't use TSE in events" and people still use. You put what ever price you want, I am going to sell 10-20 caps plans, 100 caps pers lege star, that actually give some boost to damage (Everything with something like exterminator or troubleshooter, right into scripts), 1 cap per ammo, 50 caps flux.
---
I agree!
---
i leave everything unlocked and keep a neon sign on my camp wall that faces the road which reads 'free supplies'
---
Teaming up and helping out is the only real way to survive the wasteland!
---
Your username adds up
---
Damn I‚Äôm on Xbox. Good luck to you!
---
The only thing that has crashed are the BOS Plans and X-01 Mods. Why is it that the game offers serum recipes for 18k+ that can be purchased anytime, but an extremely rare drop going for the same amount is inflated?
---
I noticed this as well, but I don't keep careful enough track to really conclude that I wasn't just doing something different. It's nice to hear that others have seen the same thing. I'll try unequipping and requipping perk cards to see if that changes anything.
---
We got it thanks man
---
Nah. Just allows them to retaliate and initiates full PVP. It‚Äôs not ‚Äútrue‚Äù wanted.
---
I've had a couple of experiences where I couldn't run in PA (mixed raider and T-45 on the chassis) UNTIL I jumped for the first time, then I was able to run.
---
A little late, but go to the Giant Teapot and do the event for all of your bug parts.
---
The biggest pull for me in this game is making ourselves sort of the NPCs. If I didn't make a Tavern-esque general store or like a moonshiners shack, I feel like I'm not doing it justice.
---
Especially after having gotten a good amount of home-y plans from various vendors, interior decorating just feels nice and has a cozy vibe to come back to
---
How did you get it? Just getting the badges?
---
Just look at r/Market76
---
Wow that‚Äôs fruitful. Does it require a lot of mats to craft? Wondering if its worth occasionally swapping around with the max carry weight mod whenever u wanna go full out merchant mode
---
Starch genes/class freak if you want mutations
---
Yup! Grinding Possum Badges which is mind-numbing!
---
oh no damn.
---
Because they want to remove caps from circulation to reduce inflation. This would accomplish the exact opposite of that.
---
I only drink dirty water and from the Sulphur fountain at White spring.
---
Ammunition sold via vending machine doesn't seem to be removed from inventory on PC.
---
Because it isn't a fucking bug.  If you want them to just copy the system from 4 over exactly then I hope you've never had to use the blueprint system because you'd be saying goodbye to that.  This is why this connection dependency exists, because the blueprint system needs to be able to scan through your structure piece by piece and record everything. Remove a set of stairs and suddenly you can have a floating section that doesn't get blueprinted.  On top of that it prevents people from taking their already stupid floating houses and making them float even more by just building up and up with stairs and then removing them all.
---
Yeah at night must be around camp adams.
---
Server hoping = at every server where is currently night
---
Pic?
---
The actual bag is easssy to craft, but HOLY SH*T those challenges are awful!
---
Nice, still haven‚Äôt gotten the backpack, was more interested in the player vending yesterday haha
---
pharma farma (luck) if you want to be stocked up on meds all the time.
---
Ahaha yeah
---
A canned dog food workshop would awesome
---
Well when he attacked me I defended myself. That was before I knew about pacifist mode
---
Lol, I never lock anything, come enjoy my water, it fills every 5 minutes and I'm here once every 2 hours of play.  Even with my junk extractor, it takes like half an hour to fill up with 20 items, if you show up within 20 minutes of my next visit, good for you, enjoy your scrap cloth and aluminum.
---
Maybe this'll make people more likely to show up and check my store.  I only put good shit in there btw.
---
id say both are bad. you designed a quest that requires the player to use 3rd party software to attain one of the most requested QoL features that you added into the game...
---
also yea... fuck the tracking "cooking 2/5" or whatever.... mother.......... what the hell do i need to do!?! exc, chalanges, world... scrollllllllll... find, ah i see... good thing you implemented tracking.... just go one level down please.
---
It's creative, but it's not a word. Yourdictionary dot com is not a credible source. No actual dictionary recognizes it.
---
I'm not trying to be pedantic about it. It sounds like you know what you're talking about. Is it a term common in the industry?
---
Take your time, you‚Äôll go insane if you rushed it (like me!)
---
I would enjoy them but a lot require the camera...which I've still never been lucky enough to actually obtain.
---
I was stuck at that point too. Wendigo cave took all my stimpacks around level 25. I just went exploring and doing side quests and leveled up till about 30-35 and had collected my resources and caps back up.
---
Personally, I'd look for a few endurance perks pretty early. Especially good doggy and dromedary. Good doggy is very useful if you can keep a steady stash of dog food (it increases the amount of hunger it fills). Dromedary will increase effectiveness of all drinks by up to 75% at max level. If you are looking to be a melee build then strength is definitely the way to go (you'll find perks to increase both one and two handed weapon damage so pay attention to the difference). Also, there is a perk in intelligence I believe that allows you to repair weapons over 100% as well as make them last longer (there may be two separate perks for gun and for melee weapons so keep that in mind because I can't remember). The rest is kinda sorta up to you. Personally, I have a couple endurance perks that I find very useful. One removes rads between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. and the other gives me health during those times. So basically I can't just sell all my radaway and I use fewer stims. Keep in mind though if you use a bloodied build you won't want the rad remover. Also, there is born survivor which auto uses a stim when health falls under 20% which I find useful as a melee build because I'm trying to focus on attacking more than my health. Lol. There's one more I can't remember that makes stims give more health. That's pretty useful as well
---
Seeing as I'm a bar U.S. federal law constitutes that tap water be free so I cannot lock it up lol.
---
Miscommunication my foot. You don‚Äôt go into detail like that and then act like it was never gonna happen.
---
That's similar to their going rate on r/market76..
---
Yea my buddy was doing them and hearing him in the party chat was hilarious
---
I wish we had more people in the business of item transfers and power leveling
---
I started playing it a little over a week ago. SO much better than I expected it to be.
---
PS4, sorry
---
I made a level 15 dude without any cards and bashed enemies lol I finished it jist now
---
--close
---
Bash breaks faster
---
Make sure you unequip perks that make you repair above 100%
---
Craft lowest level one you can.
---
Don't pick the single thing that you can use to argue... how about the weapons selling for more than a single character can carry in caps?
---
I think I‚Äôve aged around 20 years in the last 8 hours!
---
 The last one works. They don't normally stack. There are some exceptions to this, but not many.
---
Then make your pick, blueprints or being able to move a staircase more easily.  
---
This isn't just Bethesda fucking around to make the game more difficult, they had to change the building system from 4  because they added to it.  Blueprints are dependent on being able to scan through the connections of your structures, remove a staircase and you can isolate sections of a structure, meaning that as far as a blueprint is concerned that floating bit no longer exists.
---
Yeah i do have 1300 caps, but those damn lollycapsnatcher are my nightmare they hit so hard and they have poison. Everytime i go north i find a shit load of them.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be damaged significantly
---
Make sure you don't have the perk equipped that slows down the wear and tear on weapons. Beyind that, I have no idea. Best of luck.
---
Or better yet kills Communists by brute force while selling things.
---
What do you consider list price?  What vendors sell them for with or without any bargaining perks?  Trying to figure out what I should be pricing plans at that would make sense but also make me some money.
---
They do, but they cannot be applied right now, Bethesda failed to add the correct keyword to the Bowie Knife, hopefully it will get fixed in time.
---
It still repairs to 200% but before it also buffed the stats when at 200%
---
as for the bot... at least with you he got the context right... ive seen worse :)
---
If you want to complete the repair quest as fast as possible you have to shot one enemy with it (otherwise it will not break) and then repair it. After that just repeat it until the quest is done.
---
I agree. I can see building floating boxes if there was ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that could completely bulldoze your place. But what‚Äôs the worst that they can do. 
---
Now that camp protection has been improved their shouldn‚Äôt be a need for that many eyesores. 
---
One day we‚Äôll be rid of them.  But at least we got the golf club cleared. Small victories.
---
Do you think they would still sell them for that price if they knew what they could really get? Because I don‚Äôt
---
mope
---
It‚Äôs not damaged at all, when I crafted it I crafted it to 200 percent accidentally
---
Sadly cant craft that mod for others
---
What ya playing on?
---
I have 5 unlocked purifiers for people to help themselves.  Having enough water was only a problem at low levels, and now I end up dropping water at the railway stations.
---
Gonna log back in now, being a dumb fuck I think it probably was fml
---
I find people very rarely contest workshops unless you have the ammo workshop.  I've regularly claimed power plants and acid workshops for hours on end with zero contest... I've actually only been contested 3 times.  I don't even bother to defend them since there can be up to 4 waves which can take up like 10 minutes to finish, I just wait til it changes to "Retake X Workshop" since you only deal with a single wave and most are already there and dead by turrets.

If you don't like PVP just don't defend it when someone contests it, just let it go and grab a different one or change servers.  That's what I do since I have little interest in PVP.  Keep in mind that when building stuff at the workshop, if the junk materials are listed in green then they're coming out of the workshop's "stash", not your own.  This gives you free resources to make all sorts of defenses and if someone takes it over you're only out the 25-30 caps it cost to claim.
---
Don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong
---
That was my thing, I priced my stuff for the people that want it right now without the hassle. Not for the people that watch trade boards hoping for the max price. I had my 5.56 for like 2 or 3 caps each, shotgun for 3 caps. I also sold my bulk junk for roughly 1.25c per plus a little extra for the plastic. so lead was like 35c, though depending on the market for the junk price went up a little bit. stims were about 20c per. And most plans and recipes were under or right at the recommended sale amount. I might raise my prices a little more even. You gotta pay the convenience fee. lol
---
This one is death, look at the helmet it just like from bill and ted
---
I usually set my prices 50 to 100 caps lower than what it initially puts it as. And I always make bank, mainly cuz I have been hoarding all of my plans I already knew.
---
‚ÄúShot one enemy‚Äù?
---
I've started throwing up the help emoji (that I never use unless playing with friends) to help others get their revive point. I just need to get mine now.
---
It does. I just did it last night on PC. They had their bed locked up, I wanted to sleep in it.
---
It's fine, and thank you for your efforts.
---
no rad damage on this side try kiting enemy to this water
---
Craft another without the perks equipped and use that instead.
---
Enclave bunker maybe. I never checked but my first place to check for plans
---
Oh no üò±  I was getting so irritated last night. I kept checking the weight of everything on me and my perk cards. I traveled to Wetec and had to hoof it back to WS because I was so over encumbered.  üòÇ  Wish I would have redone my perk cards before going there!
---
Pemmican is food. It's like a super jerky irl that can be stored for like years.
---
You mean this one?

---
I think you replied to the wrong person, i'm the original OP...
---
Btw, in Fallout 76 the vast majority of people have floating bases. If you claim you don't follow the "herd" you should make a regular, nice looking house.
---
Maybe that's what the dungeon under the pharmacy REALLY is, since there's so much of it
---
There used to be a bunch of dudes who did this when the game first came out, but I think they all quit. It was super helpful.
---
Can you sell?
---
What is a good farming spot that you suggest?
---
I get that. But I think it looks weird not to have a door. Besides, I bought it with atoms, and I guess in my mind there's an imaginary screen door. Because what back door doesn't also have a screen door? None in my life that wasn't a sliding door. 
---
So my imaginary house has got even more imaginary screen. Maybe it's like one of those as-seen-on-TV screens you can walk through that is self-closing. Yeah, that's it. 'Cause I'm fancy.
---
Try removing/renaming all 3 .ini files and let the game create new ones. If that works, you know the error has to be in there
---
So what is the absolute strongest?
---
You're right. I just double checked with my TSE level 50 combat shotgun. Bloody mess, 6 points of shotgun, perforating mag. Level 68 scorched is 6-8 shots from close enough to couple myself with the explosion. Also, I can shoot at my own feet. Naked. I get crippled, but take zero damage. Nothing wrong here at all.
---
If you are on PC i can help you with that right now
---
You get pemmican from doing scout dailies. Its a food if i remember correctly  (not ingame) that gives endurance buff i believe.
---
Apparently the morgantown airport was redone as well
---
Check 2-3 level safes that‚Äôs where most of mine came from as well as events.
---
It is reward for daily quest. that one where you kill those ugly bugs
---

I am indeed on PC, my username is ExoticManiac

Its on wikipedia i think
---
Some crazy mixture of foods for like protein
---
Sewers near the Harper's ferry armory. Or the on the other side of town roughly on the same position.
---
 Or people were filling punch bowls with Nukashine to other dwellers would pass out.
---
I was thinking this same thing. Super bummed I can‚Äôt get the backpack without this. 
---
Anyone on PC need the checkpoint? I need to get it as well. Let‚Äôs link up!
---
my god how is this such a nightmare
---
And smores is reward recipe from new event:campfire tales
---
That's actually the point.  They are not lightyears better than what they were trying to sell you anymore.  By making them only marginally better it makes their kits we didnt ask for better without actually making them any better.  So it's a very underhanded buff to their kits imho.
---
You forgot Blackjack.
---
I do not play with friends so I do not know how inviting really works xD. id dignite
---
excavator armor bonus (100) + 2X calibrated shocks (100) + glitch that gives an extra hundred lol
---
bold of you to assume mr pebbles and wise mothman's ancestors even existed in the same dimension!
---
but no for real i don't think we have a legit explanation for any of the mothmen in 76. all the other cryptids have an explanation. mutations, west tek FEV research, goddamn aliens... but other than the mothman cult saying they summoned him (which is kinda flimsy as evidence) we have no concrete idea where he came from.
---
Yes, which is GREAT. 
---
So they'll probably nerf it next patch.
---
I would love just a 5 slot tumbler where we just set digits. 
---
20000 cap items? Set the first digit tumbler to 2. Done in 1 second.
---
I hear you, friend. my FO 76 crew quit a LONG time ago, I logged back in to make a store front and get a cool backpack. Then I saw the quest requirements and realized I would never finish the quest. Oh well, back to other games.
---
What console/platform? I'll swing by if I can
---
People don't seem to get the meaning of my help emoji, not even after actually saying to the microphone what I'm trying to do
---
I picked up the medical malpractice a few weeks ago in survival.  It's kind of a nice gun.
---
One of the quizzes said a salamander is the largest lizard?  Because 1) it‚Äôs an amphibian, and 2) the Komodo dragon is the largest lizard (Deathclaws nonwithstanding!)
---
Calibrated shocks - where can I learn this amazing thing
---
Not sure if in game o.o
---
Maybe it could be kept in the new personal terminal, that would be cool.
---
Does it add 30 additional carry weight to the standard backpack or does it reduce the current pack down from 60 to 30?
---
List price is the value displayed when viewing an item, most recipes are 50, common Camp plans 100, armor plans from 250-600, etc..
---
hahaha oh I'm well aware. 
---
When life gives you crap - turn that crap into decorative hedges
---
Oh my god, I can finally use the .50 cal hunting rifle and sell off my mountain of .308
---
I didn't say it was a solo game I said it was a game that they said can (the present tense of could) be played solo.
---
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that...
---
Seriously though... I'll help if anyone needs it. I die tons anyways.
---
I am pretty sure it‚Äôs not even in the game.
---
S'mores are toasted marshmallow and chocolate bar in between two graham crackers. Cause you'll want s(ome) more.l
---
I don't really play with anyone either :D I added you as a friend btw
---
I've always done this in the past, but when you are running a vending machine now there could be a lot more traffic. I will only start locking if I find I can't get any water when I need it.
---
maybe try your camp again since it worked for me their
---
Thanks a bunch for reminding me! I keep forgetting to update the custom ini every time there's an update and sure enough same happened this time and I'm there wondering why I'm missing new things in the world. :D
---
It looks the same to me ü§î Maybe you missed the basement on the first play through? It also may have been updated at some point but I‚Äôm a fairly new player (1 month) and it looked like this when I did the responder quests.
---
Yes, totally crying real tears cuz people brag about selling things at outrageous prices to reddit users.  CRYING some real tears for the reddit users who have been put through that, or who actually pay IRL money to get items without putting in the work.  üò≠üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  
---
YEAH.  Everyone getting bent about this, is the person who would totally brag about buying something for a cheap price and selling it to reddit users.  üêà‚ú®
---
i had 2 pieces of it in my inventory before i even did anything related to the pioneers, i was dealing with my player vending machines when i noticed i had some. i was like where did this come from.
---
Personally I didn‚Äôt farm exactly I just explored and leveled naturally while avoiding that grind feeling but if you want to farm places with super mutants are good they give a lot of xp per kill. Morgan town airport is a pretty good spot with the event that goes on there but the scorched dont give too much xp. Sorry I‚Äôm still pretty new to the game so I don‚Äôt have locations off the top of my head but this is the vid I watched that helped me https://youtu.be/eVblUDULP7g
---
Cool join me. I have a workshop that I do not want to leave now
---
Dumb question. What‚Äôs giving you that huge health regen.....
---
I was thinking recently what if they made it to where you could place your camp next to your friends to make a bigger settlement.
---
sure, i guess i didnt mention the reason.
---
because it spams the sub with stupid posts with people looking for help that should have been solved in-game.
---
the reason i ranted on reddit is because tod howard said that this is their main location for feedback.
---
This is the only reason why I've considered locking them.
---
Also, cause crafting RadAway is stupid easy. Craft RadAway, dilute and sell for caps stock.
---
The moor event Irrational fear there spawn 5+ of them.
---
FYI some people are putting junk items in their machines for crazy prices so they don't autoscrap. I saw some vault tec alarm clocks in machines for 20K caps.
---
Did you find deathclaw hides?
---
Muh roads
---
That's honestly a good question. The best thing I would suggest is consider that you found the object yourself and if you would consider it a price you'd want to buy it for. People are using those perks in general not just for a good deal, but also just to get some fair prices from the stingy bots.
---
Also vendors don't have the same potential for stock as players do. If you set up a med station or even just a junk station, you can sell for more than what someone may buy from a vendor with discount perks, just because it is a demanded item and you offer a better bulk buy.
---
Fair prices and full shelves is what I would suggest, since that is generally my gripe with the robo-vendors.
---
I can't be the only one imagining the "Wet Bandits" from Home Alone...
---
I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Well I know the mothman is a real cryptid in WV. There is a reap statue and everything. Im guessing their explanation was radiation made giant moths. Personally I always found the amount of cryptids that are in the game almost a little lore breaking. Its just so strange to me that mutations somehow created all these different creatures that are so similar to prewar cryptids.
---
Can you get a recipe for it?
---
Yup, would be perfectly logical to have it there, since the thing was introduced to us just now and needs to have some additional uses.
---
None of that is true. Now you're just being a bad salesman too.
---
Oke thank you, i‚Äôll watch the vid and i will probally the same as you, just lvling the normal way.
---
I've never even heard of it
---
I've seen many near the "cure disease" fountain at white springs
---
Yes. Espicially in my responses to random people on Reddit ;)
---
Middle mountain cabbins have them sometimes. 3ugly bees.
---
*yells to fellow campers*
---
‚ÄúHERE, I‚ÄôM HELPING!!‚Äù
---
*spikes a grenade*
---
I have some pemmican. It was a reward from one of the scout things.
---
There is nothing worse than a premature finish
---
hit up r/market76.  someone there can do it for you
---
Middle mountains, seneca rocks visitor center or there's an unmarked spot northwest of Freddy Fear's.
---
If possible, I‚Äôd like some help with this quest too. ü§û
---
it is bug
---
Yes Sir.
---
I can solve your stim problem (more or less you have to work for it I only give the advice) ;) 
---
Produce healing salves (Forrest) with the pharmacist skill (all crafted pharma x2).
---
(if you have super Duper skill at luck use it too) 
---
You need 1x boiled water 1x soot flower 1x bloodleaf (there is a skill I don't know how it is but you earn x2 plants very usefull also) 
---
All the materials can you farm easy and a lot of them at the river by Flatwoods. Just walk the river up and craft them at the Chem station if you got enough. You earn a lot of XP while crafting and each slave gives 20% hp instand :) 
---
If you got the pharma and plant skill you can craft round about 100 of them in an half hour with farming materials if you are quick ;) 
---
Good luck and have fun ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Yeah, normally I try that, but in this case it doesn't seem to work
---
Yeah every time I got stuck I had to fast travel to the closest map marker then walk to the camp.
---
The healing factor mutation
---
But the buzz stacks!
---
Really I'm okay with riding the bandwagon for this just because from a roleplaying perspective it is what I was trying to get out of the game from launch.
---
I don't really mind if I have to undercut the market hard just to move some product if it means I can open up a tavern and actually have some people enjoy my little pitstop
---
Armor never repair just make new it will cost you much less and guns are kinda the same if your using normal non stared items just grab another one when it breaks.  Those two things helped me quite a bit .  Also, early on I got used to just letting myself die and run back instead of wasting a ton of stimpaks.  It will get better but i found it hardest getting through the 20s both times I leveled characters.
---
PC too
---
A couple bugs with the new DLC I've encountered is that when completing the repeatable quests, when it gives rewards, the game tries to give badges to you, but that seems to be broken (more in the bio of vid)
---
[https://youtu.be/oJ3qDsh9-B4](https://youtu.be/oJ3qDsh9-B4)
---
But another problem seems to be that the Frog habitat is not checking off in the World Challenges for the Reptile (Hermpatologist, Frotogilst?? Idk how to spell it, bit a mouth full) which makes one of the Tad pole badges un-accessible for time being (along with the Medic one as the Stimpak Diffuser doesn't seem to be currently in the game).
---
Some Atomic shop items for the CAMP can be accessed, even though they have not been purchased.
---
The bug where you can only spawn at vault 76 or some far place is still around, wanted to re-mention that.
---
Well there is something to be said for consistency, lol.
---
I don't think there's a recipe yet but it's a beast of a snack ingame. 3 END, 40% food and it weights 0.01.
---
Idk, I guess I just can't relate. In all my hours of playing this game, I've never had it effected so negatively by seeing a floating base. I just figure they enjoy it and are having their own fun with the game.
---
I was in a camp last night heading to their vending machine, they had punji boards all around it.....why?
---
Sorry, dont know
---
Yes, but you'll have to watch the video, I can't recall when it was said, but I clearly remember Todd talking about it during the Bethesda Fallout 76 Panel at this event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zIQaXj8h6o&amp;has_verified=1
---
Todd also says someone sent him a box of bobby pins with a note that said "Weigh These" lol.
---
thank god for that thanks bud
---
Yeah I get it . I found a serum vendor on the trading sub like a week ago and his shop was truly amazing . I took a picture and it is now my favorite loading screen .
---
That all you needed?
---
Defense is worthless in PvP, go with damage.
---
Psychobuff and Berry Mentats are the strongest combo you can get now.
---
I have the same problem. The vending machine shouldn't be tied to the camp budget at all. These restrictions are ridiculous in my opinion.
---
Ah, really? That‚Äôs disappointing!
---
Lol this was me last night
---
It‚Äôs the Charisma perk card Healing Hands that clears revived players of all rads.
---
&gt;  before people start giving me shit, if its easily repeatable by normal game play, then it should be considered a feature, not a bug
---
Don\t forget to mention it in your essay
---
I would love this.
---
by which i mean are you going to pull a prank on one of your actual friends, or are you going to attack somebody who is not an actual friend.
---
Not all heros wear capes... Some have a scout uniform.
---
Thx!
---
The latter
---
I hoped I'd get more team up requests with my medkit icon.
---
No, I gave up, did some others lol!
---
I don't know how to respond to that! XD
---
The Over encumbered Bug forcing Respawn at Vault 76?  
---
Thanks for the rest, will explore later today
---
Repair it,thena repair it to 130% ,then to 200%. Maybe it works.
---
They are made of glass and dropping them destroys them immediately
---
Other than the fact that I already never have plastic thanks to bulking (thank you for letting me sell parts to other vendors without doing that now), I fully approve.
---
I experienced something similar, in that the threat at the CAMP was deadly.  I travelled to a vendor's camp, which was a beautiful structure, and wound up on their bottom floor outdoor deck.  Immediately I was attacked by 12-15 Super Mutants Level 50 and above.  I ran, put on power armor and then powered through so to speak.  I never did get into his vending area... assuming there was an accessible one.
---
Okey thanks, i need to get used to that
---
Yeah this helps me a lot cause my build eat Stims like chips I'm lvl 167 and still farm my salves at Flatwoods haha
---
I dont mind dropping $20 a check. It's just annoying because I got two sets because I did not fully read, but I did see all the armor names supported. My shock when I lost my raider helmet. -_-
---
You can find hot dogs on a grill on the roof with the apartment sign in Morgan town, do the hog dog eating mission in Camden park.
---
Pemmican is powdered dried meat, mixed with fat and usually  berries. 
---
Until it's mixed... it's not pemmican.
---
Solomon's Pond, BoS graveyard outside of Huntersville, and Leader of the pack event in the forest
---
Where is the event location i still have not found it
---
Found some at the freak show
---
Xbox One
---
Because Bethesda thinks consoles are better than PC.
---
You need the blood pack recipe, stimpak recipe, chemist perk, and level 3 butchers bounty. All you need to make stimpaks are tick blood, antiseptic and some steel. With the chemist perk you can make a 2 bloodpacks with 2 tick blood and antiseptic. Then you use 1 bloodpack 1 antiseptic and one steel to make 2 stimpacks. In the end each tick blood will yield 2 stimpacks. Tick blood sacks can also be scrapped for antiseptic. So all you need is a source of steel, and to server hop a spot where ticks spawn. With butchers bounty your basically getting 2-4 stimpacks off each tick.
---
Good point. You've found more things to complain about.
---
I'm not going to hit that value, but wtf?
---
So you can have a dmg resist one and a max carry wt one? That's what imma do
---
I've gotten a response from one of the Community managers, they are looking into this.
---
didn't get it in water so did not count toward the scout world challenge badge for me.
---
did it for you?
---
Awesome link! Thanks a lot!
---
I imagine yes, just craft another backpack.
---
The owner of the C.A.M.P. is the only one that will spawn near the device. Visitors will spawn in the original location of the device when the C.A.M.P. was first established.
---
Also on PC, also looking for revive help. IGN: etherdemon
---
That's pretty much where I am at. Early in the game, I setup this really nice looking shop that was equipped with all the workbenches a wastelander could want, with a cozy sitting area playing music on the jukebox. 
---
But since people didn't even see me on the map, it was always abandoned while I was on scavenging runs and was no different than a random shack you could find out in the wastes randomly except it looked cleaner and had no valuable scrap in it to encourage people to even step in.
---
I want to be the tavern owner in a player hub like something outta Monster Hunter, having people buff up on consumables before heading out in the wastes on adventure.
---
I did and it‚Äôs condition was still at like 150%
---
Yeah passed it! I‚Äôll go in again
---
Wait there's a fountain that cures diseases?
---
Use the taxed caps to subsidize welfare programs for low level players.
---
Freak show sometimes.
---
Is this just the same as Australian GST?
---
Tbh is doesn‚Äôt 100% bother me. But when I have to use marsupial to get to your base I‚Äôm nothing interested. 
---
But yes play your way. 
---
I‚Äôve only seen one place that was really cool in terms of ‚Äúfloating‚Äù. The player used the post found under the stairs section and made their living quarters appear to be floating in the air. The whole thing was 1x1 being 6 long and 3 high.
---
Just the little QoL fixes and balance adjustments in this update were really great.
---
I'm also enjoying the difficulty of the pioneer challenges.  I just got to possum level and it's fairly demanding, although you do have a lot of options.
---
Also, Pompy is fucking great.  I'll never turn down a little dose of Mr. Rogers in my life.  He's capable of killing a bear, so he's choosing to be a kindly robot.
---
Considering how insane people are pricing most shit, yes, getting some consensus would be good.  
---
Keep in mind that most recipes are completely worthless.  No one needs another rug recipe or the batter statue, we all have it already and have dropped dozens of dupes.  Recipes for drugs on the other hand...
---
I think you mean skeet.
---
Repairing your melee to 200% no longer increased the damage output, however I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference in my rifles
---
I'm not sure if it's the same issue, but sometimes it won't let me attach wires from Part A to Part B, but WILL allow me to attach wires from Part B to Part A. Otherwise, move the objects close together first, connect the wire, then move one of the objects to where you wanted it to be. If they just aren't attaching AT ALL, it's probably a bug, or it thinks you are out of CAMP budget.
---
land on me here in water
---
I had that issue yesterday. Attempting to connect my vending machines to power. Wire was green connecting from conduit to machine, but wouldn't connect, I would be jumping instead. So I reversed it, vending machine to conduit and it then connected.
---
Ill try it cause I literally hust need that one I don't wanna do any other one till after I get my backpack
---
woah total newb question, but what are you selling? I need me some caps lol
---
Agree. First thing that came to mind..
---
"people who don't use it are left with nothing."
---
I will disagree with this. The mod called "deep pockets" AFAIK it's available for all armor pieces. Giving you and addional 50 lbs of Cary weight. So no PA gets nothing again for updates but skins.
---
My main is a PA hvy wepaons build. I'm good with using PA 99% of the time. I don't have issues with bot getting another 60lbs carry weight. Since currently in t51b I have 176/385 carry weight. But I've modded the hell out of my t51b. Yes in my excavator I get 176/485 so what. If Bethesda ads a refrig mod to the park torso/arms fine still not going to change my play still/pa mods. It's that Bethesda clearly went back on what they said. That's the issue.
---
If its the problem where you jump instead of it connecting you gotta start from the opposite direction.
---
I'll definitely die for you, but i cant promise i wont fuck your mom
---

---
The football nuke throws would make so much sense...
---
It‚Äôs Supposed to be like that :)
---
Yeah, I thought there'd be way more folks looking to partner up with awesome passive heals and big fat XP boostin' teammate.
---
damn, I should be more aggressive about checking shops.  I'd buy any and every PA plan I came across at prices like that.  I'd buy them if already have them for resale.
---
I made my camp in s manner that it directd you into a bar area with a conolete workshop and stashboxes available fkr anyone to use. Inside there a locked door leading to my living quarters. It fullfills the need for a bit of privacy while at the same time being a friendly neighbor.
---
If anyone is on xbox come on down to Old Fart's Ware's southwest of whitesprings at the edge of the golfcourse. Each purchase comes with a free teabag and a heart emote.
---
Do you have the gun plan perks? Only thing i can think of
---
got it in the challenges now thanks bud
---
Nah bruh, they said they changed it in the patch notes. :)
---
Yep that's the one! But I have had times where I've died in Watoga, and the only spawn location was Miners Monument, and a sometimes if I die in an interior/cell, no icons on the map show up. This happened once, and only icon that came up for me was a horde event that said was in the Cranberry bog, but the icon was in the forest...
---
Whop no worry‚Äôs! Have fun
---
My standard perks for every character is Blocker, Fireproof, Starched Genes and Lone Wanderer. You won't get anything out of Lone Wanderer in a party though.
---
I'd really like to know how people thought they'd access this backpack when they wore power armor. Logistically. Anyway, I think it was a fine decision by Bethesda, and think with the new Purveyor selling legendary power armor pieces, it seems more balanced.
---
That would definitely be a good idea to encourage player Vending further
---
Finally the game economy is going to be somewhat better.I'm getting tired of people selling items over the cap limit.Thanks Bethesda !
---
I havent dug too deep into the lore behind the creatures (still only level 47) but that makes a little more sense. Its tough to decipher what holotapes and notes are pre-war and what are from the survivors in Appalachia. If West-Tec made most of these creatures that makes a little more sense.
---
eyeroll
---
Also we could vote on our terminals they gave us
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and it‚Äôs usually broken. I can see that other people are talking and if it‚Äôs really, really quiet I can hear them just a little. Going to party chat works fine, but game chat has been bugged like this since at least patch 7. 
---
They really need to fix this. Now that players are coming together in CAMPs, it‚Äôs a huge loss.
---
Eh, itd create a system where its more profitable to create a bs vending machin with 5,000 cap stimpacks just to collect the toll.
---
Calibrated stocks give you 100 carry weight so power amour is basically already a backpack
---
I wish I could upvote this twice, man. I have almost all the recipes and I craft a heck ton of aid and chems, but the fact that I have to do multiple server hops just to collect blight, firecaps, strangler blooms, ash roses, and the various types of blossoms that you can‚Äôt grow yourself makes me want to pull my hair out. I‚Äôm on a lake and I would kill to be able to plant some snaptails and tarberries ‚Äî heck, I‚Äôd settle for bloodleaves. Another thing I‚Äôd love to see someday in the game would be seed packets, so that you can plant large quantities. But alas, we work with what we‚Äôve got until the lords of Bethesda hear our cries!
---
I can help you, that Sherox guy above were kind enough to die for me so now am i too :D
---
It‚Äôs a backpack mod
---
Sorry m8, it was a choice between planting a few gourds so I could make cranberry relish for that sweet 10% exp boost and adding some pillars to hold my house up. One of them had to go.
---
You could always just use the refrigerator bakckpack
---
While I do like this idea because I spent well over 500-600 caps yesterday fast traveling, I feel like players without food items to sell would stack there vendors with useless items (pipe wrench‚Äôs and such) just to make there vendor look as if it has a lot of options and be more appealing to spend the caps for the travel. Maybe if that was only implanted if a purchase was made it would be more reliable and less exploitable
---
you as well mate
---
I‚Äôm seeing about a 15% increase in my rifles today. About what I get from bloody mess, but I‚Äôve always had that equipped. Sucks on the Melee though. :(
---
a lot*
---
Try clearing your cache.
---
No not just that it‚Äôs the principle of survival
---
Well, at least I was capable of starting the....transaction.   There are worse problems.
---
They added the refrigeration mod to backpack that‚Äôs a start. Food shouldn‚Äôt last forever because it‚Äôs exactly what you said it is, a survival game. If I put food in my fridge at home it doesn‚Äôt mean it lasts forever.
---
Itll cost space no matter where you put it
---
Awesome, I'm in game now, or I can be on again later if that's better for you.
---
Opportunist = a person who takes advantage of a situation often at the expense of ethics or morals = a shitty person.
---
That... would be a half-marathon. Only a "marathon" is a "marathon"... 26 miles.
---
people who read patch notes already know this
---
They were deactivated in patch 9.
---
Oh, you just made my day!
---
It got nerfed with the latest update either because of an exploit and Bethesda didn't want you sending people across the map with nukashine .. it might come back depending what was wrong.
---
Course :)
---
I carry a backup anti-armor/limb damage ultracite laser pistol and 3-4 related perks just for those annoying enemies that I can't convince to square up with me.  It's very light, has good ammo capacity, ammo is very common, fires quickly and does remarkably well against scorchbeasts that refuse to land.  Well worth the perk investment.
---
Play an encryptid event. Plenty of people go down in that lil puddle and it does count
---
Yeah but I would rather have it in my stash than have it on my person
---
Some people just make all the stims diluted
---
They got "disabled" this patch due to trolling
---
Yeah that is kind of a valid option but shouldn't a game - and no i'm not rant about it, since i put much time in it and got much fun back - work without depending on another platform/Service to team-up?
---
It takes less space in your inventory if you take the Tru-Hiker perk.
---
it was disabled, it was mentioned in the patch notes. no specific reason but obv something was wrong and they needed to disable it
---
If you get a chance read the patch notes from the last update yesterday. Punch bowl was shut off.
---
This is the way. Way less mats required to repair low level weapons.
---
SW of Charleston Fire Station on the side of the hill where you harvest them for the responder vaccine quest
---
especially considering you don't even have access to the X-01 yet when you first visit the bunker
---
I hope we eventually get glass walls and ceiling pieces to complete the greenhouse aesthetic.
---
This content has been out ONE day and you guys are using terms like "finally" and "grind"? Come on. Bethesda finally delivers a quest chain that requires effort, and you want to devour all the content at once?
---
I'm still working on getting liquor recipes, while farming the sheepsquatches, while getting mounted head trophies from Cryptids side quests.
---
Yea that. It looks wacky as hell for a fallout game. Dunno why I got downvoted for my opinion, not how it‚Äôs supposed to be used
---
I‚Äôve tried that, no jumps, though it only went green one way.
---
I'm also in game at the moment. My username is ExoticManiac, I can join your game once you add me :)
---
So I did the three badges and got my tadpole backback. I know have access to Possum badges. Is there a continuation of the questline or is doing the badges their own reward?
---
I love seeing other people's camps as well. Even if most just defy gravity. They could do the guestbook thing on the players personal computer, that'd be neat.
---
Yeah i noticed my melees take a decent hit but to be fair I run a bloodied sledge and adrenal soo after I‚Äôm below 50% it‚Äôs 1-2 hitting most of everything I run into anyways. I‚Äôll try out my rifles today and see what if i notice anything
---
Found it if you're there to take a picture for a badge stand back for it to work
---
Then I will take everything from your vendor and resell it for a profit. You're move comrade üëâüèªüòéüëâüèª
---
Won‚Äôt be on until this weekend and I‚Äôll be playing my low level build but I will be in contact. Worst case scenario it‚Äôs another gun shooting
---
When that happens, i usually exit out of build menu and try it again. it should work after. Happens so much to me!
---
I remember that. That might come in handy.
---
I thought they both meant that.  What does yeet mean then?
---
It uses more space in your stash than it does on your person when your using the right perks and/or weight reduction armour. Be smart.
---
Read my mind
---
Platform?  
---
If you are on PC make sure '76 isn't open in your Task Manager and try re-updating.  
---
   
---
If on console do the verify/repair
---
I'm looking for this too. Apparently there is a plan for it somewhere
---
For text fields, yeah.
---
Theres non man dammit by any chance you know where to find anglers
---
I spoke with a Community Manager, they are looking into this
---
Yeah the faction vendors and others sell a lot more plans now
---
So when damaging weapons, you can just shoot (not gunbash) and it causes general wear and tear, you can repair the weapon, shoot another arrow, repair it again and repeat.
---
Of course with a crafted weapon it always has 120%+ condition depending on perks or not, to mitigate some of that, you can fast travel to Vault 76 and gunbash all the robots outside until you need to repair it again as they respawn fairly regularly per server and can in effect be server hop farmed
---
they wanted to support the game with skins yet they dont seem to put the time into creating skins. the people at beth are either incompetent or not very creative
---
The guy that responded to you doesn't know if you're from Minnesota or San Francisco or Istanbul or Kyoto or London or Singapore. You have a chip on your shoulder.
---
Of course, I was just trying to give a layman's simplification to mean meat food that lasts long time.
---
Do you have one, could you check the numbers ingame?
---
Start the Encryptid event. People who show up count as allies.  
---
People die in that event. They die a LOT.  
---
Stimpack freely and keep an eye for someone down in the pool. Heck, BE the guy in the pool. Someone saving you gets the bonus and, odds are, they'll die there too, letting you return the favor.  
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch, man. She's your accountabilibuddy for playing solo. :D
---
Medic? Is that it? Other effects better be good if you want 4k for it. Can whip out a medics anything and it'll have the same medic heal effect
---
That means it would only take a little longer for you. You‚Äôre not on a time limit
---
Just want to add...Hasty .50 call is still less damage than my Hardened Rifle...
---
is there another .50 cal mod im missing? Patch notes said this new .50 is the highest dmg
---
Obviously I know that this is a possibility, but to be honest, out of about 10 interactions so far only one person has done that. Besides, I do it to help others so if you making money helps you I guess we both win!
---
Do you have to shoot an enemy or can you just shoot the air?
---
I say finally because I've been holding out for backpacks and hoping they would show up since launch. I just happened to have the day off from work so I've been playing it all day. Trust me, if anyone tales there time in this game, its me
---
Alright sounds good:)
---
How many times did you hop, they guaranteed at middle mountain, what were you getting ?
---
I'd also love to stop by if you're up for company! I want to try a serum!
---
You sell 100 per lege star? Wow. I'll buy them from you, matey. That's a killer price.
---
But those that don't know now.
---
I don't know if the 10mm SMG is classified as rifle. Tank Killer is only for rifles.
---
Pemmican was traditionally made by rendering bison fat and making bison jerky mixed together. It's like a keto super food that had a room temperature shelf life of 20+ years. It's uh... interesting to eat. Kind of like eating a tallow candle infused with finely shredded meat. 1 pound of the stuff is like 3,000 calories. Native Americans and early American settlers used it for long journeys and tough winters. It wasn't exactly tasty, but if you were starving, it had everything you need to survive - all the vitamins, minerals, protein, and energy (fat) to keep you going for years and years. Explorers survived on nothing but Pemmican for many years with no ill effects. Sometimes nuts and berries are added for flavor, but that drastically reduces the shelf life since it can introduce molds and bacteria.
---
Thats honestly such a smart niche market. Magazines and bobbleheads would be a good one too. You could be a little hobbiest store lol. Its also kinda hillarious that you purchased a game, and spent hours playing, just to become a videogame salesman.
---
Use the trash can, it works for RP to have it outside and also provides stash access.
---
Go between them like realy close and try again. Took me while till i found out.
---
&gt;Then make your pick, blueprints or being able to move a staircase more easily.
---
So  I have to  choose between moving a staircase easily or keeping the most overrated and useless feature of the camp system?  Damn.  That's a tough one.
---
Don't strain yourself reaching that far.
---
The console does have a little keyboard that pops up.
---
I don't think this is "consolitis" so much as it's just dumb design.
---
It's just as annoying to use that fucking slider on the console.
---
It might be aroubd the campgrounds I found a few plans there
---
You talk about dick? They were all up in you so  hard you‚Äôre still talking about Bethesda like a scorned wench. Ima go cry about the launch of destiny now cause that‚Äôll help the cause.
---
Investigators cabins a good spot
---
Polk is the wrestler, not Lincoln.
---
Were you at my camp? Listen here my 1*walking cane is OP end game weapon and it was actually used by famous ppl so it‚Äôs worth a lot. Also I think it‚Äôs up for 3000 caps not 1000 and in also selling the barbed cane mod for another 2000 caps so come on down. Also coming soon the ivory grip mod for the low cost of 10,000 caps.
---
I don't know, I design spatulas for a living
---
nine ish, I found Yao gai and radscorpions
---
Jumping on now
---
Yeah Betheda, what are you spending this money on?
---
Mmm if i can manage to drop some weight i would gladly do this ,but right now those 60 weight are a breath of fresh air for me.
---
Also if it costs 8 badges, how are we supposed to buy everything?
---
Yeet is throwing or chucking something aggressively or without care
---
Mmmm tastes like tears lol
---
To throw
---
Yes you can shoot into air and it‚Äôll still affect the condition of your crossbow
---
This is a bug they are looking into, oddly the seller has to be close to their own camp for you to inspect the item
---
Whitespring bunker entrance top of the hill
---
Upvoted, but if anyone else on Xbox would like someone to get the water revive challenge I'll be on for the next hour. My gamtertag is Tempestium.
---
Hey my mic is fidgety and people don't always hear me, thanks for that. If you need help with any of the other stuff, please feel free to let me know.
---
You know what.... Now I wonder if anyone has spawned off the edge when traveling to my base..... hasn't happened to me yet but it is a new base location for me.  
---
I'm near **The Freak Show** location.
---
Sounds like commie propaganda
---
There's always room for improvement but after this update, oh boy there's a plethora of things to do / complete / achieve and interact. The community is strong! So many passionate players. People whop had lost hope in the game have since then returned. Give it another go! There's so much to appreciate! :)
---
That‚Äôs right but I think it‚Äôs just wrong of them to try to not add it in the base game and make people pay for it or work for it like I do if i want something in the shop
---
The swimming test fails for me over and over? Any idea why? It says swim but it's too shallow to swim, I get to the last buoy and it fails me even with 3+ minutes left.
---
Just wanted to say that for the ‚Äúkill 50 enemies with a crossbow‚Äù you don‚Äôt need to craft arrows as it still counts if you bash them to death
---
Interesting .. what platform ? That's where I would go .. try the freak show, so unless they got nerfed ..
---
Good luck.   The struggle is real, out in the wasteland
---
They're one of the steps you need to get badges so you can ultimately move from Tadpole rank to Possum rank in the Pioneer Scouts, allowing you to craft backpacks.  If you go to the World Challenges (in the same place you see the Atom Challenges) and scroll down, you'll see exactly what you need to get each badge.
---
Them being close doesn;t work either.
---
I've tested multiple times with the seller standing next to me, and the only way to properly inspect is to ask over voice if they'll trade and show you.
---
This is usually fine, but there is another thread on people telling people to GTFO because they want more detail than the vending machine offers....
---
Wow, first silver! Thanks!
---
Ive been seeing a lot of squirrels in toxic valley.
---
hahhahaha
---
All you people complaining about how other people's camps are ugly: You're all active in your neighborhood HOA, aren't you?  Goddamn busybodies, git off my floating lawn!
---
Just thinking about this today! I had to minimize the game and heard the "purchase" sound, but once I maximized the game, the notification was already gone and I have so many items on sale that couldn't figure out what was actually sold.
---
Sale logs/history would really help!
---
The amount of caps you pay in travel cost must be pretty high for water that you cant even cook with!
---
TIL, thanks!
---
The road from Overseers camp to Flatwoods
---
I only did for the water one but i'm fairly sure it counts for both.
---
I did not see them in my run last night (I checked them all).  Hoping they might be a rare spawn there or at Grahm.
---
eli5?
---
Yup, Girl Scouts and former science museum worker here.  There were some pretty tough questions in there, though.  I had to remind myself of some stuff since it's been way too long since I did archery.
---
Legendary hunting rifles have always been dropping. They just buff'd the .50 cal receiver that you can add on to the hunting rifle since they were poop before the new update. GET IN! Catch up! :D
---
And do you get back to reproductor after touching all buoy?
---
The fact that food dosen't decay while you are offline undermines your argument
---
thanks for the info :)
---
The picture has to be taken with the camera item, not just in photo mode, and when you aim at it properly there should be a little text in the top right corner indicating things on screen ("scorched, petrified corpse, Slither Slide").
---
Sure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HluANRwPyNo
---
That's my point. It would have been a funny answer responding to someone that was from a different area of the US. We joke like that. It's not his fault you are sensitive about the US.
---
All good. 
---
I've got a freezer full of dry meat at home right now... caribou mostly, and a bit of moose. This thread is making me hungry.
---
Yeah if they‚Äôre guaranteed then they owe me something. PS4 
---
Freak show had radtoads, only tried twice, there is a dead honey beast in a truck trailer thing that counted for entomologist badge but not the daily challenge
---
I mean, the numbers themselves are higher for some reason. None of my perks have changed. Anyway... do you actually see higher DMG numbers under your item stats when you‚Äôre below 50% health? I‚Äôve never carried nor really paid attention to Bloodied Weapons. I like my health. :)
---
Check from different angles until you see the name in the screen (like for enemies), that's when they triggered for me
---
They've said it will just be purchasing legendary items in the patch notes. My money is on being able to buy the base item type and selecting how many stars you want, but the effects being 100% random.
---
Well Crap! There goes my power tool business, what am I supposed to do with all those drills I get now?
---
Yep.  I appreciate you offering up such a great gun.  It was really fun to have during SBQ during my hour of play before work this morning.  I thought my AA/E handmade was nice, but that gauss tears shit up just as quickly.
---
I did it in broad daylight on my first time. Kind of odd. Maybe someone triggered it right before Dawn and I joined the event during it's timer and the sun had risen?
---
I listed ballistic fiber at 10 caps a piece. No takers. Almost the only thing I didn't sell. I was surprised given how much this sub complains about repairing armor! Alternately I sold a couple thousand shot gun shells at 2 caps a pop in a matter of minutes.
---
We should find out in tomorrow's inside the vault.
---
Cool, thanks :)
---
attacking animals stop to destroy the punji first. gives the turrets time to wipe them before they reach anything that matters
---
I stumbled over a cluster of them spawning as I headed W from Kiddie Corner Cabins last night
---
I was playing with my sound on speaker instead of headset &amp; my little dog got so excited hearing all the noise they made
---
It‚Äôs me
---
Max wight is 1500 plus you character's max carry weight ,fyi.
---
In other words , your toon should be able to carry 1800 max right now.
---
Honestly, my dude, talk to some people online.  Ask around for help.  People in this game love to help each other, and I'm sure you can help them out with something too.
---
It's okay.  It's Adventure Mode.  They're not going to bite your head off. Unless you ass a deathclaw to help, i guess
---
Firecracker berries are awesome.  I built my camp out in the sticks and little did I know it was adjacent to a thicket of them.  I have a crapload of heavy turrets protecting my pad but it‚Äôs f-berries that scare the shit out of you.
---
No rush, I'm ingame right now and maybe get one.
---
that makes sense, in its own insane way. since it is eating stash space anyway- why??
---
LOL TRUE STORY
---
I would be down to help make a googledoc for this
---
No problem lad, currently I don't need any  help but I heard that there might be similar kinda objectives later on the quest line so I'll perhaps contact you if I need someone to revive :)
---
There's actually also a damn gym in Alpha, with a shit ton of weights.
---
If the robot encounters the two robots that talk to each other, then prime should stop and join the conversation.
---
The robot should occasionally get distracted by flowers and try to smell them, then lament on being unable to.
---
There it is... it can't be that I don't like the assumption that I don't know anything about living in the country... it MUST be that I have a problem with the U.S.
---
The fast travel point is usually near the actual camp device put it outside to fix that
---
Think of all the BOS re-enactors following behind with miniguns &amp; plasma rifles... That'd be a site to see
---
Thats how much they go for, used to be just 150
---
Y'know, I found that Free Range covers a pretty wide range of animals for this, including Wolves.  You'll also get Stingwings, Bloatflies and Yao Guai, all in one go.
---
No one realized that people would put nuka shine in it. Come on......
---
Duping
---
I did have the BOS arms when I was there today. 97 caps... feel bad for everyone that bought them last week
---
That was my thought, how am I supposed to get 8 more possum badges to unlock the ammo backpack? There must be new challenges coming
---
My self personally the new order of the tadpole is broken it popped up for me a few weeks early and doesnt work now.
---
Technical data is broken for me and now stacks and can not be turned in.......
---
My challenge for build functional objects at workshop or C.A.M.P reset from 7000ish/7600 back to 0/7600.....
---
I have no issues with this.  You might try validating your game files.
---
My question is....where do you live that you can get a pizza for $10???  It's closer to $20 in NY.
---
That's fucking hilarious though!! Buyer beware for real,lol.
---
The people bitching about people ‚Äústealing‚Äù their water are probably the same people that used to set up turret camps behind the golf club.  What‚Äôs the problem?  I have a bunch of purifiers at my camp and will never use it all so if you are passing through help yerself.  Just don‚Äôt nuka grenade my camp!
---
I did it too but Stims can go out, plants and water not ;)
---
If you have Marsupial, you can also jump off the cliff behind the cabins at the scout camp.  Takes a couple of tries sometimes, depending on your health, but it works in the end.  A very nice gentleman whose name I forgot revived me after I injured myself this way.  I naturally returned the favor for him.
---
I've found lots between the vault and the Overseers camp.
---
I know the feeling, I had 1200 on my mule. Put them in my machine for 20c, and only one person bought 50 of them. I was a little disappointed.
---
If only this were a democracy (it's not). It's not taxation, it's a service fee for advertising and license to use the vending machine.
---
Awesome. My gt is F1DL5TYX, hopefully we can play this weekend.
---
Power armor is comically outstriped by Legendary Armor, doubly so when looking at 3* armor with Weight Reduction,  this added to it is frustrating.
---
Straight from the patch notes:
---
Animal Friend: Deathclaws, Mega Sloths, Mirelurks, and Scorchbeasts can no longer be pacified by Animal Friend
---
Im on my way! CalcifiedBaby
---
They're probably basing their price off how much they cost at the Enclave bunker.
---
I believe you can have up to 4 vending machines and a total of 120 items (30 on each). Maybe that second one wasnt powered up? I dont know?
---
Yeah but it would be better because I go to my stash all the time so I‚Äôd not like imma leave it there and forget until it gets rotten when ever I need food I can just go to a train station and eat and put a limit on it
---
My tse handmade went from 163 damage to 201.....
---
The responders vendor has the plans for like 6000caps
---
live in the 907? asks someone who lives in the 907
---
Yes the bos items are there and cheap as dirt, but oddly light Raider armor is not.  It‚Äôs stupid if you ask me.
---
It seemed like reroll at first but the most recent news suggest it's gonna be a sinple vendor of random legendary gear.
---
The latter is the most plausible to me. It would be easy to code given what we alteady have.
---
Let's whait the "inside the vault".
---
I feel you girl
---
I'm experiencing this same issue. Very annoying.
---
I made a reddit post and someone responded in under 60 seconds. We teamed up and got er done in 2 min. Easy Peasy. And this is coming from someone who has played this game for 300 hours completely solo since launch day. Not a single friend in the game, and that is how i want it. :)
---
There are several different levels of "Encumbered", the first level only causes you to use additional AP, next you lose the ability to run, then you begin to use AP to walk at a normal pace, and without AP you slow to a craw, and lose the ability to jump over your own shadow.
---
Can you drop the backpack?
---
Exactly, I'm slowly dismantling my awesome camp to sell things )=
---
I mean, whoever buys purified water is a fool, water is the easiest resource to come across
---
I'm loving it. Even with the questionable placement of spawn points, I'm really enjoying being able to easily see and visit camps. I'm taking pictures of them, too. 
---
I was going to make this thread last night, but I'd already made like 4 so decided not to.
---
Nah..they were bugged and dealing double damage
---
I'm starting to accept it's just that you are a huge pussy. But goodnight.
---
Drunk ideas are always the best ideas. You just gotten sift through the drunkenness when you sober up to actually find the good idea in it. I can see a idea brewing here just execution is a little off
---
I just went into the Bethesda Launcher on PC and downloaded the games from the menu.  No idea how it works on consoles.
---
Hm. I'll test it out tonight, I run at 19% life and I'm pretty sure that gets me 50% when on a team with Strange in Numbers which is in line with the table.
---
Super damage on that table refers to the Adrenal Reactions bonus damage when Strange in Numbers is factored in.
---
I feel like that's gonna great slot of server hopping, unless it's a fixed inventory everyday.
---
Yep! Love the update and all, but this is by far the most frustrating bug I've dealt with since launch. It completely invalidated my base designs.
---
Thank you random citizen
---
That's actually hilarious (but fits the FO world theme quite well)
---
Your right but what if you play hours on end every other day like me
---
Not broken
---
I think you should make your own post rather than trying to hijack someone else's post to complain, while most others are happy with the changes.
---
If indeed this is an issue others are equally bothered by, I'm sure it'll get some traction, maybe even the devs will notice.. it's pretty much 100% they aren't going to be looking for your comments here, in a totally unrelated post.
---
Oh trust me, I agree with you. I mainly live in my power armor so I won‚Äôt benefit from the backpack at all so it‚Äôs kinda upsetting. Was just throwing different point of views out there.
---
I can finally stop using strong back perk and use those precious 4 special points in strength elsewhere. God bless you todd howard.
---
make sure you go into notes and sroll down to  read plans and recipes
---
Yes you do! Sometimes I‚Äôll open my pip boy at 20-30% and it will be like 700 damage üòÇ just found a bloodied plasma rifle yesterday have yet to check that out. Does your rifle have a .50 cal receiver? They did buff the damage on those!
---
I will never understand posts like this. Beth is not forcing you to buy or craft or even play.
---
LOL, I remember spending my birthday money to buy Super Mario 3 for like $50.  It seemed crazy expensive at the time.
---
Then you are given hours to replenish your food supplies just like you would have to do in any survival game.
---
Someone said there's an event about scary campfire stories at night, which gives badges as reward. Not confirmed
---
No doubt those downvotes came from the jump shooters. Same reason i don't play COD or Battlefield. That bullshit tactic drives me nuts and blows any sort of immersion away.
---
I brought you back up 1 vote.
---
We know it's a bug that is the whole point of my post???  If no one says anything it won't get fixed.  The owner is very rarely in camp so that doesn't really help when a buyer needs to inspect.  Beth already fixed this bug once before so surely they will fix it again with the vendors.
---
No way, bruv. There's some stuff I legit have no clue on how to price. Like maps. I've settled on 10c a pop but have no idea. Also put supply requisitions for 10c. Diluted stims for 9c per. Instigating lege for 135c. Fusion Cores for 99c. Point is, I wouldn't have a bloody clue.
---
A yeet is actually over the shoulder behind the back a fleet is a forward yeet. And what liberty prime did was a touchdown!
---
I have both the Stealth and Serrated Bowie Knife Mods, but can not install them on Xbox.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôve found myself bouncing around all over the map checking out different camps, getting ideas for my own. 
---
Side note, I know the tax was intended to start taking caps out of the pool and decrease inflation but I feel like I‚Äôm spending more traveling than I‚Äôm being taxed on sales.
---
Small water fountain under domed columnar structure with statue on top.  (I hope that wasn't sarcasm.)
---
I've been able to inspect items at vendors and player's machines since the update. On xb1 though.
---
I think I have an issue/bug with the swimming challenge which takes place in the lake. When I try to touch the furthest red thing (the one on the right side)... "Mission failed".
---
Has anyone else had this problem?
---
Thank you!!!!!
---
Yes. My TSE Handmade with all the rifleman perks and bloody mess went from 148 to 173.
---
yes unfortunately that's what players will have to do.  Otherwise, why even put them in a vendor to begin with wasting space... just drop the stuff in a bag if you want to give it away for free.
---
Better yet, they could just add in the fast travel spawn mat, like we have at workshops and in Fallout 4. It's beyond my understanding why they haven't let us use it in our own camps yet when it's already implemented.
---
Then again, spawning inside a mountain, or in the air next to it, does have a certain charm I suppose.
---
I bought a few last night and realized you can sell them to a vendor for like 500. 
---
You guys are doing the lords work. 
---
Now if someone would just sell me some stable crimson and violet flux for cheap I‚Äôd be set.
---
Okay do you want me to inv you?
---
True. If it's fixed ,it would be like that destiny guy that sells high grade gear weekly.
---
Otherwise ,as you said, the server would explode from everyone server hopping for days.

What would be nice is spawning on a Welcome mat of some sort. Someone actually spawned on my camp. My camp is by water and he spawned in between the foundation and a dock that was already there and i watched him call for help and i just watched... and watched... until he drowned! Im a freaking monster! I didnt know how to react!?!?
---
I don't know. I've read that such crits also completely ignore limb armor. The other buffs let's you add any additional damage boost, but those are usually maxing out the damage against DR.
---
Whenever this happens just move on with your day and come back to it later to fix it. No point in throwing the baby out with the bath water when something is glitching out.
---
They're talking about the enemies that come with the game, like scorched, mongrels, mole rats. Those can still destroy your camp. While players cannot.
---
Just selling a few wares atm. Will be with you shortly
---
Okay
---
I think some recipes require purified water. But i think the reason they do this is, is so that it's more redily available.
---
I lost my damn C.A.M.P. and am gonna have to spawn in and hope I can figure out where it's at.
---
Verified this myself. 100% true.
---
Why we gotta have an enforcement? I'm saying just come up with ideas as a community. We don't need anyone overseeing it. It's just lads and lasses and those betwixt figuring it out on their own. And this is Fallout, nobody expects everyone to follow a model. I certainly don't. Just an idea to maybe try within ourselves or to throw aside. It's all good either way.
---
How do you steal someone else's caps? 
---
Is that a thing?
---
Dude... You didn't get the point. At all.
---
I'm not complaining that all should be solo - no - it should be both, something you should be able to accomplish alone (takes more time, is harder to take on etc.) but also having fun doing with your friends. I mean - get off those team-up stuff, which they shouldn't, but get more options to solve challenges.
---
And if your view is on mmo, which is also valid, we then got also to look after RP chars or not? Well because if we do then what should someone do whos serious RP a lone scavenger? Should be left out also i guess in your opinion. 
---
Sorry that in your view someone is crying when pointing out something valid other than your view.
---
The only crying i see is "we get no raids..." which is also not true - beth is onto it or i'm wrong? The vaults? No?
---
And let me guess - just for fun ok? - you're not playing solo, you mostly hang around with 1/2 or more friends. I think you also have done raids in other games together maybe. And this is great - congrats to that. But therefore you have no Problem like some others which aren't in such a wonderful situation.
---
And i take another guess - you think - "nah...poor dude is crying because he has nobody to play with" and that is wrong :)
---
See you soon at a vault raid fella
---
This is an awesome format. I gotta learn how to make those check boxes for my sheets!
---
I'll tell you why, cause Bethesda's PC ports are fucking trash, always have been, only saving grace is that they release the creation engine mod tools for mods on the PC, but I predict that TES 6 will not release these tools or will have a subscription base for them, forcing the "PAID MODS" agenda they want. Their games are made for Xbox consoles because that studio is up Microsoft's ass since the Original Xbox saved their ass with oblivion
---
I'm in the same position.  I'm not looking to get rich.  I just want any weird Legendaries, plans or items I find to have a happy home with someone who needs them, because I have no use for them and they are just taking up space.
---
And if it's a middle finger to those who farm the metas, then I consider that a bonus.
---
can you help with it then? I couldn't have the problem when it was required to have whole family in the picture, but now when only queen and spawns are required I can't make it count.
---
Because Radiation adds flavor and glowy things to your diet.
---
Ragstags have no utters. What were you "milking"?
---
Join me

PSN?
---
Lol made my day thanks!
---
Haven‚Äôt played in a while, but I left all but one purifier and my personal bedroom unlocked.  People find my spot?  Hey, reapply buffs, cook some food, decontamination shower is on the second floor.
---
Oh yeah, go check out the West Tek facility. That company pretty much single-handedly destroyed Appalachia just by existing.
---
Lol. I always wondered why all you fools were running around with your bars close to death. That‚Äôs cool as hell.
---
No I‚Äôm talking about my lever action and handmade. Now, given, they are both explosive, so maybe that‚Äôs where the mysterious buff lies.
---
So they get stuck?  
---
Does that mean I can sell them too?
---
I grew up in arcades and met a ton of great people, running one just seemed like the obvious thing to do given that we have a bunch of holotape games and people are hungry for content and interaction.
---
I run a tournament every Thursday night right now, but I am really hoping to get more stuff going as interest builds.
---
The holotape games are really well thought out and really deserve more attention than they get.
---
People say there are no NPCs in this game but man are they wrong. There are a ton in both Grognak and the Ruby Ruins and Wastelad. I am actually fascinated that there is a gamer lifestyle actually included in the game itself but most of the people playing it just don't check it out.
---
It would be pretty hilarious though, place the mat inside a sealed off room with nothing but floor spikes. Or you could place it on a spot where they will fall to their deaths if they aren't in power armor. It could be abused too easily but I really miss placing my spawn point with it in fo4
---
Pew Pew from New Vegas
---
Yeah daily hunting animals to make meals but I would like it if I could save those means a little longer that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking to be able to not have to worry that food will rot and then theirs my brahmin milk I want to have but rots so fast I just don‚Äôt want to rely on my backpack to do that I want something made to have it  and it can be restricted to only hold so it‚Äôs not broken
---
My camp floats over a submerged acid sink. Before this one I built my camps on the ground around the resource generator. That is such a waste of camp space. My house sits above the resource generator and water purifiers that use leaving the surrounding land available for my crops. I did use the wood building plans to make it look lighter more like a treehouse, but I don't have enough camp budget to also put the columns underneath to make it look visually more stable. When I originally built it I thought it was really cool.  When I finally get the brick building set plans I plan on redoing the house to see if it can fit better without floating. Also I don't really believe in leaving your resource generators out in the open they're too expensive to constantly repair. I think of my house as acid springs and the fact the resource generator is in the water saves me a lot of heartache.
---
Let it go man.  Or don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs only junk and fake currency that can really only buy a few plans that you don‚Äôt need anyway.  If you can‚Äôt accept that you‚Äôre going to die some really shitty, unfortunate deaths in the wasteland then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.  
---
Hint:  it‚Äôs supposed to be harsh.  Let‚Äôs just fantasize and pretend this really happened - do you think there wouldn‚Äôt be shitty people out there doing that exact thing?  It would be an absolute free for all.  A total nightmare.  They‚Äôve actually made this pretty palatable if you ask me.
---
No I don‚Äôt think so, I did it 5-6 times and on the last try I got a S‚Äômores plan, so if it does give badges it‚Äôll be very rare I would think
---
It was hilarious to Nukashine people. The first time one of my teammates did it unexpectedly was gold.
---
There are multiple at Whitespring. The hill above the bunker like someone mentioned. There's one in between the bunker service entrance and the main driveway to the resort, along the grass and under the trees. One more in the little patio area connected to the resort, right next to the parking lot with all the cars and ghouls in it.
---
Why are you here? Lmao
---
TIL. Thanks
---
I‚Äôve been trying to find something such as that to compensation for my lack of range but I just haven‚Äôt been able to get good drops, or enough caps to be able to trade for such a weapon.
---
So I just run around like a headless chicken when a scorchbeast decides to spawn far ahead of me and instantly scopes me out.
---
Invite away
---
With?
---
&gt; *
---
You're welcome.
---
Meh I'll loose a few people like you but I'm ok with that. They have to tour my CAMP following the 4 signs I put up. No one has spawned at my CAMP and given up or been frustrated so far. Also if you don't like the price of something you know don't buy it? Everything will eventually even out and their will be the usual prices for everything.
---
Yeah but they keep track of whether or not we have it installed don‚Äôt be ignorant about that your acting like it‚Äôs some close friends your defending it‚Äôs a company that realizes on us the consumers if we uninstall to show we don‚Äôt support something they will get the point
---
So far every single data mined thing that would have negatively impacted the game (example: loot crate) by being pay to win.. hasn't happened. They've listened to players thus far.
---
Repair kits you can buy for atoms for 50¬¢ or with free atoms is as far as possible from pay to win. I personally am okay with them adding useful things, rather than just skins, as long as we can aquire those things for free (aka: they aren't **only cash items*").
---
I personally could give a shit less about skins, so anything useful I could save atoms for would be welcome. Especially if they aren't pay to win (how the fuck would fridges be pay to win?)
---
There's always going to be players like you that think the worst, or use scare tactics, rather than wait and see what actually happens. As long as there's nothing that's **cash only**, I think there's very little that will hurt players.. especially when thus far they've not done *anything* that hurts the game (like the shitty repair kits for atoms, versus the good ones you can't buy)
---
Same. I used a bunch of caps hopping to camps; but found some great stuff.
---
As far as challenges resetting I don't think many know yet. But I do think that's the only way of obtaining them.
---
The voting booths already in-game
---
My meteorite sword no longer is a legendary after the update. I don‚Äôt see it in the notes.
---
There are a ton of Bones around the Dumpsters near the Bunker Service Entrance as WS
---
Can confirm. Picked a lock yesterday without thinking about it and got a 10 cap bounty. Had to jump over to a survival server just to get someone to kill me, so I could see everyone‚Äôs camps on the map again haha.
---
still need help?
---
Only walls and floors that are directly connected to the stairs are affected by this restriction. The "navmesh chain" triggers also with the topside of a wall. 
---
Just place a stair somewhere outside of your house temporarily on a place that is not connected with the first stair and you should be able to delete the first one.
---
this drove me nuts too and surprisingly what worked for me was being quite a bit away from each attraction and then snapping the pic. it‚Äôs like the entire ride needs to be in the frame and the name must appear on your screen before u snap.
---
There goes my entertainment. Next you won't be able to drop a quick half dozen Vintage  Nukashine in the overseers' camp box. Welcome to West Virginia, vault dweller!
---
IMO, Berserker should be *at least* on par with Bloodied.  It's a vastly more dangerous way to play, and yet the bonus seemed to top out at a measly +50% damage, versus whatever the heck Bloodied is doing.
---
Where are you seeeing the costs for the mods? How do you get the BP mods? Just completing the challenges or what?
---
Yes :/
---
I‚Äôve been looking. Also what about the fasnacht bonfire plan?
---
I'm a little confused. I've read on here that the backpack skin from the atomic shop is not for the backpack one would get from the scouts. If that is so where do I get a backpack to put the new skin on?
---
I told you what I did lmao. I think its funny that people are trying to justify being a dick head, it's like you guys are neglecting to use the part of your brain that controls common sense. If I so very obviously have enough crops for one person... And it's all within my camp... It should be a no brainer that they aren't yours to take. You want crops? Plant some yourself dude.
---
Tre-fitty
---
There is a max harvest rate for an area, so putting 5 huge purifiers is kinda pointless. I've put 4 of the small ones and let them act as storages.
---
It's bugged for me too.
---
You have to buy them with badges in the machines of the scouts camp
---
I would **think** that it would be, but I don‚Äôt have it to try
---
I agree with what you are saying. This is just a FYI.
---
When you place the C.A.M.P machine down @ a build area for the first time (moving to a "new"location. Reber that spot. That is where EVERYONE else will spawn at.
---
You as the owner of the base will spawn at the EDGE of the build are where the CAMP machine light is facing, or directly the opposite direction. You can move the Camp machinf and it facing. This will change YOUR spawn point. But not othwrs
---
You not wrong but at least other survival games can make it so that it takes long to make the food rot
---
I got it just dont but i can die for you no worries ill inv you
---
New business idea, go to every player camp you can and survey prices. Average them out, and sell your results as a subscription service to other traders so they know what the current average is.
---
Make 25k caps a day and never sell anything but data.
---
KEVIN!
---
No worries, just go back to Treadly every day at 8pm, Dolly Sods and do the bug quest. It resets and gives you a possum badge.
---
Edit: I‚Äôll be on at about 6:10pm CST
---
What?!  It's not that super hard one by flatwoods? I've been trying to complete that for half an hour now. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
---
Some might say you're a.... wet bandit.
---
I had the same problem. Thank you for the EDIT!
---
Only for the guys.
---
No joke, I do wish there were a few underwear options.  Or, at least, have them look nice.  I mean, we lived in the Vault, not the wasteland.
---
Weird, i just checked and it only had tadpole gear... are there different machines?
---
But that's not fun! Can I outsource it to you?
---
Here's 5 shots to kill a level 68 scorched at melee range. I'll grab a clip of my invincible feet next.

I picked up the pistol from a player vending machine yesterday.  I have an instigating plasma pistol (fully modded with a burning receiver, stabilized sniper barrel and aligned grip) in my machine that no one has bought yet.  500 caps.  Also have a fully stabilized modded instigating pipe bolt action rifle for the same price.
---
IGN shankwell if you're on PC.  My camp is right across the tracks from the Whitespring Station.
---
Did you do it in water?
---
Mind if I add this to my Bug roundup?  
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 9.0 | 05/07/209 Wild Appalachia - Pioneer Scouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm96og/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_90/)
---
Just server hop at that camp, this event sometimes gives badge too
---
I have my own business to run!
---
Yes, on the other side of the tadpole one
---
Like your parents never bought you stuff when you were a kid?
---
wow! possum badges?
---
Anytime friend.
---
they mentioned that backpacks work with the powerarmor as far as i know
---
I disagree, if they made it free then you could just use someone's CAMP to go around for free with a short walk
---
This is where I went wrong. I don‚Äôt have the camera, haven‚Äôt gone through the ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù questline yet. Now it‚Äôs another whole can of worms just to do that... Hahahah.
---
They are ammo for the ultracite gatling laser, but they still work in power armor just the same.  Since each one requires a fusion core to make it, you can just use a core that at 1% and it refills it to like 95+int percent full.  When I make them they turn a 1% core into a 112% core.  Costs violet Flux to make them tho
---
I see robot armor on occasion in bog armor plan spawns.  700+ hours and have never seen raider armor piece plans or t45 or heavy metal.
---
It has happened to me. Totally frustrating
---
From the limited timeframe I‚Äôve seen way more traffic to my camp, trades, and buying than ever before. I think vending is going to be ok in the long run. 
---
However, the point of the sales tax was to start taking caps out of the market to combat inflation. That coupled with the fast travel cost associated are going to achieve that goal. They Rent going to look to ways for players to recoup these costs... that defeats the entire purpose.
---
‚Ä¢Harvest Fungi plants &amp; flora challenge
---
This is a staple of classic RPGs that's sadly fallen by the wayside.
---
But hell, Metal Gear Solid V had a game message log, I think it's a real useful feature for any game that has a lot of game messages.
---
That means your stash is full, all items for sale are tied to your stash..the item you're trying to sell is in your personal inventory. When you try and mark it for sale the game has to put it in your stash. So if you're at 792/800 and you try and add a 12lb TS Handmade to your vendor it will say camp budget is full because the 12lb TS Handmade can't fit into your remaining 8lbs of stash space.
---
It asked which of the given options is the largest. It was a turtle, a garden snake, the giant salamander, and I think another turtle
---
 People should try having some self respect and live in a home that doesn't look like a shitty fort you drew in your notebook in 5th grade and tried to build out of scrap materials behind your house in the woods and then immediately abandoned after like half a day of work.
---
lol, all they need to do is stop allowing a widespread, unavoidable bug from launch 
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Lol it isn't that its harsh.  Nor is it that I lost junk and caps and now I'm sad.  It's that I get a few hours every few nights to play.  I dont feel I should have to deal with players exploiting this weeks loop hole to make those hours less enjoyable.  Nor do I believe there should be a system in place, core or not, that rewards them for making my game experience less enjoyable.  Especially when the developers made an entire mode specifically for killing each other and taking each others loot.  Sorry, not sorry.
---
Bethesda must be rolling like dirty pigs in all that fake money they're making off of us from the tax.
---
It hasn't happened, but I'd be lying if the thought didn't cross my mind.  That there's some potential gaffe Bethesda failed to account for that will allow others to access and take stuff from your stash.
---
How long are you waiting? 
---
Is it a huge camp? It can take a few minutes before even my dinky 2x2 camp loads in sometimes. 
---
Have you tried going into build mode in the area that your camp should be in? is there anything in the "stored" section?
---
I obviously don't know their code, but it seems like you could give both dirty water and purifier water a base type of "water" and have recipes that just need that base type. Then the ones that need purified water specifically could require that specific type. Seems odd to have a distinction between them for everything. Water is water.
---
Interesting... I will definitely be looking into this! Hopefully I hear back from some more people as to wether or not it‚Äôs across the map! (Maybe your just a lucky soul and liberty prime has blessed you with increased damage for killin the commies) if this is true though my instigating black powder rifle plus 2.5x sneak damage is gonna one shot anything in my path üòÇ
---
I think people would be less frustrated if they gave more obvious instructions instead of hiding part of the quest in the challenges. If someone didn‚Äôt mention it on this sub I‚Äôd have no idea where to look. 
---
Where am I supposed to find these exams? 
---
Also, the restrictiveness of the challenges is pretty frustrating. Plenty of people have already posted at length the problems with solo and multiplayer missions. 
---
Last, I think they need to implement random target areas for the insects. If everyone is constantly going to the same locations it‚Äôll be impossible to find a damn bloodbug proboscis. It took me 3 hours today to find a single bloodbug because all the ones in the normal locations were either killed or, suddenly after months of being bloodbugs, were some other creature. 
---
I like longer quests that take time and thought to complete but hiding instructions, making it grindy, and forcing players into multiplayer just doesn‚Äôt do it for me.
---
Most fun I've had in a long time for this game.  I had a blast doing these last night with a buddy.  Don't think it would have been nearly as enjoyable (for me) if I was solo.  Something really dumb and fun running around together in lower leveled areas just spamming crossbows and then spamming mini-nukes everywhere.  Super rewarding once we got our backpacks too.    
---
Exams were fine for me.  Only had to look up a few things on the tatpople tests and passed most on the first try.  I too enjoy trivia and learned a couple things in the process.  A lot of the clearly wrong answer options were things we found to be pretty amusing and I'm looking forward to the possum ones.  
---
The frustrating part though was that several parts to the challenges involved things that are either bugged and don't register or stuff we didn't know how to get/make (photos or instruments not registering, smores, and stim diffusers - which I've since learned about).  Due to this, it felt like some time was wasted but I figure they'll be fixed eventually and the progressing those challenges won't be a waste, in the long run.
---
Yeah. And if not i don't understand how i can have 4, when i done only 2challenges.
---
There should be such a display board. Same with everything else in the game. You should have the opportunity to showcase your weapons or your power armor in your camp, so you can flex on players that come by. 
---
I'd love to customize my camp with stuff i collected
---
Can always hope it‚Äôs legendary mods at high cost. 
---
Get the feeling we will have just another version of the monster mash!
---
I had no idea I could change my spawn like that, thanks!
---
My only issue is my camps are always enormous in width so it always touches the middle. I‚Äôll have to figure out a workaround til it‚Äôs changed
---
Thanks :)
---
The Post Apocolypse needs shady going ons, keeps the world interesting. Keep up the good work:)
---
maybe from the daily?
---
Nope check the patch notes they say there was a miscommunication.
---
excellent idea.  I was thinking a cooler or something, but trash can is much better
---
See I've never understood the need of plastic to bulk to begin with most boxes are either wood are metal and would make much more sense
---
Yeah, i realize that now, feeling a bit embarrassed, lol
---
No ider what that thing under there was :D
---
But i'm not against caps sinks :D  I think it's a great idea to combat inflation.
---
What console are you on? I think ive only ever found the pipfall game.
---
Oh heck... Maybe get better this nice fisher outfit from Whitespring then lol
---
Did you update your INI file?  
---
If so Disable all your mods, reenable one by one, until you find it, it is one of them
---
Yeah. I got pretty frustrated because the ticks are in a building with a workbench. So I‚Äôm guessing it happens a lot. Might have been nice to need actual quest items.
---
That means your stash is full, all items
---
for sale are tied to your stash..the item
---
you're trying to sell is in your personal
---
inventory. When you try and mark it for
---
sale the game has to put it in your stash
---
So if you're at 792/800 and you try and add
---
a 12lb TS Handmade to your vendor it will
---
say camp budget is full because the 121b
---
TS Handmade can't fit into your remaining
---
8lbs of stash space
---
The amusement park in south west sells them as well if memory serves.
---
ohh its barely valid, and Beth definitely shouldnt be requiring it of players.  its just the pragmatic answer to your question
---
Definitely seen them alive at the freak show

Try grind event: campfire tales i think there is chance for badge
---
I've spoken with a community manager, they are looking into the OverRepair issue
---
I just wish it was a separate stash. That would put my mind at ease. But I understand that would probably cause more problems.
---
There's no questline for the Possum rank sadly. You just get the currency badges which you spend on the Possum level plans in the vendor (Extra carry weight, refrigeration, damage resistance, etc).
---
Those people should rather have to pay daily fees
---
Yeah I had the exact same issue earlier! Good luck! If you are lazy like me, just go to the big tea pot and server hop until a corpse spawns on one of the three tables.
---
\*blushes\*
---
Doesn't the quest shows the exact spot where you can find each of the critters required for it?
---
They were left out of the patch notes originally and added later.
---
And we appreciate it.
---
oh im sorry then, just thought you might have assumed it didnt work
---
i wonder how this could have been a "miscommunication" i have in mind they stated that pretty clearly
---
i just hate how every time bethesda makes major improvements with the game however seem to struggle with the same problems of misleading or lack in foresight since release
---
Oh c‚Äômon the Hornwright Executive questionnaire is hilarious.
---
I can help
---
Do what I can, being an addict and all myself ;)

Thanks so much

Which weapons do u have..there's never enough
---
Yea it can be a pain. It's just something that I have observed on my 400 hours of play time.
---
Lol. Anyone who says all nerfs are bad are kidding themselves. Things get nerfed for a reason. Contrary to popular belief in games like this there is such a thing as items/tactics/items interacting with each other being too synergistic or over performing. And it promotes a healthy game to tone that shit back.
---
Is every nerf done right? HELL NO. I can think of easily a couple dozen examples in the past 10 years of turning the dials WAY too far in the other direction, and leaving them there. This nerf though? Nah. Its beautifully done IMO.
---
I've had the exact opposite results, with the Seller near by I could,'once they fast traveled away, I could not
---
I did, I'm gonna run through them all here later on today and see what's up.  Thanks for the reply!
---
I know thats what i also think but i just want to answer most polite as possible.
---
Quests aren't tr he only thing. Try exploring and learning new lore. Its very interesting. Or even try out some pvp, make another character based solely around killing others. With this new update, Pvp is completely different and more balanced, so its worth giving it a shot
---
They need to add an actual mini fallout shelter under Misc. Items tab. If your camp gets nuked whatever is in it survives and any crops you have on the outside are turned to nuked flora. Would produce some interesting builds in nuke heavy areas.
---
I definitely agree, but to be fair, that was just fan service.  *WE* are the ones who call them "three star legendaries" not bethesda.  so they just changes the in game symbol to match what the unwashed masses call it.
---
Ya I did but those times it failed I was still out in the lake, each time at that particular buoy, so I tried ending on a different one and it worked.
---
It is in fact no new thing its been used time and time again in other games and what it does is make the people selling from their vending machines increase their price by 10% which means anyone who is not selling through their machine but instead uses reddit or what have you, can sell at the actual price its worth. Hence keeping that economy alive and well.
---
I remade my camp last night at 2 am. Had no problem with stacking half walls
---
Doesnt matter if players have to build houses that way in order to move their camps without having any trouble. They still look ugly as hell.
---
lol, just did the same thing, couldn't find it :)
---
Don't think we can karma here
---
They should add a purified water to boiled water recipe.
---
For the hand pump you can actually press drink, then rapidly collect the water while it's pumping.
---
Whats your gamertag?
---
Liberty prime giveth and liberty prime taketh away. :) I‚Äôm sure what ever this is, I probably shouldn‚Äôt grow too attached.
---
yeeted = a new perk coming soon, just throw mini nukes like grenades.
---
Kinda wish each vendor machine just added a cap to max items. Rather than looking through 4 machines.
---
same, this vendor update was pretty neat. I made more money and met more players than I ever had. Cause of all the feel good vibes; Helped repair some workshops and defend them from raiders . I feel like I'm gonna go back to RP brotherhood of steel now than being a raider dick. I met so many people at their little stores- it humanized player interaction in a new way. One player in particular had this cute little house. I had tore them apart a month ago and seeing where they lived and how much care went into it .. I dunno I turned over a new leaf. odd but game got a lot of depth now and be dimensions.

It's a pain in the ass. Don't consider it as a new "floor", think of it as a catwalk. Everything hangs off that first set of stairs until you build a second one. 
---
To add another anchor the stairs must snap from a floor on the previous level (foundation for the ground level). Just because the stairs appear at ground doesn't mean they are anchored there.
---
I recommend building the stairs first then connecting the catwalk to the new level afterwards to ensure it anchors correctly.
---
Hope this helped

Then use perks to increase decay time. Gather items as you go. Grow your own food then. One pass with green thumbs and my own camp I can create half a dozen sweet tato stews that last me a while. Rad stags are so common and there are hard spawn points I effortlessly get the meat to keep weight carry up. The second most sold items I have besides junk to vendors is my over abundance of food.
---
Hi, is there more than one vendor, the one I'm at doesn't sell mods.. Sorry if this is a stupid question üòÇ

you might have the option selected that only shows what you can build if you have the mats. if you don't have the mats and it's not selected then it won't be visible

---
I guess I can understand your frustration. I've had two sets of T-60 power armor disappear out of my inventory due to a glitch that, as far as I'm aware, is still in the game. I filed a support ticket, but still haven't looked at the results because I have no hope that the devs will be willing/able to solve that problem... The only reason my gaming experience wasn't thoroughly ruined by this, was only because of a Good Samaritan who donated a fully modded set of power armor to me after I reddit-whined about it. I suppose I had just gotten over the CAMP gripes because I hadn't experienced a new way for my camp to be taken away since they fixed most of the CAMP issues. Sorry for your losses, bro. Truly. I know how much time, effort, and love goes into those things.

Thank you. I‚Äôll be off at 5:30pm. Should be home at 6ish and then I‚Äôll log in if my wife doesn‚Äôt have anything for me to do ( please the wife she pleases you....or let‚Äôs you play fo76 all day after work)
---
That's what they did, yep.
---
I don't know how that percentage stacks though.  Like, if one fails, can another proc instead?  And if it does, is it for the full 15%, or a fraction like it would be if both did?
---
For all practical intents and purposes, I'm a bit more spongey now than I was before.  That's fine by me.
---
Heck I have to move camp to change structure.  Blasted unsupported errors block me.
---
I cant wait to start throwing stones
---
I've waited about 15 minutes on each server, it wont even show up on the map. it's just gone

Didn't know.  Whats the rate/math etc?  Seems to be fine now that they are locked.

---
Shut the hell up you are not weird this game is awesome
---
Thanks, will give out free missile launcher
---
Thats actually a very interesting idea.  like prefab fallout shelter pieces, when sealed, everything within survives a nuke dropping.  i think we'd start to see people making camps specifically for flux collection / queen fighting, etc
---
Still learning camp build tricks so dumb question, why stack half walls?
---
I already have it at max rank :)
---
&gt; Yeah. I got pretty frustrated because the ticks are in a building with a workbench. So I‚Äôm guessing it happens a lot. Might have been nice to need actual quest items.  
---
That is exactly what happened to me, and they were the last component. I just rage-quit and haven't played since.
---
So key question here:
---
Why should the seller need to be near? Does this not defeat the entire point of the thing?
---
Lame lol why is this at the top of my feed,
---
If Liberty prime was put in F76 he should do something useful, get a smoke gernade and the basically invinible robot drops from orbit to aid you.
---
IE: fighting scorch beast queen or imposter sheep squatch
---
it counted?
---
All mods BP's including that and calibrated shocks.  Off to nuke some  violet plants.
---
awesome thanks man.  let me know if you need anything
---
&gt; Shut the hell up
---
Ruh roh raggy, here we go!

&gt;you are not weird this game is awesome

Oh, false alarm

Players logging out could be because of reaching their Cap Max limit, this happened to me very quickly last night on my plan Vendor, I had over 20k in sales in about 30 minutes.

That's what it defaults to.

They are good if u a rifle build..+2 perception üòÄ

no problem. have fun!
---
Well, if it didn't happen now, it was going to inevitably happen later.  Their stated intention was to basically force the worse case scenario, from a balancing standpoint, to see what shook out.  They haven't taken off the table things like seasons or an eventual fresh start.
---

It's a horrible idea, it means you have a free fast travel across the whole map in theory!

People don‚Äôt seem to get the point
---
It does but Someone has already been to most and killed said critter and nothing else on site.
---
No one *has* to do anything, if people want to hoard &gt;25k caps over multiple characters so be it but don‚Äôt moan about it like it‚Äôs some hardship, it‚Äôs not the way the game is meant to be played.
---
get a bunch of debuffs to reduce your intelligence as much as possible. That should help minimize the crafted condition bonus.
---
Also in helvetia, where the fasnacht event was.. usually by the riverbed
---
But okay I understand all this perk card talk but personal I change my perk cards a lot but I never keep just one on the same I wouldn‚Äôt waste perk space for that perk tbh
---
Yeah, what happened to the good ol‚Äô GOAT format? :)
---
It can be kind of a grind, but there‚Äôs things to do. Try to top survival, hunt for legendarys, try some new events, launch a couple nukes, sell some stuff, complete some challenges, build your base, explore everywhere. Honestly I kind of get obsessed with a goal, spend like a week or so on it, get bored, and move on to the next goal. There‚Äôs a lot to do, but you also have to kind of make it happen. Much funner if you have someone to play with imo.
---
Id love this.
---
My vendor stations have been surprisingly active, but Ive missed a few notifications peeing and such.
---
It's be nice for pricing as well. See what's selling and if I can charge more, see what's not selling as quick and lower them. 
---
I've filled and restocked all 3 of my stations probably 3 times over just a few hours, so it'd be super helpful for profits
---
‚ô´Zombie...zombie...zombie...‚ô´

Friend, what platform are you on?
---
Try to build at your camp spot. Will it let you? It may have put everything in your stored tab in the build menu. Some spots are no longer campable due to being new nukashine wake up spots.
---
I managed to do the frog one
---
If a refrigerator addition wants to make you uninstall the game, then I'd suggest you see how others have reacted towards it. It's just like any of the other adjustments made in other updates, not everyone is 100% happy with all of the changes/additions. If it's a game breaker in your mind, and playing with this will be an issue. Then it's unlikely you'll continue playing. There's no requirement that you have to use it, so perhaps you could ignore this point of disagreement and enjoy the game anyway.
---
I never lock my water purifiers
---
Just out of curiosity, why did you sell it?  You could have traded it for pretty much anything you wanted in the trading circles.  TSE isn't quite as good as it once was, but that's still a god roll gauss rifle.

Yea it would need to be very limited space though or it would be kinda OP. Like maybe room for 1 small generator and a few benches. Power wouldnt be able to go through the walls. Everything inside survives, everything outside is nuked. Have the bunker itself drop as a rare plan from the queen and crafting cost quite a bit of stable flux.
---
Collectors!
---
Just take it to as low HP as you can with anything else and then finish it off with syringer
---
I only see mention of prime and .50 cal receivers on the hunting rifle. No mention of lever, Handmade, etc. that I can see.
---
Where is it?
---
You cannot use them yet. Legendary vendor is set to come on 16th May
---
But 3 start stuff if it's cheap... Easy scrip
---
Ah that‚Äôs going to be difficult for some because they built right on top of their camp placement. I place mine and usually don‚Äôt move it and build away from it, so I‚Äôve never had these problems with visitors.
---
Yeah I can do that, I'm working Friday but I finish early so should have some time then
---
There will be a Legendary Vender added in a upcoming patch where you'll be able to spend the scripts at.
---
But like no
---
Yeah, I have done this on two characters before the vendors at Whitesprings were implemented.  It's a fun journey.  I was able to complete it with both, though both were a bit higher level - the first was in mid 30s, though that one had no ranks in sneak at all,  the second had full sneak and I  ran it in low 20s level. Both times I had to hide/flee from Scorchbeasts...good times.
---
Pay for convenience items like this are a great way for BGS to make money and ensure we get content long term....
---
I'd like to play 76 for a good long wbile., So how bout don't listen to the OP.
---
But it still gave off milk eventually? How did that taste?
---
Then don't shutdown
---
Thanks. I think its a bummer we don't at least get a free Possum Uniform.
---
How it should work:
---
When a vending machine is placed, there should be a requirement to have a certain distance cleared from the front of the vending machine. So, when a player fast travels to your vending machine, they spawn right in front of it, inside that clear area.
---

I haven't done water yet, but I got the basic revive a teammate almost immediately when someone triggered imposter sheepsquatch. TONS of people constantly going down and calling for help.
---
There's a pond there so you could get lucky and do both at once.
---
Ya, good point. Curious to see how the legendary vendor works!
---
The righteous BS indignation you display is ludicrous. Bethesda NEVER said they were going to add refrigeration into the atom shop. Sure they did themselves a disservice by stating they were looking into refrigeration in the same article as they were announcing repair kits but it was a separate paragraph, dissassociating the 2. The fact that they added it into the game via backpacks undermine your ridiculessness. 
---
I skimmed the replies. I heard your argument about keeping food in your stash. Frankly it's idiotic. How you've played the game is a wonder. The downtime of cooking food and then traversing to a stash or conversely the cost of placing down yout camp just to cook and store food is all food rotting time. And "not playing" time. This is the way you want to play, fine. But to gin up conspiracies that are demonstrably false as REFRIGERATION IS IN THE GAME FOR FREE! is asinine. 
---
Repair kits are bull, are pay to win (albeit in the most minimal of sense) and a betrayal of their promises. This I agree on. But to say their going to add refrigeration into the atom shop just because the "outrage lynch mob" strung two disparate statements together (or you yourself has)... Well I hope it causes a much needed premature coronary. It begs of the lunch box/loot box "controversy, or of the many others that have failed to materialized. All because someone didn't get a pretty enough bag.
---
Or.... you could create an lfg post and ask someone to help you and then return the favor.
---
Some people just want everything for free and will invent 1 out of 18383 scenarios to try to spin this or the repair kit as a paid advantage.
---

Yeah hell no.

There's no way I'll take the super-slow 4-legger with me across the wasteland for me to either:

a. Not carry anything valuable

b. Get my cow one-shot exploded all over the street by some PvP boi and take all of my hard-earned loot for him to get a measly 500-ish caps bounty and server hop to quickly sell the stuff in his own shops for much more value than his own bounty.
---
Reminds me of the Fel Reaver in WoW.

This was awful for me. I got one down to no visible HP and still had to pop an Overdrive and shoot it 10 times to finish it.
---
Yeah. I want to force a Dev to make the game better. 
---
Not cry over pay for convenience items....
---
Id rather have a seperate item that sets the spawn point. You shouldnt have to use it but having the opportunity if you wish to do so would be nice
---
Thanks for the heads up my man
---
Liberty City
---
I think it depends on if they get knocked down or killed.
---
Just playing on my own there are a bunch of times where I can call for help, and others where I can only respawn.
---
Can't revive a dead person, only a critically injured person.
---
Mine too.
---
That's a thought, make some low level pimped out guns for new folks.to buy.
---
Did they say removing the extra dmg for higher condition is a bug? I have an anti armor buzz blade that seriously shreds but it really drops off with &lt;150% condition :(
---
Okay, i mean this is the most genuine way possible and am no way insuating anything but...
---
Have you interacted with the hand scanner?
---
No such thing as dumb questions, friend! :) The half-wall trick is actually pretty useful for building some cool-looking stuff like fireplaces or ‚Äúcustomer service counters‚Äù in front of your shop. The trick: stack two half-walls, add a roof/ floor piece once you‚Äôre done with the roof/second story, then remove the bottom half-wall (you must have a roof/floor piece on top of the half-walls before you can remove one or else you will get an error message). Hope this answers your question! Happy building! :)
---
if you see them for this much, buy them all, then resell them to vendors for 450.
---
this is the exact reason I sell mine for 1000
---
Weight limit?
---
I have 8 industrial and while they may take longer to fill due to the shared space, it means that I don't have to visit my CAMP all the time to empty them. I can come back after an hour or two and collect them.
---
Could still place there, and i didn't get anything in stored. It's like the game just deleted everything
---
Is it only two ranks?  I was hoping we‚Äôd have some Eagle Scouts running around next year.
---
This update has changed the entire in-game economy.  No more legendary items at Whitesprings vendors, commodity items are getting a lot cheaper, no more free ammo dumps, and I think it will take weeks to settle out into more stable pricing.  
---
My policy is to price things at the rate I believe I would pay for them if I stumbled across them at a vendor and it was something that I wanted/needed.  Some things marked up a bit to test the market that will drop over time, some things selling for cheap to get them out of my inventory.  
---
I also have a wall sign indicating things I'm looking for, so players that might have those things can arrange a trade.
---
You need the Home Defense perk card, and the Ecience perk if you're doing laser turrets.
---
Um... We call it that because they come from "started" enemies... Something Bethesda definitely made...
---
Go to the fasnacht area, helvetia. There were tons there during that event. May still be some spawns there.
---
Ive been trying that with no luck.  the syringer does pretty much no damage.  ill give it another go
---
Same as other vendors, \~20 hours.
---
Happy Cake Day HappyCamper781! You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
---
It's a bug... 
---
Unintentional as it clearly would defeat the purpose!
---
Yes. I‚Äôve got the quest to work on my other character too and that one can enter fine.
---
I'm playing solo and not having nearly as hard a time as most people here. Most events will give you the opportunity to revive someone.
---
Yep, developer of weightlifting and inventor of scouts life here, former shoe cleaner to the president's shoe and I can swim with no limbs. Questions were no trouble for the likes of me
---
The statement was 'the more weapons and armor you will be able to buy' in the latest news.  Older quotes did include other wording though, but can you really trust what Todd says? :P
---
I can't quite figure out what the best way to do this from a game standpoint would be, nothing except blind random items (ala Diablo 2) comes to mind.  Random, if a single set per day/week and not the same for others (but not something you can server hop to change) would work, but that's a fair bit of code to juggle.  Set items, like the survival ones, would just homogenate everyone into the same gear all around (more or less).
---
Don't think so, I have 21 free in my stash and those weapons are each around 2 due to perks.
---
Yes I get that but it is a shotgun for God‚Äôs sake it‚Äôs suppose to be double just bring it back to what it was and be done with it don‚Äôt do anything else
---
That's what the little pluses or minuses next to the gear name are - a comparison to what you have equipped. Highlight something and they will pop up.
---
If you don't want to waste space for the perk card then don't complain. That is like me complaining about how I can't carry 4 heavy weapons because I can't waste perk space for bear arms perk.  Or complaining I can't pick a lock because I can't waste space on lock picking perks. 
---
The game gives you options to use. If you fail to utilize them then it is your own fault. On top of that food is extremely easy to come by. So it isn't like you have to struggle to get food.
---
hey, looking for someone too :) add me, ign brenerd
---
I think people who dont want others to drink their water have already locked theirs lol.
---
Upgrade it to bleeder barrel.
---
Robot, bos, raider plans spawn at Hornwright Estate use keycard elevator up then left, lockpick, the plans on desk. If not the plan you want do not touch but Server hop until the plan you want spawns there.
---
It was my seventh idea/attempt. There were many fruitless deaths. Deep water was bad.
---
Good Faith Reply; Confused about what?
---
sure, but since the number of "stars" is unrelated to the number on the enemy, it stands to reason that Beth thinks they are the same thing   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Allowing the stairs (also bring back half stairs) to snap to the 1/2 and 1/4 flooring pieces would also be a live saver. They also need three snap spots, left, middle, right. It was so much nicer in F4 being able to build a corner hugging staircase using two half stairs the quarter piece

Selling a Toad Eye for 15,000

this. after selling a few items.. I wish I had a history of what I have sold.

Tried this yesterday but it made me start a fresh for some reason.  I've finished it now though and was was just venting steam
---
Happy to help, crappy issue, really hope they fix it quick
---
Idk why but this reminded me of Mega Maid from Spaceballs.
---
Your perks do not work in stash. If someone has 1/2 weight in your inventory due to perk then it will be back to normal full weight in stash
---
You have to revive an "ally" not a team mate. Which is any non-aggro player.
---
And it has to be in water, not under water. So streams and puddles work.
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch is a super easy place to get both done.
---
Ah cool, thank you I'll have to try that now lol
---
Perks don‚Äôt effect your stash. If the weapons are 25lbs before perks the stash considers them 25lbs.
---
Sometimes I think the stash just requires a little extra room like if I have 10 lb vacant and I try to put a 9 lb object in there it'll tell me my stash is full.
---
Nope stash is not affected via perks. And your Gatling actually wights around 24lbs. Not 2
---
S/SE of Huntersville there's almost always a small pack.  Right by the BoS graves.
---
Look at world challenges - Possum. There seems to be no guidance though.
---
absolutely.  maybe the size of the large tent
---
They didn't confirm the removal was intentional, which makes me think it was accidental or someone snuck in an unapproved change
---
I've been saying ammo should be capable of being bulked into an 'ammo box' for a while now.  This is what the ammo vendors in the game world should sell, since nobody in their right mind looking for ammo is going to buy individual bullets from these vendors for like 20 caps a piece. 
---
Bulked ammo boxes seem like a much better solution, since they could contain different amounts of ammo dependent on the type of ammo.  The more easily-crafted, or accessible the ammo, the higher the box contains.  So a 5mm, .38, and .50 would have like 100-200 rounds per box, but something like .308 or 5.56 might only have 60-75 rounds in it.
---
I feel it‚Äôs pretty obvious that if I‚Äôm giving something out for free when i have the option to sell at market rate, that I‚Äôm expecting someone to take it because they are in need, and not because i expect them to pocket the 2k.
---
I‚Äôd argue that grabbing from charity and reselling for a profit is kind of a dick move.  Then again, i see people do this all the time with hand-outs and charities for poor people, so I really shouldn‚Äôt be surprised.

I'm on PS4. I've never seen anyone do Free Range, ever, when it pops up when I'm playing.
---
It's because the fandom gatekeepers don't believe in the "crafting-exploring-survival" meta.  To them, it's all about story, conversations, moral choices, and deciding the fate of the wasteland.
---
The thing is, they don't really accept that decisions can exist without an explicit prompt, and that's a fundamental tenet of the way Bethesda designs their open worlds.  Take Skyrim for example.  One of their many criticisms of Skyrim is how you can join every Guild in the land.  How implausible, they complain.  How can your character be an expert at everything?  How is that role-playing?
---
Well, how about you choose *not to don't do that?*  That's an option, right?
---
Maybe Player A wants to see it all.  Maybe Player B wants to be a Warrior and a Mage.  Maybe all Player C cares about is being a Thief.  That's all on you.  You be what you want to be, you set the rules you want to set.

I live the same way.

If you manage to find my camp, come in and rest. Grab some water and fix your gear. Play an instrument for the bonus and be on your way. No locked doors anymore.

Mole rats. Those frikkin‚Äô things are everywhere.
---
I noticed that the challenge actually says ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù milk them. That says to me that failure or inability was expected. It seems Bethesda didn‚Äôt want people to run to Flatwoods and do it quickly.
---
Or as we found out you can also accidentally aggro 20 ghouls, a couple bears, and a scorchbeast there all at once and see how it goes.
---
Seriously the ripper and buzz blade are unusable without it!

LOL, what idiot would spend caps on water?

I only sell plans and tend to seek them a quarter of the asking price so it‚Äôs a pain having to move it all the way down

In this case the option to milk appears but nothing happens at all when you press the command and the option continues to be there. You see it happen with wild plants sometimes too.
---
Ok, so it does spoile eventually. What I would like for my Camp is a freezer. Where I could store some of the food that takes some effort to cook up. And it never spoils before you take it out again.
---
I am on PC ... game name "Jeffah24"   
---
Feel free to add me as a friend.  I'm more than willing to travel to your CAMP and help you with any build issues you may be having or any ideas you need to make happen.  I've spent countless hours in this game learning and figuring out how to do pretty much anything I can come up with in the build system. :)  There is never a need to disassemble an entire floor to correct something as simple as stairs.
---
Either collectors or maybe in hopes that we'll get functional shelves to display their junk collection in a future update.
---
The bright side its less of a trip buying plans, and might make mods rarer and easier to farm to resell since the plans are pretty pricey.
---
Same reason you don't build a church for Easter and Christmas. If on average you only need x VMs spun up and they can be hosted on y virtual cores, you don't want to be paying for y\*2 all the time; you'd prefer that the existing instances fight over the y cores you've allocated, or at most the y\*1.25 you've budgeted for.  
---
The problem with a big update like this is the "y" they've so carefully calculated and budgeted for is no longer accurate. Players bouncing around servers bringing up vending machine inventories means pulling a lot more arbitrary data and passing it off to more clients. After a while they'll figure out a new value for y and things will be stable again...until Nuclear Winter comes.
---
This would be a ridiculous idea, everyone will disagree on some prices all you can do is suggest prices when someone asks
---
No, it wouldn't.  If you're travelling all the way across the map for 50 caps, the fake shop would get 5 caps per visitor and there's only 24 players on a server.  If you even just sold duplicate plans for 200 caps a piece, you'd make more from one sale (200 - 200 / 10 = 180 caps) than you would from every single person on a server falling for your clever trick (23 &amp; 5 = 115 caps).
---
I have one out of four unlocked just incase anybody comes buy as I don't mind helping out a player if they need it.
---
No but refrigerator should be in the base game that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to make across okay I‚Äôm just saying that
---
Someone had the mod for an X01 jet pack for sale for 700c, I quickly bought it and put it up in my machine later on for 2500c...it sold almost immediately. I spent 10k on 4 rare outfits, sold two of them off fo 5k a piece the same day, so I made my caps back and got to keep 2 of the outfits.
---
Every "business" purchase I make, I consider a gamble. I'm putting my caps up for something and hoping to get a return on them. Free market allows for consumers to make a decision on a price and if they feel it's fair. I was able to turn 2k caps into 10k caps in an hour yesterday. God bless Appalachia.
---
Upvoted because I really want this answer as well. /u/valseek ?
---
I thought it was well known that the damage boost from over repairing was a bug. It never worked for ranged weapons and the perk card makes no reference to performance improvements...
---
Hmm thats nice to prevent immortality, but I always thought that the gears gave bonus defenses for standing or running not be a chance thing like mysterious stranger/savior perk cards or life saving gear. Still, though they should have tweaked anti armor automatics while doing this change too.
---
You will know soon enough. In 8 days tops.
---
Is it banditry when the owners don't lock them?
---
Are you trying to stack half walls, or are full walls floating for you? 
---
Half walls are pretty messed up for me. Can't stack 'em, or put a slanted wall on top of them. Really frustrating.
---
Now I can‚Äôt wait get off work and log in
---
I suppose it is quite subjective. They might sell low level items for beginners, which higher level players may rate negatively, and vice versa. The only thing I can imagine being fairly rated is the prices the vendor is selling their items at, and whether they are overpriced.
---
That would be cool... would be neat that if it lost power your stuff would start to lose condition again.
---
Weird, I use a controller and if I connect it from the wrong end I jump cuz Y is jump and also connect, so annoying.
---
All mine are in the machine for 150c. I knew there was a reason I had people coming en masse for serums
---
To be fair, you can already opt for +200 carry with excavator and calibrated shocks.  Non-PA users now have +60 with backpacks.
---
That being said, it would be cool if there was some kind of storage benefit for PA folks.  Maybe some small satchel mods for legs or a fanny pack for a torso piece.  LOL.  It would look ridiculous, but an extra 20-30 carry would make excavator hoarders happy.
---
I thought that was kind of what they were wanting as answers because some of the choices were so goofy
---
Picked it up today along with the xo1 shocks as I'm near my cap limit best way to keep it down
---
It would keep ppl from having to refill the machine. Especially on an AFK character. Sorry, thoughts like this are why we can't have nice things.
---
Now you do, if you can buy the plans
---
Well that is why I said people doing it are guinea pig beta testers and free labor for bethesda. I just wish survival environment didn't feel like rust/dayz were its shoot everyone on sight and be more like you have the option to shoot on sight but don't have to. Kinda like rdr online were you can make alliances go to a fort and defend it from other players kind of thing for fun, etc. The aid lost just too much of a penalty to go on my main character.
---
Go on the Fallout twitter and it should be posted on one of their most recent tweets.
---
I know, right?  Should I dump it all in the hopper or not? 
---
Given the daily limits, this is a real question.  I'd hate to hold back a few hundred in script only to come up short on trading day because the item I want is 1000 and there are no rerolls to save for....
---
And if the inventory is random, I could be facing that furious fast fire rifle I've wanted to the first and last time.  Suuuuucks....
---
Won't ever happen.
---
One spawn for Ansel with the camera is right outside the Whitespring entrance, on the red car you pass just before you go inside (main entrance, not the bunker or the train station).  He's draped across the hood of the car if he's there.
---
Try server hopping there for a bit, see if it comes up for you.
---
well, if they were looking at rifle damage then I assumed that would mean am assistant across the board but maybe that's me. it seems whenever they mess with something they do it as a whole but whatever, either we can accept that everyone is experiencing an increase in rifle damage as the accounts pour in or we can scratch our heads. They never specifically said rifle damage was increasing across the board specifically. however, seems to be a trend here with stealth nerfs and buffs
---
Is this a joke?!
---
People trying the game out again. People also testing old exploits to see if they're back. The first week on a new patch is pretty rough
---
Nope!!!!
---
Helgen
---
Tfw the misterious savior probably already has more badges than me
---
Is a perfectly preserved pie that I am selling 25k caps for too much?
---
For $60, a season better be about 6 months, that's 120 a year as it is. Lol
---
Capitalism helps another poor soul make it out in the world
---
Scout Master Touchie: "Being a good person is it's own reward son."
---
What for??
---
The problem I have with that is I don‚Äôt want people just spawning in front of it and leaving. Many of us spend a lot of time on presentation and building our camps to look nice for visitors. I‚Äôd prefer it if it would treat spawning guests similar to how the camp owner spawns, just outside of the camp. That way we can do cooler things with vendor placements and whatnot
---
I'd take it if you're on Xbox
---
You're entering the toughest stretch of the game, for sure. Levels 20-35ish are kinda weird. You can probably dispatch most things in the Forest with ease but if you head west you'll get your ass handed to you. My best advice is to grind levels in the Forest and/or Toxic Valley by exploring and killing enemies or doing events.
---
Maybe consider getting a good melee weapon so you can take out the lower level mobs without wasting ammo. I prefer power fists and deathclaw gauntlets but I don't know if they're available at your level. Maybe try a fire axe if you find one. I would also strongly recommend getting some points into charisma and maxing out Lone Wanderer as soon as you can. It's a straight damage reduction which is better than any armor you can get and the AP regen is very helpful as well.
---
Just got the last one I needed from there!
---
I used the .50 mg until it had around 1% health then spammed with the syringer. Worked a treat.
---
If I assume this challenge is like the collect all copies of magazines then I don't know if picking the wing from a bag or player would count. And you might have to get it off a dead mothman you helped kill. But, if I'm wrong which would be good cause hunting one down going be lot server hopping I could see people start selling quest items in their vending machines for a pretty cap.
---
Hey are you on xbox?
---
Me too
---
Ya i can help
---
It's possible for your CAMP beacon to end up underneath the Wooden Foundations, if you didn't move it, you should find it at the center of your build area.
---
I wanted to know so I could throw one at my feet for the douchebag who has a vending machine but builds a locked cage at his spawn point :-) I don‚Äôt want to have a bounty for picking his lock so I spawned at a nearby location, threw my orbital beacon &amp; skipped away
---
Is anybody else on Xbox experiencing the game not loading after this patch?  
---
I haven't bothered to play in a week, so I don't know if this is tied to the patch or not.
---
I have two characters with 4 fully stocked vending machines. There‚Äôs a little bit of everything in them and it‚Äôs all selling. Plans are by far the most popular item, but there seems to be a buyer for everything. It seems that player builds and preferences are much more varied than Reddit would lead us to believe. 
---
I think there‚Äôs also a lot of people who just like seeing cool CAMP setups and buy stuff just because it‚Äôs there.
---
How do you infer he exploited, when he claims he datamined it?
---
Or you can keep it and have even more carry weight
---
But who really cares that much..
---
I don‚Äôt even have room for everything
---
Oh thanks but I already got it done. if you still need I can help you out
---
Don‚Äôt even get me started on stranger blooms lol. I can never find those bastards. Just being able to plant everything would be tremendously helpful to all the veterans who know what they want to craft and want to craft it in bulk.
---
If this is for the challenge you can‚Äôt get traded it :-/ I tried only picking it up naturally
---
This is strange. I uninstalled this game last year, and decided to install today because of the update. And I got the lookup failed even tho I deleted my custom ini months ago when I uninstalled the game. I dont even have a custom ini. Unless there's another besides the one in my documents I wasn't aware of. I didnt even install any mods or anything, just a fresh bethesda launcher install and then a fresh 76 install and bam, lookup failed. \*shruggs shoulders \*
---
Bethesda will not make as much money from this method. So I‚Äôm gonna guess that‚Äôs a no.
---
I couldn't agree with you more!  Just last night I was saying to my teammates that we keep completing new content so fast we're done in a matter of a couple hours after it is released .... and now they've finally given us a whole slew of new things to do that are actually challenging and/or time consuming.  Most nights I find myself getting bored early and wondering "what can I do now?"  Last night I looked at the clock and realized I had been working on these challenges for 6 hours without even feeling the time pass!  It was awesome!  Were there frustrations doing them?  Yes ... but that's good!  I didn't buy this game so I could sit back in my chair and let it play itself for me. Keep up this kind of content, BGS! :)
---
You can buy the plans to make calibrated shocks at:
---
T-series = Phoenix in Watoga
---
Raider = Resin in Pleasant Valley Lodge
---
Excavator = any vendor in the Ash Heap
---
X-01 = Enclave Bunker (need General level clearance)
---
I either want to be able to reroll stars or pick a base item type and how many stars I want, and get random stuff on it.
---
Forget that other guy, I'm your cool PC connection.
---
theres several mods for fallout 4 that are power armor backpacks.  it could easily be shamelessly ripped of like so many other things, to make a plan for 76 PA.  hell they could even introduce a scout themed Power armor entire.
---
Yup, the way items are priced $60 would only cover few items. They could either do season pass gives you 1 special item you can't buy with atoms, and few atom items that are eye candy everyone would want kinda like all the power armor horsemen of apocalypse skins for free, plus % discount on atom shop items, and few free repair kits for shits and giggles.
---
I got it done with help from another redditor thanks tho
---
Try reviving someone at the imposter sheepsquatch event. there's also a little pool in the middle for a water revive.
---
But fallout 4 was for DLC story with functional weapons, this is completely different, a series of unending cosmetic items from roughly $/¬£ 2-14 each, doubt anyone would see/do this in any game ever, it would be a giant loss of any money the developers would make.
---
Flatwoods myself.  I've dumped a huge amount of plans, aid, and low end ammo in that crate.  Seen a few other use it as well.  My communal crops surprisingly dont get cleaned out much for caps (about 3/4 my budget).
---
I‚Äôd be glad to buy a refrigerator.  Unlike the repair kit, it would a one time purchase, and it would enhance my enjoyment of crafting.  Put some rare or interesting raw materials in it and leave them around until I have time to craft.  No returning from adventuring with just a bunch of spoiled fruit.
---
I wouldn't buy it at that rate but you do you, Holmes. A sale is a sale. NO REFUNDS!
---
Similar idea: what if the 10% went to the Enclave vendors? The more money Modus has, the higher the chance of cool mods.
---
I don't like that idea. I don't want LP hunting me down.
---
It's another ammo farm for me, plenty of scorched and sometimes trigger the event that brings even more in, very easy to melee these guys and net a decent chunk of ammo with minimal effort.
---
Ah I didnt kno that, I submitted mine in December lol
---
Ps4?
---
Yeah im planning to go for lone wanderer, but i convinced my best friend to get the game, so i‚Äôm in doubt if that will be usefull, the powerfist and deathclaw gauntlet arent aviable yet, i just got the dg but it is for lvl 35
---
BoS Combat Armor Plans are available at Grafton Train Station.
---
You may complete the possum challenges by 2021
---
On the road between Vault 96 and Federal Disposal Field.
---
Stairs are extra broken with this patch. The inaccessibility issue is really frustrating. 
---
Placing objects under stairs is very buggy too. Work benches specifically are giving me huge issues. They pop up to the second floor, and I pull my hair out.
---
Yeah you're right. I just moved a load of stuff from my stash to player and it went right in.
---
It's confusing that the weights shown in stash are affected by perks though.
---
Thanks mate.
---
I'm sure it's not working my harpoon gun at 200%  damage was about 500 odd now it says 1400 but still feels like it did before.
---
No blueprint even?
---
Erm?..   Bye then bud?
---
Stairs are the most infuriating thing ever. The other day I had to waste a total of about 400 caps replacing my CAMP because I couldn't delete stairs that were floating in the air by themselves after trying to stack them. The only thing that was placed was the foundation and the stairs themselves, and stupidly you can delete the lower set of stairs but the set above just refuse to budge despite defying the laws of gravity.
---
The actual turret type is the only thing you can change. Normal turrets will always be level 4. Heavy turrets will always be a set level. So on and so forth
---
I second the need for spawn welcome mats. Whenever I spawn at my camp I'm pretty much stuck in one of my foundations
---
Loophole/Exploit waiting to happen. Just set a astronomical sell price and  use the vendor fridge to store food.
---
Next!
---
Your friend could consider sunkissed to slowly remove rads during the day.
---
The game isn't nice enough to tell you how much weight is actually going into your stash without the perks.. trust us.. take note weight OUT of the stash, and you'll be fine
---
I kinda had similar situation were I was on my alt character to do the lvl up 3 things in flatwoods and this high level character asked me to help him with a challenge and talked about water and I knew he wanted to do the scout challenge, so I invite him to a team and go to the stream and baseball grenaded myself he revived me and I didn't know if it worked since he stopped using his mic and never said thanks. Left the team and walked away. Still kinda find it weird that person would ask low level to do something like that. Imagine if it was someone that didn't know the challenges like your guy lol and they just bought the game; great introduction to FO76.
---
I do, for the strength. With perk you get 15 lbs a pop. Whiskey gives 30 lbs carry weight. It's pretty short lived but I can get my carry weight to 635ish for a fast travel.
---
15 lbs is 6.81 kg
---
Maybe they have the old weird wastelands perk?
---
Not sure, but using the workshops as a guideline, we're looking at the ballpart of 8 units per hour.
---
*Rolls eyes* 
---
Not enough bug fixes they focus on fixing things that dont need fixed
---
There are not egouth people datamining / doing wiki.
---
Yeah was going to get the possum upgrade buuuut I'm afraid of using my 3 badges for another backpack with some paint and not a new model
---
Are you on PC? If so, what's your username? I'd love to check it out when you're done.
---
Skeleton army factory in the Mire usually has a bunch of anglers. I think it's called Braxton something or other. Hemlock Holes Maintenance place up in the Toxic Valley too.
---
How the heck did you figure this out if it came out yesterday and there's only 150 every 24 hours?
---
I haven‚Äôt played any of the other Fallout games yet, but I plan on it. That aside, I love Fallout 76!  Yes, there are bugs and glitches, and yes I get frustrated with them sometimes, but I‚Äôm pretty patient for the most part. I love that I can play by myself or team up, or team up and we all do our own thing. I love running around killing things, especially scorch beasts and the sheepsquatch. I love the quests...long, short, hard, or easy...I love them all!  I love that I can just wander around, and even after the hundreds of hours I‚Äôve already put into the game, I still discover new things and places. There are just so many options that sometimes I can‚Äôt decide what I want to do first. And I absolutely LOVE üíó playing around with my camp...rebuilding, decorating, adding and removing things until it‚Äôs just the way I want it. And I love (most) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è(some are just jerks) the people I come across!  I try to help new players and get excited when I see a baby coming out of the vault!  üòÇ  I really love the new additions that were added yesterday, giving me even more to do (I‚Äôm so thankful to have an understanding bf) to keep me busy for hours!  There‚Äôs just too many things to do and love to spend time complaining about the little things üò∫
---
Iv got a serum in my box. Psn same as user I‚Äôll be in at 6 cst
---
I honestly wish the camps told what level the player was so I can assume they might have rare items if they are no lifer or not. It would be cool if the camps said if they how many legendary items for sale and if there are not known plans for sale.
---
They *weren't* a chance thing before Patch 9.  They always provided that flat level of protection for sprinting or standing still (or, weirdly, jumping, but not crouching).
---
I never used it lol. And I made a healthy profit on it compared to what I paid so I am glad you enjoy it.
---
Why?  I'm almost halfway to obtaining the badges for the increased capacity mod.
---
Am I the only one that doesn't mind these items being available in the Atom Shop for players who want to purchase them? As long as we can earn Atom Points by playing then I see nothing wrong with providing an option for players if they feel it's worth paying real money.
---
Didn‚Äôt read the data mining part and jumped to conclusions, got downvoted for it. Justice served.
---
Niceeee
---
I can agree if that‚Äôs how they do it but I have a feeling like it‚Äôs going to be how it‚Äôs be like it‚Äôs going to be materials I have already
---
Ammo sells surprisingly well. I keep forgetting a majority of players aren‚Äôt aware of the hardcore economy, so they buy ammo at 1-2c each. I loaded up my shop with .38, .44, .45, .308, .556, and fusion cells, and everything is nearly done within the day. It‚Äôs amazing.
---
That and the half foundations
---
 https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/put_one%27s_shoulder_to_the_wheel
---
I saw shops were they made it have 4 garage doors surrounding all 4 sides opened, with the shops and most workbenches inside. It was neat when loading into the camp seeing the doors open animation at once.
---
I was thinking they could do like the ESO Premium Subscription, you get an "allowance" of Atoms each month (possibly the amount you can just get for $20 currently) plus a couple other small perks of some sort (separate dress-up apparel storage? or add that and give Premium additional stash &amp; apparel storage?)
---
Sorry, just saw the title and assumed only a cheater could. Keep up the good work
---
Me too I play a lot like if the repair kits were something you buy once and the you can crafted the it would have been different
---
You will receive a random legendary for the chits you turn in.
---
A very popular drop will be  Mutants Commie Whacker with swing speed and weight reduction.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt work because fallout 76 is prior to fallout 3-4
---
Soooooo?
---
Yes, they could have made some tweaks to the Automatron DLC from Fo4 to add small packs to power armor, or created a completely new suit of Scout Excavator armor for players that need to have 200 of everything.
---
I wouldn't count it out for the future.  I can see a lot of future potential with the Pioneer Scouts, including bows, more wilderness related daily quests, etc....
---
Really they have a giant, open book of Scout related material just waiting to be filled in.  Scout related material is a no-brainer for a survival game.  That's the whole impetus behind real-life scout programs....learning to live off the land, make what you need and develop a strong sense of character, community and self-reliance.
---
Yes, you truly see through the smoke and mirrors.
---
It wasn't supposed to do double..it was supposed to do what the developers wanted it to do.
---
All my friends quit, and I hate teaming with random people.  Especially just to do some dumb quest.
---
Do you have to have completed the order of the tadpoles?
---
I got it and thought wtf,I'm not complaining :)
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019
---
Nice, ye there are a lot of neat stuff in the game been playing since launch and haven't seen it all. Like there is a sunken railroad car in the earth were you can enter from the side door to go below into a furnish living area and you can put a camp there too.
---
I've been server hopping looking for one, Can we trade?
---
It's pretty great.  I haven't felt myself pulled in this many directions simultaneously in the game in quite a while.
---
Well, I'm happy to be using it now.  Thank you.
---
Quit buying tacobell and spend your duckets at the atom shop, p o o r b o y
---
another thing that would be nice is a enclave radio
---
See a gynecologist.
---
So many player vending stations have them for 3 - 500 caps.
---
You should visit t the vending stations
---
Between bouncing around camps and completing challenges, I probably spent around 200 caps yesterday on fast traveling. I'm ok with that though. I'm always near the cap limit.
---
It works as long as I just have one that's all.
---
Can you (or anyone for that matter) tell me what a stimpack diffuser is!? Please!!
---
üé∂Hey everybody, did the news get around
---
About a guy named Cool Drink
---
Oh, Drink just flew into this town
---
And he's scoopin' up all the women's drinks
---
[Chorus]
---
He's scopin' and sneakin' and stealin'
---
He's  scopin' and sneakin' and stealin'  
---
He just scope, sneak, scoopin' those drinks
---
Cool Drink's got long colored jammies
---
He starts scoopin' and don't know when to stop
---
All you fellows gotta watch your wifes
---
'Cause Drink don't care who's drinks he carries off
---
Now, ever since Drink flew into town
---
He's been havin' a ball
---
Just huntin' and scoopin' for miles around
---
Single women, married women, old maids and all
---
He wakes up in the morning, half past five
---
Stealin from sunrise to sunset
---
I don't see how he stays alive
---
Water's gonna be the death of Cool Drink, yeah 
---
He just scope, sneak, scoopin' those drinks 
---
 Look out, here comes the kid!
---
The police put Drink in jail
---
He finally met his fate
---
But when they came in to pay his bail
---
They found him stealin' from the jail fridge
---
He just scope, sneak, scoopin' those drinks  
---
That Cool Drink is the craziest yet
---
Tries to collect all the purified rain
---
Just scoops up anything he can get
---
Man, that man is just insane
---
He just scope, sneak, scoopin' those drinks   
---
That man is crazyüé∂
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a bug.
---
Really?  So say it is a preset inventory by the trader, and I have 200 in legendaries I was hoping to reroll in my stash and am short 200.  I can't cash them in, due to the 150/day limit, and they have suggested that the inventory will be random.
---
Really just looking for a clear answer on the topic, but thanks for weighing in, I guess..?
---
In the future you should keep a bottle of Nukashine on you.  Just drink it and stay alive until you black out.  The odds are you will wake up far away from whatever was attacking you.
---
Nobody knows, I'm afraid. It may not even be in the game yet. If it is, nobody has found it.
---
I had a friend drop something else for another one of the challenges and it counted.
---
Honestly, liberty prime would take away from the experience, it already doesn't make sense why there are supermutants in West Virginia, it'd make even less sense that there would be another liberty prime.
---
A challenge
---
Short and to the point.  Good talk champ.
---
Yeah you're right. I went to a lot of effort to try and integrate mine so that it blended it with my CAMP and looked like a proper store front and not just a randomly placed machine. I put little seats out the front, lights and the full works, so what you saying is totally true.
---
My question is, can you transfer backpacks to other characters if you don't atom shop paint them? been meaning to test it...
---
Just server hopped with both of my characters and found HoneyBees no problem at middle mountain, got 10 HB's .. on XB1 though ..
---
No problem. Hope it's what you're looking for.
---
LMAO.
---
Probably, just want to know for sure which path it is...  see, they also said something about "trader inventory" so...  which is it?
---
Someone dropped me a wing last night for that challenge &amp; it didn‚Äôt work! So if you try it lmk it could‚Äôve been glitchy for me, nothing would surprise me
---
Frankleek626290 not on now when I get done with work I will be tho
---
Figures and I am on this dammed business trip until Friday with no game :(
---
I just need to find one is all Haha. If I knew where to find a mothman to kill i would just do that but i dont know where
---
Or to make new and free dlc for us.
---
I'm a mirelurker! I'd love to chill with other....
---
Survival?
---
now lmao
---
i am a solo guy myself.  I have completed every trophy that doesn't require me to team up with or kill other players and it annoys me that my style of play precludes me from getting the platinum
---
Yea
---
FWIW, I tried this exam like 10 times, and got this question several time. The only time I passed is when I selected swimming alone, and all other times I selected swimming in the dark and failed. It's not a sure thing, but I can verify alone works, I cannot verify that dark works.
---
So I found out what the stimpack diffuser is from a community manager:
---
The Stimpak Diffuser is a Stimpak that restores health to you and your nearby teammates. The recipe for this item will be available in the next update. We're aware that this creates an issue with completing the Tadpole Challenge referencing the Stimpak Diffuser, however you may still complete other world Challenges to earn badges.
---
So the item currently does not exist...
---
Do you have all of the fugsnatch masks and berets. Have you crafted fermented spirits?
---
Use that camera and take pictures.
---
That's what the game is all about now.
---
Nice! I'm limited to 4 due to CAMP budget restrictions and the area I'm in gets attacked by lvl 68 super mutants often.
---
These things always get abused
---
How?
---
Why did you keep so much crap? They have made it clear that limited stash space, limited inventory space, and limited currency caps mean you shouldn't be hoarding everything you touch. Only keep and use what you need, sell, scrap or drop the rest. Dont quote me on it, but I'm pretty sure they even said something similar.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right, players should definitely move their entire camp to make it easier for other players to reach them. Not doing so is just inconsiderate.
---
you can click on the camp and directly fast travel to it
---
According to some data miner, it will probably be a random legendary, casino-like feature.
---
But that was just his opinion based on what he gathered. It might be something entirely different.
---
First one I tried was the Save Everything mod, that was the culprit.  Just FYI if you use it as well
---
Wonder if they applied chance to the blocking legendary effect too.
---
Hey @LoneVaultWanderer @LadyDevnn @Bethesdagamestudios I still get this crash.  I've pasted the relevant parts from the dump showing where the error is, but Beth CS doesn't seem to be doing anything with that info.  (Got more, but reddit won't let me paste the whole thing.)

---
My guess is to prevent a sudden flood of bis gear.
---
I agree.  It's nice not to get clear through a new update in 2 hours while trying to nurse it by refusing to fast travel.  Maybe I'll get through Possum in the next 2-3 weeks, which gives me a LOT to do.
---
Yes, some stuff doesn't exist yet or is bugged, but you can still rank up to possum in a variety of ways.  I personally did it with hunter, athlete and swimming badges.  I have to repair a crossbow one more time to get the point for archery.  (FYI, advanced repair kits don't care if your weapon is over 100%, and I got two during one SBQ this morning)
---
This makes as much sense as going naked to avoid paying armor repair costs.
---
The real reason this idea is bad is posted by another user, which is that it's going against Bethesda's goal of fighting inflation and so won't happen.
---
Ok ill be there
---
Fort Defiance
---
For me it's a little bit other lesson. No one. And I mean no one has a CAMP in Ash Heap.
---
Always keep a whiskey to boost you over your carry limit to fast travel. And some charisma drinks stockpiled for vendor runs.
---
No worries! Also idk why you got down voted so much lol
---
Hahahah i do avoid armor so i don't have to deal with repairs and the carry weight.
---
Damn, I was afraid of that. The only thing I needed for the badge üòë Thank you for responding üëç
---
The preview we got of this patch on May 2nd on their Inside the Vault post mentioned we'd be getting more details next week. So in the next few days we'll get more details. The vendor is also coming on the 16th now, rather than the 23rd.
---
I would say google because I‚Äôve killed one ever &amp; he spawned at my baseüòÇ
---
No problem send me a friend request and I‚Äôll swing by and craft you up some stuff if you‚Äôd like. PSN Tffka33
---
Well i spend maybe 20k caps on plans i will never use. Is 60caps something?
---
Is it just me, or does anyone else find it fantastic that we have situations like this in the game?
---
"Look out for the notorious water bandit!" is just a wonderful thing to say and think about.
---
I was thinking about making and selling ultracite gatling lasers for cheap. Just don't know if there's a market for them.
---
I‚Äôm a basic person. I just put all my crafting tables in a circle around the CAMP thing.
---
I've been googling and cant find an exact answer
---
LMFAO I‚Äôve server hopped 30+ times easily in the past two days going to different vendors &amp; haven‚Äôt seen one in Ash Heap
---
Unless you have an extra set of plans you‚Äôre selling you can mod the piece I would guess just like we do for weapons.
---
It‚Äôs taught me that so many people just make basic rectangle homes and don‚Äôt do anything else to them
---
Just place a 2nd set of stairs, then moved 1st, finally remove temporary 2nd stairs
---
Dude.. you gifted it.
---
Its said it to me when the item was already in stash, fast travelling away and back seemed to sort it.
---
Torso
---
Well said
---
Just to land under the floor. Has happened to me three times today.
---
Xb1?? I wanna pick up a starter mutation set for a friend.
---
Yeah would love that, only problem is i cant go online right now. Its 23:00 here and i have my first exam tomorrow so i need to go and sleep. But thanks for the offer, i‚Äôll add you and tomorrow or friday i can definetly come online:)
---
To add: The antiques shop (2) and Sunday cabin (1).
---
It's a shame that we still cant just craft mods like we could in fallout 4
---
Absolutely yes if they are trying to sell something!
---
That‚Äôs a rip-off, I got mine from someone for 100 caps
---
Deleted, knew it was bullshit but messaged just in case, turns out he *was* a dick.
---
You would be correct.
---
I play in excavator and noticed I've been taking a lot more damage, that makes a lot of sense...
---
Yeah, um. Display Cases are on the way pal. Check out last weeks Inside the Vault below xD
---
"DISPLAY CASES ARE COMING"

Pix or it didn‚Äôt happen

Same here but I couldn't hit them with my tse gatling gun. I had to go into vats to kill them.
---
 I'm on xbox right now. Ign:KbJc2o0o 
---
We can take turns dying and reviving eachother for the challenge.
---
I approve this message.
---
I think it's because all the end game farming is closer to the cranberry bog or center of map, so people put their camps there for the lower fast travel costs.
---
I mean, there probably is. The only issue Id see is people wont know what guns you have til they actually go to your shop. So you probably wont be getting alot of people buying unless you post it on here or something, or if your camp is in a high traffic area.
---
First the imoveable walls now the unmovable foundation YAY
---
When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.
---
It should show all dislikes all over the map and allow us to highlight ones to pop up a notification when they appear on the map. 
---
Unless I'm just completely lost on an a tual purpose for the terminal
---
This became newly newly relevant with this weeks pioneer scouts missions. Thank you from the far far future!
---
Agreed, lol
---
I was real selective with my mutations and took class freak off. Otherwise great build IMO
---
Nothing
---
I'm strongly considering getting into leveling people up on ps4.
---
They are making refrigerated back packs. So why not?
---
id move down there but there is no acid nodes i can CAMP on
---
YES! Would definitely pay for that!
---
Have it use Motherlode to move underground, or maybe ha e all 3 Motherlode machines mesh together to form it. Liberty Miner.
---
I know, but - right now - badges aren't a physical item that we can display. I'd like to display them.
---
Seriously making snapping optional and be a little bit more forgiving in colliding items. You have to place things to far apart which makes it look bad.
---
[Example](https://imgur.com/J9mEAQD)
---
I don't see any reason why this couldn't be attached there if it would be real.
---
Cheers man! :)
---
I just came up with it on the fly hahhah
---
Did you craft the levelled variant? Depending on level you can craft up to a level 50. The reward bag has 20 carry weight and the crafted level 50 has a carry weight of 60.
---
Appreciate you probably already know this but I thought I‚Äôd mention it in case you weren‚Äôt.
---
I believe they changed it to the 16th!
---
Your trying wayyy to hard on this thread.
---
Too bad if it really was a bug.  The extra stats added some additional depth to the game mechanics in a logical way, for the most part.  I'm guessing they had to make their dumb repair kits more viable somehow.
---
150 scrip a day is more than the vast majority of people are going to earn on sustained rates.
---
I can promise that actual runners have a very different opinion on calling all runs marathons (my wife is a runner =), and many running events will include more than just a marathon (despite the name emphasizing the marathon since it is the main event) like half marathons, 10ks, etc too.  Those additional routes are something most marathons have for those not able to run a full marathon, but are not actually called marathons (they are referred to by their distance, with the exception of the half marathon).  
---
While I understand the confusion, I can't really blame the expectation that an exam about athletics should expect familiarity enough to know the difference.  We're the exams not infinitely repeatable, I might agree with the questions needing to be made more general/having all answers in game.  Since they are just 5 questions and Google exists (and internet connection is required to play), I don't feel it's unreasonable the way they are currently.
---
Instead of whining about it politely ask someone for help everyone else has to do it and have no problems helping you if you return the favor. I had to ask a couple people but i got instant replies from the people that helped me.
---
Because games that aren't PC exclusives have their UI ruined by consoles.
---
Any idea where that is?
---
Let us build aquariums and terrariums to match the environment the plant/fungi needs.
---
I tried this but don't work. I think is something with my local files. I'm gonna do a scan in the game folder with the launcher.
---
The view in the Divide is to die for.
---
Don't come out then if you dont like the location. Quite honestly if 60 caps wasted is a problem, you probably shouldn't be vendor hopping anyways.
---
Same here, in the case i didnt pick it up there would be two legi's on the body. Was nice
---
I didnt actually know that!
---
This is not a copy of creation engine nor does it fucking matter.
---
One of my alts has a camp in a camp just above the Tunnel. 4 tents already there, with a grill and re-spawning items. Just had to build a couple foundations for the crafting, put lights in all the tents, and my Mothman bed in one of the. Home sweet home.
---
JDBuckSavage
---
THIS!
---
Id love to know some average prices, ones that would sell, for serums for example. I initially figured that 2,000 caps was a good deal, less than half the price at Whitespring. Hell I thought I would be undercutting everyone at that price and raking it in.
---
After an hour of everyone telling me my serums were outrageously overpriced I started visiting other camps. Seems the average is 150-250 caps, or less than I can sell them to a vendor for.
---
I;m selling at 200 caps right now but have taken to only putting one in the vending machine at a time because inevitably someone comes along and buys them all then tries to sell them for 5 times the price elsewhere. 
---
I sell stims for 20 diluted for 10, but see them for double that out there. Any ammo I sell, I sell for one cap each.
---
I sell bulk lead and aluminium cheaper than the stores but no-one bites. 
---
I just don't get it. I'm lost as to what to price anything at because there is such a huge disparity in prices out there. So, I am relying on location and having a nice set of free amenities for anyone and everyone to use. I've had a lot of thumbs up and hearts today, so I figure I am doing something right, but man I wish I knew where to set my prices.
---
I've heard:
---
    ear to the ground
---
    eye on the ball
---
    nose to the grindstone
---
    put one's back into
---
but I've never heard that one. Look at me learning stuff on the internet
---
Ate you pc I‚Äôll buy it all :)
---
Alternatively the one stop shop at the vendor bot doppelgangers in the Whitespring. Responder bot in the bookstore has the excavator accessories.
---
I'm not sure if you get the X-01 unlocked for building if you buy it's mod's plans, you can't buy the armor's plan themselves
---
I think the overreparing not affecting the physical damage resistance value, maybe that is the defense loss?
---
Hey, thanks!
---
Might not be currently possible as those mods are 8 tokens each and there are only like a dozen possum challenges.
---
There‚Äôs a new tab in the armour workbench to craft it if that helps.
---
Fallout 5 was one aspect. Lore breaking another, and Bethesda's infamous bugginess/reliance on the creation engine as well but most of the outrage was stemmed on youtubers cashing in and promoting outrage about glitches. 
---
Sorry, I was about to go off on my anti-youtuber tirade. Btw, the game had and still has glitches, I won't deny that, and if it was enough to drive you out, I won't deny you that either. It's just I've only experienced a handful do glitches and crashes.
---
Yeah, I froze about 6 times in the 4 hours I played.   (Xbox)
---
Send them a message if you‚Äôre looking for a certain item...
---
HIDE YA KIDS
---
The standard .50 Receiver does more damage than the Refined .50 Receiver even though the refined one states improved damage. (Looks like it's improved relative to 308 not 50)
---
Now where do I get the cooking challenge recipes? :(
---
Better than nv
---
ah fair enough. yeah screw you mountain people!
---
Are these different than the challenges in the World section? I don't see any mention of the archery stuff.
---
I added a laser first right next to where people spawn in on my camp, so if a low level spawns anything attacking will go for the turret first.
---
To expand my thought, if you wanted more people to look at shops, 1/2 off fast travel to camps. If I'm going a direction and can pass be a vendor for less money, I'll do it. 
---
Also 70% of the vendors I've visited have had stuff in the list, only to get there and find garbage. If i knew they were making money for me to just pass by, I'd be pissed.
---
I don't believe Starched-Genes is available that early. I can only imagine he popped a Radaway sometime after and inadvertently cured the mutation. Good job he knows a serum dealer, though? Everybody gets one?
---
Do not eat meat with a critical build. Take the herbivore mutation and make Blight Soup for 20% more critical damage.
---
Also, you are losing out on a lot of damage not putting on a silencer and taking covert operative and mister sandman. I would put only one point adrenaline and gun-fu in order to maximize the sneak perks. For five points of agility you increase your damage by 2.5-3.5x (3.75 if you use the bug). Nine points of perception only increases damage by 1.6x.
---
I saw the video and I was more surprised by the hilariously goofy tactics that are used by PvP'ers in this game than the sneaky ways they try to fool people.  
---
It's just so awkward to look at, I mean it's like you're watching some 5 year olds fight each other in a bouncy castle.
---
It's the only design you can have when you move base a lot and don't want to have to rebuild everything from scratch every time. 
---
You shouldn't let solutions to game limitations hurt your feelings so badly.
---
Wasn't fake. He gave me all his stuff. 1,000lbs worth and a bunch of legendary stuff. Nice guy.  ;)
---
A little trolly, I'll give you that :)
---
But....cmon like, the inspect bug has been here before, they know the fix, seems like it should have been tested....that was all I was trying to say.
---
Unless you‚Äôre walking across the wasteland and not using the fast travel option I understand... however you could get close and use the option to fast travel for 1 maybe 2 caps....
---
You can also message them if you‚Äôre looking for a specific item.
---
Has to be with the actual camera and the name of the photo subject should appear in the top right of the screen. Should register then.
---
Thank you, bot!
---
We, as good players, shouldn‚Äôt be punished by cheaters. They can limit the amount of time and amount of food stored. Like 10 food items that stays good for a week. Ionized food stays forever so they can just get that anyway.
---
Are you on pc? can u sell backpacks?
---
My nation will starve to death and a violent revolution will overthrow me. Your move Capitalism!
---
How do?
---
Yes you get a notification, if you didn't sold anything yet, try too visit other shop to compare the price
---
The difference between you and him will be you made 10k off the paint and they spent 10k on an item to have it sit in their vending machine.
---
No and no.
---
Sent a request
---
I started a new character today and there was a player camp by the flatwoods overseers camp. It was a level 123 players camp and it looked like something a 6 year old would make. I would be absolutely embarrassed if I had played the game as long as they had and that was my camp.
---
Had the same thought last night.  Would think it could be doable as long as the vendor object always spawns first.  Think the real problem though is that players could use it to glitch into prohibited areas like they did with the beta welcome mats.
---
After 90% weight reduction it only weighs 9 lbs. And the faster reload is phenomenal.
---
Yup, picked a locked water purifier the other day since I was near death from not drinking (what I get for letting my kid play). 10 cap bounty, stashed my junk, fast traveled to white Springs train station and got destroyed, then moved on with my day.
---
So you already know the answer to your own question?
---
I hate it when I‚Äôm trying to sell something for like 5k and suddenly it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOh Ok, so you can sell it for 2k or 25k‚Äù
---
Send me message. GT is Antinash
---
True
---
Yes, there was a ton of great stuff to do in this patch, from selling to shopping to scripping to new questlines.   It will take me weeks to properly absorb it.
---
I‚Äôm sure many players have stashed full of all types of legendary items to turn in as soon as we all found out you can sell them to the legendary vendor. 
---
They‚Äôre also probably figuring out what items no one uses and gets rid of or hardly used legendary items. 
---
Add in players with mules... it‚Äôs a lotta scripts!
---
I got the radroach mounted plan yesterday. Same quest.
---
Yep, that's really frustrating.
---
I ended up triggering the Ecryptid event, just to get people in one place taking damage.
---
Hmmm...maybe there is more than one bug.
---
Log out and back in . They won‚Äôt be there
---
Replying just to help the jumpstart!
---
Why do we need the mole miner when the slot machines can spit legendary out like the one in Watoga HS. Maybe machines for random draw and purveyor for reroll?
---
 So if you wear power armor the backpack is useless. What else did they add then? Nothing?
---
yeah its small sum but still sum and it stacks up when u fasttravel 80 times a day
---
Oh I just hate locked doors. (This was mostly a joke.)
---
That's the most reasonable suggestion. It's still a low chance to get the stars aligned (eh) and get exactly the 3 affixes you want, but at least that's not reduced further by adding a "1% chance of being the right base item" term on top.
---
I'm sorry if you think this takes any effort.
---
Same reason why you can not type/chat with others in the game, mechanically speaking.
---
Did the archery exam trying to utilize my microscopically small knowledge of archery and some basic common sense, passed it in 3 or 4 tries. Can't wait to try the rest.
---
I considered that about repair kits too
---
Here a list of going prices on the market
---
Ammo= 1 cap in bulk
---
Fluxes 50 unless violet 100
---
Rad stim etc= 10 to 20
---
Treasure maps = 50
---
Plans depends on rarity really
---
God rolls go for 20k plus
---
Items really depends on mods but 1 star should never be over 300 to 500
---
Ummmm sorta forgeting the giant spagetti monster !!!
---
they really need to make a collandor hat for all us pastaferians
---
&lt;3
---
Well thank you
---
me: uhhmmm mmm..... wtf is a mile? xd
---
It should or a lighter at least.
---
Only think I lock is my daughter's bed. She plays on my account and it's weird playing and seeing someone sleeping in "her" bed (the atom shop castle bed with the atom shop stuffed bunny on it).
---
Other then that, my doors, my bed, water, everything is free to those in need.
---
Ah. I feel ya. I never understood why we never just shoot the locks off or bash the door in.
---
Wasnt me, I leave an enameled bucket, 3 bags of fertilizer, and toilet paper. 
---
Happy trails
---
I just use 3 CHR total for Hard Bargain otherwise I usually got a 1 star Lone Wanderer + Travel Agent so I don't have to swap all the time or 2 star Lone Wanderer if fighting a boss. I also like Happy Camper for when hanging out in-game doing nothing productive. :)

if it takes you 4 months of playing then....you just like it
---
Ah okay thx for the info, wasnt aware of the blight soup so i'll switch that mutation out :)
---
The only problem is that I know you can pump out a lot more damage with the stealth perks but id prefer to play a run and gun style rather than acting stealthy.
---
IGN:coolardvark
---
Oops, I think I forgot that one. I already had three completed. I'll add those in now. :)
---
Is this the ultimate scheme to destroy camps? Get everyone to lock their waters so you can unlock them and get aggro with the player home and destroy it with a minigun? Evil genius.
---
This is excellent. That's a montage right?
---
Great idea but you know for a fact there would be many leaving bad comments or low ratings due to being ticked about the game. 
---
Not too mention the opposite where they are artificially raised like in the real world.
---
My game is and always was on PC. It used to swap from me not hearing them, to them not hearing me, or both. In some magical way I was always able to fix it with ways even unknown to me up to this point. But now I've actually been stuck with it for so long I decided to look throughout the entire web for anything about this. But as per usual, this is kind of the only place I can find relevant things regarding the game, since everything else I look up for fixes is typically a bunch of websites talking shit or updates about 76.  
---
Let's just hope more people speak of this so nobody has to deal with it ever again, as it's been here since before the beginning and there's yet to be any text chat for teams at the least!
---
I‚Äôm kinda hoping for both a small inventory and a random prize. I just really pray that if there is a random item option we can pick what weapon category (random pistol/shotgun/rifle) we want.
---
Yeah he wants attention
---
I'm not gonna Google that, but, F yeah trader mate!
---
That works out great. Friday 5:00 EST good?
---
I can't delete a section of walls because it blocks access or some shit like that. It's literally just 3 walls, 2 high with nothing on top. I've tried everything short of just moving the whole damn base
---
Just visual bug.
---
Still didn't fix the Legendary vending machine though, still says 0 for every item.  Disabled all my mods completely and it still says the same thing.
---
Where is that event?
---
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.
---
Thank you. Was really confused.
---
Let the market developer naturally. Giving someone control over pricing is what we dont need right away.
---
Still looking for someone? I don't even want the caps, just let me do the same for you
---
i played solo went to kill the real sheepsquatch someone die, i stimpank his ass, quest completed.
---
if you don't rant the karma provides
---
I'm on ps4. Anyway sinply use a shotgun and cripple her legs. Stay bwhind her untill she spawns the little bastards. That's it.
---
Yup yup.
---
this I want this, by the way the vending system works way better than anticipated I would say best update yet! :)
---
One of the new Scout dailies also gives mounted head plans. I got the radroach plan yesterday. I think it was the one that asks you to collect bugs from Dolly Sods
---
You buy now
---
Oh, you're just a bad shot and are used to splash damage carrying you. Got it.
---
Maybe try to connect with more than two shots lol. SUPER rekked that door frame tho.
---
the same cant be said of everyone tho...
---
The worst dupe in dupe history lol
---
As it wouldn't be already enough lying around everywhere.
---
Slay a ghoul - airdrop, look into next trash can - airdrop, from nowhere diseased mole rat comes up - infected with rad w...nah ah airdrop.
---
No need to announce your departure. Good riddance.
---
They may hold off on them to avoid trap vendor camps.  I‚Äôll be honest, some of them are pretty ingenious and I wouldn‚Äôt mind running into them on occasion.  Makes you feel like you‚Äôre really in the wasteland.
---
Now I'm imagining two players separately looting the water purifier at a camp they found, except the camp belongs to the other raider so basically they're accomplishing nothing.
---
I only started locking my water purifiers yesterday so I could sell cheap purified water :/
---
Other than that I carry 60 around with me all the time
---
yeah or just shhhh. you werent meant to tell anyone...
---
Lol. Toxic community at is finest. Ads at 5 feet misses half the pellets and it's my fault. Dead weight convo right here.
---
Liberty Prime activated.
---
This is probably already thought of, but how about a "Bulk Sale" or "Package Sale" option, then select number of identical items, then select total amount for all items.
---
like, I want to sell a pack of 100 .38 ammo for 50 caps. I assumed that was how it was going to work, but was surprised to find that it's always per unit.
---
It would also be cool to be able to sell sets of items... ex. 'starter pack' with a gun, ammo, water, etc for a flat price. I tend to mark things at 0 caps for those visiting, would be cool to be able to throw it in free if they make a purchase or something.
---
That is fair, and my thread was certainly also made in the spur of a heated moment.
---
Thank you however, for the explanation. I've realized my own mistake at assuming that marathons could be different, because of how it has been advertised where I live. I assumed the same about this particular question regarding the Charlestons charity event, my mistake.
---
It's not like a lack of a fridge created a huge gameplay issue. It isn't a paid item that solves a major issue every player has. 
---
Food isn't a huge problem. It's easy to come by and easy to prep. It's a minor inconvenience at best.
---
Mate, I always need Lead. What's your PSN? I'll buy it from you on whatever server you are on.
---
I thought about this last night as well. Would be great to add to the game. What about a tip jar or CAMP contests to see who in the server has the best built/designed CAMP?
---
I literally moved yesterday because of this issue. Had a sweet cave spot too but fucked up by testing out stairs.
---
Outstanding. Those are fantastic to display!
---
Eh, I've only got one and it's locked.
---
And covered by turrets.
---
It counted for both for me
---
I thought about this a little further, what if all online active venders could be searched from the main screen, then when you find a item you like it would log you onto that server if the server has room??? This seems do_able! But if the item gets bought  while your loading... your SOL.
---
ahhh heres where your wrong. about 3 weeks of playing, the rest grinding absolutley everything to get a god-roll shotgun and still not getting it :)
---
the things that i have more than 100 i put them cheaper than the default price.
---
the things that are cheap but are harder to find i add some overprice like the nuka kola paint job i put it at 400 and someone bought it (it's 150 default price)
---
Yeet is for power and distance. Kobe is for precision and accuracy.
---
Only him, one that I had in my box. I bought 2 off a guy before I could get starched and was afraid I‚Äôd lose it. Then i leveled real quick on an event and maxed it out and never lost it. I just found the lowest person on my server I could find, corned him and then told him over mic what I had for him and dropped it. I‚Äôm sure he lost it fast but it was funny at the moment
---
Found a TSE Dragon, and a TSE Handmade for 5k each the other night but the way I see it as long as they are selling for what they want everyone is happy. It would be different if you saw they had good gear and were offering super low caps trying to shark their items.
---
You and me both.  Some of these people would pat me on the head ‚Äúoh hey you built a two story house!  You are doing SO good!  Have a fancy lad snack cake!‚Äù
---
Or to put another way, I feel like Ringo with John Paul and George all hanging around.
---
he he dont make me blush infront of everyone &lt;3
---
It is mandatory one of the first ones is "revive an ali" doing it in water is optional
---
Hello yes I need to be part of the mass suicide as well on XBOX :D
---
PS4 is L2, XBOX is left trigger
---
Will it still destroy it with the new camp destruction rules? You now have to be pvping to damage anything in someone else‚Äôs camp.
---
Would 50 per pure flux be a good price? I've been thinking of making that a staple of my business
---
And that revolution will really be a military coup funded by the capitalists üòé
---
I'm fine with someone buying and reselling, I just want to keep product moving. I'm a wholesaler :D
---
It's price about between 10-20 buck which is well enough for this game. Otherwise not worth to play much.   
---
Yes, they are improving game but in a wrong way. Each update they are break something or previous bugs are return to the game.  Also %50 of the new stuffs are not working for players. Last thing they bring to this game a college exam system which you need to solve academic questions. It's boring and annoying. It's better to find ready answers to do it. Also do not expect any regular dungeons like other ARPGs have. There is no instanced dungeon. Actually this game sort of sandbox game which  the worst game model for this game.
---
Yeah that's how I thought it would work aswell but luckily they can always fix it this update was a step in the right direction QOL wise
---
Enigma_Tim
---
I‚Äôm not sure. Previously you were able to destroy camps by nuking them, I don‚Äôt know for sure now however.
---
There is crazy sound of sirens, huge window saying it is gonna boom in 3minutes. Like wtf? If you don't leave server you wanted rebuild that camp anyway.
---
I got 14 for sale at my camp!
---
Dead Money over Lonesome Road or Mothership Zeta?
---
Nahhhh
---
I def respect your opinion though, I probably just got dissuaded by the bomb collar, poison, yadda yadda. I was also significantly younger than I currently am when I attempted it.
---
i wanted to sell my t60 jetpack but for some reason doesn't sayd it has the mod on it so 2k looks expensive af for a chest lol i save that for lates. the jetpack plan is expensive
---
Thank God, now I don't have to worry about my camp whilst doing anything else
---
No doubt...
---
There's a guaranteed Yao Guai spawn in a little cave by the snake at whitesprings. I always hit him then head to mountainside
---
I'm not entirely sure but I doubt it'll re-roll on items you turn in. May give you a weapon/armor type option then maybe depending on how many scrips you use could decide whether it's a 1 2 or 3 star item. Maybe idk
---
Try the most northern entry of Whitesprings, a little bit up the cliffs it sometimes spawn there
---
Good luck!
---
Ah yes, my bad!
---
This was a complete headache...im on xbox but wont be on till bout 9pm eastern time.
---
I may be mistaken but I think it only comes with the Mothman paint job from the atom store.
---
use a keyboard
---
You can still hop servers tho. And thats a good bit of effort to go through just to grief a camp knowing that the owner can, and likely will,  just hop servers. Wasted nuke.
---
Dude I'm 80 hours in and I havent even met the raiders faction yet
---
That would be beautiful, it's a lv 50 perk that allows you to have 75% of lv 50 fatman stats except for weight feel free to continue witn more changes
---
Helvetia around where you spawn
---
At first I thought you edited the picture and added the cart at the back of this tractor. That's actually a thing in the game?
---
I do!
---
Wow, took you 4 months to draw a conclusion? Sure it's the game?
---
I'll help. i already did it. add me tukkunnizura
---
hang on a moment young human (cant be sexist as its 2019 boys and girlys) there is no need to announce how you feel about my announcement. good riddance. btw i promise i know what good riddance means...
---
If it was that easy to get it wouldn‚Äôt be a god roll now would it! I haven‚Äôt found a good legendary shotgun but I have gotten plenty or other weapons that would put it to shame! But on a real note stock up caps and server hope I‚Äôm sure somebody got one for sale!
---
I got the Brain Bombs, Sweet Roll and Cranberry Meatball Grinder recipes from the cooking vendor at Whitesprings, but I'm not sure about the others. )':
---
They are not strong enough
---
sure it is my friend, sure it is :)
---
Once again I needed to photo "whole family" :) But at least it worked.
---
Nah, you can have my water. Hell, I WANT you to have it.
---
So...Prozac is a thing.
---
Thank you for including the DR issues that affect Berserker builds.
---
Yeah thanks
---
Yeah that is my ultimate max, but I can't run past 1200 pounds because it's 4x my carry weight.
---
No problem! The frog habitat for the Herpetologist badge is also bugged, you can "craft" it as a CAMP item, but it doesn't register for the challenge. Hopefully Bethesda will fix those soon. ):
---
I use a keyboard, there is a delay with my mouse aim specifically. controls are ok
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
Okay bud. :)
---
you have a very good point. however, i kind of gave away everything about 30 minutes ago :/
---
Or or. A giant robot similar to Prime but that of John Henry. He wields a sledgehammer and throws uranium packed sticks of dynamite. 
---
Fits with the WV lore.
---
I sell Blackberry Juice for free along with a steady supply of Phantom Devices, which I price at 1750.  Is that a ridiculous price? üòÖ I have no idea, it just seems the norm to be selling some things for pries in the thousands.
---
Would anyone pay 1750 for a Phantom Device?
---
Get concentrated fire if you are a ranged build. Target their thruster, it's their weakest spot. I can usually take one down in 3-4 shots.
---
Mind helping me out with the revive?
---
SAME! I watched 3 people use my shop, and then turn the power off when they were done. I need to figure out a 3 way circuit si that when the vending machines are on the turrets turn off and vice versa. I was told if the person is wanted or attacks the turret and the turret fires back it breaks the immunity and they can then destroy your camp. It is 10 missile turrets though so. They better hope they shoot quick üòÇ
---
Yeah it worked pvp bitches got what they wanted
---
Chavous24 PSN
---
I‚Äôve got it on my nuka-Cola set. Picked it up from Phoenix in Watoga, I think.
---
You do make a point. However you underestimate the lengths people will go to to make someone else have a bad time.
---
Well, you're out nothing but that 10-15 minutes.
---
But I agree it isn't something to whine about.
---
I just said screw rnjebus and went full heavy auto with two handed melee and a side of blow em ups....permanently living in my power armor. 
---
Screw legendarys when ya got ALL DA GUNS!!!
---
I mean, it won‚Äôt cause any damage I guess, but still, it‚Äôs annoying, you know?
---
Big facts. I just picked up every piece for 90 caps a pop . The amount of time I wasted server hopping to find the spawns for just one of these plans is embarrassing.
---
People do it all the time believe it or not. I actually mine coal.at Gauley and harvest bleached dogwood to make water filters so that I can get more for free. Keeps me pretty well in stock.
---
Upload the clip to the cloud and then go to xboxdvr.com and search your name. Underneath the video itll give you a link. 
---
[here's](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/dieselmectech93/video/73135238) a pretty sweet rocket league goal I uploaded last month.
---
You can also turn your clips into gifs
---
Meh. I'll keep my water purifier unlocked. It's like that for that same reason tbh. Im always finding water in the world, often even having too much water with me.
---
Your not wrong it‚Äôs just my endurance isn‚Äôt the best so I have to try to find a way to fit it
---
John Henry Eden
---
Oh and the leets out there are telling me ya need super high luck to get rnjebus to love you.
---
Says the guy complaining about not being able to use his weapon after it gets balanced properly haha.
---
ALRIGHT HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING...
---
If they made it so you could buy more budget with Atom points, would you buy it?
---
I dunno about you guys, but I would buy so much haha
---
Not the computer. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)
---
This guy.
---
Now we‚Äôre are cooking! That seems rather easy. What about also giving you a choice if you want to spawn at the vendor automatically instead of searching.
---
Not sure if this will work for you but I‚Äôve found after this patch that exiting and re-entering build mode consistently was what I had to do in order to get things to place correctly. I‚Äôd try to build something and it would give me a bogus red message saying I couldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd exit build mode, wait a few seconds, then go back into build mode and the object would place just fine most of the time. Not saying we should have to do this and there is definitely a bug or two that needs to be fixed but that‚Äôs the work around I figured out last night. Hope it helps.
---
No big deal, I don't need much water, my replenish rate is super high, i don't eat anything but dog food, so have at it people, enjoy the feast and refreshment!
---
I'm treating the whole thing more like a bargain apocalypse fleamarket than anything else, it's been a hell of a lot of fun to check out other people's prices and compare. 
---
On average I've been seeing 1 star 2-shot weapons (revolvers, 10mm stuff, rocket launchers) for between 500-1.5k caps. Explosive stuff for between 1k-2.5k depending on the popularity of the gun. Unless it's a really good roll or the person is out of their mind I haven't seen anything too far above 5k.
---
Armor I've personally been putting up from between 500-1000 depending on effects, higher end of that scale if they give weight percentage decreases. 
---
Serums I've been putting up for 500 caps as well since they're really pretty cheap to synthesize but I'd still like to make something from it.
---
I sell mine at 50 per unit and they were all bought by a single guy. I assume it was cheap enough for him.
---
can't you join all the guilds in every TES game? That complaint reminds me of the one about Skyrim not having classes so there is nothing forcing you to "roleplay". Bro you could level any skill you wanted in the old games too despite having a focus on certain ones depending on what class you chose. TES games are more freeform than a lot of other games out there. You do whatever the hell you want. If you want to be a  jack of all trades, do it. The game lets you. Thats whats awesome about it. Thats whats awesome about all of them. Unless I am mistaken and not remembering them correctly?
---
First, there's a thing called formatting, second the armor needed to be nerfed to stop griefers in adventure.
---
Oh no, it's not edited at all, found it in game today. It's inbetween Vault 96 and the Federal Disposal Field workshop.
---
So you want to collectively pool resources to provide a service for everyone, sounds like something a communist would say...
---
Too much time on your hands.
---
Yea I even agree with the the nerf even though I miss it
---
No. No rating system until they add an NPC begging for water just outside flatwoods.
---
Poster at train stations.
---
Depends on which purifier you use. The small ones are fairly slow but the industrial one is crazy fast.
---
Fallout 3 Flashbacks?
---
Or free poster from atom shop
---
Ohhh glad you commented, it was your post I saw the comments about the DR on first, then I noticed EVERYTHING had + 1 DR, I'll credit you above!
---
The Original is Butcher Peat...  Which is a song from the soundtrack...  Why so negative?
---
Cool where's the swimming race starting place at I'm in the lake but cant find it and which badges can we actually complete?? Can we get the backpack
---
If anybody was not already dissuaded from taking you seriously with the title, this formatting is gonna do it
---
Is everyone on this sub a cynic?
---
I currently live in the middle of a lake and am considering moving to the Ohio River, just west of 76. I‚Äôm not exactly short on water. 
---
Go ahead, take what you need.
---
Ow my fucking eyes
---
They do test, but they need a larger test base, it's easy to overlook a little (and it is a very very minor issue in the grand scheme of player vending) thing like proximity being a factor
---
I guess I don't know what yeat means. Oh well
---
3 comments and I already realized why I stay away from this sub.
---
"We‚Äôve seen many requests from the Fallout 76 community to remove the ability to build C.A.M.P.s near the Whitespring Golf Club, as they can tend to trivialize enemies in the area." - CAMP built _anywhere_ will trivialize _any_ enemies in the area. If you're following this logics for reals - remove CAMPs completely, damnit.
---
Kill me now. In two shots I mean.
---
God forbid you have to land three shots with a weapon while ignoring all other damage multiplier mechanics like sneak attack bonus... Welcome to literally all other ranged weapons.
---
Nah that actually looks really cool.
---
Wait, before you leave can I have any of your legendaries?? :)
---
Seriously what is wrong with all of you?
---
Tldr. Guessing it's a rant.
---
One way to look at it is that it is a new opportunity to try a new legendary effects build, or, a new way to approach or plan kills. Drop a few mines and funnel enemies to them, etc.
---
I can?
---
The right kind of bug!
---
I might hold off until things become more clear. If you only can accrue 1000 caps at any one time, no rush to scrap everything. When the vendor comes and it's clear what they intend, then I'll scrap the good weapons with crappy effects if it is simply a legendary slot machine.
---
Not really. It's about cost vs reward. 15-40 minutes and a nuke keycard to launch a nuke, just to cause minor inconvenience that can be fixed in 30 seconds by the owner
---
Bit late for that with people duping and trading thousands of BiS items for months before any action was taken.
---
I might just be paranoid but my explosive shotgun seems MUCH weaker than before. Dmg claims to be the same but it takes a significant increase in shots to fell the same old baddies. Yao gui at Dolly Sods used to be 3 shots. Now its more like 10-15.
---
I'm pretty sure I'd get a bounty just to fight a giant robot
---
sorry man, I already gave them to someone
---
wow
---
I finally got it. But that you though! ((My mother is safe!))
---
Someone must have powered up thunder mountain
---
This is a good price
---
Explosive combat shotgun?  
---
That's covered in the patch notes
---
People were using the armor to greif way too often in adventure mode, made it practically impossible to kill them. This way at least others have a fighting chance.
---
Oh that bums me out, I was able to repair my Gutter so high that it was doing the damage of a two handed melee weapon
---
It's a new dupe exploit unfortunately. I heard about it from someone a couple of people who were collecting massive amounts of materials to do it.
---
That would be because the length of a marathon being fixed isn't an American thing, but a worldwide thing.  The event itself is from the 1896 Olympic Games (which were in Athens), and the length is specific to an event it celebrates from ancient Greece (and the 1908 Olympics Games in London were the ones that set the current distance).  I promise runners where you live know the difference between a 10k, half-marathon, and marathon as readily as a runner anywhere else.  Your assumption that this is an American thing might be part of what gets in the way of finding the actual answer more easily (a search for "length of a marathon" is much more definitive than searching for the "Charleston Charity Marathon" and would have given the correct answer without the confusion you mentioned earlier).  Your confusion about what is and isn't a marathon has nothing to do with nationality, and everything to do with you not being a runner.
---
Oh, I thought I read it. Perhaps I should go back :)
---
I am poor, but symbolically i give you gold.
---
I went to visit a vendor, and the guy had 20+ water purifiers built on the cliff‚Äôs edge. It was very impressive.
---
One time I had someone follow me around the whole map I was in for no reason shooting at me the whole time. They wasted tons of caps and their time. Some people suck.
---
That was me, I got thirsty walking around your house five times trying to find the damn vendor station.
---
Nope looks really cool. Keep it.
---
What's up with the formatting?
---
Very true though. The tourist is almost impossible to find, and then we get with all of this
---
The addition of vending might of caused a glitch with it, who knows
---
I'd start a Kickstarter to do this in real life
---
I kept 2 and 3 star legendaries specifically so I could turn them in when the vendor came out. The second I heard about it, I started keeping all of my 2 and 3 star stuff and transferring it all to mules.
---
Not really a rant I was just pointing out the imbalances and how other overpowered aspects have been ignored
---
feed tge mouse peanut butter
---
Wow
---
That part would be hard I think for the programmers enless they did a flat cap cost say 75caps. Being that the game doesn't know your location or the distance from said vender if your not logged in.
---
Thats like 1 hour of nuked WS farming though...
---
crybaby
---
No. Nice use of support posts!
---
Thank you so much!!!!
---
The steel beams are what distinguishes it from floating bases. Camp looks great. Go to Whitesprings if you want to see a lot of examples of floating bases
---
ok :)
---
Why does the format even matter? It just showed up like that when I hit post. How does that make what I have to say invalid?
---
Nope you use the beams now if you didn‚Äôt use the beams then yes floating..looks like something you would see in far harbor
---
Deathclaw Hide is a junk item and autoscraps into 5 leather. It's possible you've looted some and accidentally scrapped it?
---
It does not. Source: a different Reddit thread on this sub
---
Exactly what everyone else has said, looks awesome!!
---
The excavator plans can also be bought from the vendor bot in the middle of grafton. Not the train station, the other one. The train station one now sells all those rare weapon mods and armor plans that were previously removed from the game on accident.
---
Floating is when the only thing touching the ground is the staircase. This is a house on stilts. 
---
üëç
---
Someone wastes their time and effort doing a silo to nuke you, you log off. Not sure who is trolling who in that scenario.
---
Ah see better left in your hands. I was a emt, now a mechanic. I know nothing about coding and all that.
---
Thats part of challenge, sceaping it and i have still 0/5
---
In your friend's camp. Ask him to lock it
---
are* there
---
I have a couple in my inventory. Why do you want it exactly?
---
I don't think there are drycleaners left in the wasteland to remove any unusual "stains".
---
My bloodied handmade went from 285 to 301, all perks the same, @ same health
---
The updated date is May 16th.... not that long but enough for people to max out.
---
Well fellow wasteland sojourner, I'm not one to be tossing around grenades like I'm giving away participation ribbons at the county fair. No siree. If I'm stirring up a big pot O trouble with a Grenade, you can be damn sure it's wrapped up for those commie bastards (which is what all them super mutants are....commies}. Those flag waving Ivan's will never know what I'm delivering.
---
if you want people to always kiss your rear and tell you you're right, there are other subs for that
---
Oh, my bad.  I haven't gotten to that part yet.
---
Or we can all stop pointing it out because it's literally the only reason I'm not overencumbered usually.
---
I actually anticipate it being removed so I've been forcing myself to use T60 PA so that it doesn't come as a huge shock to me. I do still carry the Excavator with me just in case though.
---
You're one of those types
---
Don‚Äôt forget the creepy monotone rape sounding voice telling you shit went south Jed book it!
---
I recently took a Grape Mentats and lost all of my addictions.  Is that normal?  I was able to recreate it again.
---
The repair kits don't allow you to repair weapons or armor to 200%, they only repair to about 150%. 
---
I used the two I ended up with to see how they work, and was quite disappointed that with the perk, you don't get the full beef.
---
If it's a glitch, cool, but if that's how they work, I'll just grind to get mats to repair.
---
While I get your angry and yes bloodied probably needs a little nerfing too 
---
The fact is the armor was way overpowered and could basically make people invincible
---
I'm sure you probably paid a lot of caps for that setup or even possibly real world money given your reaction but it needed to be done
---
They'll probably add in new quests as we move along until the next big content drop happens.
---
It happens man, I quit for like 2-3 months but came back and I‚Äôm
---
More addicted than ever. We hope to have u back one day!
---
No I havent - which is a pain as you dont seem to be able to "buy" all the items with the badges you can earn
---
Sometimes I can
---
Like see what the other stars on a legendary are?
---
This sounds like what lead to me getting in the free candy van, and all the horrors that followed.
---
Honestly, two seconds at the sheepsquatch quest and you'll get it.
---
Feel sorry for those who bought the two most duped items out there with real world money. The pain must be immense.
---
As far as I know it‚Äôs still bugged and doesn‚Äôt work.
---
If that's what you want to do, go for it. The problem is, a weapon without a single card in damage can outdamage it's TSE maximum damage perk cards counterpart simply by using a sneak attack build instead.
---
If you want to go raw damage, fuck the game mechanics, a bloodied build may be better for you.
---
Darn tooting. And I should be able to rent equipment.
---
I created a separate circuit just for my vending machine and put the switch too high to reach, way up on a tree that was in my back yard -- I love that you can use terrain items like that as part your build. Then when I wanted to turn off the power, I did it via a terminal that was locked in the building with my fusion generator.
---
Oh, I do. We all all like to take a break from playing from time to time and kite monsters now that we can't shoot houses ourselves.
---
The chaos it causes makes it easier to steal from CAMPs too
---
Now just need a list of all the answers to the questions on the exams.
---
I just find them as more lazy "chore" quests. Where's the interesting story content?
---
What happened to the magic bullet machine that was supposed to come out? I'm holding on to ballistic ammo hopefully to scrap then make .308 or 5mm bullets.
---
Although a bit of a grind, I have to say I‚Äôve enjoyed it all so far. The backpack is really handy too.
---
What is this 10% everyone is talking about?
---
Yea. I saw a 3 star weapon but I didn‚Äôt buy it because I have no idea what the other stats are.
---
Probably just ughs and grunts.
---
First. You find rock bottom. Since you've found this subreddit, I'll assume you know what it looks like.
---
As we all do.
---
No, I'm telling you it isn't a "problem" or even a "bug" that needs to be fixed as some people are complaining.  It's a part of the feature and it's not something they're ever going to "fix" because that's just how the game works.
---
No real world money and no caps either. Months of bartering on other subs with legendaries I've spent lots of time farming. How come so many people on this sub think they know so much about someone based on one post? Maybe I'm upset because this is my favorite game and it's my hobby that I enjoy very much? How about that instead?
---
I've actually found server hoping to be difficult lately it just keeps sending me back to the same one 80% of the time you can tell by the player names and already nuked zones
---
Couldn't agree more. And not only do I love selling stuff to people without the need to use trading forums, but I also love hopping from CAMP to CAMP, seeing what people have built and actually interact with some of them, if they're around. I mean those are some real life traders! Better than an NPC!
---
There is no balance in this game and every nerf or "correction" shrinks the variety further. Theres only 2 viable builds and both are bloody. Not to mention its all done to appease the PvP users/griefers. Its funny though how so many people look down on explosive gun users yet 1 shotting things in melee is totally cool and acceptable. If the guns had better balance we wouldnt all use explosive or anti armor.
---
What items are those?
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to get anyone to do down since the patch making doing two of my challenges incompatible, is anyone else experiencing this?
---
I can
---
Awesome, lol. Thanks guys! I wasn't sure, I don't want people to think my camp looks whack, yo.  
---
I need to build a secondary building or something for my shop now, cuz as of now I just threw it up on the rocks in front of my generators.
---
What's the most popular stable flux? Violet?  I might start selling as well.
---
Aae shotguns and sent-cav armors
---
The jetpack is purely for fun, with marsupial you're better off picking Emergency Protocols if you're running a bloodied build, and you can get all that outside of PA. PA replaces your armor. You move slower, can only interact with certain things, stagger when you jump, have to maintain a constant supple of fusion cores, can't use fist weapons.
---
That's what I mean and everyone's giving me shit and insinuating I've spent real world money on my character
---
You should see the high level mark VII turrets those bastards fire explosive rounds
---
I think that means you‚Äôre trying to put too much weight into that machine. Not sure though.
---
Is your stash box full or almost full?
---
one of which types? please explain for those of us outside your echochamber
---
Dey terk eer serloooo
---
I have to agree with the shotgun part. I went from two shotting super mutants to having to empty an entire mag from my combat shotgun and still not killing them sometimes if they are wearing armor. Mirelurk Queen was a real eye opener. Each hit was dealing almost no damage, even in VATS. I used to kill them in under 10 shots.
---
Well I don't have an AAE Shotgun and I've traded legendaries I've farmed myself for every armor piece I have.
---
I‚Äôve got a friend who will be starting the game soon.
---
I made him a heavily modified level 1 auto pipe rifle so he could mow down shit as he left the vault.
---
Then realised that I don‚Äôt have any .38 rounds because I either don‚Äôt pick them up or drop them on super mutants.
---
Been farming for the past 3 days...
---
If u could bulk them tho id buy the lot from u.
---
Go wc and came back as nuke is on ground. Problem solved.
---
That‚Äôs how I see it, not everyone is gonna be happy that way but I‚Äôve had more interaction in one day than I have all the others combined... and they didn‚Äôt try to blow up my base!!
---
My armor outside of PA is all BoS Heavy Combat Armor and my DR sits right at 400 and 500 ER. If radiation resistance wasn't broken then I would have about 100 rad resist and a radshield would help cover the difference.
---
It's not a challenge. It's just boring lazy content. Go kill thus, go collect this. I want some actual story. I much preferred the sheepsquatch quests. At least they gave me some enjoyment.
---
Sometimes it works, other times it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Dammit, yes, but that doesn‚Äôt make sense cause some of it is coming from my actual stash.
---
My heart skipped a beat when I saw this, but I realized it was just a request. Bwom bwom ;-;
---
(having the same trouble smh)
---
Dont you bring anti armor into this...
---
There‚Äôs another post that says that it only works when the owner is near
---
The answer was pulls up by the way, lol
---
Anyone need a revive buddy on ps4? PSN: Chavous24 ... I need to revive someone
---
The wastelands suddenly became much friendlier. 
---
*tips hat to Bethesda.
---
I've been  checking the same 3 spots for like an hour and nothing still.
---
Queen of The Hunt... That would be nice.
---
Last time I did that daily must have been February.
---
I need to roll a new toon to do dailies in The Mire and I can do them only once.
---
*sigh*
---
That would suck. It‚Äôd Be cool to hear someone speaking normally in a mile miner suit.
---
Don't worry bloodied and melted nerf are probably coming. Now that most people will be flocking to it
---
The type that speaks for everyone else and hypocritically accuses others of transgressions they're guilty of themselves
---
Ricky, I already racked up -50 karma for a similar post earlier today.   Just wanted to join yours to continue the hot neg rep action.
---
Honestly I never seem to have a problem with them I'm always getting them I actually dropped 20 of then the other week because I had accumulated 50.  And for some reason I always find more that I use.
---
It's really weird and I only have the first perk of the make them last longer one
---
No, but I think Yao Gais are nightmares. I saw a 45 YG take down an albino DC that was 68 if I recall. It was close, but not close enough.
---
At best I can jump in the air using marsupial, then aim myself at the mob and hit the run key, it drops me faster and if lucky I can Pain Train them if I hit correctly. But it'd be nice if this was an added effect, not the only one. Ah well, at least there's the 'Clang!', I'll do with that right now.
---
Check challenges. Now you need to do 8 for increased carry weight mod. Probably nobody have it yet.
---
Its shared with your stash. Its annoying so try carrying stuff on your person or shred some of those heavy legendarys
---
Hahaha
---
I've been to a lot more, I can't see any.  Are you running mods by any chance?  I'm wondering if one of my three mods might be conflicting with something.
---
I played it just fine from day one. I literally don't know what people's problem was and think most people were (and continue to) lie about this game on the Internet because of their "epic trullz lolz" or whatever.
---
Honestly I just find it boring. I want some story, not a checklist of things to do.
---
Once u put it in the vending machine it goes to your stash which adds stash weight so take sum things out of your stash to add things to your vending
---
and the verdict is GUILTY
---
No. Some people ran into issues, but most people were jumping on a troll bandwagon and many of the issues that people talked about on here were absolute fictions.
---
Someone posted that items in vending machine take camp budget.
---
They're certainly extermely calculated in how/when this info is coming to light. No chance this thread gets a bethesda replied tag.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt put it out with your boot, Ted!‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs one of the things I got too, that the budget for this CAMP has been exceeded.
---
Yeah I'm about to delete this post. I didn't realize how much most people on this sub find pleasure in being dicks
---
It would. But by the time we come of the vault the mole miners have devolved too far. If she does have human speech it would be cool.
---
That's what I prefer,  though I'm open to adventure as well
---
Mine is still there, or it was. Gonna have to make sure tomorrow now and screen shot it just incase.
---
Lol well you can't damage them with weapons anymore if they are set to passive , and if you wanna go thru that much trouble to nuke my camp, and watch me as I change servers  have at it
---
The sky is the limit
---
At pioneer camp, or camp adams where new event: camfire tales hapens.
---
if everyone had a headset or the game had text chat it would be way easier to do these things.
---
Friends don't let friends use the "Z" shaped stairs.
---
The " \\ " shaped stairs are much more reliable.  If you ever need to move them, like others have said, just drop a foundation next to your house, slap on a temporary stairs to support the upper floor, make sure all floors are linked together by another floor (and not a roof panel used as a floor), and make your move.  Then wreck out any temporary supports.
---
Yeah I tried that and so does everyone else I've done 4 since the Scout quest and everyone runs to help the downed person and no-one wants to be a pylon anymore.
---
Is or should be? I wouldn't be surprised if it just didn't get a drop assigned to it or didn't make it in patch (like how we had camera challenges even though cameras got pushed back in the previous update).
---
Not being a fan of rap I never undetermined ‚Äúhaters gonna hate‚Äù until my time here.
---
Lol thank you I humbly accept
---
Nice! Now it‚Äôs time to pop to an armour workbench and craft a better backpack than the reward one. The crafted has a much better carry weight.
---
Found one...there's the ridge directly to the east of Prickett's Fort, run along the ridge, nice spot there that I have mine.
---
Anyone on PS4 selling Talons, twisted Muscles, Scaly Skin, or adrenal reaction? Been hopping for a few hours looking for someone.
---
P.s. sorry to highjack the thread
---
I was considering making a list of the ones I know, but there's a lot of questions for each exam, and they're taken from a random pool, so it'd be difficult to have something entirely comprehensive unless the community chips in to cover the ones I've missed. I'll see what I can do. :)
---
A lot of people did buy those and now are very very salty. The shotgun nerf is pretty heavy handed. I tested with my bloodied shotguns, they still do well but I need to get a lot closer to the targets than before.
---
Another event too
---
https://youtu.be/7AYNHiYewXo
---
It could be an event all it's own. Gain notoriety as some kind of communist, then survive liberty prime for a certain amount of time long enough for his battery to wear out and then they loot him for mininukes or something like that.
---
In its current form, all it does is tell you when a daily contact, like big or the scout masters are off cool down.
---
For that reason I didn't set up a shop yet. First, I need to clear my camp. Imo items shouldn't take camp and stash space. Both are not that big.
---
Couldn't they have just made all builds at least somewhat on par with each other and buffed the enemies? Wouldn't everyone have liked a little more of a challenge instead of making certain builds irrelevant?
---
PERK BUGS:   
---
Weapon and Armor repair bug. Just at the same time repair kits ship into the game.
---
The majority of this sub wants the game to be a Minecraft clone, so you won't find much discussion here. Most of them don't even understand what griefing is and think any form of PVP on Adventure is griefing.
---
There's nothing wrong with your formatting. They just can't read anything larger than a paragraph unless it's in bullet point format. As for your point, you are correct. I don't even use a shotgun build, and you're correct. The nerf was pointless on what was arguably the most balanced build in the game. Guess Bethesda was bored
---
Maybe she'll talk like ET? Or Wanda from fairly odd parents. I'm chill with either. Mole miner grunts are fine too.
---
Ah thank you!
---
Not worth it. Cant wear it in power armor. Pass.
---
I was walking when two level 20 mongrels came and killed me, as I tried time and time to get my loot they kept killing me every time. It was all the junk that I had since the start of the game.
---
Saw a vendor today, charged 1000 caps for stable flux.
---
Well I don't use power armor soooo.
---
Ever?
---
Nah, they came out a couple updates ago, the new repair bug was introduced when they fixed the Grognak's axe repair to 200% issue
---
Yeah its working fine so far. I ask people to help me do the revive an ally thing - then I don't revive them and I wait for them to give up and I pick up their junk which I later sell at my vending machine.
---
Thanks bethesda
---
Oooooh nice. These new challenges are ridiculous lol.
---
Yeah its definitely the most valuable
---
Never had a need for it.
---
I've yet to even start that quest and I'll need help too, so you wanna team up and help each other? GT is Jjinsaru
---
Errrr..?
---
&gt; I don't see any harm in letting us build more stuff
---
Don't you? Do you really not?
---
I would love bigger budgets too - but harm includes server load, issues in streaming data, framerates and memory constraints.     
---
Don't get me wrong - I'd love them to work on this, but it's not going to be as easy as changing a number.
---
you can inspect them.. but the Camp's owner has to be close enough
---
Nope, they can't be traded nor dropped
---
After 4 months you got your money‚Äôs worth.
---
Do we have to kill 2 Yao Gaui's with shotguns?
---
It‚Äôs for one of the scout challenges
---
Throw super duper on top of that and dilute them and your swimming in caps and stims.
---
Thank the you
---
did you guy's do this, did you find a easy way ?
---
Tried jumping of that bridge at Charleston Harald, didn't kill me :(
---
Any good ider's ?
---
Some are just retarded, you can't do anything about it.
---
I have no problem killing people, never had. Now the field is even but there are no incentives
---
Ok. Well then congrats on your backpack. Its perfect for you if you dont use power armor. I need power armor though or i get mauled. I use it when i fight high level enemies or else i wont make it. Lol
---
the collections tab seems glitched. check at a trade-in machine
---
After hearing about this patch I was looking forward to it and I was going to play tonight. 
---
After seeing this, I think I will just be frustrated and I will just play Skyrim instead 
---
Maybe with the next patch they will remove the Ally requirement
---
I thought you were no longer allowed to grief people‚Äôs bases unless in combat in adventure. Am I wrong?
---
I must've got lucky. I had more trouble getting the stupid bloat fly gland for the one quest.
---
I dislike this whole quest line. It's so tedious..
---
I think....you put the vendor down.....and power it up..... don‚Äôt quote me on that I could be wrong
---
I don't even use armor. For the most part I avoid getting hit.
---
Def was working for me. And didn‚Äôt stop nobody from giving me caps for mine ü§ë
---
I wasnt sure if the 30% chance was worth the 3 perk points.
---
With foundations thing the funny thing is if you fast travel again after it loads then it puts you like in it properly (happened to me yesterday). They just need to introduce a damn load delay for character to let buildings load first. When the game is allowed to load in buildings it apparently works fine as is.
---
BROOOOO GET OVER HERE
---
Yes! This right here. I've got an IE Combat &amp; Pump Action, FE Combat Shotgun, ME Combat &amp; Pump Action and an EE Pump Action. Also I've got all Vanguard's Cavalier Heavy Combat armor except for a leather left leg. If people were buying these items with real world money then they'd have been heavily duped and there'd be a whole lot more of these items on r/Market76. Some people automatically assumed I spent real money on what I've got and that's why I'm upset.
---
Okay let me explain this another way.
---
You have a choice between 1, 1.5, and 4.  One being the bought repair kit.  4 being old weapon artisian with the damage/armor bonus.
---
People said 1 wasnt worth spending money on.  Instead of making 1 better or cheaper they made 4 a 2 so now you have the choice of 1/1.5/2.  While 2 is of course better. It is only marginally better now and requires you to farm up mats to use bringing the already marginal difference closer.
---
Again they made the worst open look better by making the best option worse.  Clever if you've never seen it before.
---
gone in the in game trade menu as well
---
Obviously not! That's an error on my part, sorry. That's supposed to be "pipe syringer." If there's any obvious mistakes, you just need to compare them to the challenges list in-game to find out the proper thing to do. I'll edit the list now to fix that, though.
---
Do you still need to do this? I'm down if you help me out with it
---
There are hundreds of posts stating the vendor has to be near his camp for you to look at descriptions. Does nobody browse for answers before making a post.
---
I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a bug...I‚Äôll give it a try tonight to confirm, ty for the info üòä
---
Smooth. I am not that agile or quick. Still dont quite get the game mechanics. I see people with mutations jumping and running super high and fast. Im lost on that stuff. I need someone to walk me through it cause i get my ass handed to me without power armor. Even then... I take alot of damage
---
Camp Adams
---
This!
---
Go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmbktm/spoilers_tadpole_exam_answers/) for the complete list of answers.
---
Well I appreciate your saying that. I just didn't understand the immediate negative wave I recieved immediately after posting.
---
last time i checked mine, i was at 299. (1 leftover in the exchange machine)
---
what level would you recommend one to start the pioniers quest? im gonna start a new character soon and would like to have a backpack as soon as possible.
---
Yup, also the language barrier is a problem when you are playing from outside US.
---
And, of course, from the point of view of Liberty Prime, everybody except the Enclave are communists.
---
I'd love to find a steady supply of low level legendaries. Starting a new character and legendaries are hard to get if you don't  want to tick people off going to white springs for lvl 5 legendaries. I still go, but wait until the place is empty so as not to lower the enemies for high level players or get lvl 60+ ghouls mobbing me.
---
I don't have any mutations. I just like giving my character an objective RP wise. Like I don't even use my stash box. Everything is on me. And now that they added player vending and backpacks I can be a one person caravan.
---
I was addicted to mentats, so I dont know if that played into it.
---
If you put it at anything above 2000, it‚Äôs just better to go to the bunker.
---
What I am understanding is that you are saying is that weapon artisan no longer repairs to 200%? 
---
It worked just fine last night for me, or am I not understanding something here?
---
Well I don't know concrete numbers but when making stims using about 20 blood packs I've seen it proc practically every other craft. Though annoyingly you only hear it proc once and when you exit the crafting menu it'll make the sound a bunch of times.
---
I also have four luck for various other cards so swapping it in when crafting isn't much of a problem.
---
You absolute madman.
---
Even though I do enjoy older rap &amp; hip-hop you're still absolutely right about this sub. The initial reaction was just absurd.
---
i literally have a sign next to them that says "Free Water" in glowing Neon lights. cannot steal something that is being given away
---
You‚Äôre a little late for that.
---
But it requires hacking terminals, not locks.
---
Try closing the build menu when you get that error and reopen.
---
That usually fixes that error for me
---
A minecraft clone? What the fuck are you even talking about? I use a tse shotgun, and yeah enemies are 2-3 as opposed to the 1 they were two days ago. Big fucking deal. As a shotgun build, who used my gun for unspeakable horrors out there, they needed to be nerfed. And I dont think you were here 20 minutes ago before he edited the old format out, it was quite fucky.
---
 I agree, I‚Äôm on this game all the time. I even got a new PC when it came out so i could run it at max graphics.
---
One problem completely unrelated too the game and more the fault of some of the community around this game tho.
---
3 of my friends whom originally enjoyed the game stopped playing so they could be part of the ‚Äúpopular opinion‚Äù of ‚Äúthis game is trash Bethesda u suck‚Äù
---
Me now tho: SO WHAT THE FRICK DO I DO WITH MY 12 CHARISMA NOW!?
---
Nice! Everyone has a playstyle. I like it!
---
Most of the people that can afford to buy ammo use 5.56 though.
---
Almost for sure new ranks will come in future updates. This patch has been hugely popular. Probably even more popular than fasnacht
---
I love it lol makes things crazy challenging.
---
I started studying CS because I was inspired by the dedication to quality I saw from blizzard, and I was hoping to join one of their dev teams after college, but their recent issues have been really discouraging.
---
I spoke for other people under the assumption that I've been on this sub long enough and talked to enough people to have a rough idea of what the general audience is like. I could have been wrong, but based on the other reactions here, it seems like this time I wasn't. I also don't see any accusations being thrown around
---
Yeah i might end up doing that. Unlock the perk cards after lvl 50 and just swap when Im crafting.
---
Anyone on Xbox want to team up to compete the revive quest? GT: LogicalFlux
---
I didn't expect to one shot most enemies except lower to mid level. Taking 2 mags to kill an MQ doesn't bother me but not even a 4th of her health in that time is crazy
---
Had no idea the quest meant game challenges, been looking at the camp for the past 30 minutes for anything that would help.
---
I think you can either pick a lock to a door or extractor and initiate combat with the camp, I'll be testing this theory out shortly.
---
I was thinking about this the other day. Going through Abbie's quest into Harper's Ferry. I've got level 3 lockpick and hacking, started just doing that to get in... But then I was like "Wait a sec, did they really gate this quest by perk cards?"
---
Nope! You don't get a "perception" prompt, or an "agility" check, in an annoying popup *telling* you what you see and do; because you can look for yourself and totally vault right over some of the security gates.
---
So can we meet up? I‚Äôll be online for the next few hours.
---
Seriously? That's mad. The whole point of Player Vendors is that you dont HAVE to be there to sell stuff.
---
Bethesda y u do this
---
If every piece of content in the game was story focused it would be boring as fuck.
---
I've been asking for a refund every month ever since the game came out
---
Can already do what?
---
I‚Äôd buy it.
---
I was at 149 and then I logged on today and it's gone. So I'm not sure. I'm hesitant to trade in more atm.
---
I think they should do that, instead of nerfing everything. I think that would make everything fun and fair in pop and pve
---
I was part of a clusterfuck of players all punching each other and trying to res each other in 12 inches of water today...great gameplay, lol...
---
I've spent all my caps just serving hopping and checking camps and sales.
---
Gotta stick back up now.
---
Great update.
---
Mentats is one of my addictions as well üòâü§ôüèª
---
12 inches is 30.48 cm
---
My water purifiers, like all my resource collectors are unlocked, for a reason.
---
It kind if takes away from the surprise of coming across one though. But being able to sell stuff off for cheap to help lower levels is neat. I just wish my first camp could have been saved, but one of the updates killed that location, it was the coolest basement and all 6 floors! If only fast traveling charges when people come to my camp went into my pocket... that's not a bad idea eh?
---
Yep I was stuck on that for probably about 10 minutes when the quest first dropped just have to go into your challenges list down to world challenges and you should find them all there you can even tag them to make it easier to complete
---
That's basically how I treat all my crafting cards.
---
Super duper procs ALOT more than that 30% makes you think and when you have it equipped and are starting from tick blood you can make a lot of stims in half the time.
---
It's easier to nerf the one or two things that blatantly stand out as overpowered than to buff all 20-something others to be in line with it. At least bloodied melee has trade-offs, and especially in nuke zones or against higher level enemies it's prone to more maintenance activities and the risk of getting one shot out of nowhere.
---
Hey you out there in the cold 
---
Getting lonely getting old 
---
Can you feel me?
---
I didn't think it that. Clever.
---
Hi there
---
Sure, the shotgun took a big hit, I get that
---
But the ass/sent/cav gear needed nerfing
---
Some guy at a train station baited me to pvp by asking to clear their 5c bounty
---
Guy was immortal when I hit him. Blasted me away, took 120caps and reported me on xbox live for calling him a twat
---
This is the world we live in
---
You can lock terminal
---
If you are supposed to be award badges for the repeatable quests that would explain how we can purchase all the new plans from the scout vendor machines - at the moment from just completing the badge challenges it is impossible to purchase all items
---
Took a lot longer than I thought, you still on by any chance
---
Where do you go to farm ticks? I found a unmarked shack near Harpers Ferry that spawns up to 8 ticks.
---
&gt; e found 3 broken quest cameras, fixed them at a tinker bench, and gave them to poor souls already. They show up as weapons.
---
&gt; Found 2 on scorched in white springs, one on a legendary elsewhere.
---
Are you on XBOX and will you sell it to me?
---
Yeah I'd buy .556 just so I dont have to wait hours at the ammo factory
---
There's multiple locations I started looking for him yesterday and eventually found him by server hoping
---
if you are on xbox i'll give you 1300 caps for that gatling gun
---
Have you tried playing it recently?
---
I saw 3000 each at one camp this morning 
---
Best part was the seller had like 10 of each to choose from.
---
I acquired most of my muts for free just bathing in a rad pool by Backwater Mine.  The only two mutationsI actually purchased was marsupial and adrenal reaction.
---
Hmm. All 3 of our rifles went up disproportionately. Different percentages, apparently.
---
That's great help I hate the new tests thank you so so much.
---
I haven‚Äôt done this mission yet, but have you tried taking your armor off and throwing a grenade at your feet?
---
I was talking mods, i.e. pocketed leather armor sets, hunting rifles, etc.
---
Put the spawn location in a sealed room.
---
Sounds good I‚Äôll hit you up when I‚Äôm done with work if your on will play threw the quest right quick
---
I was at 0... sold a legendary, back to over 150.
---
It's like the caps amount at the vendors bug, but backwards.
---
Oh ok. My bad. Apologies!
---
Ooooh I'm sorry wise old sage. Can you ever forgive me?  I didn't know they appointed you chairman of this sub and you were so important. Maybe I should know my place huh? After the initial wave of unmitigated and cynical hate I received most people commenting have something constructive to say and have been in agreement with me at least in part. Your assumption has failed you so if you don't mind please take your soapbox and kick rocks.
---
I also call my turds ‚ÄúCharleston heralds‚Äù
---
Bodkin point for shooting people in armor.
---
Person who makes bows is a bowyer.
---
A online possible spawn point location guide would be your best bet.
---
I found Anne's body at the base of the mothman statue.
---
I was hoping they'd show up on the uniform. But whatever finally stuff to do that can't be done in 10 minutes. although wish I had more space for photos. playing on xb1 and having to constantly delete photos gets kind of annoying.
---
No shit. That's awesome
---
And what's next? Bloodied, melee, antiarmor?  They are all the same, one shot everything.
---
Sorry, I'm on PC. Good to know people are willing to pay double the amount I'm asking for it, though :P
---
And you actually downvote my reply? You're a sad, sad individual.
---
nope i have the badge, but my friends have the same problem, try to change server it just work
---
I have been selling bobbles like hot cakes. Of course im selling at about half the rocommended sell prices just to reduce my stash.
---
Can confirm.
---
Then why complain about fast travel costs?
---
Hopefully it will be fixed soon, it is annoying. To be fair if I find an instigating rifle I can use for sniping and I can afford it I'm buying it regardless of what else it is lol.
---
I have enough badges to get the possum backpack but super hesitant. It's probably just a reskinned tadpole bag.
---
It used to give bonus armor and bonus melee damage on top of the 200% repair.
---
It says camp is full but it‚Äôs actually your stash being at limit.
---
I feel ya brotha I‚Äôm almost off now.
---
I hit the moonshiners shack by 76 then head down to the mill, can normally get anywhere from 4-8.
---
Then I hit up Big Maw near Berkeley Springs and can grab about 5-6.
---
I also only have butcher's bounty at 1* so you will probably net more blood then me.
---
Yes, played for about 30 mins before i uninstalled this piece of shit game. It's optimized like ass.   
---
Bethesda promised me a new leather duffel bag shipped to my door. They never sent it. I've had enough. All i ask for is 80$ out of the 300$ i spent for this scam of a game.
---
wouldn't be surprised if you got more if you post on a trading sub. im trying to get one of each gatling and meat hook, kinda have an addiction, lol.
---
I get what you're saying but couldn't they have did more buffing to make things more even and make enemies more challenging instead? Also I don't understand how so many people on this sub have such a high sense of self importance.
---
Lol if we could shoot the locks off a vault door or bash it in, it would be a pretty shit nuclear bomb shelter.
---
I'm with you. Glad to have something I can take a while to work on and not just finish in less than an hour.
---
Tadpole lvl20 is 30 but if you recreate it at lvl 50 you get 60 carry weight
---
Great. I‚Äôm not crazy. Thanks for confirming.
---
I did the event and bow have 3 possum badges. I didn't have any before
---
I mean we do that now with explosive weapons to people‚Äôs walls. What would change?
---
Well, with mmorpgs you can generally expect different builds to be nerfed or buffed in different ways going with the overall response of the players as the game progresses. 
---
So from now on we just start feed this disinformation and complain about how stalkers stuff is overpowered...that'll teach them
---
2 shot combat shotgun, 2 shot rifle for 200ish each
---
Fasnacht masks for 10 caps each
---
Is there any way to get them besides buying at whitesprings?
---
The realest MVP right here!
---
It means your stash is full. Since it‚Äôs limited to 800/800, and stores selling items in your stash. Move stuff outta your stash and then sell them
---
Why would they think it works differently than the vendor pricing that's already in game....you wouldn't go to a pet food aisle in a store and buy the entire rack of cat food
---
I left a computer out in my open bar area.. so when people visit they can jump on and change the light colours..
---
Come back to fix things and they're different all the time..
---
Love how I can now see where camps are.. get inspiration from other ones you see..
---
The formatting (at least of mobile) was pretty fucking difficult to read before OP must‚Äôve corrected it, the text was white with a grey background and you could barely read it.
---
Expensive though -- up to 120,000 caps for a boy scout badge!
---
I‚Äôm skeptic all but you never know :)
---
They've definitely taken a much bumpier road to bringing balance to the game. Thank you for your civil discourse in commenting. After the initial wave of cynical hate most people have been generally constructive and pleasant
---
I‚Äôll take a swing here that your looking at it from a purely PvE position. Which is all well and good if that‚Äôs all you do, hard to see the other side. But that armor was **Broken** with a capital B, in PvP
---
As to your last paragraph, that‚Äôs the internet unfortunately. I *try* to keep my head down and not bite directly back, as you will be deemed at fault...
---
You sure that‚Äôs tadpole? The one I crafted was a ‚Äúbasic backpack‚Äù that‚Äôs the one that can be modded. As far as I see tadpole/possum are aesthetic ones with one base carry weight. Basic one is the one we‚Äôll be attaching mods and skins too for awhile I think
---
I believe it has to do with collecting the bug parts for the daily. Not 100% sure
---
Did they kill Responder Bot Greg? Or was it just some Commie asshole? The Vendor Bot was destroyed when I checked it out.
---
You can‚Äôt repair an item unless it‚Äôs destroyed, as far as I‚Äôm aware. You could always just replace it.
---
Oh, that is something I never noticed, I was certain it was only bonus longevity.
---
Ooh, does that include that new terminal they offered?
---
Thank you, I was wondering
---
While it's tedious I don't actually mind that I'm happy to take a week to finish it.  I'm in no rush I've survived this long without a backpack I'll live it's just harder when they force you into relying on other people as well
---
Trying to sell*
---
Items you‚Äôre selling are stored in your stash so even if you have the vending slot available you still need the stash space.
---
Do... Which part mate?
---
I'm only level 24 and haven't found many plans.. are there planters or anything of any kind or do we just have to plant our crops in the dirt? My dirt is on a hill, so half my crops just float and it looks so bad.
---
They can't be traded. Only way to get one is do the challenges.
---
How do we get upstairs now? I couldn't find any keycards.
---
Yah I know lol. The previous answer was the last one and that‚Äôs what auto selected when I went to the next.
---
That defeats the purpose of the update
---
Ikr, someone tried selling a troubleshooters power fist for 10k earlier
---
You mean via vending machine or this subreddit?
---
Not bad.
---
You display pioneer values through completing challenges (located in your world challenges where you find your dailies and weeklies). You'll see each challenge has multiple parts to complete. You'll also see that the changes reward a Scout badge instead of atoms. You need to complete 3 for the Tadpole quest. Hope this helps.
---
You're correct on that end. I knew certain builds like Bloodied and melee were so overpowered before they released the Survival beta that I knew I wouldn't have a reasonable opportunity for being successful in that situation.
---
As far as the cynics and jackasses I can't help but bite back.
---
Each type of purifier is, or was pre patch, on a different timer, i got 1 big one 2 small ones and 2 ground ones.
---
You can find them in containers now as RNG drops after the patch. But you can have one if you can't find one.
---
They autoscrap, but I didn't find that out until too late last night, lol
---
That did it, was alone testing, insta died, but no option to cry for help so no one could have revived me if they where there or could they ? Not sure how that works üôÉ
---
There is daily that is supposed to activate when you get there
---
Is a robot in the house cabin thing to speak to
---
The pioneer values 1&gt;4 are
---
Pick up goo daily
---
Pick up bug parts daily
---
Revive a player
---
Get three world challenge scout  badges
---
That‚Äôs it
---
On XB, Gt is same as ID
---

---
I‚Äôm actually away from home for a few hours and may or may not be able to get on when I get back in 2-3 hours.
---
Nice to see another even keel dude. OutRage culture annoys me to.
---
Did you drink a rad ant lager?  It gives +50 carry weight for some amount of time (2 mins? 5 mins? haven't actually used one) and could have worn off right as you were logging off (or you got the hangover from it that gives you -50 carry weight). That's my best guess since you had an exact difference of 50 carry weight.
---
Yeah but you want to be able to do it when they‚Äôre not near, obviously. ‚ÄúDoes nobody browse for answers before making a post.‚Äù What a douchebag.
---
There are people so overpriced and underpriced it isn't even funny I bought an AAE fully molded assault rifle for 2k caps last night.
---
Dang that sucks. Do you have the bird bones mutation?
---
DJ_Dribbles
---
Yeah but what if everyone here agrees to stick to a super inflated price for rarer items? 
---
Say this thread or resource of prices gets popular and some people get super into trading and form a group or guild to roleplay traders and maintain/update this list, they could collude to set prices artificially high for items they have a monopoly on/abundance of and screw the average Joe vault dweller out of hard scavenged caps! 
---
What I am saying is... my post is a load of nonsense üòÅ
---
Probably the new way of grieving people wow take workshops. Since Bethesda took away their ability to take over the workshop and kill people from across the map
---
Irradiated thistle for... medicinal purposes.
---
I just want to make my AA +Vats crits handmade explosive, please Bethesda
---
The game is too unstable, it took months for is to get to 800. For it to work currently they would have to partition the existing allocation into a separate, in exanple, 700 camp budget and 100 vendor. 
---
Good news is they are still looking to expand stash space. Personally I hope that increase is dedicated to a shared inventory between our characters. (I don't have mules, sincerely)
---
Do you still require further clarification after multiple people telling you that monsters can still damage your base?
---
Logged in earlier and mine was gone, logged out and back in and it was back so idk
---
There‚Äôs a farm near WV lumber at the north west corner of the map that has radroaches and spawns bloatflys and bloodbug or ghouls
---
Bethesda and their shitty engine can go fuck themselves. Tried to do the Camp event 4 times now and it crashes toward the final wave.
---
I get that. But being as how I just loaded 30 items with prices I'd love to be able to repair it. Literally has like 1/50th of health left.
---
Just ranting/suggesting.
---
I completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from. It‚Äôs personally not my ideal sort of dlc but it‚Äôs the sort of dlc the game needs. Even ifs it‚Äôs a grind it adds a lot of content that can be done at the end game, or while questing. And this is the kind of thing that keeps players logging in and staying invested in the game so I support the dlc even if I don‚Äôt necessarily love it, hope that makes sense.
---
Sure. I won't be on until a little later. GT is same as ID.
---
Haven't started the scout quests yet, got too caught up in vending last night. What is it for specifically?
---
Nope, but the missing option to cry for help might just pop up if somone is around ?
---
I love them.
---
I figured it out..... Bandolier for some reason affected my electromagnetic cartridges before the update but don't now. Which makes sense, I never understood why they were affected before hand but I used accepted it lmao, I guess it was a bug that was fixed haha
---
It's currency like cash should up next to caps
---
I was so busy setting my camp up (Vending machine) I forgot I bought the new PA skin and didn't make it last night lol to busy :)
---
i mean youre paying more in fast travel costs then youd pay for water if youd buy it.
---
If you are using Google Sheets, highlight the cells you want to use as checkboxes, "Insert" -&gt; Checkbox. Not nearly as intuitive on mobile / idontknowhow

Same,  I tend to give away alot of shit for free.  Whenever I do I always drop a little communism poster in there.

no problem

Unlikely. Devs aren't likely to use a name that announces who they are, unless they're acting in official capacity

---
Casual gamer.  r/Fo76FilthyCasuals for you
---
Yes the first backpack you get is the tadpole, labeled standard backpack with a tadpole skin.
---
Now send it to the boys at nukacrypt to bake into their website  
---
THIS IS AWESOME! Thank you.
---
Okay, yeah I used to do the Moonshiner shack, and lumber mill run. I found doing the unmarked shack is a little quicker because I tend to have to search for the ticks at the mill, and you cut down on traveling time just running to the one spot. The only issue is since its unmarked when you server hop itll spawn you at the closest marked location which is treetops. Have to run for about 10 seconds to get to the shack. If you look at the map it is right where the railroad and creek both end just west of treetops.
---
Thanks everyone for your suggestions
---
Boo hoo hoo. Get a better rig? Lmao.
---
Justifiable ranting but I think they‚Äôre your only choices. Would be nice if you repair intact structures in the future but unless I‚Äôm missing somthing too there are no other ways :(
---
Sorry. That question was kind of irrelevant, I was curious as to how you didn‚Äôt die from the fall. I think jumping is your best bet but somehow you can‚Äôt commit suicide. 
---
I am not sure how you can do it. Sorry.
---
oh no, i have a couple rippers that actually work. now i'm sad

---
Seems to be my takeaway of it too.
---
No one likes the shitheap.
---
Kind a balanced by the fact that combat armour can weight quite a bit while PA is weightless as long as you wear it.
---
Liberty Apples
---
Yeah you just have to plant them in the dirt. Also they do often basically float, so they do look awkward.
---
If you modify it with tadpole skin is it called pioneer scout tadpole backpack
---
My main characters CAMP was near mount Blair for a long ass time, ended up moving to the savage divide though for a more central location
---
That would definitely explain why I was getting killed a lot more last night. Had gotten used to just powering through stuff and damn!
---
Thanks for this!!!!! I was wondering if this could haooen.
---
The Xur of F76. I'd be good with that. 
---
Though, it'd have to be fixed, but different per person. Else it'd lose its value
---
As far as I know. It‚Äôs bugged. But there is a fossil in the hills north of alpine river cabins. Directly. Roth of the ‚Äú88‚Äù road sign on the map. Should see a cooking station there.
---
Squanchbeast mission. People get injured all the time. Just heal someone. Worked for me.
---
Athlete exam answers are wrong I guess.
---
I hope the game didn't say the Japanese Giant Salamander is the largest lizard, as it's an amphibian and the second largest amphibian next to the Chinese Giant Salamander. Komodo dragon would be the largest lizard, which is a about double the size of rather salamander.
---
What a shit answer.

All rise has a mod you can't get on other super sledge that's why, but without the good legendary effects I threw mine away
---
The scaling is weird sometimes, if its happening too often just switch servers and it should correct. Someone else can probably tell you how the scaling works but my best guess it it scales to the highest level player in the area
---
Thank you for not asking if it‚Äôs worth playing again lol. Welcome back :)
---
Doesn't matter. i saw people play with an RTX 2080 Ti and the game still run to 32 fps. It wasn't the CPU it wasn't the RAM it's just the fact that this game is a mess.
---
Well that's a bummer.. would be nice to have almost foundation like blocks that are dirt planters so we can even our farms out.
---
There's no point in looking for it. Just pick a known spawn location and server hop it. Even if you hate server hoping, it's the only way to get it quickly. Took me an hour and a half. Just watch something while doing it.
---
Lmao I can't say where you can 100% find him cuz idk where. He spawns in different locations so just server hop till you find him
---
I've always had a bar (for at least 2 months) 
---
So I mainly sell alcohol, mags, bobbles, cola, plans, and mods.
---
Also got faschnat masks.
---
Dailies from the two scout robots can give 1 badge too. It's the very first reward I got yesterday.
---
Can‚Äôt speak for Bloodied, but melee has serious draw backs and doesn‚Äôt really need nerfing
---
Getting as close as you need to on big monsters like Sheepsquatch, Deathclaw, Yao Goi, Super mutant etc... basicaly anything you can‚Äôt outright oneshot; 
---
You‚Äôre armor condition gets absolutely mauled along with the chance you‚Äôre going to get stun locked into knock-back animations and subsequently die
---
As for Bloodied Melee... Well, I‚Äôm sure that would be rectified by a tweak of Bloodied‚Äôs numbers
---
I remember one underwater in a big hole in the mire. Don't remember exactly where. And another one in Lucky Hole mine.
---
Ah gotcha. So the possum backpack is really just a skin on top of basic as well presumably?
---
Yes it is
---
Did you go to the correct machine. I know it‚Äôs a dumb question but....
---
Dont forget mama dolces stew now doesnt spoil
---
i do, just below lewisburg station, hardly anyone stops by.
---
Should have been fixed months ago, before anything new was added to the atomic shop, and long before any new content.
---
The best I‚Äôm hoping for is grunts like the other mole miners but with newly recorded sounds for that little bit of extra effort and not just copy pasted voice from her mole kin.
---
I usually have a single purifier locked for myself and all rest unlocked. This way I know there will be water, but I can also help travelers in need.
---
A camp location is not necessarily lost for ever ! My camp was near the black bear outpost, and since patch 6, the game said I can't have my camp at this location and gave me a free relocation. 
---
But I didn't get my camp back until patch 8, and when I logged in last Tuesday... My camp was here like before !
---
So these non-building area are not definitive !
---
Well, bugger.
---
The world's longest recorded living bear was Debby, a female polar bear born in the Soviet Union at some point in 1966. She died on November 17th 2008 in Canada at either age 41 or 42.
---
SGA: Don't sell purified water. Instead, get the Chemist perk and turn 1 stimpak and 1 purified water into 4 diluted stimpaks, then sell those for more than you'd get for the stimpak and the water.
---
Looks like 50 receiver update isn't complete... The variations on the 50 should also be buffed.
---
The standard .50 Receiver does more damage than the Refined .50 Receiver even though the refined one states improved damage.
---
I'd be down, GT: McChicken888888
---
Thanks I'll have to check it out.
---
Just saw another post stating they are under the cutting wheel at Mt. Blair!!
---
You can get the recipes for the serums, then they only cost 1 ultricite, 1 flux, and 3-5 junk items (antiseptic, fiberglass, oil, etc).
---
ah ok thank you
---
I think your reasoning is completely just. I love the lore that comes along too. Being a low level at the moment, I‚Äôm stoked for a broadened way to find loot.
---
Ha, I‚Äôve never seen this before. Is it new or just rare?
---
When you leave anyway can you give me your stuff? :)
---
weird! thanks for letting me know
---
Yes - this is a form of communication that is entirely written.  Precisely the situation for which children are taught to read and write.
---
Yeah, i also need help, not sure what is the best way, i am at the  spruce knob lake right now, look me up GT: Spawn3232.
---
P.S, i have a mic :)

Also strange in numbers, and herd mentality, sorry that's probably important ;)

&gt; It appears there between sunset and sunrise 
---
This is called night :D And the Event is called "Terrors of the Dark"
---
Dunno if it's just me, but since the update I can't milk the Brahmin.

They either kick me or do nothing at all. Tadpole challenge shows 0/10 milked :/

After i get home I will log into the game and will see if I have any extra unstoppable mags.
---
I remember when my main character reached level 20, it seemed to get harder for a while, but it eventually eases up.
---
You have log into the machine at the train station.  When you enter the menu you see you scrip.
---
There's also a set of bones in a shallow pool of water in the toxic valley, near the south side of Wavy Willards.
---
I just have 5 but empty them often. Same results.
---
I'm UK so that's five hours behind me so yeah that should be fine
---
And once again someone demonstrates their ignorance of terminology.
---
Market economy /= capitalism
---
Capitalism allows for one to make money through investment and rents. As in owning a company and leaching value off the labor of your employees.
---
What you are doing is just old fashioned trade not capitalism.
---
I know üòÇ I've just seen some other people talking about doing it during the day, and I wanted to point out that I do see it occuring during sunrise or sunset, where there is light still.
---
Yeah really...this has been pissing me off for awhile now, really killing the trade/vendor process...and idk why this is getting downvoted, its a legit issue and a major annoyance.
---
Nah, they were spoopy in New Vegas.. but Cazadores were fucking terrifying in comparison.
---
I'd say it's doable to solo at level 20 or so, providing you have the right gear and perks. Finding 3 challenges you can complete will be the hard part though
---
Niiice! I'll have to try on the desktop. I thought it was like creating drop-down lists, but somehow restyling them. Very cool.  Thanks!
---
A 'destroy' option pops up when you try to drop it
---
no I hopped servers and the effect persisted.
---
New Vegas: Cazadores.
---
LT in build mode.
---
I manage to get my junk around with character that doesn't work at all when overencumbered, and I have 30lbs free when I go hunting using him. Its a powerbuild so the only carry weight perk I use, bandolier, occupies 100% of my strength limit which is 1.
---
I travler from workbench to workbench, scrapping everything as I go, and return to stash immidately.
---
My scrapping nonPA window has just trippled :&gt;
---
" How are people STILL using PA outside nuke zones in the first place?  "
---
Heavy Weapons. Your welcome.
---
If it is bugged, I haven't experienced it. The Overseers quest should send you around to most of the main plot areas. If you haven't done the main quests you really should. There's lots of perks and areas you can't access without completing them.
---
...thanks alot fun police
---
I was simply making a joke.
---
Flux is the smart way to stay hydrated. Flux. Try it today. Flux. Available at a nuke zone near you.
---
Flux.
---
What if you‚Äôre only level 7
---
Someone wanna trade revives with little ole' mua on PC? If so IGN Zemunac78.
---
This is right. I'm guessing since lots of people were doing the same quests they were soawning in the high level enemies.
---
I'm with you, but server stability is already an issue as it is.
---
I‚Äôd love that since I am not always the best hunter-gatherer. Then again, with my internet being out I can‚Äôt even play so don‚Äôt mind me.
---
Via vending Machine is my best guess
---
#YOU WHAT YOU FREE STATES LIBERATOR BUILDING DISGRACE OF A MEMBER GET THE HELL OUT OF THE BUNK OR MODUS AND I WILL MAKE YOU
---
Hopefully they will change that in the future or have an option to program it.
---
Now we know the REAL reason for that insanely extended time limit on daily challenges.
---
I should've specified I meant melee in PvP. Someone with chameleon armor &amp; sneak modifiers and a little patience would be like The Predator
---
They‚Äôre intended to work, if not working it‚Äôs a bug. I‚Äôm a stealth sniper/combat rifle build and I 1-2 shot almost any build from stealth
---
yup, my food is free, but i lock my purifier so if you are thirsty go drink out of the dang pond. and watch out for the mirelurks down there.
---
Literally everyone. Deathclaws don't drop Deathclaw hide.
---
On my way, maybe we can do this all 3 of us üòÑ
---
Were at Encryptid event
---
Where can you get the recipes?
---
It may be something that drops from one of the new dailies or event? At least we've heard that the recipe for s'mores has been recieved through these.
---
Yeah, the different percentages is what's really weird
---
Oh, I was working on that one haha. Shiiiit.
---
I don't know, haven't bought it yet
---
Please, please Bethesda: dual input.
---
So a big ass terminal for something that should be in our pipboy. Got it lol.
---
And...does that money just disappear?
---
No clue but the prices I have seen are crazy, 9 radaway listed as 900 caps each
---
Omg I am so unreasonably jealous of the plastic!
---
Just use a friend you trust, or at least someone on reddit with a good karma rating. Or, the most annoying option, keep scrapping base models of the weapon/armour you want to mod until it unlocks. With player vending you could always just visit sites showing mods on their listing and hope for the best.
---
Who do you think pays the developers? Where do they get their revenue? How far do you think they allocated funds for? What would happen after the ‚Äòplanned‚Äô content reaches its end? Who pays for it then? Are they going to work for free? Perhaps common sense is not so common.
---
Making more repairs than ever, I‚Äôm getting at least twice as many attacks by scorched, liberators, mole rats ghouls and a lot of super mutant‚Äôs but at least they‚Äôre dropping caps and gunpowder so there is that lol
---
Incentivizing daily log ins is certainly part of it, but I also think it‚Äôs to ensure that legendary items don‚Äôt just disappear from the world entirely. 
---
If you could turn in as many as you want, why would anyone sell any for caps? With player vending now available it makes for some variety.
---
Amazing work, very handy.
---
One thing I've noticed: In the Tadpole tab, from Row 41 down to Row 50, when selecting the checkboxes, they cross out the text in Column C in the Row above.
---
It seems to only be in this range of Rows.
---
It also happens in the Possum tab from Row 41 down to Row 47.
---
Also for some reason Row 50 in both tabs is hidden, dunno if that's intentional or not.
---
For the tests, there's two types; there's a cabin with two terminals in it near the scout master bot you speak with to start the scout quests, and they have 5-question quizzes you need to pass for each badge. The other tests, such as the swimming test you mention, are "beat the clock" physical challenges. If you skirt around the edge of the lake, you'll find a shack that has a sort of intercom-looking thing. Activating the intercom starts the physical test (though you will need to find a swimsuit to actually start the swim test). The same sort of thing applies for the Athleticism badge; that one has three running tests done in the same fashion. Archery has one as well.
---
Spending abnormal amounts of time answering absurd questions seemingly for no reason is practically Fallout 101
---
Lol same!
---
I love seeing well made ones, unfortunately they are very rare. Too many floating monstrosities.
---
sit down and play an instrument- then put up the map  stayed on till i died from hunger :-(
---
Is base defense a thing now like fo4?
---
How docyou revive someone I water
---
I‚Äôve been trying since the patch to revive someone in water if anyone is on Xbox and needs help my gt is captain bonclay
---
Like two foot of reinforced steel difference
---
True had someone want to buy my 40 or so boiled water from me once.
---
Find them honestly i used treasure maps for mine
---
It was always just a visual bug when it happened to me.
---
Bashing enemies with it.
---
Praise be
---
Oh gosh you sold it at the vendor bot didn't you
---
Nope, they‚Äôve confirmed it‚Äôs not in the game and will be coming in the next update
---
Nice, I never considered direct sales. This will create a black market. Step one: Check out a popular player vendor. Step two: take from your stash the same items being sold and also grab a trench coat. Step three: hide in the bushes out front the vendor and say to everyone rolling up,"pssst. Wanna buy some drugs?"
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox gt captain Bonclay if anyone wants in on a murder suicide
---
The answer is below the question. Also, won't hurt to try again, maybe you've made a slight mistake.
---
lol!
---
You can buy them in the Science Wing of the Whitespring bunker, but they're very expensive.  They also used to be a rare drop from the SBQ but they removed them from her loot table recently.
---
Yep. Don't like committing without knowing the full deal.
---
Are you using the advanced conduit to go through walls? Point cursor towards top of the advanced conduit... Not at the connection point.
---
Not certain about armor but power armor was +10 to +14 per piece and 2h weapons were like +35ish damage.  Haven't checked my chainsaw but it actually made the chainsaws viable.  Took it from 2 damage to 47 damage with mods and perks.
---
I went to Morgantown with a crafted bow, killed all the ghouls and scorched I could find, then went to Charleston, you can repair the same crossbow 3 times so once you repair just kill 3-4 enemies and then repair it again.
---
just world jump at the waterpark you'll see em eventually
---
Wait it does? Thank the lord
---
Precisely hehe.
---
I'll carry the Brahmin milking issue over to this page, thought they fixed that one
---
That would make most sense. Most people are not on reddit. So most don't know the value or current market prices. But just like some items are overpriced, I'm sure we will also see major deals with some selling expensive items for pennies.
---
Or you can just play the game?
---
Not sure about your math there.
---
Hey I‚Äôll help you you help me üëçüèº
---
Alright. So only good armor to wear with the backpack is the leather armor. Other armors like the Trapper and Combat armor suffer from clipping issues. Well the trapper armor is suffering the most, as the scout backpack clips trough the Trapper backpack. 
---
Combat armors hip pouches and canteen clip trough the scout backpack. So it's better to wear either Leather armor of costume with the backpack.
---
Probably from the ground looking up
---
Im down, add me Birdjp19
---
I think there's two different tales. One where you kill the camp leader and one where there are 3 waves of bugs at the end.
---
I would say it is piss in the wind, but I guess at the end of the day it is your piss and you can do with it as you please.
---
You actually don't have to break it. Damage it barely and repair it. It counts!
---
I've been trying that.  Unfortunately, with no luck.
---
With the high cap backpack, the can probably even carry more. Like, what even is the point of PA anymore.
---
As a PA Heavy Gunner, it's pretty discouraging.
---
I had it doing the same thing and noticed that I was running on land between the two buoys; I think you can't leave the water at all during the test.
---
It's not about not being able to. I don't do it out of principal.
---
It‚Äôs a very good skin, my favourite one in the game, the metal and paint look old and worn and it‚Äôs covered in stickers
---
They are NOT guaranteed. They are more common than other creatures in certain areas but can also spawn something else.

I'll help you in just a minute. GT is bluetrav.  Still need to just revive an ally myself.

this sounds too op.
---
Atom bomb baby
---
BETH STAHP EVERYTHANG, THIS IS THAR GOLDY TIXIT!!!!
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
Same, just equip Starched genes everytime Ive gotta pop a radaway, then unequip it and go for another swim until Ive got the proper amount of extra limbs lol.
---
how do you people still support this game after a shitload of scandals?
---
Totally agree. I hate quests that are designed to be simple busy work. That‚Äôs not content. It‚Äôs boredom with extra steps.
---
Another trick for console peasants is to go into photomode and then use a rubber band to hold one of the controllers so the camera keeps spinning.
---
I use the small letters set and posters to make signs now. but it eats up camp budget and it would be nice to be able to type a message out instead of selecting and hand placing each letter.
---
Thanks everyone for the comments. I didn't realize bashing actually brought the health down of it so quickly
---
I don't know, but all the baddies seem really offended by this recent patch.
---
Currently Bethesda claims it as a "fee" for providing the vending service
---
you are a god. Thanks for making a sacrifice to go through these painful exam questions
---
Wasn't there a long-ass slideshow/tour thing with the Boomers in Vegas?
---
Adhesive, steel, ballistic fiber, screws...
---
God right. I‚Äôve gotten three new mutations in just two days. It‚Äôs wonderful
---
What?deathclaws were scary in new Vegas whether you think cazadores were worse or not. They were certainly more scary than 3‚Äôs deathclaws.
---
Thanks for the reply/explenation!
---
I mean like doors on a camp workshop level. We all know how tough vault doors can be. Taking a nuke to the face. 
---
Unless we are talking about the vault doors in fallout shelter.
---
I just fixed a lot of my outdoor floating things in my camp by putting a base underneath them. I also hid floating crops with a fence in front. Works for me. But I don't like moving my camp, either. It saves time and caps to stay put and I like a neat look. To each their own.
---
Hey how do you craft the backpacks I bought it from the store and it won‚Äôt let me craft it
---
I know. I was being funny about the event.
---
Thats me, only have plague walker and charged, but im happy to share
---
Both of these answers are correct. 
---
Process of elimination, Google, and common deductive reasoning and I passed both the archery and mammal tests in like five minutes.
---
We can do it! :)
---
Whats your GT? Need me some Empath, Healing Factor and Twisted Muscles.
---
That‚Äôs a little pointless
---
&gt; And if i use the de-rad spray tunnel at the bunker it wont remove the mutation like radaway does? Dont want to spend all my caps on something that wont last for at least a week or two.
---
Sorry, missed that part. There is a Luck perk called Starched Genes, lets you lock your mutations so Radaway and such will not remove them.
---
You have new .ba2 files that need listed in fallout76custom.ini. They're 76 - 05update.ba2 and 2 other 76 - 05xxx files. Look in your fallout data directory for the correct names. Arrange files by date and it will group all 3 together. Just add them to the same section of the ini that their earlier versions the 76 - 02, 03 etc are in and the vending machines will appear.
---
You're right. Same event, just different outcomes. The only parts that seem to vary are, as you stated, the ending fight, and the objects you have to collect switch between two sets that match whichever ending you get. So, once you get those objects and hear either the older girl or the bug boy/girl , you know what ending you're going to to get.
---
They were scary, but when I was high level I was more worried about running into cazadores. Maybe I'm the minority.
---
Just got it, just stayed crouched and as level in the water as possible to avoid any bumps of ground :)
---
I whole heartedly agree, they claim it's to try and balance the market place by removing caps from the game.
---
I got lucky and did that in the beta when everyone was a low level
---
Yo no homo but i love you üòÇ
---
Want me to come to you or you to me I‚Äôm at water
---
It unfortunately isn't a drop for deathclaws, but rather a random piece of junk found in containers. Like the yellow wooden crates. Happy hunting!
---
Im omw

I wish I knew how to make dropdown lists! that would clean my spreadsheets up significantly lol, happy spreadsheeting :P

...circuits, crystals, and ultracite scrap...
---
Let me introduce you to my friend over here *Berry mentats enters*
---
Thank you for pointing these out, and being so detailed!! I've fixed the hidden row, and I'm looking into the checkbox issue now. :D
---
Don't forget they forgot to put the stimpak diffuser in the game so you can't complete that badge and the frog habitat is bugged you can build the frog habitat but it will not count towards the challenge so you cannot complete that badge as well
---
I think even in F4 they were leg only and 50% effect. In F76 they are definetely so.
---
I found him surrounded by dead super mutants and he kept saying ‚ÄúYou can come out now, the ba banks gone‚Äù or something like that, it was sad
---
Many thanks...already sold 100 screws and steel is selling incredibly well as common as it is.

I'd love an increase, but server stability probably can't handle it. Maybe like 10% at max.

I need to figure out how to pipe Tom Leher's "Be Prepared" through my audio while doing these quests.

Yes I did.....I didnt see a machine. I am at work now. Will check later when I get home.

Also a great time to start using some of those repair kits the SQB drops that I keep forgetting I have.

Those of us with high int are screwed...I crafted a crossbow, used it to kill all 50 enemies for the one challenge...I am still in the &gt;100% durability.

Whats the quickest way to deteriorate a weapon?
---
What badge did you get, and what storyline was it? I've done it quite a bit so far but haven't seen any badges yet, sadly.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs ok, Bethesda‚Äôs a new developer, they‚Äôre still ‚Äî oh wait
---
I'll be on tomorrow, I'm usually on from about 1:00am uk time zone
---
Same I don't have any but my stash is mostly full of junk and weapons
---
I'm not sure of your question.  It sounds like you want to be able to join your friends team but that seems pretty easy to do now.  Just message your friend to invite you &amp; maybe they have an open slot in the team.  If that's not really your question, my apologies.
---
Any ideas
---
Steel is one of those components like aluminum that‚Äôs always needed. But when you just want to fix your shit and get on with playing instead of scavenging. Just quicker to buy it.

Join my party

Dont know why anyone would ever buy food to begin with though..

I mainly play as a scavenger so junk is something i have waay too much of.
---
Sure but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve made any other online ....  .. ..oh wait
---
I am going to steal this for the formula, thank you. This is precisely what I wanted to clean it up. Also, very clean and well structured I like it
---
Sidenote: I am "happy" to see your lost notes. Sad to hear you are missing items, but happy I am not crazy. 7 legendaries the last time I checked them vs my spreadsheet.
---
PC Master race.
---
Did you collect the frog before making the jar? 
---
I have 2 pet frogs in my camp and the challenge doesn't register them.
---
I built a department store to showcase all the rare plans I have to build for people. I ran out of budget before getting to all the appliances and had almost none of the outdoor stuff, but I had all the furniture, workshops, wall decorations, and most of the lights other than the outdoor ones. No turrets at all. Performance on my (very fast) computer was totally fucked if you looked in the direction of my camp from a fairly huge radius, like at least 500 feet, probably more like 1000.
---
I would love to see camp budget increased, but on the current engine, it just won't work.
---
I'm on a top end PC.
---
If ever it‚Äôll be between Xbox &amp; PC. Sony has a stick up their ass because they know if cross play gets enabled across all games most people will use PC‚Äôs or Xbox not PS4‚Äôs. They‚Äôve been that way for a while, it took them like 6 months to let Fortnite players have cross play when Xbox &amp; PC were doing it for half a year. It‚Äôs competition, I get it but damn I‚Äôd like to play with everyone
---
You are the best scout leader!
---
I‚Äôd need someone to test this as I am unable to but I‚Äôm almost positive that if you have the electric charge mutation (or possibly the plague Walker or both) other players can be damaged by you in pacifist mode and force you into PvP.
---
I was hunting bulk steel yesterday so I could just mod a weapon and had to buy it for 71 caps a pop from the vendors :(
---
My point exactly?
---
I‚Äôve completed it, but can help you if you still need it.
---
You tha real mvp here. Hope you days are full of sunshine and orange juice.
---
I had a jar made ready collected for frogs went back to my base made the one frog in a jar and then made three new jars to put the other frogs in and it still does not count towards the challenge
---
Are you guys serious? At level 180 I definetely don't use any goat legs, aqua boy and neither equilent armor pieces. On my alt which resently got to level 50, I still have whatever medicore 2-3 star armor I've found on it, when I have one fall damage armor piece I do take advantage of it jumping down to take shortcuts, doing jumps I can heal off instead of dying, but the moment I get any weight reduction armor for that particular slot, Im going to recycle that fall damage thing.
---
And water. Theres so little of it ingame. You can swing long time without taking damage, and you can heal small amounts of radiation with passive daylight perk, which I find handy as then I wont need to take radaway and get some stupid disease.
---
Sadly I do have a lot of special/perk points tied to weight reduction stuff, whch makes then not available for damage boosts. On my main I can barely afford to have 30% damage for full auto rifles and 40% for explosives. On alt I can have level 2 incisor with no other melee boosts, even though I have max strenght.(my alt though needs to loot and carry exploive ammo for my main, who also has the explosive weight perk)
---
Because you have to earn the backpack. This would be a exploit, that you dont have to work for.
---
Did you ever get balloons. I got a spare balloons id be willing to sell.
---
I hear you but you cant hear me

I logged out then back in and it worked

It's their optimisations problem, not PC related

Ohhh no :(
---
This is outside of the storyline. You just have to go to the location after you've started the tadpole quest, I would assume, and I believe it only gives Possum Badges, not Tadpole ones. But, keep in mind that I didn't test this while I was still a tadpole.
---
Thanks to you all , could be a better / easy place to do it as in the  Encryptid event .
---
Now i only have 3 "hard" exam's to do, boring, lol
---
Talking of animation issues...
---
I went to deathclaw island 
---
I died on deathclaw island. Twice.
---
Basically got the deathclaw to spawn and started picking him off (challenge for atoms, new char was sub level 15) jumping into the water, letting him run away and then taking a few shots again.
---
Well. The little shit decided that his animations were going to flip out and he would no longer run at me. He was stood still, and I thought, is he getting closer?
---
Yep. Just floated straight to me really fucking fast and slapped me dead.
---
2nd time, he stayed in one spot, went invisible and I dropped dead.
---
I logged out for a bit :D
---
That's what I did. Though I used basic ones so I just had to damage the weapon once each time
---
No it isn't, since it's so far ahead of others in meta. 
---
This cav/sent nerf might bring it down enough so it won't be nerfed directly, time will tell.
---
Well, that truly sucks.
---
I saw one in this mornings playthrough and just had to visit. They didn‚Äôt have anything but ammo so normally I wouldn‚Äôt even check it out, but had to see who was weird enough to build there... I was not disappointed. It was the most glorious camp I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Make sure your getting a cap deposit. Say the nodding service is 500 caps. Sell your weapon for 7k caps. Let the other player mod it and then have them sell it back to you for 7500.  But have a set deposit set for the weapon depending on it‚Äôs worth. If the deposit set it too high the modder would get burned if you just left with the caps too low and he might just buy it from you and leave you with less caps than it‚Äôs worth. If you try and ask for a deposit and they tell you ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough caps‚Äù or ‚Äúnah, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù. Than it‚Äôs likely a scam.
---
+karma   Thanks
---
Finally haha thanks man
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs a new engine, they‚Äôre still working out the‚Äî oh wait
---
It‚Äôs listed under skins in the shop...you sure?
---
Better than the weird floating homes
---
Oh boy lol. That sucks lol.  Guess I would t be completing that challenge anytime soon lol
---
I bought it from the atom shop. I do not see it as a piece to equip. I will double check later. If it is not equitable then it is a skin. I will let you know later.
---
I just recently came across a couple of pieces of armor with a Sentinel aspect to them so it is disappointing for this to happen.
---
Just coming back to this to say that I did some more testing and it doesn't appear to take budget to assign items. I must have just had a weird bug that has since not happened again.
---
Enjoy your whole 2 purified water. Dromedary Rank 3 yo
---
Well if that‚Äôs not the cutest fuckin thing!
---
Same thing, usually
---
Still need help? 
---
Well, low level players can't buy all the extra .38 ammo any medium to high level can have, for 1 caps. There's fairly little of semi-decent .38 to use even for fun.
---
I've got a picture of it on twitter I'll edit with a link.
---
Great there goes my friggen base.  :(
---
eXoTiC wEaPoNs ArE a HuMaN rIgHt!
---
Check your armor station it's a craft able armor not skin for the scouts or other backpack
---
Not all, but multiple players will make dents in it!
---
Every time Bethesda makes a game that‚Äôs not ‚Äútraditional‚Äù elder scrolls/fallout or changes a core aspect is to these games people rage and freak out. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter how good the games are if they are not releasing a sequel to my favorite rpg.‚Äù Seems to be the mindset. Reviews are just personal opinions, if you want to see if you like something you have to play it.
---
Just curious, how do you know if your customers are reselling the stuff? By checking their camps later?
---
Acid is a hell of a drug
---
Guess so.
---
It also says ‚Äúskin is craftable at armor workbenches‚Äù
---
Thank you I finally got the back pack there craftable
---
I put up my vendor yesterday and sold some junk I wasn't using within minutes. So exciting!
---
Mines not #pay2win
---
I think that‚Äôs a pretty good bug
---
It came from Dominos during one of the times they were doing the half price if you ordered online deals.
---
If you're on Xbox I have a couple of them in my stash I can give you one
---
Yeah, most of em are about half of what vendors sell the plans for. There are some that aren't sold by vendors and some that are extremely common drops that sort of need price bumps or drops. I sold t51 jet plans for 2500 last night, which is lower than the default price. I figured they were pretty common. Most of the deco plans have been selling well at around 100 caps. They're my most common sales, occasionally someone buys a gun or ammo. I sold out of my .45 ammo pretty quickly. Someone bought 200 .44. The rest is just sitting there.
---
I‚Äôm just using mine as a table decoration
---
Oh God, not this again. *Prepares for thousands of posts about falling and pink textures*
---
I also think i got possum badges from it. I have 3 without doing any possum challenge.
---
The event is quite hard solo. Not because enemies are tough but because the fire goes out quickly at the last wave,while you're focused on killing mobs. Tesla rifle is amazing for this.
---
Cool. Will do. I will verify and advise. Thanks
---
Ahh smart. That deteriorates it quicker?
---
Neat, thanks for the info.
---
I had all Cavalier and started collecting for a Sentinel set. I guess it's because they were overpowered in PvP. I didn't hear anything about it but that's my issue. I put a lot of effort into trading on reddit for my weapons &amp; armor set over the past few months and now it's almost as if it was all for nothing. My play style doesn't really fit with other higher damage builds and equipment.
---
Is there a way in Google Sheets to hide a row when you've checked the box?
---
So i did and when i click repair it still doesn't show any materials and only shows I have 0 repair kits.
---
I'd drop a missle turret next to your machines for protection
---
You don‚Äôt have to go to the specific points to get the items. Any bug that drops it will do.
---
I did see that! Probably should check that out. I'd imagine it's nothing substantial but they probably put a lot of work into it
---
Yeee same with how you can avoid the quest to get the key to the armory altogether by just hopping the fence.
---
Just to clarify, is 5 AM or 5 PM good for you, because I‚Äôm only good for 5 PM.
---
How should we do this? Should I pm you my tag?
---
Disco dancing
---
I've got teo turrets on it now :)
---
I just created a level 15 crossbow and went to Morgantown airport and flat woods and was able to get my kills and repair three times
---
Okay but it's not like they're trying to push the atom shop backpack by making the in-game pack irritating to-...oh, right...
---
I've edited with a picture but it's not a skin it's just another backpack

There's a bug where the game likes to say "nothing is selected."  The fix for it is to close the build mode and reopen it.  This also fixes the bug where nothing happens when you try to place an object (no error message, no error sound, etc.).  For PS4, click the touchpad, then click and hold the touchpad to quick-open the build menu.  For Xbox, it's the View (select) button.
---
Does that turn you into Ironman?
---
Odd question, but do you know how to re-lock the terminals? I set them up, a friend hacked them, but I can't seem to re-lock the terminals at all. Even swapping out the locks (e.g. from a tier 2 lock to tier 3) doesn't re-lock them for me.

I sell them for 200 (or free if you ask nice). Come see my cool vending place at Whitespring Station!

Can't wait to use the scrip from all the legendary gear I didn't want to get  legendary gear I don't want.

Haven‚Äôt found a single session with it yet, someday maybe I‚Äôd love to have that backpack upgrade

I built a 10 unit motel with a private bath (porta-potty) in each room. Full crafting equipment, 4 vending machines, and a patio with all the instruments to relax with.  Just down 2 sets of steps to the left of vault 76 for free travel.
---
LOL good point :D
---
Get a PC and play with me. I've been looking for a Free States crew for so fucking long.
---
Yes. It started happening when survival mode came out, I experienced it the most in the Savage divide near the nuke silo
---
Yeah it was a bummer. But my own fault. I trade to mules by dropping things and jumping world's. Risky.
---
Steal away. Half my sheets were stolen too :)
---
Do you mean you got tadpole, not possum?
---
Not the biggest overall, just biggest from the list. I don't remember for sure if they called it a lizard, but it was in the lizard-related exam
---
I'm gonna go buy it on Xbox and buy it to see.
---
Duping, though it will probably return once they correct the issue.
---
Yes. Cultist knife and blade is a different class of weapon than Bowie or combat knives
---
From what I've heard, the backpack in the Atomic Shop is fully functional, not just a skin.
---
Wouldn't take my word for it though, I haven't got it
---
Pretty sure it's animo, but i just saw that someone from the discord got all the answers so i did my job and its done
---
Receiving something for free that others earn is a gift not an exploit.

So they are then always as found and cannot be changed/modified, shame :(
---
Stuff spawns everytime someone fast travels to mine, including indoors which used to only rarely happen. And the variety seems to have increased as well, before was always SMs or rats, now I've seen legendary deathclaw, wendigos, ghoul hordes, you name it
---
I saw some as cheap as 150 today.  As a completely-mutated character, it would've cost me every cap I had back when I was farming them, but it would've saved me so much time!  Not to mention being able to cherry-pick mutations.  Herd mentality is badass if you team a lot, but if you don't, it kinda sucks, even with class freak.
---
So if you want to sell, pretty please be at your camp. It‚Äôs rough seeing 3 stars and not knowing what those are. Might be missing a lot of sales :(
---
I‚Äôve purchased it but I can‚Äôt craft it I have the mats but it just says you can‚Äôt do it at this time so idk what that‚Äôs about
---
Don't say weapons when you refer to melee weapons.
---
I would think it's a bug. There's nothing on patch notes to even remotely suggest it's previous state would have been a bug, that got fixed.
---
My level 54 melee alt used to be able to one hit level 50 watoga bots from sneak, at least using power attack with instigating level 40 knuckles. Now I can't even kill level 38 same way. Some level 28(??) bot I can. And she doesn't even yet have the 200% repair perk.
---
I wouldn't cry if it were to remain like it is now, though. Melee so frigging OP, it disgust me how so medicore weapons on just barely level 50 melee alt, can handle anything so effectively, while my guns only main needs some seriously good weapons I've had to trade and that are selling on ebay for something like 20-30 euros.(because they are duped as fuck as also why I could get such weapons in first place)
---
Fertile soil and feed the people continually respawn low level enemies. That's what I used.
---
Cool! I'll stop by your store tonight after work. I get off 10pm central daylight time
---
Even if they are crouching hidden
---
Berry mentants are PvP God
---
YEET

I have access to venerable, overpriced pizza in my neighborhood, but I find myself baking frozen Digiorno more often than I "get a slice".  Pizza is just so expensive now.  When I was a kid I could get a giant cheese slice at Nino's for $1.50, and two slices came with a can of Pepsi.  At least NY dogs, honey nuts and Jamaican patties are still fresh and cheap.
---
Okay cool! I've heard a few people saying it does but from my experience as well, if it does take space, it's very very minimal. I installed my machines and stocked them up and have spare room left for decorations and stuff. 
---
 Love how I got downvoted though just for having a conversation.
---
I also thought for a moment about trolling people with this.
---
Seems like a landing bug to me, I've seen it before but it went away after a little time...
---
That was an exploit that was supposedly dealt with, have you seen it occur in 9.0?
---
Isnt this also against bethesdas, "only cosmetic items" policy
---
Just store it and build again
---
Me as well .which system?
---
Even just a preservation shelter would be a neat feature
---
im stealth build and use explosive silenced weapons..can shoot enemies point blank and still dont lose cover
---
Everytime I see a debate about which Fallout is best it reminds me how well they made each one unique.
---
Fallout 3 is for the people who want a nitty gritty post apocalyptic gameplay.
---
Fallout NV is for the roleplayer. The person who wants to see their actions affect the world they're in.
---
Fallout 4 is for the soldier. The conqueror. The kill em all and let god sort em out type. Better gameplay mechanics, but less RPing. 
---
Fallout 76 is the ultimate sandbox of all of them IMO. You have more freedom to do what you want than any of the others.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cultist_dagger
---
I wonder if it‚Äôs tied to players in an area.  I hadn‚Äôt been attacked in days and the first hour I had the vending machine up I had a scorchbeast spawning, dropping his scorched cronies right on top of my roof.
---
Just wondering if you can and if they‚Äôd last longer than regular power cores.
---
Yes that would be great, adding you now! Just let me know where you did it and I'll meet you there
---
&gt;The one where sometimes you go invisible if you are hit and I always wear PA and Iv gone invisible a few times randomly in battle.
---
Yeah, when you go sneaking. Thats the effect of one sneaking perk, the one that was only one level. It tries to make enemies lose you by giving you short invisibility.
---
Hah I‚Äôm getting mixed messages here :)
---
Logging on now
---
That isn't the point of the discussion at all. The locks are to keep players out, not monsters. The monsters prioritize crops, purifiers, defenses, and generators. Most of those players always keep outside of their locked doors. The monsters are irrelevant. Also, my comments were in response to the assertion that the problem was players destroying bases - which is impossible on adventure servers unless you shoot back at the attackers. Do you need further clarification of that?
---
Yes, that's part of the filtering system. Click the little arrow beside the checkbox on the header row, then untick "true" from the filter by values list. Then click OK, and the list should hide all rows with checked boxes.
---
I think the only ones saying there's no more content are level 150+. I'm taking the game slow though, 194 and not bored yet
---
Well, bb PA i guess, no longer needed xD
---
Hunters Long Coat looks great with the regular backpack
---
I want to find out how to initiate this challenge too
---
i can clear westek with my be handmade or ie lever and not get into danger once..yeh i may be in caution but i still dont get seen
---
FYI: with the new update, the Enclave vendor in the production area now sells ALL x-01 mod plans. Just bought the x-01 calibrated shocks plan for 5333 caps with fully upgraded hard bargain
---
Awwww yeah
---
Am I wrong or does that seem a little absurd also? There should be a counter foil of some sort.
---
Huge effective radiation resistance difference to any normal armor and carry weight mean nothing?
---
TY for teaching me :D
---
I'm on but give me 5 min.  Outside waiting for the dog to go.
---
You've been crazy helpful. =3
---
Is it for the in water revive. If so can you help me do it too.
---
Not on Xbox at least. It's just a skin
---
Well you specifically replied to a comment about using the refrigeration of vending machines to just store your own food rather then selling it. So yeah. Exploit.
---
I like this.  Bethesda has said they are all about giving the players tools to play the way they want to play, well what if I want to open a restaurant?  What if I want to travel the world collecting recipes and ingredients, then create a themed CAMP that sells every possible dish?  Sure certain items would be in higher demand (\*cough\* Cranberry Relish \*cough\*).  But how cool would it be to specialize in rare dishes?  Dress up like a chef, offer food items players have never even heard of!  
---
Current spoilage system kills that dream pretty quickly.  The loop could be:
---
1. Collect rarer, raw ingredients that are on a timer.
---
2. Craft them into a fancy dish.
---
3. Put up the item for sale to stop the clock on the spoilage timer.
---
4. Once the item is bought, timer starts for that player.
---
Surely they can figure out a fair way to implement that system without creating an exploit.
---
I think I'm going to change my opening line into "hi so Preston sent me. He said you needed my help".  I mean it's pure coincidence that these creatures showed up same time as me.
---
I said possum and meant possum each time.
---
no problem :) thanks for silver!
---
I'm in the same boat, except I realized 75% of the way through killing 50 enemies with it that I had Luck of the Draw on (high chance to repair the weapon on a critical hit). I may never have to repair this weapon again. Why couldn't they want me to repair a Gatling Plasma (pre-patch7 or whatever)?
---
I'm going to build all of my bases as a single stack until i reach the height limit and then its going outwards like  huge ass mushroom from now on.
---
Just says "Revive an ally."
---
Come one guys, I‚Äôm sure we are all just being overly paranoid. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs NO Way Bethesda would purposely release their new questline half done and broken in order to make you insane enough to just buy it in the ... ..  ..shit.
---
God, it was a long day at work. I read the title and saw ‚ÄúPuberty Prime‚Äù. I need a nap.
---
It was for regular armor too, for ballistic resistanses.
---
I'd like to think so. Originally I built a house between 3 trees. I wanted to make it look like it was supported by the 3 trees but that was insanely fucking difficult and ended up just putting giant sections of trees inside my house. So [this](https://i.imgur.com/2dchcRg.png) is where I've ended up. I wanted to put columns in the middle, but thanks bethesda, you can't.
---
Oh ok, yeah I‚Äôve got it, it‚Äôs not a skin, it‚Äôs a craftable item but you still need to do the challenges to be able to craft the different levels of it, even level 1
---
Yup...
---
I do hope some of their workers share their experiences. I do hope they are well-compensated
---
My Travelers Leather coat looks fantastic as usual. 
---
Still kinda sad that I won‚Äôt get to see sweet new packs though.
---
That's been happening to me a bunch, I've got a good bit of pictures. I call it "Fallout 76: Splatoon Edition"
---
Seems legit that it would, be nice if it boosted the damage reduction as well
---
This guy gets it :D
---
Note: it does not work. You have to smack them, and they smack you back. Motherfucker
---
Would also like to know this
---
Pressing "F" to pay my respects...
---
Its less about competition and more about not helping their competition.
---
Microsoft said no all last gen as Sony asked for it and now the tables have turned.
---
Why should Sony allow its competitors gain an edge by utilizing their own massive playerbase?
---
Ps4s are still selling 4 to 1 to xb1s.
---
That would be cool. Have soooo any that are duplicates
---
Prioritize in leveling first, it's not hard to reach 25-30, find some good gear and then go try it.
---
Louder for the people in the back! :)
---
yeah..but will it last and keep people playing?  :(
---
Just use the brewing station as a sink. And the punch bowl as a center piece on a table where you would put your keys if you had some to put down.
---
Ah gotcha.  I'm surprised how good the leather armor looks in a set.  Tricking out stuff (repair to 200%, put on a hardened receiver and silencer, etc. will definitely increase the value).
---
So you can randomly get modded cultist weapons as drops but no, currently no mods available in game.
---
i gave that a try but couldn‚Äôt get it to work
---
Guns never benefitted from it.
---
And thats explosive harpoon with fletchette? Maybe the shotgun "fix" also fixed the explosive damage of multishot guns to, correctly display the damage they do. Previously any applicaple weapon didn't shot anywhere near it's real damage. 
---
Though my ultracite explosve with splitter seems to have about normal amount of displayed damage.
---
For hunter, does anyone know if the pipe syringer needs to do most of the damage or just the last bit to kill the Yao GUI?
---
Yep and he is not going to sell any... they go for 50 to 100
---
Yea just had this happen begore i left for work thought my controller buggin out.
---
Uh, if you are PvE only what enemy detects matters. Not sure any enemy cares whtyour wear.
---
I just tried it. It does show up in my armor bench, but I ‚Äúlack the requirements,‚Äù though it doesn‚Äôt tell me what it is. Either this guy works for behesda and is trying to get more of our money, or he‚Äôs already able finished whatever level of the quest line you need to to craft backpacks.
---
be careful, I've heard reports of named items disappearing for no reason other than being named.
---
I've never had a trash mob - or any mob - destroy my bases except for scorched beasts. To deal with those, I learned not to put my base in areas where they frequent. The turrets are generally useless against any mob strong enough to destroy your base. The only propose they truly serve is an outlet to use up all of your excess gears, springs, and steel.
---
No, we want it to destroy commies, not thots.
---
Check that you don't already know how to make a crossbow. I spent an unreasonable amount of time searching for the plans last night only to realize I just had to walk over to the bench and create one (or could have except I needed 1 extra spring, of course).
---
Upvoted. Saved page. Ty for this info
---
Very interesting...crafting restrictions on an Atomic item? Shame, Bethesda, shame...
---
Fbi wants to your location 
---
Allow
---
There‚Äôs a typo in your description. ‚ÄòTo‚Äô should‚Äôve been ‚Äòtoo‚Äô. Gg OP!
---
Yo u on?
---
[] will put an item at the bottom btw cheers
---
Yeah, that's the big question. I think long term, a solid end game needs to be established to retain players.
---
I believe "molo" means "dock" or "wharf".
---
One issue, you can not purchase items the have been named by someone else. I thought they reverted back to original name, but maybe it happens like atom shop items and poof if traded?
---
Also the image does not prove that it‚Äôs not a skin...it‚Äôs just an image.
---
Yeah, when one guy grabbed everything I had listed I went to his camp and checked. I don‚Äôt list everything I have (except plans) ammo and chems and such I just put a few dozen at a time and replenish as needed. And I usually have a few brotherhood recon rifles at level 5 for noobs
---
The Only thing I miss to actually be able to say that Fallout 76 is some kind of MMO and not a single player game in that you sometimes stumble upon other Players would be a TEXT Chat. I just don't get it, why I am only able to communicate with other players using a Microphone. It's so hard to trade, you can't Discuss Things ingame if you don't like to actually speak. I just don't want to use the Voice Chat all the Time :c
---
ive been using tags since the update and ive had no problems to speak of so far.
---
Best update by far. Love the new attention and traffic to my shop! Constantly have atleast 2 or three customers!
---
Your world is full
---
well yes and no, when fighting weaker mobs solo yes, but when i'm not solo which is most of the time, i'm usually tagging and crippling. but i can imagine that i,m shooting it 3-4 time more in the same time frame.
---
I became a possum scout and got the scout backpack then bought this thinking it was a skin for the scouts but it's not. 
---
IDK I'm gonna get video proof uploaded of me crafting it rather than it being a skin
---
lol you right
---
Yeah I agree, if it does take budget, then it's a super small amount. I think it's just people not wanting the spread of inaccurate information, which is totally fair.
---
Regardless, I enjoy the conversation!
---
I believe it just needs to be the killing blow. That's how it works with similar challenges, so I expect it to be the same here. :)
---
I fired up the game a few days before the patch and the server was a ghost town - maybe 3 other people on the map. Makes it very difficult to do the  **sheepsquatch**  quest. :(
---
You‚Äôre correct that it‚Äôs not a skin, but you still have to make progress on the quest line to be able to craft one. You can‚Äôt just buy it without doing any of this busywork.
---
Fairs, Im working on the video for proof
---
Meat bags at super mutant hangouts will have them sometimes.
---
..
---
Just to put this out there, I found 1 terminal at camp Adams that also does the pioneer exams.
---
Add in grape mentats and a sweet roll for the win.  Intentionally boost your Cha by sitting on a radioactive barrel with some unyielding armor....you're almost dead, but you got some sweet, sweet bargains.
---
The amount of scroll wheel use the game forces me to do makes my hand tired after  working on a computer for 8 hours. Thumbs up.
---
Not working the body keeps dissapearing
---
Anyone selling Speed Demon, Twisted Muscles or Adrenal Reaction on PS4? Please give me a pm!
---
True enough. Saw someone in another thread earlier reference the in game chat Warframe uses. That would be bloody perfect.
---
We can wish!
---
And award for train wreck of a post goes too....
---
Yeah I know I would just want John Henry Eden to come back (maybe just a similar ZAX computer unit)
---
Anyone for govt owned means of production.
---
trial and error
---
from where u fast travel.. Up on the hill to the north, behind all the buildings and west of the Lake
---
Ah so you can't just buy this over grinding for the scouts. I did wonder.
---
Your welcome! Nope. I‚Äôm good.
---
Not going to lye it‚Äôs bad I‚Äôm probably going to delete it
---
Blimey. I haven't seen it that bad my end. That's rough.
---
But what is odd is I had no way of seeing this in the vending machine.  Just saw the Grogs Axe.  Purchased and then poof, not there!?!?  Anyone ever open a ticket with Bethesda and if so, how long does it take them to respond?
---
I just turned a bar piece backwards to mimic a sink
---
and I've been playing for around 2000 hours and "only" had items disappear on me 3 times.
---
not saying they disappeared *just* for being named. maybe there are other variables the person ignored. just saying I'd rather be safe than sorry.
---
"Damn you Scorched. Appalachia was fine until you came along. Brotherhood was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could have stolen that vertibird and been halfway to The Mojave by now."
---
Aye, I know this.  But I was just having a difficult time finding the bloody bug -- and repeatedly scrapping or cooking them, of course, because I'm a knucklehead.  So yeah, I went to the spawn point, and wandered back and forth over it for an hour.  I posted angry.
---
I have not, but have read weeks from other postings....
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Nope. So it‚Äôs kind of false advertisement, even though you‚Äôre correct that it‚Äôs not a skin. I would edit your post
---
I sell them for 750 in my vending machines and I can barely keep them stocked
---
There‚Äôs a text transcript of the it/him in the enclave bunker talking to MODUS.
---
Yeah, I previously could never find people's camps. Now I'm dropping by everyone on the server to compare notes on camp construction haha.
---
Yes there is , are you sure to want to sell your favorited item?
---
Yup
---
IT's a random reward for completing the new campfire story event at camp Adams.
---
I'm on xbox1 and can't even see all the requirements for the badges. Unless there's some way to scroll that submenu that I'm unaware of.
---
All of a sudden the ‚Äúrebuild Appalachia‚Äù thing feels relevent hey? I love it, world finally feels lived in
---
All good. There are 3-4 on the bridge over looking flatwoods.
---
Awesome!  Well off to find another deal on a weapon then.
---
go to your challenges menu, go to the last category (world), and there will be 10 scout challenges. If you finish all of them for any category, you will get one of the badges
---
So I did what I normally do when purchasing an ‚Äúexpensive item‚Äù, donned all my +Charisma gear, munched on some grape mentats, drank a beer, and ate something that gave me +charisma as well, and it for once ever did not change the caps price whatsoever. I have absolutely no idea why, but it was very disappointing. I bought the plan anyway lol
---
Todd Howard did it again!
---
If only
---
Sometimes when you can't delete or place something, exiting build mode and going back in will fix it. If it's being extra stubborn, I've found that fast travelling away and back will sometimes fix it. If it's really frustrating, I'll exit the game completely and rejoin and that will sometimes work. Try all these before you start deleting. And do not trust blueprints.
---
Compare how much a robot vendor sells them for &amp; how much you get by selling to that vendor &amp; then visit other camps.
---
should give you a good idea.
---
Also depends, do you want quick sales or lots of caps - set prices to match
---
We get where you are coming from. This pay for convenience thing is sketchy for sure. But honestly I have so little time to game and only spent 60 bucks on a game I've put over 300 hours into. It's been well worth it. 
---
It's only hardcore gamers getting upset about this shit. It will suck if they go full pay to win. Bit from the looks of it they understand what that would do to the player base and wont make such a dumb decision. 
---
Also, maybe they will..
---
Who knows.
---
Basically, negative posts like this wont pick up steam because why do we want to hang around being shitty and speculating about shitty stuff. Just pick up your co trollers and play the game we all love so much, you know?
---
How much do you think is a reasonable price for those ?
---
Are you on right now?
---
Go into your challenge menu, scroll down to the "world" section" and then scroll down to the tadpole challenges. You have to complete 3 of them.
---
Does the backpack look different with the mod? If so can you share?
---
happy to have helped :)
---
Yeah. It's such a small thing, but having a network of player run fast travel locations actually makes it feel like we're banding together.
---
That personal terminal thing has ‚Äúconnect with other wastelanders‚Äù in its description, maybe in a duture near update?
---
I got 5/5 first try. No clue how.
---
I did it 5 times and on the 6th try, got it right. It was weird that the first 5 times the answers on the sheet didn't work.
---
Yes Gamertag is CatsWithHats09
---
This is the best news ever!
---
I'm guessing that's where the dev testing felt wrong. My fully perked out tse gatling build would still take maybe 20 or 30 shots to down a queen. So in comparison having a shotgun at range downing them in far fewer shots feels wrong. Feels way wrong and overpowered.  I can't speak on the armor nerfs though, I've never been affected by those builds that got reduced.
---
It stopped after one of the recent patches, then things looked white/snow covered for a while, and today I had a new one- everything looked red. My first thought was "looks like Mars"
---
Stop trying to use similes and metaphors, you are horrible at it.
---
The best way is to see what vendors sell things for and do better than them. In the case of rare items, price them based on what you're comfortable with taking. If it's something you have to dump, keep the price low. If you are ok with holding out, keep it high and roll the dice.
---
I sell booze at my camp and price everything better than vendors. I know people aren't looking to purchase booze for game play so for me, it's more about having people enjoy the process of transaction.
---
Also, a quick search on Reddit will yield markets outside of the game. You'll find subs as well as discords full of players exchanging goods and services. They give you a good sense of what's being pushed around.
---
May the Mothman bless you.
---
Yeah, I noticed that too. Fingers crossed Bethesda is cooking up something fun.
---
In that sense it works as a skin would
---
Cool, yeah.  I just gotta schlep it over there.  Thanks for the input.
---
same as in real life. Visit the other stores player stores and NPC vendors. See who is selling the same stuff as you and price your stuff acouple percentages below that, or if someone is blowing out the same stuff you have to sell either hold on to it or server hop. If nobody is selling the same stuff as you and it's valuable commodity stuff like lead, acid or copper, charge what you think you would pay for it. If people come, look and leave every time, your prices are too high or youre stocking bullshit.
---
Did you try stranger bloom by dyer chemical?
---
Love the gt
---
Sweet. Good luck.
---
Visit other shops and see what's being charged, either match or present a better offer without coming out with less than you intended. Or, if you are the patient type, start high and slowly bring down your prices until you start getting hits. Don't forget the 10% 'fee' either, that should be factored into the cost too
---
You're not supposed to see the names that people give their weapons. That's a red flag that something is wrong with the trade and it's not going to go through. Bummer it took your caps. 
---
Hopefully it's not a bugged item that the trader knows about. I'm assuming you've already talked to the seller, but if not you should contact them to see if they still have it. Any reputable trader would tell you if they do, most would have already contacted you and made it right. If it's in the ether it's not up to them to give you a refund, but if they've still got it they should give it to you or refund. 
---
Good luck with everything.
---
a whole two purified water from most none market camps... hmm lets see purified water sells for what 5 caps?   
---
yeah no they are loosing money on every grab with most bases.
---
Some weapon/armor perks, like stand fast (armor) and the fixer (rifle), let alone environment ( night/darkness) can reduce need to max out sneak perk. I have level 2 sneak and can approach most mobs for a melee strike (often 2-3 strikes) without ANY detection.
---
You used to able to get mentats and psycho addictions that lasted 1 day of game play, but the others only lasted only a few hours. How long do they last now?
---
Thanks, hopefully it will register for me soon
---
That‚Äôs strange. With Cha near 20, my prices are significantly lower than base 4 plus hard bargain.
---
I think when you first post an item on your vending machine, it give the suggested price...at least that's what I've noticed so far
---
I can gt is njorls
---
I agree, although I mostly play with my boyfriend so I'm not technically solo. We took turns jumping off a cliff for that quest. I'll come jump off a cliff for you buddy.
---
Same! I don‚Äôt even lock mine, and when I see someone has left theirs unlocked, I see it as free...
---
Same thing happened to me. Just log out completely, log back in and re-take the photos.
---
Ice been selling at about half the prices of vendors. Bulk steel is 44 caps. Hope my prices are fair.
---
Yes I'm looking for the 'swamp plant' the strangler is different
---
I usually see one or two people in any of the big towns I go to and there's usually around ten to fifteen in my server maybe less when it's really early morning for me.
---
It always disappears after I take a few steps, like I'm stepping outside of it.
---
You could get in to my camp. If I lock the door it will only keep that door shut. My house only has three sides.
---

That is kinda joke that way to get badges Jesus Christ

I run into folks all the time

Where are the quizzes at?
---
Hey Beth made a post recently, it's not in game yet will be added next patch/update.
---
Stimpak diffuser gives health to nearby teammates when used.
---
There was almost no reason to bother other players. Why would you if you play the game solo like almost everyone does.
---
I just found one in  a tool box in a hangar at the Wade Airport. Hope you found one.
---
Ditto. Haven‚Äôt seen this event yet on Xbox
---
They gotta keep you playing somehow
---
Just like all my grenades and throwing knives...
---
Just you
---
Here my friend.
---
Good job seeing as the event causes server crashes.
---
People who checked the patch notes before you don‚Äôt know this
---
I saw a post earlier today that this is what someone was going to do while at work. Hopefully he remembered to plug in his controller.
---
It's another end-game, long term goal, if you could finish it in a day or two what's the point?
---
You usually see the price of a item in its description right? Double it, no matter how high it will end up :) Somebody will buy it.
---
If backpacks are endgame...
---
Does it add any bonus like weight or anything or is it just cosmetic like a "skin"?
---
There is a lodge next to the scouts robot that you go to in order to start the quest (in the toxic valley, to the east of the penitentiary). There are two computers in the room, but you can still use it if both are occupied. It will load up the terminal in your pip boy instead. Be prepared for some frustration though, there are no study guides or whatever, although a few users have started collecting answers to all of them already
---
Don't worry. Plasma rifles and tesla will now pop up like crazy ,since the grounded mutatiom is fixed. They and the gauss rifle will be nerfed too oblivion too and we will finally be forced to play melee in every situation.
---
Honestly I think selling them for 500 is a fair price, expecially since I can get around 450 just for selling them to vendors.
---
Those guys who are selling them for 2000 though, lmao.
---
10% what?
---
I don't think this one has been posted yet if so then I'm sorry but, when I fast travel to any camp with a vendor I get stuck  inside the house and am unable to get out and/or teleport inside my PA.
---
When you reach a certain level, and explored the majority of the maps, you will see events poping up and people join those events frequently.
---
Me gt is njorls

I had one earlier today on XB1 while building my camp. It was maybe around 3 EST

i dont know if will help or not but i died to imposter sheep and the game wouldnt let me respawn at all. i was just aboot to close my game but tried turning off my controller(ps4) and then turning it back on again and it seemed to fix the problem. i dont know why but this has happened before where i die and the game seems to not register controller inputs anymore. atleast i found a solution for ps4(atleast for me)

I'm just looking at it based on numbers. They said it got nerfed by 80%, so why am I having to put 10x more shells into an enemy now to kill them? It's worthless now even point blank. This is a TSE combat with all 9 shotgun perks, level 3 skeet shooter, level 5 demo, and level 4 adrenaline, while using Overdrive. VATS shots used to annihilate enemies, now it seems like they aren't even hitting sometimes.

It's a form of end-game. Something for people to coming back every day to unlock better and better mods.
---
Same as strangler but glowing yellow. There are 3 or 4 near Dyer chemicals just jump to river and move forward and backward u will  see them
---
Xbox? I can help later. Be on around 9ish EST. Hour or so...
---
Pretty sure it's new, first time I've seen it at least.
---
Magazine are between 50 to 70c
---
Bobble heads are 50 to 70c
---
Why they changed building from the fallout 4 version I have no idea.
---
Pc, sorry
---
Better get fixed
---
Are you saying it is just like the Assaultron head skin which is actually a craftable weapon by itself?
---
Possums spawn around the lake just north of the lumber yard and south of the meth lab with ticks, both just down the hill from Vault 76. I don't remember place names, but I think you know which places I mean.
---
Uh yeah. They are unlocked for a reason.
---
Fallout 3 and fallout new Vegas start with you taking tests
---

---
I'm joining ur world
---
That's not endgame. That should be normal gameplay.
---
Wha... What?
---
I was confused when the dialogue changed and told me to give him stuff so I just put my gun away and did nothing and then he said " what are you dense?"
---
Yeah my wife won't be happy her favorite shotty isn't going to be reliable to get her out of a jam anymore.
---
Hm I‚Äôll try that even though I‚Äôm on Xbox. Thanks for the advice!

It depends on where you are on the map. If I am beside a vendor and it‚Äôs 71 caps, but you are a 20 cap fast travel and a loading screen away plus 44 caps. I‚Äôd just buy from vendor. If I was close to your camp. Then I‚Äôd just get from you.

IT was probably a server that was scheduled to go down for maintenance. I was playing on the same server for several hours a couple nights ago, and at one point I noticed that there were only a handful of people on the map, and then like 45 minutes there was a pop up saying server shutting down for maintenance in X minutes.
---
I'm assuming they stop letting new palyers on at some point before a reboot so that they don't interrupt too many folks when they're in the middle of something.
---
Its taken a little getting used to. I was re building my camp today. It was weird having a different person in my camp seemingly every time i turned around.
---
It is the counter to stealth boys
---
And only lasts three minutes without perks
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty balanced, keep popping them, you‚Äôll get addicted
---

Sorry bud, but you won't get any scrip that way. Needs to be at the machine outside the train station.
