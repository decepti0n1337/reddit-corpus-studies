The bug is *bonus* carry weight. If they fix it you’ll be at 325 all the time.

---
Nice attempt at circlejerking. But seriously the game needs work. That's okay. I'd rather people stay vocal than have another AAA company like Bethesda release a game like this again. 
---
does right stick down work in player trading? i know it works in npc vendors
---
Try behind the church, I was there for a while
---
Here are some locations. I actually farmed T-51b in these places (it's better than 45) but 45 also spawns in these locations. One is the crashed Vertibird at Watoga. The other is in a building just around the corner from it but you'll need lock picking to get in. And the other is on the 4th floor of Fort Defiance.

Team + Ghoulish + Rad Sponge (Shared) = never lose any hitpoints during entire scorchbeast queen fight.  SOOOO yeah I prefer rads :P
---
Cloth is easy to farm, a run through the fairgrounds and picking up all the garbage gave me ~200 of it. Watoga Highschool + Morgantown Highschool + cat house give just over 300+ plastic. So it's the same thing really
---
I just want the stash limit increased
---
True although I would like a marine bolstering set + rad resistance. With that and rad-x you could go into a nuke zone gaining about the same rads as being in a PA. Unyielding + star would be nice as well for a end game melee build. 
---
It was not as common before the surge of duped explosives. Most games have a one-shot method, but it being almost everywhere is absurd.
---
I point this out. Because the entire game is based around not having a functional ladder. Lol
---
Ya I already knew about the pistol rifle thing, I was just wondering if there was an energy specific perks, like there are for explosives, but no, not other than ammo wt &amp; crafting perks
---
You got too many questions man I’m sorry lol. I was at work earlier but now I’m home so I’ll be back at this shit tomorrow 
---
Sometimes my wife helps me design, build, and decorate my camp. Wether I like it or not. Lol
---
I was considering that perk. +20% damage seems good.
---
Fourier_socks I’m down for this 
---
Seems like you are a smart little cunt, am i rite mate?
---
Nowhere near as the No man sky shitstorm and most of the videos made about Fallout 76 nowadays are mostly talking about the marketing issues surrounding the game or the issues with the engine.
---
And yes it's in a lot of worst game of 2018 list but if it's there it's for right reasons
---
Because you like a game doesn't mean that all the people hating on it are wrong and it doesn't mean that they shouldn't talk about it either.
---
People do what they want and if you can't tell all the people hating on this game  why they are wrong then maybe they are right 
---
There's a difference between letting Bethesda know there are problems that they need to address, even being on their case about it, and throwing a temper tantrum like a toddler/ being an insufferable human being who leeches off of self-righteous outrage. 
---
Yes it did. It showed that you can shit a half-baked product out the door with a premium pricetag and people will thank you for it. That is an uneducated consumer right there, with standards so low they would make Satan bend down with a magnifying glass.
---
I've gotten pretty good blueprints from defending workshops
---
RTX on
---
I have a friend who is running a hand gun build and says he loves it. It seems to be a harder play through which I would probably enjoy. That’s definitely the next build on my list. 
---
The gym in flatwoods, each day grab all the weights (24 hour cool down) and scrap them for lead.
---
Sunmersville has super mutants who will drop some .308 ammo but also weapons (to scrap for metal) and gun powder 
---
I have the same feeling man, i loved how the night was before.
---
Visual based, walking at night was a complete different experience, the sky was deep dark blue, the forest where you only saw dark silhouettes of trees.
---
You walk and see some lights in the distance, your natural instinct follows the light source just to make a new discovery.
---
Now, its just the opposite, the night lost its unique visuals and atmosphere and have a very generic white-grey-blue look that hurt my eyes.
---
Every tool in the game that was designed around night and dark areas also is less useful now.
---
A much better change would be to make nights even darker, but give players abit more exp, or buffing the tools.
---
Patching the night out of the game was the wrong way, its a post apocalyptic semi survival game after all. 
---
When anything, nights, rain and rad storms should play a much bigger role in Fallout 76.
---
People demonizing the game and the company are honestly the only way we can send them a message, I think saturating the gaming world with hate of this product is the only way to ensure they get that we won’t accept anything released in as poor a state as fallout 76. 
---
Yeah, it's a good idea, but since regular armor has legendary effects, it would be unbalanced compared to power armors lack of said effects. At least, that's why I *think* this is the way it is.
---
If they add legendary power armor then I imagine they might fix this, if it's even intended. Though, I got into a big argument telling a guy this was likely not going to happen because it upends the way everything works. But if you send a ticket then it's something they might think about! 
---
Enjoy the game if you like it. I play every night, despite its bugs.  Remember that opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. 
---
I was referring to you. 
---
Not once did the OP imply 76 was perfect. Or that it's sales numbers are through the roof. 
---
Not one time. So how he is delusional for points that you pulled out of thin air is beyond me. 
---
Reading comprehension is taught in grade school. 
---
Also the word delusional isn't a difficult one. Imagining people making points they absolutely did not, not even contextually or implied is delusional. 
---
You know. Seeing things that aren't there. Believing things that have evidence that says otherwise. 
---
Like the opinions you seemed to have imagined the OP having. 
---
Delusional. 
---
I'm super gullible and always believe in the best of people 😣 so not sure if you're a troll or just have a sarcastic deadpan kind of humor~ either way everyone is someone and all someones that like to play the game should meet up and have fun! I get that you are into legendaries and that's super cool~ good luck farming but please don't be mean to anyone in this thread. 
---
I got a T-60 calibrated shocks plan from the same vendor this morning. Xbox
---
I'm talking almost exclusively about how it impacts whitesprings farming and events, though the actual damage it does tends to make the game an order of magnitude easier. You don't even need to hit most enemies, just place a couple of shots near them to clear out a crowd.
---
It's rendered fat boys, missile launchers, grenades and grenade launchers somewhat obsolete
---
It depends on whether you want $20* games or $20 games.
---
*On sale
---
The game is joyfully bad. I'm having a silly time playing it with my friends. Every time we play, I encounter a different game breaking bug. It's quite remarkable.
---
Still, it's *really fucking bad*. Make my mistake. 
---
50 caps to go from one end of the map to the other doesn't seem unnecessarily high to me
---
I think you interrupted what I said as a figurative removing of the gloves. But what I said was the politest way to address the statement without capitulating disingenuously. Not everything can be devoid of politics, there is always nuance, please just try to escalate less
---
Too many questions like 'Why isn't that thing that they do which makes money a *real* job?'
---
I agree they are very happy making!
---
Well, sounds like you've definitely got the system down pat. What's funny is that for me I felt like after 50 the levels started to slow down noticeably. I think these days it takes me an average of 1-2 nights to get one level.
---
I'm constantly dropping off/giving low level players goods whenever we cross paths, I'm running a medic build so I always have more rad-x, rad-away, stims, and miscellaneous healing items/food or water then I know what to do with
---
Wow. Serums do that? I did not know...
---
if nobody is upset, nothing changes. the widespread criticism is a net good for bethesda and the gaming industry at large
---
I see a lot of comparisons below to small title games vs Bethesda, such as rust and subnotica and so forth. I feel the only game that really compares on the same level would be the big ol Bungo release of Destiny 2. I find the two very comparable in the paths they have taken.
---
A big title, with lots of promise, falling extremely short. Destiny 2 has bounced back somewhat, though I still struggle to launch it up, despite owning the annual pass nonsense(I tend to spend money I shouldn't). Fallout 76 has a similar start to it, I've been playing the hell out of it, though am getting to the end of my 6-8 hours seshing and am lucky to pull off a couple here or there. 
---
I saw one example of someone comparing it to Rust down below, I laughed to myself clearly knowing the launch of Rust was nothing too spectacular compared to its current state.
---
I still have High hopes for 76, I just really hope they get to crackin the whip come late Jan to Feb. I really don't want to wait around a year for it to get better... though gods knows I will cause I'm a sucker for punishment.
---
clearly one with a super load motor.  
---
mr gandy buzz blade is my choice.  
---
&gt;two shot fat man
---
ayyyyyyyyyy 
---
Please never stop making this. 
---
&gt; did him 100 times in one day
---
Well that sounds horrible
---
So I thought about this a little more. What if those reductions are multiplicative instead of additive? That means you're taking 80% of 50% (or vice versa) of the damage, which is 10%. So say a 20ft fall kills you, normally; now a 200ft fall kills you. Garrahan Estate is pretty tall. 
---
Alternatively, maybe it takes the greater of your fall damage reductions. So you're still taking maybe 20% of the possible damage.
---
But it doesn't take a duped weapon to kill you in one shot does it?
---
If anything, Fallout 76 doesn't get enough hate. I don't understand why fans let this shit slide. You'd think that fans would be the most critical about their product but no. [This video sums up perfectly what is wrong with Bethesda and what always has been wrong with them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D4NkS19Nso&amp;t=10350s) It even beat industry-wide workplace scandals.
---
Yup, have all accept this outfit.. lol. Have the caps to spend need be, or op weps, or a full unyielding 2-3star set for it..
---
I've accidentally scrapped really good things. My sincerest condolences, as I am all too familiar with the feeling...
---
I think they might be the single highest threat enemy you routinely face. And in numbers they are way more of a threat that any of the big bad monsters.
---
&gt;	
---
&gt;	Edit: Thanks for the instant downvotes. I’m sure that will help the game move into a better state and encourage bug reports that assist Bethesda and making it a great experience for all players.
---
&gt;	When this game came out I defended it. I said that the accusations against it were overblown and the bugs were largely exaggerated. 
---
It sounds like they are doing exactly what you were doing.
---
Jackpack. Hehehehe. Use your hands. 
---
There's some good reviewers out there that I found after TB left (RIP) that focus more on the technical aspects of the games being ported or just the details of how the game works. Better for Japanese ports to PC or if I just don't know what a game is. Most of them are very upfront about what their opinions and preferences are with a big YMMV sticker.
---
I want to upvote this and downvote this at the same time lol
---
Im a cruel realist. 
---
I think this guy is probably an asshole for murdering people who are farming legendaries.
---
i played it though and it sucks.
---
I generally would not defend any game mechanic designed to frustrate players. Making something a challenge is one thing, but if the player has already done the challenging part (killing enemies), it should not be hard to collect the associated reward (loot), simply because you cannot *find* it. Or for any other reason, really, but that one is especially stupid. 
---
Assaultron blade or the good ole shishkabab
---
Is that funny for you?
---
It's a serious question. I would not have fun grinding that hard, I like this game mostly for the exploration.
---
Level 35 and barely played quests. I don't trust my luck for legendary drops later on, i want the quest rewards to be as high level as possible so i can use those for endgame till i eventually stumble upon the real good stuff. I just explore, clear towns and dungeons, hunt for power armor and fill my junk with late game junk.
---
Just explore as you like. But: I highly suggest to farm for the hand made plans in harpers ferry when you reach level 15 -20 ( i got mine at level 18). The hype is real, the handmade is a great gun and having the plans is key to make it even better. Lever action plans are nice to have too, maybe even 10mm smg plans as the gun is quite rare otherwise.
---
You could just not play the game. You don't even have to buy another Bethesda product. That's the brillaince of it all. Your misery here is entirely your choice. If the company wants to release an incomplete product, and then handle the situation poorly, that's their choice. If they suffer with poor support in the future, then that is the reality of their situation.
---
You don't have to participate. You're choosing too. You're choosing to continue arguing against something and it's so clearly making you unhappy. Your reaction is entirely within your control. Although Bethesda failed to produce a quality product you enjoyed, they aren't to blame for your continous issues surrounding the situation. If they don't want to resolve it to your satisfaction; walk the fuck away. No one owes you anything. 
---
I wouldn't expect them to acknowledge it until they find a solution. Right now, X% of their player base knows about the dupe situation. If they come out and say "We're aware of it and will be fixing it in the next patch", anyone who wasn't aware of it is going to google it and potentially abuse it until they roll out the patch, thereby making things even worse.
---
They give you the specific mutation and supress the side-effects of said mutation for the first hour, yeah. Very limited use in regular gameplay. This interaction with Class Freak is nice but has even more limited benefits, seeing as it only ever applies for an hour (per serum).
---
If you were to buy a lot of serums and chug them and then put on rank 3 of Class Freak that'd give you some insane buffs, albeit quite briefly.
---
Remove scorbests then at least, cause those are easy to farm for commendations ons the bog.
---
Took all about 40min to kill enough of them from the events only when I helped a friend, just traveling in the bog fissures would net more in that time. 
---
Well it is a shit game and deserves every but of criticism. 
---
No way. Only my adult children - - ie OP. 
---
What time of day for EST is the nuke code reset?
---
Yeah I recently reinstalled after quitting in mid december. I quit due to duping (just don't agree with it at all) and was still having fun pvping when I could find willing opponents or snipe wanted people with my stalkers musket. 
---
Saw my first TSE guy in a nuke zone yesterday and he was one shotting everything with little regard to who hit which mob. When I do whitesprings I'll sit and block hits while I do the follow me emote to get people to hit a legendary, as long as they keep up with me. It's just common courtesy! But I definitely equipped my instigating sledgehammer and threw on Glow Sights and did my best to steal loot n xp from that dweeb!
---
It's *exhausting*?
---
Aw, you poor thing. 
---
They are out there, just rare.  Found "The Dragon" black powder explosive shot when I was in the 60s.  Mostly useless due to slow firing rate.  Then around level 100 I got a 2 shot 10mm sub machine gun.  My build is a VATS crit build so I just swapped out my rifle cards for automatic cards.  At times the 2 shot will really randomly hit other things in VATS but for the most part this 2 shot murders just about anything with a tap of the mouse in VATS.
---
If you've played the division, it had a similar function, the darkzone was the pvp enabled spot, and the light zone was the "single player mode" that you could invite friends into.  I honestly enjoyed it for what it was, but the pve players whined about the good loot being locked behind the dz/pvp until 90% of the pve base was gone.
---
I like the idea of higher rewards for pvp servers, but need to remove the crutch that is slap damage. Pacifist mode should still be a thing, and when turned off would highlight/flag that player as someone wanting to start something.
---
As for pve only server, either have no legendaries or have them only 1 star, (queue the crying carebears). Or have them drop at a lower level than the pvp derived variant. 
---
These are just some thoughts, but even with that implementation with player marketplaces/dupers, everyone will eventually have access to the god tier weapons, to correct make legendaries non tradable\*? Limit what items can be traded/dropped?
---
\* After thinking about all they would have to do is trade a bullet for said price, the drop the duped gun/item. 
---
Oh woops, I just said the same thing as you lol
---
The media blowout has died down. If anyone is still going on about it (not excluding new developments eg the nukes suddenly not working) they’re just trolling and trying to get a reaction
---
I can't stand the gaming YouTubers anymore. One guy speculated that es6 is young to be a rushed piece of trash because they are trying to make up for fallout 76s earnings. Literally no evidence, nothing to imply that's the case, just one guys speculation. Stirred up a big pot of people who now hate Bethesda, and it only made the problem worse. The hate is just going to keep growing and growing because it's fun to hate something. But we're gonna be real sad when Bethesda stops releasing quality content because nobody would forgive them after making up for their wrong doings.
---
Atlas’  gameplay with the race wars was enough to keep the game going. 
---
Just to add to it. Diluted rad-x does not suppress mutations 
---
players who come near you dont just disconnect, the whole server crashes. i tried this out with some friends (some got close, some stayed away). as they got close to me, the server crashed for EVERYONE
---
Using diluted rad x or radshield does NOT have this effect!
---
If you're going to use turrets. The MG turrets have the longest and best target acquisition maybe as good as an ASAM. Other turrets are worse in this regard but your turrets are networked together. so a couple mg turrets working as overwatch drastically improve the effectiveness of laser and missile turrets.
---
These boys were cheating. They accessed the dev room somehow.
---
This game really doesn't want you to horde things, likely some kind of twisted player retention method.
---
Just set up an artist Patreon and put them up for people to print in high quality who support you.
---
Translation: "I am feeling really insecure about my purchase and I wish that everyone would shut up and stop hating on a game I had no part in developing and that ,due to the Eula, is basically just on loan to me. If you could all just shut up about how much you don't like the game so I can enjoy that would be fabulous. You see I don't mind myself and others getting fucked over but don't you dare point it out."
---
But he says he likes the event, so I took it as he likes to friendly PvP for the event only. 🤗
---
Instead of shooting they should just say “pewpewpew!”
---
Maybe people have different opinions on “defending”. A comment saying that the game isn’t as bad as what people are saying vs downvoting any complaint legitimate or otherwise.
---
When the game came out there were a ton of reuploads of the same exact videos of a bug. That’s unfair to use as evidence of a game being broken. And fortunately this sub has largely moved on from the hate fest that it was around launch. So I understand fo76 fans (like myself) being abrasive to complaints of bugs and broken games. This post and this video however are from a player that loves the game and has been experiencing an abnormal amount of bugs, and is seeking answers.
---
This is interesting, not an angle I have thought about this from
---
At this point, the people who play FO76 to create a bad experience for other players are the problem.
---
I didn’t play this game at release, I got it a few weeks ago, so idk what it was like at launch. For me, it’s been pretty damn stable and ACTUALLY FUN! I even got a fellow FO fan friend that was HIGHLY AGAINST this game to play it regularly and he enjoys it too.
---
Should devs/studios release broken games? No, but you can’t beat a dead horse forever.
---
One of my buddies actually theorized that very thing when we went back to the spot at night to see if it would happen again. It didn't of course, but a spooky ghost dev could be on the prowl
---
Do they have a story that can be followed?
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe you can trade stuff and set the price to 0 caps so the other party can take the item. That should be safer than dropping on the ground.
---
&gt;Is GTA Online a multiplayer game? It is.
---
agreed.
---
&gt;Do you need other players for anything?
---
you kinda do. without players, GTAO is just GTAV, except with nothing to do. now you understand why people say Fo76 is having an identity crisis: there's not enough multiplayer mechanics and there's not enough singleplayer content. partially because one gets in the way of the other.
---
&gt;This isn't even remotely similar to Dark Souls.
---
it's the same. Fo76 is a singleplayer-focused experience with optional coop/pvp tackled on. you can experience it entirely alone and it wouldn't detract from your experience, *at all*. you can, however, engage other players to arguably improve the experience, if you wish to do so.
---
&gt;Even I hadn't played the Dark Souls series, then what would happen?
---
you wouldn't understand where I'm coming from? you clearly don't, hence why I'm assuming you haven't played it.
---
&gt;So are you over a decade familiar with WoW or EVE? Omg, are you saying that you are a... "MMO fiend"!?
---
hardly. I have kept up with gaming for over 2 decades though, and I remember when Chinese gold resellers became a thing. thankfully I declined my EVE invite.
---
&gt;You don't think that trading in-game goods for other goods, currency or services should be considered a market.
---
how did you even get that from my posts? that's not what I said, at all. I even clarified it a couple times. I very clearly stated that a market, in the mmo sense, means in-game goods traded for real money.
---
&gt;Sadly for you, the very concept of Economy is there to prove you wrong.
---
and sadly for you, the South Koreans have defined the meaning of "mmo market" 10 years ago. and trust me, they don't deal in caps.
---
I feel as if Oxhorn is the only youtuber that genuinely loved the game.
---
Umm they attempted to fix duping last patch. So how is that not addressing it. 
---
What are you wanting them to say instead of do?
---
Post the very opinions that you made that we all know are true? What's the point in that. They obviously know it's a problem. They tried to patch it. 
---
Pretend it didn't exist. THEY TRIED TO FIX THE ISSUE. 
---
Fuck. Where the fuck does this sub find you people. For fucking real. I wish subs required a competency test.
---
I don't think most people reach that limit. Have you thought of investing your money in Vault-Tec stocks?
---
&gt;  i wish beth had the br level of communication at a minimum
---
Not to excuse BGS's complete lack of communication, but keep in mind that Epic is making making $250 million in profit (yes profit, not revenue) every month off of Fortnite BR micro-transactions. Of course they're going to have a teams working 24/7 to address the community and fix glitches.
---
390 is pretty good.  The guys that get waaaaay up there are tweaking on lots of buffs and goofy builds.
---
That's so true . It goes against every bone in my body to drop stuff . I want it all.
---
Does it also suppress the negative effects? 
---
I mean, were you able to type that out with a straight face? "Improved, but not completely fixed" such a simple concept as moving a camp? Lowering absurdly high microtransaction prices? Seriously? And you're calling nerfing power cores "balancing"? "*Attempted* to fix duping"? Yeah, I'd say this list is delusional.
---
I’m so glad you mentioned this. NV was easily as buggy and ridiculous as this. Only difference is they didn’t completely introduce a new element of multiplayer to a fan base, but honestly after 4, that’s what many people who enjoyed the game were talking about at least in my circles. It’s really the multiplayer bit and I will say the no NPCs is jarring at first but fairly easy to settle into. 
---
But honestly this is par maybe bogey for the course for Bethesda and fallout games but it always ends up a better game and patched over time. 
---
Hmm so op wants to suppress free speech... Visits  subs that don't conform to his beliefs.. Stupid. 
---
I had a beserkers fatman that seemed like it would be fun to chameleon grief peoples camps with. But I don't do that so I dropped it :/
---
Sure
---
Attempting to fix duping isn't acknowledging it?
---
One thing I should point out is when the game was in B.E.T.A, Bethesda said that the released product is not going to be a final product until AFTER launch. So there you have it. Godd did it again
---
no. it's actually a good idea as some legendary weapon quest rewards are based on level so if you wait to level 50 you can get the max level variant of that reward
---
This is just what it looks like on console
---
Ah yes, post-purchase rationalization.
---
Sorry but I can't hold back.
---
Ninjas didn't use Katanas they used Ninjotos which are just straight bladed katana.
---
But just use the Chinese officer sword.
---
Heard they're on the up and up .
---
I believe so, not quite sure.
---
I rarely notice the negatives, tbh, but I have 2 ranks in class freak
---
Maybe it is the power armor. I found my bag but after nearly getting killed by the angry bots and turrets.
---
Your post has 2300 points, six silver and two gold but this comment section is fucking ridiculous. 
---
"But everything about this game is broken" etc — eat my entire ass. 
---
Really says something about the vocal haters compared to the silent majority. 
---
Fuck 'em, man. Come on over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals and hang out with a bunch of chill Appalachians who just don't give a shit. 
---
Horribly, in 6 weeks I've gotten exactly one non-tier 1 / tier 2 plan
---
yeah, what's the problem with that? people who don't like to get oneshot can partake in "real" pvp in workshops and people who do like it can do so wherever.
---
and people who don't like pvp should just keep pacifist on and bug Bethesda to turn the debuff into 0 damage instead of chip.
---
They tried to fix it but have not acknowledged it....
---
Are you for fucking real?
---
How are you defending this game? Have you played it?
---
Damn. I've lost count of the number of times I've done uranium fever and it still hasn't dropped.
---
ah, that's good to know
---
I like the idea with a bit of tweaking, well thought out 
---
Just refund the game is possibile because it's only going to get worse.
---
Demolition is in intelligence, I believe. 
---
A little late here but....aren’t we supposed to be some genius from the vault?  So why then would we take the time to craft a broken crapper and broken bath tub.  Wouldn’t me craft a nice one from the start?  
---
Completely agree. Always get excited at the suggested YT video showing 76 then I see the title is basically saying it sucks. I love 76, yeah it's not perfect but it's still really fun
---
BuT iT jUSt WoRKs
---
And I have the right to my opinion that if you're still complaining about the same thing months after its release, and you're still playing it; even though most of these things you're complaining about has happened with so many other games, even AAA producers[Yes, even the beloved RDR2. To an even bigger extent imo] then you're most likely complaining because you're trying to fit into the crowd/bandwagon. 
---
put out shitty game, win shitty prizes.
---
yeah, that's my point. they should make it so legendary effects are disabled in workshops and explicitly state "you see this? this is a workshop, it's meant for pvp. go somewhere else if you don't want to pvp".
---
a large portion of the playerbase, the majority I'd say, plays solo and probably doesn't care about nerfing legendaries.
---
maybe minimum is to harsh a word that i used, perhaps as a goal would be better since you have a solid point there.  i like that they took patchnotes a step in the right direction, id just like them to keep making that forward direction.
---
You the leather coat and travelling leather coat. What do they look like?
---
I paid full price. I've got over 200 hours in and still haven't found everything. I'd say I got my money's worth. 
---
This happened Saturday night (or I guess early early Sunday morning - like around 2pm I think). I couldn't sleep so I figured I'd jump on. Definitely made it more spooky at night.
---
You think there is a ghost dev going around spooking players? That has got to be fun lol
---
I actually love that song. The right amount of rediculous for the fallout games I think.
---
My game crashed 6 times yesterday just organising my inventory. I'm having fun, but they should've spent more time on bug-fixing before release.
---
Also because NMS devs didn’t continue shitting a hole straight through the bed well after the release of the game. They stayed silent and waited to make meaningful changes far too long after the launch of the game for most fallout fans to care anymore so they dismissed the game entirely and held it as a disappointment of a fallout game
---
Over 1800+ on Terraria. Definitely the most fun game and most played as well. If vanilla content becomes repetitive, there’s mods that add even more content. 
---
The only disappointment in the radio is all the songs from old fallouts. They're great, but its been over 10 years, Bethesda. Please move on.
---
I believe the best answer for this is the “rad-shield” recipe.  This aid blocks much more radiation, lasts a little longer and, I’ve read, it doesn’t suppress mutations.  
---
I'm not sure about everyone else, but the biggest thing I've noticed when talking with people about the game, is that they insist its horrible and a dumpster fire of a game, yet when asked they admit they've never played a minute of it. I don't care if you've seen hundreds of hours of gameplay and read pages upon pages of reviews, you need to play the game for yourself (and for more than 5 minutes at that) to get the true experience of the game. Especially since the gaming news sites and review channels pump out negativity nonstop, valid or not, it's critical that people form their own opinions of the game by playing it before lecturing others on why it's bad.
---
Or if there was a "spectator" mode, but you could still somewhat interact with things. Like a poltergeist kind of thing
---
It wasn’t the people, the modders DID fix it, and Bethesda banned them. Lol.   
---
  
---
 Pretty sure it was Bethesda that annoyed Fov was something they weren’t able to do with their own engine, due to limitations. 
---
&gt; , I think it’s important to let Bethesda know that the release of the game was unacceptable.
---
What better way than to just not buy their games.
---
Interesting I’ll have to try out mods some other time then thank you for the recommendation
---
You want a bad game I'll sell you the crew 2. The AI rides your ass the whole fucking race, you can't catch up to them and they can take corners at 200+ mph and pull a full 180 on that shit. Not to mention that the AI also drives through any obstacle while it's behind you. That's a fucking bad game. Now 76 on the other hand has its shit moments. Like server crashes, stash size and the odd broken mission and the scorch beast fights which come to think of it they fixed didn't they???
---
Compare the 2 games 76 wins hands down. Now compare 76 with fallout 4 it's debatable but I liked 4 over 76 
---
There's my fucking rant. I just get tired of people bitching about a good game when there's living trash from some other shitty dev
---
Well that's just your ill informed opinion. You just don't like hearing about the flaws of the game you enjoy. 
---
I honestly have to agree, but at the same time, the game's state right now sucks on ps4 and across all platforms. Automatic weapons are nearly unusable due to the lag they create. The end game is very boring and really sucks when the scorchbeast queen doesn't give great loot, or even worse all of the disconnects. Now the disconnects are due to dupers and the like, but the lack of control from bethesda is disturbing. I love this game, and will keep playing it, but man does it hurt to be a fallout 76 fan right now. 
---
You’re right sorry.
---
I have no points in strength and only 7 in intelligence so it will be a trade off between demolition and gunsmith should I ever get an explosive rifle 
---
What exactly CAN they do though? The likes of Warcraft have had this issue-has anyone come up with an answer?
---
I'll agree on the point that there is just too much trash talking about this game on every feed these days. But on the other hand I see why. This games state is unacceptable especially for what we were shown and Bethesda had been making so many mistakes you'd think they were trying to become more hated than EA.
---
  I get that it's too popular to hate on this game but the amount of ammo it affords it's haters is profound. 
---
Doot doot all aboard the hate train
---
At 2am with all the lights off - I was spooked. Totally got the weeping angel vibes
---
It's 1000% better with friends. My buddies and I play the fuck out of it. Games fun man. A bit buggy, sure, but laugh it off with your mates. 
---
I would farm some t-51 but I'm only level 25 lol
---
The caps were set low for the same reason the trades were set to 5k max per item. It was an attempt to control the economy of the game early. But ignorance and greed from the early traders screwed it up. Then here comes the dupers which actually did bring down the cost of many items. But at the price of server stability. Anyway back to your original point, economy control is the reason for the cap limit. However I disagree with saying it's low. 
---
I believe there is no capacitor that increases damage. I have scraped a lot and haven’t gotten anything of the sort. My knowledge is the piercing capacitor is best. Armour pen and either faster reload or 1 extra round. (I don’t remember which it was) I’m not sure about stocks but I think the one I use is reduced recoil / hipfire acc
---
What about Rad Resistant? Please let me know
---
Yoh went against the hate train. Facts don't matter at that point. 
---
The scapism in you is strong boy.
---
Just don't watch media and youtube and simply play the game you like then? Other people are allowed to express their own opinion if you are not aware?
---
And that's where I wanted to go. Without players, FO76 is just another Fallout. You kinda do need other players. Otherwise, just pick up Fallout 4.
---
So that's your approach. Well, that can be said for *any* online game that is not exclusively PvP, right? You can hide away from other people as much as you want. Hell, there's even people at WoW that do so and just play it for the lore. But I'm pretty sure that they don't try to claim that it isn't multiplayer.
---
And I argue that real money isn't needed. Going with that analogy, the trading that the primitive tribes did before any type of currency existed can't be called a market... yeah, try to tell that to a historian.
---
Good thing this isn't an MMO, then.
---
I did the final brotherhood mission like 8 times due to crashes and server disconnects and it restarts at the beginning every time.  I'm on a Xbox one X.  So I'm guessing they just couldn't optimize..... The game and it's just luck to not crash or disconnect often.  Also I make my settings on PC and only disconnected 1 time but that's only a lvl 8 character so far 
---
&gt; since they aren't as easy to spot as the rest of the nuked flora
---
It's not even necessarily that they aren't easy to spot–it's that the ferns are extremely similar to some of the randomly generated cosmetic fauna which is infuriating because it seems like they pulled that one out of the "Bad Design Decisions 101" textbook.
---
I've seen them on 100+ dupers....I stopped trying then
---
Lol no worries man. Thanks anyway!
---
got it too after like 5hops, thanks again 
---
No big deal, bud! 
---
Side note: Shit, I need to rewatch Austin Powers!
---
Couldnt not agree more, and I wish this kind of system was in every faction and most of your desired items could be obtained this way
---
I would rather grind for 8 hours than server hop a vendor for 8 hours so I could at least PLAY
---
Surface to air is the only other one I know of 
---
I did not realize this and have booked it a few times when a higher level arrived at my workshop 😆 I shall try to have more faith in my fellow vault dwellers 
---
I changed my weight strategy a bit. I got rid of pack rat and replaced it with energy ammo reduction. Instead of keeping most junk on me, and Excess fusion cores in stash, I now keep all junk in stash and all cores on me. If I die, minimal loss of junk if I cant get to my bag. Reducing gauss ammo and fusion core weights is huge for me. I still have thru hiker and the chem weight reduction. Maybe eventually I can shed one of those.
---
As a rifle user, i have maxed out rifleman, but if i ever need to regain a few points i can easily snatch a few of those without sacrificing too much. Need to build up a collection of assorted rifleman ranks...handy for swapping in glowsighted and such situationally.
---
Also, I guess I'd have a better chance of reaching 25k if I didn't use so many chems. :(
---
This.  100%  If you are enjoying the gamr, please love the shit out of it.  I tried my best.  As did 3 of my friends who  LOVE Fallout games.  We all stopped adter 3 weeks.  A game you doesnt not equal a good game.  Ive enjoyed plenty of games, and even movies, stand up, ext. that I know were universally trash.  
---
You could probably spend it pretty fast buying plans, if you can remember which ones you already know.

I thought this was the subreddit for people to cry about crappy YouTube channels that are negative about Bethesda? Not very supportive.
---
I have the same problem, only I don't have a piano in my camp. I wonder if it is something other than a piano preventing it? I'm going to try deleting some of the more recent objects I've added to see if I can figure it out.
---
When you say you removed the piano, did you delete it or just store it? Reason I ask is a friend of mine built me a nuclear power generator and I'd prefer not to delete it for the sake of a test.
---
When you read about the actions of Hornwright and AMS in the Ash Heap, it breaks my heart a little.
---
I'm the same when the scorched tell me to run. It makes me wonder if they're basically possessed. Unable to control their actions, because the queen directs them, but cognisant of the evils they're doing.
---
I was wondering what happened one time while I was farming whitespring. All a bunch of level 60 something glowing ones. Some of the plants were flux. But no radiation or red tint. Also, I was taking way less damage than I should've and almost no radiation from the ghoul hits. 
---
You get 20 Atoms für 7600 hours of playtime. I don't even know what to say about any of that 
---
Meh
---
“Wah people call the game I like trash” 
---
Even YouTubers I like who played the game then stopped. For example I subscribe to a channel called Hat Films, they played 76 for a couple of episodes and stopped and then in an unrelated video later they said they enjoyed playing the game, but had to end the series as it wasn't getting enough views.
---
Conversely, I unsubcribed from Juice Head in the end. He intially made a couple of videos talking about thepositives he see's in the game, then out of nowhere changedhis mind, exploited the weight limit glich, and then just posted nothing but shit about the game. I understand disliking something but then usually I just stop subjecting myself to it and move onto something else. So what if I enjoy the game? What the fuck does that have to do with somebody else? 
---
Come to r/fo76FilthyCasuals where we talk about the game, share our own memes if you like that sort of thing and genuinely just have a fun and super chill time away from the reddit circle jerk. 
---
Thank you for this. Just subbed to like 4 new subreds. Tired of being notified of whiney posts that dont contribute to my active enjoyment of the game.
---
Right? Give us 7600 atoms, because we probably won't even need them by then anyway.
---
Yes, absolutely.. It doesn't run the best and has tons of bugs but I still like it. 
---
Thank you for the answer, I forgot to mention my heating of the armor piercing capacitor, actually sounds pretty sweet! I'd better get to scrapping!
---
I agree mostly, but it depends on the workshop and type of mob. I got stuck on mt. blair for at least half an hour on the first wave because one tiny robot was stuck in a hole somewhere. I had pretty much given up when I found it, but once I had it let the event continue.
---
I disagree about turrets. They seem to do a pretty good job if you can put them where you know the mobs will show up. The Poseidon workshop isn't bad because they all tend to funnel in through the gate by the workbench and stop to attack the extractor there. Just point enough turrets at it and you probably won't have to fire a shot.
---
This is more in response to how it impacts gameplay for those around you, than workshop pvp. I didn't realize that was an issue, even.
---
2SE makes any other combination inefficient for queen fights, and one or two bullets hitting near a target can clear a crowd at white springs, preventing others from getting any credit. 
---
If you want to instagib a crowd, it should require an actual explosive ordinance like grenades or a rocket launcher, rather than just a shotgun and some distance. Switching from "explosive" to "incendiary" would I feel drastically rebalance content for groups of people, especially those who have one vs those who do not. It would also bring the current "best" down to "better than most but still on par with other weapon combos" like 2s + rof. Of course, it doesn't help that 2S is better than pretty much any other legendary effect, either. 
---
Right now I can clear a crowd by firing a couple of bullets near them and never once need to land a direct hit. It's inefficient for me to do anything else, but also ruins the fun for anyone near me (so I usually roll with a 2s non explosive gat in those situations) 
---
This is an issue with the way grouping works for loot, but also specifically for explosive property weapons (ts or not) and it's clearly not balanced around a multiplayer environment which seems to have been slapped on an otherwise unmodified single player game. 
---
As an aside, the only tweaks I've seen to actual game design from 4 to 76 to make the game multiplayer (aside from the actual social/online overlay and the npcs) are power armor chassis carrying, events, and the scrapper perk not having additional ranks/functions when compared to Fallout 4. 
---
get junk shield perk

Now say it one more time. LOUDER. FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!
---
Patch team has done a good job? Why do I have 1.5 million stimpaks?
---
You're not the only one that turns his sub up to 11 and does this.  Hello fellow child brethren.
---
For the most part I agree with you. Folks with your mentality who are trying to "RP", saying this loosely nothing against you just think its alittle hard to RP in this game atm, I got no qualms with. I enjoy abit of PvP here and there.
---
That being said the PvP in this game is just terrible. The whole bounty system, the revenge button, all of it is a mess. It's pretty annoying killing someone just for them to respawn 5 feet away over and over and over...and over again. Personally I think if you die in any situation, PvP or otherwise, you should have to respawn at the Vault 76 and make your way back. And while they may be folks like you who are trying to bring alittle bit of role playing in to the game, which is great, I would say a majority of the people who are running around just destroying bases are doing just to destroy bases. Because there really isn't any incentive to PvP unless you want alittle "fun" or attacking bases at the moment besides just feeling like being a dick. 
---
And to wraps this up, most of y'all who are complaining about PvP or destroyed bases remind me of the folks who cried about the Darkzone in The Division. You knew what can happen when you went in, and yet you still cry about getting killled and your stuff looted. It's the same as in 76, you all knew PvP would be a thing and your complaining about it. It was shown in one of the first gameplay videos before that game came out. You can't use consent as an excuse because you gave consent when you loaded in. You can't even be killed unless you shoot back, slap damage barely does anything to you. It seems like folks are just mad that they are losing more than anything, because if you were winning there wouldn't be any crying. TSEs or not 
---
15 bucks sounds about right. Just know you’re getting a discount cuz this shit can be busted
---
Ohh youll be alright. 
---
Maybe it's not low everything is pretty cheap caps wise it's just I guess I'm used to seeing big money in my games . They are actually very valid reasons too tbh. Makes sense 
---
I think I'm just going to kill those bots first thing when I join a server. Now that I think about it I don't know why I haven't been doing this already.
---
I will be adding you. Could really use some serums. I have never had any and would love to learn how they work. 
---
Try the Whitespring bunker shop, I've found 2 there so far.
---
Also, just wearing 2 armor pieces with reduced fall damage by 50% makes you totally immune to fall damage. They stack.
---
Not sure if I agree or disagree, in the current system it is available to everyone if they server hop for it and there isnt a way to work harder for it other than to sit there opening and closing the game
---
He wants a system where it is available to people who earn it via gameplay
---
Gotta live that hoarder life .

Tldr; Fanboy whining about a shit game probably.

Well said .. because this sub is toxic af even if you right, even if you ask a simple question, even if you have an opinion right or wrong, even if you ask for help, there is no discrimination, at least there's that. I stopped caring about downvotes in this sub because they mean squat anyway .. if someone wants to steal my internet points they can have them :)
---
The Ninjato or The Shinobigatana, allegedly used by Ninja, doesnt really have much physical evidence to suggest these were used in the 16th-19th century.
---
But agreed, use the Chinese officer sword.
---
Ok there's a Lumber Mill North West of the map. It has low level Super Mutants. A level 15 Raider set spawns there, but higher level sets also spawn. Really easy to farm and the caps and scrap is nice too.
---
Cool thanks, I am going to look.
---
Same
---
Actually there is one benefit I think a lot of us are aiming for:  if the public fallout (pun intended) is bad enough maybe they won’t try this type of game at all again, and they’ll go back to making what We actually wanted from them.
---
Whether it’s a good game or not, myself, and I believe a lot others out there, are just super fucking salty that they spent time and money on this, instead of having a laser focus on a Fallout 5 single player RPG.
---
I'll start working on alpha for ya bud.

Best of luck :)

Wow that's a lot of good information, mate. Appreciate the response! I was just lucky I had the Somerset .44 to finish exploring the location. One level up really made a difference there.

The companies will only give you as little as they can, if you don't pressure them to deliver the product will get worse and worse and one day you'll be 40 and a game like Fallout 76 will come out, and you'll complain, and then some pubescent teen will go on Reddit and tell you not to complain about it and...  Wait, what was I talking about again?

Shut the fuck uuuupppp

Cheney? Is that you?

I haven't played much recently, but as of a couple years ago it was fine. It's a game you can play largely alone and have few problems. Higher level characters automatically scale down when in lowbie maps/zones so they don't entirely roflstomp through everything where you're trying to play and level. The main story is still intact and can still be followed despite the changes to the world. There are multiple expansions now that each have their own cost and things they add to the game world, as tends to happen with that sort of game. This can make getting into it and getting the "full" experience a bit pricey. However, as someone who started playing well before there were ANY expansions, I can say there's a fair bit of play and story to be gotten out of the base game before you'd need/want to buy the expansions. They tend to have sales around... August, maybe? In any case there's no monthly subscription, so if you wanted to check out the game, I'd recommend just picking up the base game (maybe bundled with the first expansion Heart of Thorns if the price is good) and see if it's to your tastes.
---
If story is your thing, there's a lot of built up lore. And a LOT of built up past content to go with it. The open world is generally set to match the current point in the global story, BUT you CAN get access to almost all the old story content to play through yourself, in order. It'll just cost you a bit to get it all. 
---
TL;DR - If money doesn't grow on trees for you, at this point the cost to get every scrap of the story and content can feel steep. The gameplay ITSELF however should hold up just fine for someone brand new. If you just want a new gameworld to play around in, pick up the base game for cheap and enjoy. Try not to think about buying the rest of the content until you know whether or not you like the base game.
---
And that is MORE than enough out of me about a game that has absolutely nothing to do with Fallout! XD Hope some of my thoughts and opinions on GW2 help you.
---
Well damn 
---
Hey man I made a post venting about something that is botheribg me. I'm not aaying they aren't addressing the issue I'm saying I wish they would communicate about the issue. If you disagree with me thats fine but there is no reason to act like an asshole about it
---
I see u have purchased the new German oven
---
" With that and rad-x you could go into a nuke zone gaining about the same rads as being in a PA "
---
Doesn't work. Takes tons of chems just to take it to 8/sec, usually gonna be 10-12 (which is too much). PA has hidden RR resist, just like it has hidden ER/DR resist making it tankier than Regular Armor even if all the resists are same values of PA.
---
When you can't even do a simple research or you are unnable to choose a half-decent game and buy based on hype, even being so poor you can't buy a launch day game, maybe you should just be smarter or stop buying games at all.

Please try not to take it personally when people criticize a game. 
---
nice

No mans sky still gets trashed to this day, even though its done a 180.

Bethesda fucked up here, but theyll fix it. They want to run it long term like ESO. Itll take time.

The real whore here is the constant CRASHING on seemingly nothing like opening your pipboy or forever loading on fast travel or even logging in for the first time that day.

That is ridiculous

---
$15 bucks is a bargain, yes definitely worth that if not more. Where is it for $15 ?
---
Clarification, they have not communicated about it
---
Fully expect this.  And as others have said, it should be for all factions.
---
Question though - Do you seperate Firebreathers and Responders?  Firebreathers being more anti scorched, responders being more camp based (tgunking plans).
---
I never build wooden boxes and usually go for interesting shapes using the barn or brick presents and have multiple rooms I also use everything I can to decorate 
---
Also I've had the identical experience just trying to clear the workshop to claim it. I've given up on at least two because I just couldn't find all of the enemies. One was the red rocket mega stop and I scoured that place up and down. Found at least two extra radroaches after clearing all the super mutants, so there was probably at least one more around somewhere.

Maybe give it to your alt character if you have a friend and can trust them to give it back to you, technically you can get $125000 across 5 characters I suppose. I will take them off your hands :)
---
&gt;Without players, FO76 is just another Fallout.
---
and what's the problem with that? it's precisely what a huge portion of the playerbase wanted in the first place.
---
&gt;Well, that can be said for any online game that is not exclusively PvP, right?
---
not at all. the key is whether playing solo is detrimental to the experience, because that indicates how the game was designed. try playing Overwatch solo. I guess you... can? but it's *definitely* detrimental to the experience.
---
that's not the case with Fallout 76. you most definitely do not need other players to fully enjoy the game. you can, however, engage other to arguably improve it- just like Dark Souls.
---
&gt;Going with that analogy, the trading that the primitive tribes did before any type of currency existed can't be called a market
---
except that has literally no bearing on the matter, we're not discussing semantics here. a market, as defined by the mmo genre, is items for cash. period.
---
&gt;Good thing this isn't an MMO, then.
---
hey, you said it.
---
Okay first. No man's sky was an indie game getting high praise for lies but didn't deliver until a year later when they realized the cash grab didnt work. F76 has been hyped for 2 years ecspecialy it being a co-op fallout game. So I would have been surprised if it didn't get any noise. Bethesda is a much bigger company than no man's sky's. I don't wanna say this but technically Bethesda delivered on what they promised unlike every other gaming company, but for a game in 2018 to not be a stable 30fps I only feel it hit 30 when looking at they sky (PS4 pro) it doesn't feel polished at all. I understand it's running on a 23 or so year old engine that has hit it's max, but that to me sounds like they don't want to spend money or resources to upgrade for a better experience which is shady af imo. And what changes have they made besides fixing things? The camp system getting that rework is a fix not an additon, they knew what would happen if two people had the same camp, and decided on the lazy option until people complained thinking maybe the problem would slip by. They are adding cosmetics like crazy, but they are overpriced af buddy this meme would go people's heads if there was nothing to talk about, but the game was released a engine too early, the canvas scandle (which is being handled) the plastic rum bottle, exploits with personal info, and let's not forget people on PC can see your IP if they try. (idk if this is terribly bad cause I'm console and it was in the news so I assume it could be) I played this game for the first 2 weeks straight, and from playing the game I didn't have any problems beside the quests not working(got fixed), god the amount of bugs they didn't patch the first month every time I entered a building the ghouls would be the posed then when I walked up to them they would snap into holding weapons and shooting me.i haven't touched the game since they added the new camp moving thing, and I like the addition, but it shouldn't have taken 2 months to fix... That's my problem they would rather bring out overpriced cosmetics than fix huge issues. It doesn't help when the creators ghost the community as well. On paper it is a buggy mess of a game, but if you like fallout like me you will look past the bugs and find a fun coop fallout to play with your friends, but like 90% of us we would have rathered a co-op fallout 5...
---
The lone dark is $14 right now. Better than fallout😂
---
Yeah exactly. Everytime I get to 1k caps I spend most on recipes and plans I haven't encountered randomly. Wouldn't have learned about the cap cap for months/years.
---
Server hoping needs to be addressed.  It should not be a thing, and need to be penalized in some way. Recent post bragging about server hopping are usually
---
* About to die because of poor planning
---
* Got wanted by accident and panicked, was upset they were still wanted after server hop
---
* Workshop occupied/ Workshop got contested and would rather run to another world than defend/retake it.
---
* Scorchcbeast
---
* Has a pvp interaction and is about to lose.
---
It's like people would rather do the server hop simulator than play the game for what it is, a social sandbox.  I understand the fallout community is full of antisocial players that are used to being "quick-save gods" that never die but c'mon, it's a game that death has no real penalty. 
---
I've played all of those. They're good games, but more content? That seems like a stretch.

On PC but you have my upvote. Lie, cheat, and steal. Only way to live.

I agree 100% and feel that the popularity of hating "mass conceived" bad games is leading to the downfall of honestly good games, or at least mediocre ones because no one is willing to give it a shot.

This is fantastic. Love the videos lol

Yeah. I'd only use it to nuke a griefers base. Something I almost never run into. 20 lbs in the stash or 2 perk points (i have 2 star bear arms). Didn't feel like using that space.

Sell it? To who? A griefer?

Nope. Into the void it goes.

Lots of violet near the Prime Fissure, the mutated fern. 
---
Cobalt at Whitesprings from the tree sap (gloam sap) and silt beans in the area near the train station exit and near the bunker. 
---
Anyone know if radshield does the same?

Yes, I know about that one its the first one I listed. Thanks all the same.

Dude, some people enjoying crawling through steaming piles of shit. And that’s ok. 
---
Others don’t and that’s ok too. 
---
If you enjoy crawling through the steaming pile of shit that is Fallout 76 in its current state, more power to you. 
---
These kind of posts won’t convince anyone to join you though! 
---
I think the hate is larger than other series due to the fact that Fallout is a kinda a classic. Ever since 4, people have wanted a return to form, like NV, but felt betrayed when they came out with 76.
---
People hate on the game, because people like you make these damn long ass posts which makes me grab my popcorn.(and many others apparently)
---
Building areas do not change in size. The green circle is fixed no matter what your level is. 
---
You on?
---
It’s not a meme anymore, it’s become something where people just fall back and say fallout 76 is terrible. 
---
To not a meme, it’s just people needlessly hating on fallout 76 more than need be
---
Thank you for the post I think I’ll give the base game a try then. 
---
&gt; What do you think they did when they nerfed Power Core production? That was a PA balancing change....
---
Exactly how did this affect the balance of PA? All the damage resistance numbers are/were the same as before, no tweaks whatsoever to any of the mechanics of the PA system, and even now Power Cores are still in high abundance outside of the actual dedicated CAMP FC resource generator. 
---
All this did was make it even more pointless to use CAMP resources on FC production–with no effect on PA balance whatsoever/

Hubby (HALESMASHMAN) was trying to give me power armor. His full set of X01 with Camo paint job was "placed" (not dropped) in my camp. He went to "drop" another chassis for me with excavator PA on it, and an X01 head. When he dropped the chassis for me, both disappeared completely. Not in our stashes or inventory. Just gone. It took so many resources to build 😭
---
I'm just sad I haven't found clothing that would go under my armour... 
---
Yes
---
A lot of the times they drop crap tho. RNG and all.
---
Wife has secret reddit account OP.  Watch out!

I use the excavator power armor which modes should I be looking for

Long time lurker first time poster and I feel the need to vent.
---
Just fought my way through the Alpha Silo -solo-, the launch bots did their thing, I was trembling with anticipation at launching my first nuke - OMG, OMG.
---
Check NukeCrypt, code is \[47572867\], great I'm good to go (with only one keycard!!!). Input code...error.
---
Needless to say I'm massively deflated.
---
TBH, getting the keycards seems to be harder than the actual silo.
---
Await new codes with baited breath, and the launch of my first nuke.
---
Oneshotting is bad game design and believe or not since evidently you’re cool with that, most people aren’t. Expand this out to teams vs teams and one shots are just boring. Plus with explosive shotguns you don’t even really need to aim. Just carpet bomb an area and watch the caps roll in.
---
It isn’t gonna stay this way, one way or another.
---
Same thing happened to dow3 and it killed the game. What's worse it didn't even have bugs and played fine on launch. Community hate trains are the worst.
---
GT?
---
Warframe 
---
Eh, I think it deserves the hate it gets and Bethesda apologists are taking too much offense to it.
---
Careful,  you're drawing in all the r/fallout haters. 
---
That said,  I personally just don't give a damn what youtubers say. I've enjoyed the game immensely, flaws and all. My friends are enjoying it. It can be annoying talking to coworkers about games and they act like enjoying the game is the worst thing ever, but then they tell me they're currently just playing the latest CoD and I stop caring.
---
I see bad shit posted about the game, I shrug my shoulders and keep playing because I know that its not the worst game ever made and I enjoy it. It's not really going anywhere anytime soon,  either, and it's being slowly improved and I'm patient. So I'm not worried about what others think. 
---
Also, if they didn't cost like 15% of your budget. I want my fancy home with turrets, but can't afford both. 
---
There is only 1 mod for the gauss that has a straight damage increase and that is the prime capacitors. Prime capacitors make it your rifle only takes Ultracite 2mm cartridges which requires stable flux to craft. It now gains the damage bonus of a normal hardened reciever plus the extra damage to scorched for being prime. 
---
Other than that there is piercing capacitors (I think that's what its called) that offers decent armor penetration but nothing states just how much. 
---
It definitely works with Stimpaks, I've been using it for ages. 
---
That's awesome .. in all fairness he killed you twice, first time fine, you were wanted, no reason to kill him again.
---
Did you hit him with a mini nuke ? i think when I see these idiots outside the golf club I am going to clip them. Was there and then all of a sudden 20 turrets starting hitting the club and I was like WTF ..
---
We are talking about communicating with the fans about the issue when we say that, not any form of acknowledgement, sure it's probably not the correct word to be using it but it's pretty blatantly obvious in the context of the post and comment what we mean
---

What system are you on, I have a spare on Xbox I think
---
The furher approves
---
Sent you a message
---
Yeah. We need more of those
---
Thanks! It really does. So you think using a combat rifle or handmade would be better for mobs? Makes sense I guess I’m just attached to shotguns but that would make my build far more efficient. 
---
Is that Red Rocket thing a plan ?
---
It's funny, because I was actually thinking about RDO yesterday while I was playing this and in my opinion this a lot more fun. There is practically nothing to do in RDO besides hunt, fish, and do pvp games once you get through the small number of quests,  the economy is ridiculous and obviously geared toward micro transactions, and you're under constant threat of being ganked by some prick and losing valuable items. With this game however, my quest journal is overflowing, I got plenty of cash, and I dont have to fear other players. 
---
Man I wish enter the gungeon was online. None of my friends will play it.
---
How near to Lewisburg? Got a direction or landmark? North, south, etc?
---
Yeah we need more of those
---
Do you treat loss of arms?
---
Nope it’s Bethesda fault. You do a shit job you will be told. 
---
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to what I’d like to call... **The Mass Effect Andromeda Effect**.

Yes. I agree. But they give 4 or 5 plans instead of 1.
---
Quick additional tip if grinding the Charleston spawn:
---
When running to the bridge before looking back towards the shack to see what spawns, if its not the vendor, turn back around and kill the spawned Grafton Monster. 20 caps or so, then log out. Only takes a couple seconds and if you are grinding the vendor spawn, might aswell get some caps out of it each time
---
Agreed but I do like the fact that you can play Co-Op as long as you have a spare remote of sorts
---
Main building, front entrance, first floor. Almost all of them spawn near the main desk by the mister gutsy, and by the lockers on the right side as you walk into the building.

The fallout 76 backlash to the hate train is actually way worse than the hate train EVER was. You mother fuckers need to stop taking shit so personally. I bought NMS early, did you see me wasting my free time defending it? No. Everyone had a right to be mad.

which is why I said: make pvp-specific areas and disable legendaries. problem solved.

Bethesda is obviously gearing up to fix this game. No man's sky was still selling for full price a year after the broke game was released. Bethesda let their game go on sale at massive discounts. They dropped huge patch notes the past two months. By the end of this month, another large patch will be implemented.
---
Bethesda is handling this, so far, like a AAA studio and we will see the results. This game was released in an extremely poor condition. The fact we have come this far so quickly gives me hope.
---
When you login check the recent tab and social it'll show you who's on your server. The servers are usually full AKA like 24 people you just can't see them looking on the map
---
Looks like you're desperate to project your opinions on what someone else must be.
---
I guarantee you hes not
---
I went to the location and only found a red jacket, is percent of spawn of the vt jacket over there or what?🤔
---
Trigger warning lol
---
Oxhorn is a good channel. He seems to get through the game alright and his only major issue is disconnecting.
---
No. Keycards are indefinite. Only codes get wiped each week. 
---
Yes. I now have 3 that I have had for 3 weeks so far. I still haven’t had a chance to launch my own nuke. 
---
people would just switch to regular explosives like you said. or the next op build. this game has more issues than just "nerf explosives pls"
---
one of them is being always online and lacking private servers. why should they nerf my favorite class of weapons? because it's unfair to people in Whitesprings?
---
why should I, a solo player, care?
---
When they are alone or in pack of 2 or 3, I can take them with my heavy slegde setup for armor piercing, the fastest way. Just have to deal with the damage as it comes.
---
Built my own rad scrubber and put my camp in some toxic water. Streamlined the whole process. It's all completely random though. Took me most of a day unlearning and relearning. 
---
So it turns out my brother got them from a friend who got them from a friend. They have all 10 masks. Kinda worried I'm going to get banned for having them, but they are pretty fucking cool lol
---
Yeah, I just started getting the Ghoulish perk cards.  I'll have to look at sun kissed at some point.
---
They do indeed persist.
---
I think if you already have every possible rank of a perk, it doesn’t list the perk.  This is most easily seen with perks like Lockpick (if you have Lockpick, it now longer shows Lockpick), and I think I saw it with Science: I got Science 2 early on, got another Science in a perk pack, and later saw in passing that Science was no longer listed as an option to level up.
---
god, I scream a lot when I see something randomly coming up behind me. I want to see her reactions haha

Right on thank you for the response! Do you know off hand which stable flux is required for the 2mm ultracite ammo? I am trying to gauge if prime would be easy enough to farm

Yeah lol think I was 11 playing hitman

Where was the picture taken?

Pretty sure they go for 10 caps each as well at any vendor

That's awesome, i really like that .. very cool how you made it the centre piece ..

Not really, not in the same sense that 76 does. But story =/= roleplaying.   I would say the ability to make decisions that affect who you are, what you do, the world around you, and the overall narrative, whether implied or explicit. Boundless has that in spades, though it trades story for a the ability to come together and create a player driven society and economy. Oh, Eco is like that too. Even more in depth world building and player control, though it's much more grounded rather than fantasy based. Do you even make decisions in FO76? I haven't yet. I just follow recordings and do whatever people tell me to do and so far all my discussions have been completely one sided. It's a pretty linear experience built in an open world.
---
I'm not saying 76 is worse or better than those games, plus it's hard to even call that a fair comparison given the massive budget and man power behind 76.  But in terms of roleplaying? Get out of here.
---
Sometimes people take it too far
---
 
---
I mean yeah the game was in a really bad state but well whatever.... the damage is already done, there is no point in keep shitting on it unless you find some joy in the act.
---
Let's see if i wanted to be mean and white knight of the consumer rights in video games and all that shit i would be doing videos shitting on rockstar for straight lying on me with the hdr, it's fake and non existent in rdr2 and they lowkey lied about it. But i don't enjoy that or watching people that does that also the game is pretty popular so i would be just waiting for a mob of fans to shit on me if i did that lol
---
Same, buddy and I are in the silo now waiting and tried to enter "old" code. :(
---
Admittedly they are mostly useless. Nearly no amount of defense is going to stop someone from taking the workshop if they want it.
---
Best use is for fast travel and the plan rewards, like the OP says. I'll build extractors sometimes and leave, and if someone hasn't taken it by the time I'm back it's just a nice bonus.
---
I totally thought it was bad cgi at first.
---
Can anyone do charlie? just did the whole mission to realize it just reseted
---
Here's proof that people aren't even playing the game. 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/gg1WGD5
---
That still doesn't stop you from server hopping. See the solution?
---
I gotta agree that the youtube videos are getting out of hand. 
---
What you need to understand is that they're just doing it for a quick click. They don't add anything to the discussion, obviously, but they do rack in all those sweet sweet views.
---
I think a lot of the hate is coming from a place of disappointment. This studio has set such a high precedent that it's nearly impossible for them to reach player expectations. Problem is, with 76, they didn't even come close. Bugginess, controversies, and the fact that the game just isn't that fun have lead to Bethesda's biggest flop ever, and has sparked serious disappointment and backlash.
---
People aren't mad because FO76 is bad. They're mad because it was made by a Bethesda that they don't want, and not by the Bethesda they knew.
---
That was sort of my goal. Open people's eyes to more play styles than just power armor and melee. 
---
Thank you! It got me stuck on the waving emote and I couldn't move or emote again lol
---
Introduce pvp zones and faction based TDM modes, I believe they're doing something for faction pvp already 
---
Love the robots and animals idea. But let’s face the fact that our characters don’t even behave properly at this point in the game😂
---
I'm gonna be a huge fucking minority here. But, I enjoy 76. Yeah it has its issues, yeah they have sucked on the PR, yes they rushed it out in super show of what an unfinished game looks like.
---
But.. despite all its drawbacks its kept me entertained. Altho, I am a HUGE fallout fan. Like I own fallout merch IRL. But playing 76 with friends, having a team of 3 or 4 people running thru doing shit together is a great time. I know I'm gonna have the shit down voted for this.
---
I know I'm the quiet minority when it comes to FO76. Bethesda fucked up, they fucked up hard, they fucked up really, really hard. But they are trying to fix the mess they created. 
---
what plans do you have?
---
Sounds like they equal The Institute for levels of baffling idiocy. 
---
Not subjective - every other multiplayer game that had one shotting problems managed them out. 
---
That’s right says me, and my experience with many games with OP things which btw few come close to how nuts this effect is. I’m extremely confident they’re gonna address it. And guess what? It’s badly balanced enough that it will disrupt enough people’s experience with the game and eventually they’ll tire of it and quit. So like I’ve said, one way or another, it’s gonna get addressed. 
---
So far all you do is try and attack me without presenting good reasons to keep explosive the way it is. So, I assume there *are* no good reasons. Thus proving my point.
---
That is not the only possible point of a game. 
---
And one more question, sorry but you seem to know your stuff here, does the "+damage to scorched" include scorchbeasts and other creature types that have become scorched?
---
Alpha I1
---
Oh, good thinking! I think you 100% right. That means I can never get that 2 star animated Ammo Smith T_T Thanks for the response!
---
Doesn't stop even at level 50. 
---
I see that as a downside in a way too.  Generally I don't have any 'new creations' at workshops, its all previously developed plop down blueprints, typically on one block foundations to make placement easier.  Plus given the frequency at which you get dropped, you could end up with "just about finished" and then boom discon.
---
3 points of bloody mess is better than 3 points in rifleman/commando due to ot being multiplicative vs additive. Easy to compare just by looking at weapon damage. Obviously you'd want to shave the points off the 5% 2nd/3rd rank of those cards not the 10% first ranks.
---
I want to buy a book of this 
---
&gt; Was the canvas bag thing shitty? Yes. Also, literally every "special edition" item I've ever seen or bought has been cheap plastic garbage, do I wasn't shocked.
---
If you're being sold an item that's being specifically advertised as [not cheap plastic garbage] and get [cheap plastic garbage] instead being just "not surprised" *is* the unreasonable reaction
---
Level 114, still zero two-shot or explosive for me
---
We might be talking about a different object. The object that appears in the overseer's childhood bedroom in Sutton (at least for me) is the maroon-red "Letterman's Jacket and Jeans", which I also found in the high school.
---
If there's another object you're talking about, I don't recall running across it, but if you have an image you could link me of what it looks like, that might jog my memory! 😁
---
Same pvp system that is in eso that u can invite others to duel 
---
I know you did not just recommend Rust to someone on the internet. Why would you do that to someone? They’re gonna lose hundreds of hours of their life and only come out of it with some bows and arrows
---
I think it does deserve some hate, they should t of put out what they did and it has a lot of bugs, but its the fact that there’s so much hate, I would agree yes, t deserves hate, but this is too much, like people shit on it every chance they get and say anyone who enjoys it a Bethesda fanboy who’s an idiot.
---
So yeah it deserves hate but it’s WAY over the line
---
I didn't know that until today. Will be moving tonight on my rifles char - sorry fellow ps4 dwellers!
---
My location isn't the problem. I'm in the perfect spot for me. My problem is that this perfect spot is marred by the fact that the closest source of water is still 20ft outside my radius. 
---
I've gone over the map of resource deposits and checked every junk node, and the one next to Pleasant Valley Station is the closest one to a vendor, a main quest location, Grahm walks right through my camp, and Whitesprings isn't too far away, either. Once player vending is implemented, I have the perfect shop location. 
---
I only ever have demo expert on. And always repair my gear with weapon artisan. Some of the int perks would be nice but I can't justify more points for such low utility. The only thing I really want is stabilized if I was a PA heavy Gunner. 
---
I honestly can't remember the last time a weapon broke on me. 
---
That still doesn't stop you from server hopping.
---
You’re getting downvoted because you’re basically shouting to the world to shut the fuck up for having a different, but valid opinion. Or people making fun of something. Look at the game’s ratings. On any site, by any user consensus. Look at product reviews. If you really think the game is objectively better and that all those people are wrong, you’re straight up delusional. Your post just screams insecurity and needing confirmation that the game isn’t really that bad. If some memes and jokes hurt you on this level then I’m sorry son, you’re not a particularly stable human being.
---
If you enjoy the game, why do you care? Furthermore, why are you looking for these videos and posts? I’m on YouTube, I play 76 (granted a lot less than the first three weeks) and I don’t even see any opinion piece vods. I see more or what I am watching or am interested in. 
---
76 as it is currently isn’t even in a state worth releasing for €60-80, and it won’t be for the next few months. Possibly/probably not ever, because outside of QoL changes, nothing major about the game had evolved, no major issues have been addressed. Hackers are rampant, using easy to detect duping. (Literally all Bethesda has to do is do a database query to find who has 3-4 or more of the exact same type of weapon with the exact same stats and they could ban 90% of abusers there and then) servers still crashing like a bitch. Console versions more unplayable than ever before since a recent patch.
---
Yeah, things are going great. But hey, let’s focus on shutting up those who give criticism and feed an insecure little boy 2 gold.
---
I'm not sold on PVP until they do something about TSE weapons...... it's not even a fight at this point 
---
the game isn’t relevant anymore so neither is your post...
---
that is actually what happens. It just halts the event wave indefinitely and no other events start.
---
Even once we get the codes it will be a while before it's decrypted.

Thank you!!! You made my game! And day!

Thank you! Its not perfect and like I said a bit small, but its still nice AND resourceful

I agree, FO76 is getting more hate than it deserves. While I don't play it nearly as much as i did a couple weeks ago, I still find it fun. But... That hate isn't coming from this community. /r/fo76 seems pretty optimistic about fallout. So the question is, why are you posting here telling us to fucking shut up, when this is the most supportive community of the game? You're breaching to the choir there

---
I know, I would love to have a deathclaw wreck some shit haha 
---
Especially at the Munitions Factory. If I'm at the workshop, and I get a notification for the "Defend against the Scorchbeast attack" mission, I just immediately fast travel away before the Scorchbeast(s) can fly in the vicinity of the factory. At that point, I'll get one of two results: Either the defence mission just completely cancels and goes away and I don't lose the workshop, it's like nothing ever happened. Or I lose the workshop, then all I have to do is go back to a deserted workshop and simply claim it again and still get rewarded.  The sheer amount of ammo and time needed to take down a Scorchbeast (especially by yourself) makes it not worth it at all. Honestly easier and faster just to leave/lose the mission; which honestly is some ass-backwards game design haha.  
---
Also at Grafton Steel, I'll often get a glitch where enemies spawn in one of the middle buildings, underneath the floor so they're completely inaccessible. You can't shoot them and they can't get out, forcing you to fail the mission. 
---
Not all but a TSE shot gun sure 
---
They should just nerf the damage output on explosives for pvp 
---
&gt;So, I assume there are no good reasons.
---
a great one is that this is a singleplayer experience first, multiplayer second. a huge chunk of the multiplayers are right here in this sub, so it's kind of an echo chamber. but the solo player definitely does not care and even wants it to be broken.
---
or do you think they should balance explosives in Fallout 4 as well? like it or not, multiplayers are an afterthought. the playerbase is majorly solo.
---
I still don't have the Class Freak card... 
---
The funnest! 
---
In a datamined list of mods, theres one called the capacitor boosting coil, and the name description for the effect says "extralarge and more damage".
---
I havent seen anyone mention its existence in game tho, so maybe its a remnant from fo4 and didnt make it into 76 for some reason?
---
No man sky didn't have a community low key shitting on the game for years even a kid knows all the memes and bad publicity of bethesda and their with just browse some subreddits for a week without even played once any game
---
Can I have a Jetpack too? :)
---
People shouldn't need to 'bump up' their internet connections. Ignoring the fact that WoW came out over a decade ago and internet connections have gotten far better. How many players are on a fallout 76 server? 34 at max, compare that to WoW where hundreds of players are connected at the same time and you can see how ludicrous your example was. 
---
Just because Bethesda games have had problems in the past is no excuse. They have more than enough time and resources to create a game that doesn't require a day 1 patch bigger than the game itself on consoles. But instead they continue to shovel the same broken engine into situations it can barely cope with and expecting people to just shrug it off, which evidently they are.
---
You can like the game, i couldn't care less, but you need to acknowledge its flaws otherwise you just sound crazy. Some of my favourite things are objectively terrible but I love them in spite of it (Starship Troopers).  Stop defending Bethesda's lazy, outdated and incompetent practices. They'll never improve otherwise. 
---
Exactly what I found out. I like lone wanderer so I dropped action boy/girl. Action boy is slightly better for regent than lone wanderer, but obviously loses the damage reduction. Also technically it is slightly better with both perks, but completely negligible.
---
I've had better luck personally with defense working against enemies. If you aren't there, it's pretty much useless if another player wants the workshop.
---
I’m on Charlie as well waiting 
---
While most people are trying to have their voices heard, I find there are way to many people who seem like their only mission is to make the game fail.  Those people are starting to get real annoying.

I don't even believe the people saying they never crash. Like they have some special hardware the rest of us don't have. It's so disingenuous for people to say that. To be perfectly clear: those of you who say you never crash are a goddam liar. OR you play 20 minutes at a time and never leave the area your in.
---
Bethseda ABSOLUTELY deserves any and all criticism they get. Or, like OP said nothing will ever change if people are willing to just bend over and get raped by these companies.
---
I've put in more then enough time in this game 337 hours, to know this game was put out to early yet still sold to a lot of us at the full price of a finished game.
---
I will NEVER buy another Bethseda game at launch again. 
---
They should give Energy Weapons and Explosive Weapons like the Missile Launcher and Fatman the highest Armor Penetration.
---
At the same time they should nerf Armor Penetration for standard Ballistic Weapons.
---
The most advanced weapons just need to have more Armor Penetration, lasers should bring death to wasteland, not shame!
---
but my canvas bag 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if you had some sort of action taken against your account.  You're in a possession of an item that isn't available yet.  
---
Most of the complaints are fair. 76 is a buggy mess filled with various issues that includes the Tesla rifle causing the game to crash, legendaries not showing, pvp being a joke, duplication glitches that’ll cause the server to crash etc. but despite all of that it’s fallout 4 online. 76 can be fun but Bethesda should’ve overhauled the game engine or replaced it. The engine already had tons of issues in 4. 
---
But I will say people over exaggerated the issues this game have though. And that Bethesda are trying. 
---
[realpuresavagery](https://www.twitch.tv/realpuresavagery) who developed nukacrypt is streaming and solving the codes. He’ll have them way before anyone else.
---
just start pumping shot gun rounds into the ground.  you'll get the lil bastage
---
I don't have a issue with being upset for voicing their opinions. I have issues with people who try to drag people who do enjoy the game through the grinder. There is a difference.
---
What LVL are you?
---
Oh man! If this is in game it is definitely what I want! I guess I just need to start farming mods lol
---
Found him too!
---
Literally everything is better with friends and a bit buggy is like saying the Earth is a bit smaller than the Sun.
---
You're not alone. A lot of us were deceived and misled by the hype train.
---
Hopefully they fix the game soon. The world really needs a quality fallout online experience. 
---
Me personally, I gave up after 3 weeks of zero progress on the water purifier bug. 
---
102 :)
---
Awesome.  Thanks for the info.
---
Nice, i will :)
---
You can.  But you'll lose a good chunk of DR if you're not equipped correctly.
---
There's no problem with that. The ones having the problem are those not knowing what they bought. Like I said, this is an online game. You can get over it, or you can complain about it - but that won't change. 
---
You, and the rest of the players that wanted something else can patiently wait another 10 to 12 years until the next Fallout comes out.
---
There's only one small problem with your analogy... Overwatch is exclusively PvP. Seriously, this concept isn't so hard to get, I don't know why you are struggling so much.
---
It wasn't me who brought up the whole "real market vs in-game transactions". But I see you don't like getting beaten at your own game.
---
If we both agree that this isn't an MMO, why are you trying to apply MMO-like economies to it to begin with? You are starting to lose your own arguments at this point.
---
I see people snipe from afar and let the PA guys clean them up. 
---
What like Elmer Fudd.
---
Be vewy vewy qwiet. We’re hunting mole wats! Ehehehehehehe!
---
Whitesprings gets nuked alot.. Sometimes when the nuke is gone they will still spawn the glowing ghouls, awesome for xp. 
---
There really is not enough gratitude in the gaming world.  People have such negative opinions - please, be more positive.  This world needs positivity.  
---
When the urge to say something negative arises in the mind, there is a choice.  You can either express that a lot.  You can express it a little.  Or you can try to steer that negative thinking into a more positive expression.  A la, the top comment in this thread.  
---
It feels better to be positive, to appreciate, to enjoy what we have instead of complaining that a company isn't going out of their way to live up to your fantasy.  That's just silly consumer entitlement.
---
I was really liking this picture till I seen that beautiful character you’ve made. Even though it slightly disturbs me I love it.
---
God damn what I'd pay if they put game updates and patches in the atom shop...
---
It's fun just listening to you and your friend giggling to be honest. I'm the same when stupid stuff happens.
---
Depending on your positioning you can take them one at a time. If you use a fast weapon like a fist weapon, and if it has a legendary effect like berserker that has increased damage the lower your damage resistance, then you can knock them down one after another as they come at you. But then that isn't good etiquette if others are around, and maybe a tank would like to take the agro while you just shoot at them from a little further away. Some people could solo it in a hazmat suit.
---
Green ghouls are bloated and they only spawn in nuked areas 
---
If you go to one of the silos and launch a nuke . 
---
And you can launch a nuke anywhere . 
---
But the place that’s best to farm “XP”
---
Is whitesprings . 
---
Sharon spilled coffee on my new shirt while we were in the lounge a while back. I told her it was fine and we had a good laugh about the whole thing. If she does it again I'll stab her in the fucking throat with my pen. She's a good kid.
---
I couldn’t control myself lol, happy cake day!
---
yeah that method wouldn't work for animals either.  They must spawn from "random encounters" and spawn "alone" so if two animals spawned together in these "random encounters" then it wouldn't work either.  It's very fickle lol  - I got a pet earlier this weekend though after a billion hours server hopping at this "random encounter" location - I put it in quotes because the locations are set, not so random, but they have a chance of spawning random odd events, like robots telling stories, or an old-school tank, or a deathclaw having eaten a merchant, etc etc etc 
---
None of us have encountered game-breaking bugs. Maybe a disconnect a week each?
---
&gt; real roleplayers
---
They do seem to disintegrate when i blow up a nearby car, or randomly vanish into the ground.
---
Sit down bitch. It's called freedom of speech and your game fuckin' sucks.
---
Quit trying to rationalize enjoying a garbage tier game and get back to taking Bethesda's un-lubricated dick.
---
Alpha M-8, Q-6, T-0, S-1, I-1, J-2, W-0 (one more to go)
---
Thanks. Haha. I've just noticed it myself.
---
I think there is a super important distinction here. No Man's Sky was made with a small budget by an indie team. Every aspect of the game oozed ambition and overstepping their ability. No Man's Sky always felt like a case of devs reaching for the stars and falling woefully short. Fallout 76 was made by a triple A developer with a massive budget and it felt like they didn't even try. I couldn't tell you where the money went in the game. The game runs on the same version of the engine Fallout 4 used with some tweaks. It had absurd stability issues and awful frame pacing which haven't improved much since launch. The game has no NPC's therefore none of the story feels connected to anything. It feels like you should be playing a game as all this stuff happened, not at the point when it did. The balancing is all over the place. The economy is busted and there is little point to taking workshops due to poor production. The Beta came too late for any data gathered to be factored into the final release. It all reeks of people making a game just to pump one out.  
---
I get seeing the sentiment being echoed is exhausting. However, throwing in that you don't seem to know WHY it's bad is disingenuous. The myriad problems have been stated multiple times over. General consensus and perception of the game is bad. I wish the game was on Steam so Steam Spy cold show you the drop off of players. This game can be expected to go the way of Sea of Thieves, just more reviled.
---
I know that this comment is going to get down voted but bethesda have released a game that is not of their standerd. They have done many things to scam consumers out of their money and have also screwed over many people who trusted the game by making it $30 one week later. I hate how this sub has turned into nothing but denial of  how  bad fallout 76 is , it could have been alot better but bethesda was too lazy and greedy so they need to be held accountable for their actions. 
---
Take my upvote. This is devilish and awesome. Love it. I watched every video. So fun. 
---
It’s only like that because people care so much about the franchise. 76 was undeniably a disappointment to Bethesda and its fans. 
---
What platform do you play on?
---
You on PS4?
---
You can get an animated card after getting a full set. 
---
I will buy a lottery ticket every day this week.  I'll either win or I won't, so that's a 50/50 chance of never having to work again every day! Amazing.  
---
That answers the question. Thanks! There was no nuke or nuke zone, but the ghouls were spawning wave after wave.
---
guess I need to look for a nuke. Just found a full set of T45, so maybe I can survive the radiation with some meds and mods.
---
Col Putzy
---
I’m launching one in 30 minutes x949Mafiax feel free to join me
---
The prime specifically says it adds damage to scorchbeasts and the scorched queen. I'm not 100% positive if it affects all scorched 
---
Quick tip: dont own workshops or do SB queen events solo cause its eventually going to crash. Save yourself for the hassle.
---
Codes are out
---
The issues with ME:A came from the game's development. There's a bunch of great videos talking about why the game has so many issues on YouTube. 
---
His base? Yes. And a few orbital strick beacons. His base was pretty south on the southern edge of white springs. No way to interfere with farming at the main parts. Those bases right outside the main building I destroy the turrets. They are not there getting Exp, just stealing it. I have no problem if it's there for resources.
---
The truth is, and I’m going to get downvoted for this, is that the game should have been much better. It’s a triple A game that’s been around for like two decades. These problems released at launch on other games in the series years and years ago and they released on launch! On a game that came out 10 years after the 3rd entry! These bugs have been patched, fixed and modded out by fans for free multiple times already! 
---
If you’re ok with setting the bar extremely low and are ok with lazy, money grabbing development that’s your prerogative. Most people see it for what it is; a beloved triple A game with more than an average amount of bugs and glitches. The hate is more than justified. 
---
I do, but only with a stealth build. I died CONSTANTLY before I got the perks I needed for the build, so I don't know how you could manage without extremely good stealth or power armor.
---
I really wish they'd allow RadX type items to be more effective in nuke zones. That'd solve my problem.
---
Did you say the Wendigo... ate your lunch?
---
Thanks 😊
---
Please lmk what last one is 
---
+60% on rank3. Not good against everything but godlike against high lvl animals, molemen and nukezone ghouls/glowing ones.
---
Yeah, probably glitched then.. I seen a couple waves though when a Nuke was gone. Power armor and pop some rad x or find a hazmat suit. Good luck bud! 
---
Your choices, currently, boil down to, do you follow the trail of bread crumbs or not, and, do you nuke the threat to the world, or some place else.  But, from the 'glitch in' folks that explored vault 94 some, apparently one of the major things for that 'dlc' when it goes live will involve group consensus voting on things, so that will likely change pretty soon
---
Melee doesn't one shot entire clusters of monsters.
---
I went to look up a more recent review of the game after the dev updates and stuff and i couldn’t find one damn thing because everyone bashed the game when i asked :( 
---
So if anyone can tell me, as of today, how’s the game? 
---
Codes are in.

$15 that's hysterical, my how the mighty have fallen. At this rate might as well hold out until it's free 😂😂😂
---
I agree. 
---
Looking forward to what updates Bethesda come up with in the coming months. I'm hoping they will bust a ball because of all the bad press and go to town with amazing updates and new content. 
---
I feel like once they fill all the gaps it'll be a classic and people will eat their words 
---
It’s multiplayer first. Always was, right from the first reveal. Bethesda clearly views it that way and that’s what matters in the end. I don’t know where you got your idea that most players are solo players, but regardless if you have a source for such a claim or not, it doesn’t matter. 
---
Why? Because you are a solo player and all your arguments are based upon your opinions of what would be good for you. If you can come up with an argument that is separated from that which supports keeping the massive power of explosive weapons intact, go for it, but so far you just keep recycling “I like it.”
---
Hope it helped gave him a few chems food and purified water. To be honest I just needed the room so I thought why not share the love at the same time

Is pvp fairly common for most people? No one ever seems to try to pvp me, which is fine with me, since I'm not into pvp. But I wasn't aware griefing was a major issue.
---
This level of super creative PVP (essentially) is what I'm totally down for. Seriously nice job.
---
I know other folks have mentioned "griefing" in here, but this isn't grieving, to me. This is following the boundaries and rules the game sets up. The players don't have to go into your CAMP. You're not sniping them or one-shotting them or stealing their stuff or destroying their CAMP repeatedly or following them around the map.
---
Hmm...I always do a good run and then an evil run of every Fallout game. Where this run I'm being friendly and building cozy cabins, free for all to use with paintings of kittens...might have to see what I can come up with for my evil character. 
---
Thanks so much for sharing!
---
Addressed this in your other post
---
&gt; Being angry about a game's state is one thing. But when the devs are actively making changes, are listening to our feedback, and are giving updates (yes, after we made noise, I admit)
---
Really the discussion ends there. Being loud and angry gets results no matter how much you disagree. Never be complacent and never expect others to be either. 
---
A bit of advice if you'll hear me out; try not to criticism of a game personally. I know it sucks for your favourite game to get shit on, but in the end, it's towards its benefit. 
---
Your video got tagged hmmmm...
---
All I care about is ES VI not getting fucked up 
---
It is a variant of "took my lunch money and made me cry". It was fast, stunned me, and hit for way more than I could take/heal. 
---
Yeah that's good! But after killing it don't forget to go north. 
---
What a waste of time reading your petty bs. Get a life 
---
Bruh, I swear if I find out someone is duping in the common area.
---
25 years of learning to hate every last one of you mother fuckers. 
---
I know, it was just positioned perfectly so I had a lot of room to work with vertically.
---
I can craft lvl 50 heavy combat armor without armorer, armorer is only *needed* for few mods for non pa armor.
---
I've seen it myself a few times and I never noticed a head. Now that I'm higher level I will try to get closer to him next time and get some good screenshots. 
---
I just recall there being a dent between its shoulders where the neck and head would be.
---
Good point
---
I’ll pay 1500 atoms if it makes dupers use only protest signs and nothing else 
---
Can do a lot of things but I'm not sure what the big deal about avoiding radiation is lol.  Just pop the perk to remove it on and continue mission xD
---
Sharing the wealth!
---
really depends. if I'm hard up for a particular mineral I'll build a CAMP where I can extract that. Otherwise tend to pick junk sites mostly for screws.
---
I do. I have marsupial which is nice to have at whitesprings. I just shoot from the rooftops and only drop down to collect loot or revive someone
---
The big issue with all the hate is 99% of it are things that are just not true, being said by people who haven't played the game and are either just butthurt that it's not a singleplayer game or just jumping on the bandwagon. 
---
There are definitely issues that need to be addressed but as long as the lies are getting all the attention they wont be. It also gives Bethesda an excuse to not listen to any criticism since it's probably coming from someone hating to hate.
---
Actual issues need more attention and haters need to be ignored and downvoted into oblivion.
---
It’s like people are sacrificing decency and common sense for feeling good about being in the hive mind.
---
I concur. I have two high lvl freinds playing on original Xbox Ones. While they do run into plenty of other glitch issues, I haven't heard or see them talk about anything like this. 
---
Uninstall, clear out the Xbox cashe, and re-install the game. [https://www.techjunkie.com/clear-cache-xbox-one/](https://www.techjunkie.com/clear-cache-xbox-one/)
---
So true! I just picked up RDR2 and it has like an hour of banter before each mission. I’m getting pizzas made during cut scenes. To be fair I just started and I’m still in the snow though.

Same with EA and battlefront 2 people haven’t shut up since November 2017. Thid shit is why r/gamingcirclejerk exists
---
Don't feel bad, I just took my first rank at level 143 :P
---
I'm really not the best person to ask, but I'll answer anyway.
---
You can definitely get $15 worth of enjoyment out of it.
---
Think about how much you might spend to go see a movie in theaters - in a lot of places, one ticket is $15 now. And that's 2ish hours of enjoyment. You'll definitely get more than 2 hours of solid enjoyment, in my opinion.
---
I do. When I get swarmed throw a moltolv and run, or take higher ground and shoot. I hate power armor personally. If its a run in i’ll have my all rise and knock em down. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Idk my 1st and only nuke launch i typed the code slightly wrong, maybe its 3 strike type of deal?
---
Everything I've read has been true. What exactly are you talking about? Genuinely curious.
---
I don't listen to youtubers so this may be why. 
---
I'm not running a shotgun build, but I still find them useful for certain pests/backup pieces.
---
Not sure.  Seems like when I first started playing, the game was not taxing my system much (gaming laptop w/ 1070).  Everything seemed to be running relatively cool.  Now after several "updates", seems like it's running really hot now.  Could be imagination, but?
---
Still don't regret paying full price - just do it, $15 is a steal.
---
If you mean this post is tagged as a bug, I did that. 
---
It's all about situational awareness. Sometimes you just have to run like hell back to the robots or other players when a big pack of ghouls rushes you, but a hazmat suit is viable if you keep to stealth and use the terrain\buildings to your advantage.
---
Yes!
---
seeing as you shouldn't be able to tame scorched creatures yeah that is obviously a bug. But damn I would pay for one of those in my camp.
---
I enjoy the game as a whole. Exploring and leveling. I like the way the perk cards are done in this game and optimizing my builds. I also like to travel around everywhere and check everything it. 
---
Yeah gotta be done. I was in a good mood too I'd not long left a nuke zone with a two shot Tesla rifle which got me about 5 levels cost me a lot of rad x and rad away but so worth it 
---
Which one? I listed 4 repeatable ones, 2 maybes, 4 non-repeatables, and 2 that are in the game files but don't appear to be active?
---
At 50 it takes the same exp each level. So once you have a system and get it down. It takes no time to lvl up
---
It does
---
Oh! Can you add some comment about how Hardened Mass needs to be a "safe" junk, like beer bottles and baseballs?
---
Online and controls. Everything else is excellent
---
I've got em if you still want em. What do you have for trade?
---
Hey smart guy...I never said anyone cheated the IRS
---
Updates? I remember 2 and then absolute silence.
---
Where is it for $15 at? My wife got it on the the PC for me for Christmas and I am loving it. 
---
Thank you. So does the lvl1 indicate that the enemies drop it starting at level 1, the enemy level must be 1 or the player level must be 1? I have done as OP stated and killed everything and looked everywhere, never got one to drop either. Was it cut?
---
I agree.  
---
I am still playing but my friends have quit already.  One returned tonight for all of 30 mins, then crashed out doing a Nuke.  He's a lvl 120 so a lot of time in game.  He won't play till it's fixed he said.  I hope they sort it soon.
---
Caps or mutation serums.
---
&gt; ONLY shots that actually hit drain durability, you can confirm this easy by shooting nothing and seeing the results. Conversely, this does mean that a two-shot gatling DOES break twice as fast.
---
This means *do not* use the "beam splitter" on a laser weapon, particularly not a two-shot beam splitter. Beam splitter reduces damage but makes four beams per shot. Mine breaks at some point after the second reload.
---
I know what you mean.  I find managing weight to be incredibly frustrating, and it's clearly designed to be frustrating.  It's a pity they ever added any perks to make that easier.
---
Just add that i believe i can fly tune and bueno :D
---
Legendery effects affect the dmg number but shows dmg per hit =&gt; swing speed doen't increase that. (Bloodied,Nocturnal,Berserker,Twoshot and explosive have an effect on sheet dmg)
---
Is this copypasta? This seems like something automod on gaming circlejerk would post
---
That game sucks though, real talk. 
---
How do you know?
---
Thanks 
---
Oh my God, THIS! I say it regularly.
---
**People go in the internet to get their opinions nowadays**
---
It honestly scares me more than maybe it should. While I see a lot of great things about the younger generation, I'm worried that they are all so scared to think for themselves in fear of the backlash/ridicule they might get.
---
That was probably the smartest option 
---
This. It's under Side quests, Miscellaneous, Retrieve your dropped loot
---
Deactivate and re-activate it and you should see it. You should also see a skull and crossbones for the last location you died - this should get you pretty close. 
---
That one weird guy still running enclave events here - I like them honestly they're something different. And if it's the one big blast, for Yao Gui, it's a great source of springs which I so desperately need to repair my gun... I'm also looking for a full set of Urban Scout armor with potential legendary status from the event.   
---
I don't particularly like server hopping I find it boring as all hell to load in and walk the same jaunt over and over again across multiple servers hoping to be amazed a vendor has something different... So with that in mind I've just been staying on one server or if the disconnect gods disagree I'll be on a different one.    
---
I like this idea a lot though, I never knew Scorchbeasts also counted for commendation?! I thought it was just legendary foes and Enclave events. Either way to give more meaning to those missions to fullfil a quota even if it's a daily cap on how many you can earn like Mr Fuzzy tokens I'd still be happy to grind up to get some nice new kicks to my PA! 
---
Only PA and my All Rise for me!
---
Prolly crops and purified water. 
---
Ooh man, I bought Atlas about a week ago and I'm playing the shit out of that game haha i love it, allready 32 hours in..
---
Have fallout 76 too and I like it, even since launch but thats on hold for the moment. I'm sure it will get even better after some updates.
---
Preach.
---
I'm sick of hearing people go on about it, I'm pretty sure everyone knows by now that it's got a lot of shortfalls. If you don't like it, don't play it and forget about it. Easy as pie.
---
I still enjoy it as I'm sure a lot of people do and I'm bored of seeing the same old articles and posts.
---
I just tried it. It didnt work
---
It's not a hate train the game is bad and the stuff around it is bad also. You just don't like that it being ripped so hard. Mo one complained when battlefront2 got so much hate and no mans sky etc. Ppl are just tired of being fucked over by multi million or billion dollar companies. Month down the line the game is still nearly unplayable broken for some ppl. If you haven't had problems with it doesn't mean others haven't.
---
I was using that but then it bugged out for a few days so I resorted to here. Lol sorry
---
The warehouse plans are my white whale. Seen brick a few times, but never warehouse in many hours of workshop claiming and vendor server hopping. 
---
Its a vault tec university bomber, in blue, pretty rare but i dont have the pic :(
---
Frankly speaking, Bethesda deserves this kind of hate. Initially it is caused by the combination of high expectations from the fanbase and promises made by Bethesda.
---
I agree they are trying to patch the game, but it is too late and too little. But the damages have already been done. People just simply lost interest and move on to other games. 
---
I do really hope Fallout 76 have a “No-Man-Sky” style of  return. But right now, it belongs to the bottom-pit.
---
Surface to Air appears all around Cranberry Bog, anywhere where you find those fixed surface to air missile emplacements. I suspect this is not a BoS event though, more like Census violence where it can reward BoS stuff,  but is less likely. They use different levelled lists for their rewards than Heart of the Enemy, Forbidden Knowledge, Distant Thunder, and Line in the Sand.
---
I think you're probably right. Jesus.
---
Press reload, go get drink, come back, watch it finish reloading.
---
Although something like that you have enough
---
Bullets to potentially kill some stuff then reload after or swap. Six bullets just don’t cut it though.
---
Not sure, I too have seen random PA chassis.  I'd bet some nard picked it clean for you though and ran off.
---
Honestly imo being able to kill your self is a good enough balance, you’re at risk to lose your junk and get looted, I think that it’s pretty good the way it is. The issue isn’t TSE the issue is the duplication in my opinion. Cause honestly dupers won’t have any issue with using their duped scrap and materials to repair weapons, all it’s gonna do is make the hardworking legit players work harder which isn’t all that fair to me but I see where you’re coming from
---
other then winters coat the ect thats about all he has after 50+ spawns
---
Place all your chassis at the same time, since you seem to have multiple chassis I suspect one isn't empty. 
---
Don't drop them.
---
Super fun with people and now its a lot more manageable alone. Warning, starting out alone it feels like a survival horror game. With friends it is exactly what it sounds like. A Fallout game with possibly its best map and some of its best quests with friends! Make sure your friends respect your time on quests to read terminals and listen to holotapes! So much story!
---
If you're on a team and one person shares rank 3 Rad Sponge and another shares Ghoulish you'll be healing and curing rads so fast that you don't need to worry too much about staying alive. Just watch your 6 and run to the robots (or high level players) if shit gets to be too much.

If the person with the bounty has no caps the “bounty hunter” gets nothing or whatever the wanted player has

Did not know that. I haven’t had the opportunity to test it or yet. Thanks for the information though.

You might also try the market subreddit - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/)
---
What, you people dont like searching bushes for 20 min just to realize the corpse fall under the map?
---
But muh New Vegas!
---
Maybe because so many people talk shit about it it's because it's a shit game.

I was going to buy rust but after reading some of the comments on this thread I’m having second thoughts. Any reason why it is bad or is just the core gameplay experience? 
---
level &lt;= player level, so basically they will drop it as long as u have finished the quest and RNGesus wishes u to have it, I believe that the EpicLootChance comes into play here, tho im not 100% sure on that. And its also possible that they have infact stopped it from even spawning on the server side
---
Exactly. OP is a crying manchild.
---
I don't even get what he's saying. "I'm angry because a shit game gets shit"? What? Of course people are going to discuss of the worst games of 2018, a game cynically designed to rake in that sweet microtransaction cash.
---
Anyway, If you wan to enjoy a good Fallout experience, I suggest ATOM RPG. It's a game actually made with love.
---
I don't even understand why you guys keep playing the game. It's dead anyway, and probably going F2P in 6 months.
---
Trade completed I found what I was after
---
Have you tried to use VATS to see if it has a head.
---
I didnt even think people bothered to defend the game at this point.  
---
I played it for about 100 hours, was alright.  I mean i regret paying $60 for it but i paid the same for red dead 2 and that only lasted like 20 hours.
---
The overall lack of content is just meh, i mean i think i did everything by day 3 or 4?  Finish story, get power armor, reddit the nuke codes go solo that for gigs, farm nuke stuff until you realize enclave vendor sells all mods for x01 anyways, stack all the mutations because why not, buy explosive shotgun off ebay for $.75 off some australian dude and good game.
---
I don’t know a lot of the ins and outs, but one thing I do know: if you have been using the “drop” button to place power armor in the world, definitely switch to using the “wear”/“use” button instead.
---
I don't think that the game is as bad as the media makes it out to be, however the reason it gets so much more heat than no man's sky is because it comes from a AAA company.
---
It's clearly design intent that the Mire is dark, and things are difficult to see until you're uncomfortably close to them.  I don't know if searching for bodies is intentional or not, but it's much, much harder in the Mire than it is in the Ash Heap.
---
Either I responded to the wrong comment or it didnt show properly on my phone. The reply was meant for a post that simply read "Event: Line in the Sand", it's not showing anymore though.
---
Thanks for the great info! This is perfect.

Nah. The game sucks, bro.

"Theres literally no quest"

This are the most common ones I've seen here, YouTube, pretty any website that allows unverified product reviews and the web in general. They pop up pretty regularly. 
---
I don't think that's accurate. I had raw materials both times I tried. It didn't matter. As soon as I made a new Core, it would use the materials FROM that core to make a new one. I'm not really willing to try again, to prove this. But if you do, let me know if it works. 
---
🤷‍♀️
---
This, except I’m not sure which category 2mm EC falls under. Gauss rifle is considered an energy weapon under certain conditions, I’m not sure what the ammo is considered
---
I had a whole wave of anglers spawn in a wall behind the workbench... out of grenades and no way to fight them but to wait for them to work their way back to the surface... 
---
That's fair. IMO if I can't take off a week or two for Christmas and I didn't even leave millions of people with a $60 flaming mess, they probably shouldn't either, but it will be interesting to see if anything gets fixed now. I kind of doubt it.
---
Ahh, okay, I think both of us may have misunderstood you then. I apologize! 
---
I will keep watch for it. I don't recall seeing it yet.
---
Event: Census Violence appears all around Cranberry Bog. I suspect this is not a BoS event though. It can reward BoS stuff, but is less likely. The event use a different levelled list for its rewards than Heart of the Enemy, Forbidden Knowledge, Distant Thunder, and Line in the Sand. 
---
&gt; Fov was something they weren’t able to do with their own engine, due to limitations.
---
If they really did then they were obviously bullshitting; even if it wasn't obvious by the ability to mess with FoV in past titles built on the same core engine, there'd have to be something seriously wrong to not be able to change a setting like FoV because it's a fixed unchangeable setting due to the base engine level code (and one built especially for open world RPG games with highly customizable worlds/environments at that).
---
Patch it out for good, nerf explosives and bump the weapon level cap up by 20/30. The only way to lessen the current effects is to make the weapons obsolete at high levels. They'd still be a bit of an issue at lower levels, but it'd ease off at higher. 
---
I got two card right now I can use when I feel the need.
---
Last card I earned though as the damn mule spawned right at Prime and hovered around with TWO scorchbeasts I had to try and avoid as I sniped the drone down for the card, then ran away like a baby.
---
Might also be when you started the game had a few more rats and the occasional ghoul were handled with a machete. Now you are fighting hordes of super mutants throwing grenades at you while a scorchbeast flies overhead screaming and over the hill you see a 3* legendary Mr. Gutsy heading your way while firing off a mobile artillery of weapons. I haven't noticed a performance decrease really but it can differ per person.
---
I tried shooting one that popped up in white springs last night in the "head". I Just kinda shot where the face would be if it had no neck, but had a head. Couldn't find a sweet spot before it died. Now i know what I'm trying to do whenever i see one.
---
You are literally the best!!! I’ve sent you a friend request and patiently await you accepting and being online. I’m short a few specific ingredients to cover my exact order but have enough related items (I have flux, just not the right kind) to make up the difference. I’ll happily donate extra ingredients to the cause too. Except for coal... I don’t think I recall ever coming across that. Be well, kind stranger!
---
You know what I came here ready to point out the flaws in your game, and then you bought up destiny and I remembered how much I loved(and still love) that game amongst the hate, I genuinely hope that you enjoy 76 and find a way around all the haters in YouTube, Reddit and other social media
---
I usually give new toons stimpaks and dont really lock my purifiers so people can take them.
---
Ding ding! Hazmat suit is great for snipers :)
---
Never trust a man in a German officer uniform.
---
Thanks all, got the code, launched the nuke, killed about 10 green guys then......DISCONNECTED!!!!
---
So....you're ok with the bug staying in the game? It's OUR responsibility to work around it?
---
Cool, thanks so much. I'll try again to see if I can get one to drop. Nothing else to do really. Maybe after the next update it will be corrected and drop regularly. 
---
I dont think I've had the game ctd on me yet. But I have to switch servers every hour or so. Stopping duping will help, but wont fix it.
---
I did not. I played through nuka world once but thought it was kind of a snooze and didn't pay much attention
---
I dealt with worse shit on one of my posts and then stumbled across this comment, disagreement = stupid pos go die 
---
Explosive should be a primary effect and not scale with demo expert. This puts it on par with two shot only with AoE damage, but you also damage yourself which balances it. Multiple projectile weapons like shotguns, need to have each pellet's explosion value divided by the number of projectiles
---
I really don't think even the state it launched in deserved this amount of hate, when the canvas bag news came out I said that was the first legitimate complaint I've seen about fo76 and it's only related because it came packaged with he game. It didn't impact the quality of the game in the slightest.
---
I do realize that others may have had more issues than I did, but even playing every day for hours on launch week my game only crashed 4 times and I only lost connection 1 or 2 and I'm positive it was because of my internet. And the only glitches I've seen were graphical and meaningless. The one and only problem I had on launch week was the ticket machine not working so I couldn't complete a quest.
---
Yikes
---
Usually if you disconnect fast enough he respawns, or that's what happened to my deathclaw. I used to live near a train station, so he attacked every single player that passed by and actually he got killed several times but always came back. Except one time when he died and I noticed only 2 or so hours after.
---
Once my first pet was gone I tamed a bear (ugly and diseased) which for some reason kept attacking my generator 24/7. Called a mate to kill him, and after 1h or so I logged out. Once I came back he was already gone after only one death.
---
Now I have a chill deathclaw that doesn't hate anymore my teammates but still doesn't trust strangers.
---
It's cool. Didn't know if you knew about it or not. Mostly just wanted to say that since there's a dedicated place for trading, even though it's chock full of dupers. Didn't know it was bugging out though. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Yes. Every online game ever has fixed duping with their first attempt. 
---
And I'm sure you have in-depth , first hand knowledge of the issues with patching things like camp placement. 
---
And they lowered atomic shop prices pretty significantly when you compare the Xmas bundle and the new years bundle. A couple hundred atoms different if I recall correctly.
---
Everyone's an arm chair programmer. "How hard is it to fix this? Or that?"
---
Do you work for a game studio? No? Then I'm sure you're opinion on patching issues on a multiplatform game is fucking jam packed with credibility.
---
Legitimate Grievance = Fine
---
Hating the Game = Fine
---
Trolling the forums trying to deprive anyone of any enjoyment of the game = Lame
---
I'd buy the pack's weapon skins though if Bethesda sells them on 76
---
Nuke zones are impossible to do without radaway. Even with the best rad protection power armor and an ass ton of rad-x, you will be able to stand inside for a minute or two before you die of rads. At the very best you can use the perk that heals your rads in daylight and just keep stepping in and out of the nuke zone, but I wouldn't really count that as even participating since you would just be in the outskirts the whole time
---
Well, what do you know, surviving at ground zero of a nuclear explosion is not realistically possible. I'm just shocked
---
Hype train? We obviously live in two different countries, or maybe just different rec on youtube.
---
Sounds about right ^^/s
---
Or just tone down their damage (or bring up the damage of other weapons) so that they're more in line with one another.  
---
Not saying that they should all deal equal damage, but make it so that TSEs are not overwhelmingly superior, and that all weapons can be used effectively against what it seems like are bullet sponges.
---
They're less comparable to Super Sledges than Power Fists or Deathclaw Gauntlets, though. They're weaker.
---
Also, unarmed weapons are better than the Super Sledge. Super Sledge is overrated.
---
How am I doing that? All I did is was say his review of it seemed less "upset" than 76's.
---
TS already has about a 30% accuracy loss iirc.  
---
instead of dropping a nerf nuke how about we buff other effects to be more efficent so all effects have a niche.
---
 aoe trash clear? TSE.
---
 boss fight? lets buff furious to have a multiplier that maxes over what TS has, rewarding good aim.
---
lets make nocturnal WORTH carrying for night use.
---
Actually, people got banned because they had been using Cheat Engine (either actively using it to cheat, or left it running while the game was on).  Even the dimwit that 'came forward' to claim he had been banned for using Reshade turned out to be complete BS.
---
You really think people are actually going to admit when they fucked up and got caught cheating?  These people will stare you in the eyes and say they aren't cheating even when you've caught them in the act of doing it.
---
I get it, you need to continue the hur dur "OMGWTFBBQ FALLOUT 76 BAD FONV MOST AMAZING GAME EVAR!" spiel but seriously, at least try to get your facts right occasionally.

Pretty much no point in building settlements on XB1 recently since I can’t go more than a couple of hours without a DC.

Yeah that's a story damn good one but I guess everyone different I hate having no story and so do alot of other ppl. But each there own.

Holy shit. Settle down Hitler.

She was the last truly intimidating enemy in the game. I feared her long after I realized I no longer had to worry about scorchbeasts
---
I remember the days...I was playing max payne and GTA vice city when I was 6 years old. Good times. I probably turned out fine. I'm sure the people around me would agree there's definitely nothing wrong with me.

Exactly. Just want it for being out in the world, Yao gui's come to mind.

You are welcome. Are you looking for some particular item/plan drop? If so, I can datamine the levelled lists and let you know where it can drop.

Well the east coast enclave were the less loved members that didn't get invited to the oil rig. This is apparently the reason why.

I love it! 😂 that’s my go-to. Patrolman glasses and a ball cap.

Go ahead and start on your fanfic, we'll read it
---
Then they got nuked, the end.
---
True, it should have been stated,  but come on, look at the cap of the Nuka Rum bottle. Look at the size of the bottle, the shape and the cap makes it obvious this is not the container holding the rum itself.

Your video got flagged for mature content on YouTube, unfortunately.

Oh, well that's the way to go then!

Not to mention for several quests you lose all quest progress (along with their essential notes/items) and the quests disappear from your log until you retrigger them–even major ones if you haven't progressed far enough.
---
i also did that, pretty sure i dropped a few curse words in there.

Yeah, he just never skips neck day.

no offence if you could care less care less. It's couldn't care less.

The fuck do people say this for? Did you not read it before you posted lol.

#NO YOU GOTTA BE POLARIZED

Yeah. Luckily the game is easy enough to play through even with a lesser build. I'm not as strong as PA people, but I can't easily do stuff.
---
Stop clicking on the hate videos. The YouTube algorithm will suggest you more of the type you choose to watch.

Resist the clicks and you will not be flooded with them.

She was the last truly intimidating enemy in the game. I feared her long after I realized I didn't have to worry about scorchbeasts anymore

Oh, nice! I thought that all of the damage perks got less impressive the more points you spent on them. I've run into a lot of glowing enemies recently, so definitely worth a try. Thanks!

Really enjoying it so far. No complaints at all and I really enjoy pizza so it’s convenient too.

Switch worlds
---
I'm not sure! Might be! A guy down here in the comments said that two 50% pieces do stack to 100%.
---
Found the frustrated Bethesda CS Rep. In all seriousness though they are a triple A developer who released a game that was at best halfway finished. They deserve reminders being ramrodded down their throat every day otherwise this unacceptable standard will just continue to prevail.  
---
Yeah the step outtakes line thing was sorta annoying but running through a neat area and finding a holotape of pointless talking or a note that says "haha i wanna piss off the edge" isn't fun but each there own.
---
If it was Xbox I was there.  The Nuke ended but they kept coming in large numbers.  About 3 full waves after it cleared .  I had a level 22 with me who finished lvl 28.  I got him to shoot each one (for his XP) we met.  Then everyone killed them.  I noticed another lower level player, which might have been you.  There was also a 40 ish throwing grenades without pacifist on getting Wanted.  I finished at lvl 108.  It was good fun, clear sky and greenies.  His stash is now full with legendary I dropped for him and he's very happy, having been in his first Nuke.
---
 Jews 😎
---
I done fked around and got some snot ear 
---
The game was 76% off 2 weeks after launch. 
---
They don't need to be changed.  They are fine as is.
---
I'm just trying for all the PA plans, including the BoS paintjobs and outfits. I hoped to get a handful so I can start a small BoS faction. I dont have much to do in the game atm so I was just gonna grind the events for the BoS stuff. 
---
When I hear that sound it reminds me of railway rifle, almost like a compressed air cannon firing a small spike at me.  
---
Yep. They should’ve at least made it impossible to sneak in Power Armor. 
---
I have an explosive shotgun with appropriate perks and my slap damage is still slap damage. I have heard of people getting ridiculous melee damage with drugs and berserker builds
---
The lack of NPC's is one of my favorite things about 76. Grab the holotape, listen to the story while doing other things! Way better than standing in one place for 5 paragraphs of dialogue, most of which is unrelated dialectic nothingness, then pretending the 4 choices of dialogue i get to reply are anywhere near what i actually want to say back. 
---
Explain why hes wrong then?
---
You and your videos are amazing. I love how subtly creepy even this version is. The long narrow metal hallway without any furnishings at all seems to give some visitors pause just before they hear the door shut. Very creative!
---
Exactly, I think this is what people still don't get.  No Man's Sky didn't get this much shit because you weren't really expecting them to put out a perfect AAA title, no one was really surprised when it was trash on launch.  Bethesda putting out a game this bad is not expected, it's obvious how lazy they were with the game, and you know they can do substantially better.  That's why they are getting so much shit.
---
If you're happy paying $60 for broken games running on old engines, I've got some bridges to sell you. 
---
What special is travel agent in? I don't think I've seen that card before.
---
The surrounding controversies, false marketing and release of an unfinished, always crashing game with $10 Atom outfits that clips players hair...  Bethesda clearly brought this on themselves..
---
YouTube isn't coordinating an attack against a 'great game', there are valid criticisms of bad decision making, some of which are still currently playing out. 
---
I don't care enough to attack the game but the butthurt fanboys that overly devoted to defending this trash are what drove me to uninstall the game completely. Not referring to op, just my exp with this sub the last few months. 
---
I'll come back if Bethesda makes things right, I'm not that salty, but I really don't recognize them as a company anymore.
---
SCORCHBETCH 😂 *definitely* stealing that.
---
Congrats!!
---
Yeah after looking it up it turns out that Bethesda only published it. But I feel that only really furthers my point. Most people would likely tell you that Bethesda both created and published it because they did so for every other Fallout game (that I'm aware of, correct me if I'm wrong). What I do know is that New Vegas is many of the Fallout fanbase's favorite Fallout game, and that it is very critically acclaimed. Despite them not actually making it, Bethesda still gets recognition for it and can use it to bolster their popularity, which is pretty uncool if you ask me.
---
Another tip: don't underestimate bloody mess, while it only gives 15% on rank3 it is it's own multiplier!
---
Hey. Even a bad game can be enjoyable. I laugh at all the stupid shit thats going on with the game when I run across it. I laugh with the youtubers because they are right on most of it. But I enjoy the game and don't let what they say bother me. 
---
Hello?

Play a Bette game dumb fuck. 
---
Up in the northwest part of the Forest there are a lot of unmarked, partially ruined houses and old estates you can build onto if you set up a camp. Find one with a water seep or a creek in range and you can get a very nice farm going.
---
For what it's worth, NMS did absolutely get this much noise. When did FO76 Release? I was seeing shit about NMS for literally the next year. The game was an embarrassing dumpster fire on release, being the subject of mockery is to be expected when devs are so shortsighted and publishers are so greedy. That's the price you pay for not putting in the effort to *release* a good game.
---
How long did it take for ESO to not be treated like a laughing stock? Oh right, many people still perceive it as a trash game, because its really hard to shake people's first impressions.
---
That's right, this wasn't even the first time Bethimax ballsed up an online game release to an absurd and unacceptable degree. 76 is *always* going to be a joke game to many many people. That is the price to be paid for shortsighted greed and apathy.
---
I like it

Fallout 76 really isn't any different load up holotape go find dead body listen to another one go here clear area repeat.
---
Oi fooken limey think yer hard there mate?
---
I like it.
---
Preach! I agree with you. If you don't like the game then play another one. There's no reason to waste breath on trash talking a bad game.
---
No, not with a passion.  More of a dissapointed type of hate.
---
mid-late January for a large patch is the most commonly thought timeframe based off the last "inside the vault"
---
Very well designed. You are evil and I love it.
---
Oh look, yet another thread by a Bethesda apologist. The game is still a buggy mess and will continue to be because they can't be hassled to use a new game engine.  Rather than make something quality we see the same trash being put out on another version of Gamebryo, year after year.
---
Tanking Ultracite. X01 is easier 2 mod 2 the way you like and looks better in my opinion. But ultracite will do you just fine
---
No. The view is pretty and no one bothers you. Is it cowardly to want to have a real house in the mountains away from everyone? No. Its peacful. 
---
Aww too bad the devs are scum and released a shitty game and because it's a AAA studio that has plundered millions if not billions from it's fanbase since their existence people should be megaphoning their hatred from rooftops to really drive the point home. It's cool you like the game but how about you shut the fuck up and let Bethesda get what they deserve.
---
\*nods\* Very bad \*takes more psychobuff\* LET'S KILL SOME MUTTIES!
---
Ha, sparklers ... classic. (ง'̀-'́)ง
---
&gt;The ones having the problem are those not knowing what they bought. Like I said, this is an online game.
---
and what does that entail? because up to this point, I figured you thought Fo76 was a mmo.
---
&gt;You, and the rest of the players that wanted something else can patiently wait another 10 to 12 years until the next Fallout comes out.
---
or play 76 since it's mainly a singleplayer experience. being online or having other players in the map doesn't really change that.
---
&gt;Seriously, this concept isn't so hard to get, I don't know why you are struggling so much.
---
I could say the same as you were the one comparing Fo76 to GTAO, which also depends on player interactions to even exist. it's the same as Overwatch. sure, you can dick around by yourself. but that's not how the game was designed.
---
&gt;It wasn't me who brought up the whole "real market vs in-game transactions". But I see you don't like getting beaten at your own game.
---
beaten? I don't see how considering what I'm saying is factual: a market, in the mmo sense defined 10 years ago by Chinese and Korean gold farmers, implies items for cash. *period*.
---
&gt;If we both agree that this isn't an MMO, why are you trying to apply MMO-like economies to it to begin with?
---
because one, singleplayer games *can* have economies, and two, you yourself brought up a "healthy economy", except you meant caps. in-game currency means squat unless you're buying it for cash.
---
Lol I have it in the highest mountain very top 
---
Both of those armor pieces are pretty good. 
---
T_T
---
I didn't say that. In the interim if you don't spam buttons you'll save yourself grief in a few different ways
---
Might be a bug. I don't think slap damage is that much. Do you run with pacifist mode on? Did she accidentally hit him or his base? Is she running any mutations like Electrically charged or unstable isotopes?
---
What's cowardly is building on whitesprings for the grass and complaining about it being destroyed all the time. 
---
I don't give a shit about people's opinions, to be honest.
---
My feelings towards 76 as a whole can be summed up as disappointed rather than "send death threats to Bethesda devs that had little to do with the release decisions". 
---
I don't think you read at all the part where I acknowledged the game's problems. 
---
But taking the argument into other games, rehashing the same "Bethesda sux and here's why" videos that all say the exact same thing, and constantly comparing it to other games? That's tiresome. 
---
But apparently being sick of the negativity makes me Todd Howard's bitch and a Bethesda shill, because *clearly* I agree with every single one of their decisions and believe they can do no wrong. I'm TOTALLY being paid to say nice things about them. I'm not a human capable of my own train of thought AT ALL.
---
You guys should try getting over yourselves.
---
The two respawning with the thumbs down and angry emote cracked me up 
---
U want sum of dis mate? Imma tank, i will fookin disrespect u
---
It seems like they at least attempted to address this with the meat-pile-flies-noise thing, but it's certainly not enough. Also, no accompanying noise for robot enemies (maybe just wires sparking?).
---
I used to get up high and sweep around with Dogmeat's cursor to help in FO4, but...but 😭😭 sorry, I just can't....DOGMEAT!!!
---
I'm still doing the Enclave events because apparently the last two baseball bat plans I need can be rewarded from some of them.
---
Ugh my camp is nearby there and I hear a creepy voice sometimes. NOW you tell me this? Yeah I’m totally gonna sleep tonight.
---
I’m not joking btw. It’s a deep voice that has a flat tone. Sounds not normal at all. 
---
Wow. You guys are the reason developers can get away with releasing unfinished products and effectively lowering the bar for AAA games. The analogy is made in a relative sense. You're not using your game the same way as a new car obviously.
---
Sheesh in 4 days its going be a month since they said I'm going get canvas bag and email about getting atoms, whats with the slacking Bethesda.......
---
Nah dude. When I get in my super introverted mood, my camp is literally just the camp box since it's hard to see by itself. I store everything and only get it out when I want to use it.
---
Me and my crew of pirates appreciate this
---
Fortnite💯💯💯
---
Ultracite is better for tanking. X01 is better for rads.
---
Yeah that’s the quest. It just wants you to really hate the dmv 
---
With only 600lbs of storage (may seem like a lot now but give it another 10-15 levels) as well as limited caps to trade for many higher level players will give away stuff they arent using rather than just throw it on the ground.
---
Honestly OP, the game released in a poor state. Bethesda need to do better, they CAN do better.
---
 FO3 was incredible. FO4 was great, but the graphics and engine clearly aren't up to the task, or on par with any AAA games releasing in the past 2years. Making an online mmo rpg or whatever the heck they are calling it, on an ageing engine with the amount of problems it released with...why should people let them get away with that??
---
They deserve the shitty PR. 
---
I expect more from them, especially after the masterpiece that was Fallout 3, but after playing the FO76 beta I had the good sense to cancel my pre-order and grabbed my popcorn to watch the shitstorm that was the games release. They gotta improve BIG TIME because the next game they put out will be under serious scrutiny, and if they don't overhaul a lot of stuff - they are screwed.
---
As for all the hate the game still receives, again, I feel like they dug themselves into that hole. I get it sucks having to see it everywhere you look online, but you cannot stop people from having an opinion.
---
Just my 2 cents
---
No, I’m literally just telling you, you’re upset that pvp is an actual thing in this game and people who do it scare you off the server haha 
---
Free loot sign would be nice
---
Well it would be helpful to know what exactly you are doing.  
---
Probably endless Whitesprings farming. Find a higher level person to "carry" you until you can manage.
---
For me, I rather enjoy "clearing" every location, starting in the Forest, then Toxic Valley, then Ash Heap, then Mire, then Bog. 
---
Not quite done clearing it yet, but I'm not even done with the Free States quests and haven't started Brotherhood or Enclave and I'm going to hit level 50 soon. All I do is clear locations and explore, but I fought a few scorch beasts and leveled up a bit on Saturday.
---
u dont care about peoples opinions but..... u made this post
---
Delayed reply, 'cause I went through all the comments so as to not be *too* redundant.
---
Definite +1 on the sneaky. Never mind the usefulness of the sneak-attack multiplier (loved me the YCS/186 in New Vegas and piffing indistinct dots in the scope from a couple miles away), but until one gets a recon scope or power armor with the analogous HUD mod, the HIDDEN/DETECTED/CAUTION telltale is often the easiest indicator of whether you're near something that might object to your presence.
---
And OMG the rush of the first solo Scorchbeast kill. You did better than I did. Mine dragged on and on as I as an out of ammo and guns broke. I think I eventually finished it off with an M79 grenade launcher, and had, like, three rounds left when it finally dropped.
---
I'll agree also with the sentiment that, much as it sucked to go through, it's a good thing you had games and gaming to give you a good indicator of your exes' "true colors" before you got further in. Never settle. You're doing just fine, one sneaky explorer to another.
---
It doesn't make sense for him to be trying to find codes and at the same time they are updated on the website. 
---
I would disagree with explosive being primary, I think it should stay secondary but more of the primary should be moved to secondary. Primary is too crowded and secondary has essentially nothing good but explosive. 
---
Again it would be helpful to know where said spot is. Just saying spot in the mire helps no one.  
---
I put mine far from any fast travel spot, because if someone wants to bother me they are gonna have to work for it. And I'm also trying to farm a recipe that just won't spawn, so that's why my camp is in the middle of nowhere. But I actually want to build a maze up there with traps and all sorts, get a bounty and see if anyone is the adventurous sort.
---
Don't compare Hello Games to Bethesda. Bethesda is getting this mountain of shit because they went from triple A much-loved titles to something that wasn't even alpha, it wasn't even half-baked, 76 being so incredibly premature and even in its infantile state Bethesda places the icing on the cake: micro-transactions. The disappointment isn't a flawed new title like NMS was. This is going from the glory that was the Fallout series ending at FO4 and regressing or stagnating in every single scale: story, gameplay, graphics, customer service, communication with playerbase. NMS was pure disappointment, but F76 is a *literal* betrayal of any hope of improvement you wanted to see after FO4.
---
funny how it was designed to be fully experience by solo players, then. there's no detriment in playing alone. in fact, Bethesda went out of their way to limit player interaction as much as possible, unless you specifically state that you want it. forget the fact that the entirety of the Fallout playerbase mostly play solo, let's just take Bethesda on their word. **I'm sure they never lied before**.
---
multiplayer is an afterthought that you can completely ignore. that hardly qualifies as "multiplayer first"
---
Hmm still some serious bugs in fallout 4 3 years later that need mods to fix
---
That would be super cool actually 
---
I'm doing the same (grinding for all the BoS underarmor outfits and PA parts and mod plans). Are you PC? If so, maybe we can grind together sometime? IGN: jchamlin
---
This is so rad and so much better than another suggestion thread. Well done!
---
On my explosive combat rifle it adds a star and says 30%. I’m not sure how it effects outside of that as it’s the only one I’ve got and tried.
---
Those sound really cool! Are you on PC?
---
You could wait 24hrs if you want the caps for them from a vendor. 
---
Oh ok. I just wish I would have known that before I tried the quest. That's why I'm bringing it to light again. I know there were already posts about this, about a month ago. But the last one was before teh 13th Update, and obviously they a. Didn't know about it. or b. They didn't do anything about it. 
---
Hopefully they'll fix it soon.
---
Replace game and 76 with Trump and you just described some of the main political subs. Worldnews too
---
Also if you have a problem w dead-horse memes and cringeworthy clickbait, you should probably just get off YouTube in general... that’s the equivalent of standing in the rain and getting pissed at being wet. 
---
Intelligence lvl 26, it's a 1 Star perk card

Best line of the day. Winner right here boys, put down your pitchforks.

You’ll make a bunch of friends if you are willing to go and fetch a bunch of handmade weapon plans.

Yes I am on PC, and i know about the wait limit it’s just such a burden on my weight limit and stash limit 😂

Console?
---
I really do not want another game to be like the Division.  Where everything that became the meta got patched.  
---
Thats an idea. My friend was saying I should stick them on my patreon for folks who may not have seen it and I could put together a full sized print version without all the sketchbook background on it a bit more slowly that way...
---
Why it's a product someone expects to be working properly and there are tons of games for $20 look outside new 600 releases and one gamepass has 100s of games for $10 
---
It'd help if we know what platform you play on.
---
#YA FOOKIN WAT YOU BELLEND?! I SWEAR ON ME MUM THAT I WILL SMACK YOU SO HARD YOULL BE DRINKING TEA THROUGH A STRAW FOR 8 MONTHS
---
(sorry that's all the British slang I know)
---
Keep junk in stash. Get rid of pack rat. You probably have more weight in food and chems than you realize. Get the perks for those if needed. Do you collect a lot of fusion cores? Get the energy ammo weight reduction and keep cores ob you.
---
Basically reduce weight on other things and keep them on you. Dump your junk in stash...if you die you only risk losing what little junk you were carrying.
---
No I'm saying even with the shit system Bethesda uses for junk items/mods, if you have scrap if shouldn't be scrapping things to do it.
---
If it is, that's buggy AND shitty instead of just shitty.
---
Nice. Thanks for the psa
---
I understand what you’re saying, but to me, that just means people need to more pissed off at the other companies and not less pissed off at Bethesda.
---
There are counters. Look at the perks, gears, and mods to see if you can come up with something... Not that the PvP is in a good place right now. But yeah I agree with you it is ridiculous how many people opt into aquiring duped gear. Such is life. 
---
I got stuck in power armor a couple days ago and wasn't doing anything special at all. Just noticed I couldn't exit anymore, and my PA model was visibly "hollow" from a lot of angles, like the chassis was gone but the armor pieces were still on it.
---
The game state was corrupted somehow though but not crashing, because I no longer had *any* quests show up under data tab except completed ones. I've also seen this happen independently of the PA bug, so maybe not related but seemed suspicious.
---
Actually, yeah, it does mean that. You’re playing a fallout game not a farming simulator. The first look we have at the game is one player shooting another player that’s on their damn l knees. You guys deserve a special server hopping mode since that’s all you guys do anyway. 
---
Oh so let’s nerf the entire game? Gimme a fucking break, how about they give some forethought before balancing their shitty game. You have any idea how much they’d have to nerf melee for it to not one shot mobs??? It’d have to do 10% of its current damage, and it could still one shot weak to mid tier mobs with power attacks
---
Ive heard some interesting stories of low level people suiciding with fatmans when they've gotten pvp flagged
---
Hold up.
---
You expected more.
---
From the company that brought us Skyrim.
---
The game that, after sixteen rererererereleases, on a dozen different platforms, in several different editions, including a newer edition that was supposed to have had a ton of bugfixes, STILL has game-breaking bugs that require you to either look up some obscure console commands (or if you're on any console that isn't PC, you're basically fucked), the most uninteresting combat there's ever been in any game anybody can remember, one third of the combat triangle (the magic) completely useless from midgame on, basically the same engine for the last twenty years and half dozen games, no balance patches, no exploit fixes, no patch logs, no communication from the dev team on anything.
---
History teaches us nothing, I guess?
---
Ty for the info :)
---
Weird I have intelligence maxed. You'd think I'd remember that. 
---
Off to look. Thank you 
---
Was thinking the exact same thing, but with radiation emitters and turrets. If they break the emitters then the turrets mow em down.
---
Eh I get +15 of all stats with my low hp build.  Well minus endurance. 
---
Now I just need a bloodied, 40% fast attack speed fist weapon. 
---
No this is bullshit, it's a game ment to peddle shitty microtransactions, it runs like shit on consoles and has more bugs than any other Bethesda game released. The fact that it was made by 300 people and it came out like this makes be belive it was just to make some money through 2019 before es6 was released. When games like doom eternal and rage 2 come out against fallout 76 it makes fallout 76 look like an xbox 360 game.
---
I feel your frustration. My guess is that you either enjoy the game personally or are just accurately observing the hate. 
---
I haven’t played it, so I only know what I’ve read. I think one of the reasons that it got so much hate is that everyone LOVED Skyrim. Bethesda gained a lot of cred for that. Then fallout 4 was good and everyone had a pretty good view of Bethesda.
---
We kinda idolized Bethesda, because they made great games and weren’t like those “other game companies”. With fallout 76, they showed that they too can be like those other companies. 
---
&gt; The enemies seem to scale with you
---
To an extent. The different areas have a 'range' of levels and yes will scale within that range. [Here is a map I found](https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc)
---
Since it has only one perk it's missing out on the 40 percent the other 2 can give but talons gives 25 percent without costing any perk slots. So that only leaves it down by 15 percent, but you also gain damage for your strength so that makes up for it a little ( and alot for specialized builds like the glass cannon ) and the power fist has an armor penetration mod although not sure on the percentage. I can say that my legendary antiarmor power fist + mod + incisor totals 90% armor penetration.
---
It's a product you pay for that should work properly a car can be fixed after you buy it see no difference. 
---
All summed up as “my assumptions are reality.” Show me what Bethesda says and what they do that supports any of that. You’re still operating on your point of view and not looking at it objectively. As every single post from you is this and you obviously don’t have any compelling information or arguments, I’m gonna leave you here with that.
---
That was a bit more specifically directed to GTA5, which I perhaps should've indicated.
---
My experience with RDR2 itself is a bit more limited, I've played it a couple of times, and have friends who played it a bit more indepth in my regular gaming crew. And I'm certainly not as familiar with the western genre to recognize the barely disguised blatant story lifts if they are there.
---
A slack approach can also be somewhat relative. To take a memetic image, they had the wherewithal to model shrinking horse testicles, but not to change their code so that horses don't burst into flames like crashing automotive vehicles. Or indeed to recognize that horses are living creatures that will not run headfirst into obvious obstacles themselves, they'd balk and throw the rider, if anything. Its thats sort of instance where the effort is entirely surface level, like repainting a car thats falling apart from rust rather then fixing the crumbling chassis, that I'm referencing.
---
Don’t see how this would change anything at all...as they could just store extras on extra characters or sell the surplus before duping more 
---
Ps4, sorry my man.
---
They just need to make a hotkey to turn on or off on PC and a key combo or an action you can save in the favorites wheel.
---
Yeah more talking about class freak
---
Stop buying games at launch then. 
---
online and in game
---
Thirdstorm IGN, yours?
---
Lol I'm on ps4 that's why I'm asking 
---
Yeah pvp is fairly common if you stick yourself in those situations. I think it’s a bit more uncommon to encounter somebody directly attacking your camp. People consider mechanics that are in the game (like folks who use the perk card to do damage to other player structures, or weapons that do extra damage to other players) when used, to be griefing. When to begin with, one of the first glimpses of the game we see one player shooting another player on their damn knees in the head. 
---
People wanna at Fallout: Wasteland Sims Edition, and they are upset when somebody picks a fight. 
---
Only problem with that is explosive damage is calculated after the primary effect is applied, so if your primary effect doubles your damage, explosive will double it again.
---
Eg: gauss with rifle perks and bloody mess: 248
---
TS gauss same perks: 515
---
Explosive gauss same perks: 515
---
TSE gauss same perks 1030
---
TSE gauss same perks with demo 5: 1545
---
Hrmm noted! I'll try, how do you get a lead on where the plans are located?
---
Quit crying ffs. Why are you people tying your own self worth to how much people like the video game? Grow up. 
---
luficr, i sent you a request earlier should i send another? i will join on you 
---
Instead of whining, we should just not buy the next gam... Skyrim 2  wha?!? Forget that, I’m all in lol
---
I like a lot Fallout 76 for what it is. I know there is more coming and it will continue to improve. What we've been talking about doesn't really bother me, though of course I miss some of the more interactive/personal experiences Fallout used to offer. It's honestly only the bugs and lag that keep me from really getting obsessed. I still get rubberbanding, big framerate drops, and enemies that don't react to being shot or just decide to stop moving randomly. I have a very above average internet connection and a fairly high end rig, so all my problems are definitely server-side. It's just really frustrating fighting enemies when some buggy bullshit happens almost every time. That's most of the gameplay and it doesn't work. I still play though lol
---
This for dupers.
---
game sucks yo
---
Actually fixing the problem would be nice. Their continued failure makes it look even worse. That’s the point I am trying to make. Launch failures are bad enough but the game hasn’t gotten much better in 10 weeks and I’m not sure how much more to expect. 
---
On PC use [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/129](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/129)
---
Nah dude, you're great, nothing wrong with you. Now, please put the gun down.
---
Very well could have been me. Someone had a camp nearby with full crafting stations that people were in and out of scrapping or repairing their stuff. Lasted a couple of hours, I think.  
---
All I had was a decent (for my level) pump shotgun, so I was spraying the crowds while standing on the wall of the pool for a lot of it.
---
Ha! She'd have an extra snarky remark for each one of those bullets. On second thought, I'm glad she doesn't, she's way funnier than I am... Sigh...
---
Like...it's like you can't even like the game without being accused of being scum or a shill. 
---
Have you tried getting a grip?
---
Shut the fuck up Todd, go make a new engine.
---
Well, it tags the mobs for you, and also pulls them, so I use it to bring the fight to me...cooldowns pretty long though.
---
How are you not a bajillionaire?? Sooo friggin good art/writing/concept.... Bravo!
---
Hate the scorched. Save humanity 
---
Roger!
---
This is how swbf2 players feel in a nutshell
---
Ooooh, honey.
---
That would be nice. Good suggestion.
---
Their duped items explode in their inventory! Of course!
---
Team up with some who can share rad sponge with you, Im sure there are some ppl who would be happy to help. Maybe ask in chat if you have a mic. As someone else said all you need to do is tag the ghouls no need to kill them. A good spot is on top of the bus (make sure it has blown up before hand) or the wall area by the pool. 
---
Known bug. Maybe they will fix
---
These two are a must have in my book! I hover around 100 stimpacks always, 50-100 cans of dog food and 100 waters. 
---
Pharma Farma rank 3 is always running ... I do not do drugs, but I vendor them every few days for my 1400 caps.
---
Hahahahah , fokin A :D
---
👍🏻which silo?
---
T60 for ease of repairing.  
---
How about you fucking. Shut. Up. 
---
I had alot of gameplay guessing you only played the story
---
I try to go without power armor and die so quickly and I have a decent assortment of legendary armor. Do I also need perks to travel sans PA?
---
Just search “the mire crash” dude. It’s not hard. I can’t find any recent posts. Some people about a month ago say it’s still present but nothing past that. If you’re not gonna help, please don’t comment. 
---
Absolutely not. If anyone expects perfection out of the gate you're going to be a lonely person in life. The game kicks ass. 
---
just to be clear, that's when you hit the roof? and do you throw the flare inside or up top?
---
I read that caption completely wrong
---
Yep fairly early on I lost all my junk because I was keeping it on me...not realizing that a lot of my weight was chems/ammo/food/cores. After losing all my junk I stepped back and reevaluated my inventory management strategy.
---
Not an issue anymore. I keep only what I need, and extra of the stuff I really burn through. Hardly keep much junk on me. Pack rat just really isnt that efficient compared to some of the others, and without pack rat you tend to stash your junk and keep other stuff on you that can benefit from 90% reduction...90% on fusion core weight is huge.
---
You heard it here first folks, the edgy QuantumDrej has decided he's had enough of the hate train. Shut it down guys, time to head home.
---
So I started playing Fallout 76 a week ago and love it.   
---
Yes, I see a few bugs like floating glitches. I'm sure they will be fixed.   
---
Yes, there are no NPC's. This is the thing I like the least.
---
Those are both bad, but honestly all I wanted was something like Fallout 4 with more map content. I got that. I am happy. 
---
I did play the game. That is why I wrote what I did. Your whole reply really doesn't compute given I can voice my perfectly valid complaint whenever and wherever I feel like. 
---
This doesn't make me unhappy as you assumed, but merely fills me with a sense of pride and accomplishment as my once top studio has fallen so low regarding customer support, care and satisfaction as these months proved. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I like the idea of holding workshops, but the current incarnation doesn't work for me. Not just because of the discos, but because there's no persistence there at all. Why build a workshop up at all? So I can occasionally do a tower defense against super mutants or rampaging animals/robots?
---
&gt; Ostensibly holding a workshop is so you can farm some mats, but you can usually find them quicker just exploring. 
---
They're very useful early on, when you don't have a lot of plans or materials, and the caps needed for fast traveling are scarce. You can do the tower defense events to learn plans. You can build stuff for free. You can fast travel for free. Early in the game when you're out exploring the world, being able to put down roots - however temporarily - at one of these spots without uprooting your CAMP is actually really handy. 
---
Later in the game, these largely cease to be issues, but there has to be content for players of all levels. 
---
That's not a Prime Receiver.  
---
You're thinking Scorched-Killer, which is +30% vs Scorched, -20% vs everything else.  Similarly the Zealot's Legendary trait is +30% vs Scorched, but no penalty.  
---
However the Prime Receivers are special plans that drop only from the Scorchbeast Queen.  They do an unspecified amount of extra damage to Scorched, stackable with the above two traits.  Prime Receivers require special Ultracite Ammunition, which become unlocked after learning a given Prime Plan.
---
To my knowledge, no one has posted any behind-the-scenes data on the Prime Receivers bonus damage, but I suspect they are coded like the secret Radiation immunity granted by Power Armor.  Not accessible in any datamining to date.
---
Well the obvious problem there is that explosive is doubling the damage without any additional perks. Are these actual in game numbers though? Because I've had an explosive gatling gun and it absolutely did not just arbitrarily double the damage before applying the demo expert perk. The damage was something like 20-40 higher than a normal one. 
---
Xbox, unfortunately. Sorry. 
---
Oh you mean the poor gunplay and the clunky movement controls? Yeah, good guess but I actually did play the game.
---
i’m sorry but i don’t understand
---
I just watched a couple of Saw movies I hadn't seen this weekend... This is delightful.
---
Navybluepaint is my psn name bruhv! Haha I'm new and I don't know what to do, don't hate me homie!
---
I'm sick of the idea that having fun with my friends "isn't good enough." 
---
New year's day I went to a $25 buffet style brunch. Food wasn't that great and I was hungover as shit but I didn't complain because I was there enjoying the company of my friends. 
---
Are people so Forever Alone that the thought of needing friends to enjoy something ruins everything?
---
If you like fallout and you like your friends you'll probably enjoy FO76. If you don't like fallout or you lack friends then take the opportunity to make YouTube videos crying about it so other idiots can make you money by watching.
---
At this point people are just bitching for the clicks/views/likes/whatever.
---
&gt; desperate to project your opinions

---
What if corpses with loot got highlighted when we pressed the VATS button?
---
Missiles 2lbs, mini-nukes 6 lbs, plasma cores 1lb. That is just the big ones. Grenades 0.5 lb.
---
&gt;Show me what Bethesda says and what they do that supports any of that.
---
I can't, because most of what they say is a lie. I can however, pinpoint just about a dozen things they lied about Fallout 76. but I guess their word is still good for it, huh?
---
&gt;All summed up as “my assumptions are reality.”
---
assumptions? the mechanics speak for themselves. let me sum it up for you:
---
-there's no detriment in playing alone, the game is just as enjoyable
---
-there's no content gated behind multiplayer
---
-you have to actively engage in player interaction (ie, shooting back) 
---
-otherwise you can completely ignore other players to no penalty
---
so let me ask again: how is that "multiplayer first"?
---
But it's not though. The hate is beyond well deserved. If you keep seeing hate everywhere, guess what? The game sucks. Just because youlike it, doesnt make the majority wrong lol
---
Get a life
---
Added you, btw. Ttly Kyle
---
Bro, I think people are getting upset at you because you sound like a raving lunatic in this post. Not because they disagree. You’re really getting upset and saying stuff like “I don’t give a shit about other people’s opinions”
---
When the whole point of the post is that you’re upset at Youtubers opinions. 
---
Just shotguns? No melee or heavy weps? I use a build that can do medium damage for all 3 or heavy damage from one
---
You can save blueprints, you can select which parts of the building you want stored etc. When in build mode hold E and start selecting the building parts etc you want to blueprint, you can even select just certain sections. Then you save the blueprints when it gives you the option.
---
The “hate train” is a myth thought up by the fanboys and girls as a coping mechanism. 
---
Lol I'll add you when I'm done with dinner. And don't worry we were all noobs at one point. Well get you in fighting shape soon!
---
lol this game sucks how can you play it
---
The robot arm looks interesting to me.  Add me, my IGN is WhiteNoiseMaker.  I'll be online soon.
---
I love your edits. They made my night. Oh, and I 100% agree with you.
---
Yeah it's good for that 1 meelee build, but super dangerous. At that HP in normal armor ghouls can 1 shot you. 
---
Well that's what happens when you only play the story I made plenty of decisions it the open world fallout 76 doesn't give any decision other than just not do the quest. 
---
Shotgunner skills and scattershot in str, Enforcer in agility, skeet shooter in perception.
---
He walked past my camp yesterday, my camp is near Morgantown - right where the Morgantown City Limits sign is. I rarely go back to camp but I did and he was there in front of it :)
---
Heavy weapons would be cool too. How often do you find power cores? Which guns are more accessible?
---
Those are actual numbers, yes. I'll check my TSE handmade against my TS one to check that as well but I'm pretty sure it's the same. I know my TSE is in the 500s and a regular handmade is 100 something so my guess is it's roughly the same scale
---
Tryb selling to them. There's a display bug
---
Fanboi at his finest.
---
My point and the answer to your question is that you get a bunch of damage for a half pound of carry weight and that's why people use them. No one said there aren't better fist weapons, no one said the super sledge is the best. What are you trying to prove? 
---
No, but then again I haven't bothered with a camp at all so there's that.
---
south of thunder mountain power plant. its the only thing out there right by the map border
---
But it will store the items wont it?
---
brilliant, i love it
---
Sometimes the numbers don't load try to sell something for one cap and it usually appears
---
Tell me, why are you so upset people play like this in a post apocalyptic wasteland? It really sounds like you just want a Fallout: Wasteland Sim Edition instead of what we have. 
---
May I remind you that one of the first clips we’ve seen of this game is of a player attacking another player, only to have the other player get down on his knees and have his head blown off? 
---
Come on pal, give me a good reason. You’re too busy attacking me you ain’t makin no rational sense lol 
---
I think more people know that Bethesda didn't make it than you give them credit for, but even then New Vegas was still at the time incredibly bug ridden. Sure one could argue a lot of that had to do with the engine but still. 
---
Bethesda started making Fallout with 3. The first two were made by the company that made New Vegas I believe.
---
Or just spamming "X" (on PS4) to loot shit from a pile of ghouls in case i get d/c'd and the game decides to interpret that input as a long press of "X"......*tick-tick-tick-ti-ti-ti-ti-tick-tick*
---
They already make you spend so many perks points on weight reduction for this and weight reduction for that just to be able carry a halfway respectable stock of all the diverse supplies that you need that when you finally get around to the perks that actually affect your damage it just makes the auto/semi-auto perk split seem all the more obnoxious and pointless.
---
Games that are way wirse than FO76
---
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 
---
Big Rigs
---
Hong Kong 97
---
No there is a legit way to actually just make blueprints, and then you save the blue prints. It does not store the items
---
Hey, they tried to rip me off, fortunately I saw it coming and bought RDR2 instead. 😊 
---
  If theyre trying to go the cheap route, they should just update new vegas with new graphics and keep everything the same story wise. Theyd sell a lot more of those
---
Not if you manually make a blueprint 
---
Also baffling to watch are the non-PA players trying to melee the Queen.
---
I don't really think you are supposed to drink that are you? It smells so much I didn't really have to think about it too hard.
---
I like it, however it sounds like a bear to organize. Have to have plenty of trustworthy protection if you wanted to include junk for sale.

I'm not trying prove, anything... Relax?

I'm not wven arguing with you. I understand your explanation. I'm simply telling you my opinion on the Super Sledge, since we were talking about it.
---
Nice one! The radiation emitters look cool when they go off too
---
My quad automatic ultracite laser rifle has a mag of 108 and i can empty it a good ten times or more without repair. So I think its durability is working right. 
---
I admire your work. 
---
I'm fine with people attacking me if I'm taking over a workshop or something, though I wouldn't want to be randomly attacked all the time by OP players. But then I don't really play pvp games. 
---
Like I said though, hasn't been an issue for me for whatever reason. I don't really take over workshops too much though, and I'm usually with my friend if I do.
---
The really early questline is easy to solo and introduces you to a lot of basic stuff like boiling water and crafting, just follow the Responders quests until you've done all the stuff in Flatwoods.
---
Thats horrible in the best way, if you left my loot so i could get it back im fine with it. You put a lot of work into that, its really creative.
---
Thanks  Sebby! Lol true true, all beginners at one point.
---
What paint is that for the X-01?
---
I mentioned the same thing.  
---

---
That is the action of a sociopath, when they take in game acts of violence and destruction off line to taunt others, clearly they have issues. Without knowing obviously but we may be reading about them in the news after a murder or mass shooting.
---
I don't use plasma cores I mainly use a gatling gun and a 50 cal because they do mad damage with the perks as long as they're two shot. That being said in my time of playing I've only found 8 plasma cores. Fusion cores on the other hand can be very easily farmed. Ballistic weapons regardless of type are the most accessible because they're found everywhere meanwhile energy and plasma are more rare
---
It might slow it down, not being able to duplicate 5k every run and only being able to duplicate up to a set amount they would still need a few characters to pull the amounts we see off. 
---
Instead of using 2 characters to hold the gear and such you'd need a few more. Maybe?
---
I believe x01 has better energy res too
---
Seek help 
---
Will add you mate, and fuck yeah I will take you up on that offer. Thankyee! Thus game really isn't that bad. I'm having fun honestly.
---
I’m betting there’s throngs of people server hopping and buying them up....
---
lol you're not wrong about that... but I'm kinda hoping the whole MMO thing will inspire better patches. time will tell I guess 
---
Avoid any quest until at least 50 so that the quest rewards are at lv 50
---
Yeah there's definitely something fucky going on there because the TS alone is somehow doing 19 more than twice the base. The math doesn't add up. 
---
&gt; So add in a few new laser rifles with increased rarity akin to lever and handmade, and make those the top end laser rifles that are competitive with their ballistic counterparts.
---
We could even add a ***Non-Shitty-***______ prefix to them to add to the prestige!
---
Sometimes, being shamed into realizing you made a dumb decision is a good thing.
---
You’re one sick puppy.  You may not be the hero the wasteland needs but your the one it deserves.   Cheers mate.  PS which platform are you so I know not to look for free plans and chems.  
---
I'll repeat.....lazy ....mission.... design.... You can literally walk an inch in a direction outside of mission bounds and it's mission failed. I have played RDR2 more than "just the story" which you for some moronic reason keep repeating. And your "decisions in the open world are fucking greet and antagonize. Give me a break.
---
Honestly the game is fun in my opinion. What killed it for me was the duped guns, i could live with everything wrong with the game honestly. The fucked fences in building, the game crashing, hell even the storage cap problem weren’t that bad tbh. But when everyone  including level 20s with a TSE gun of any kind and were able to kill anything just by smelling the enemy. That ruined it for me. 
---
If people don’t like the game they don’t like it and in a perfect world people could dislike something and not throw their 69696969 cents into it like a fucking child. 
---
Also before someone says “you haven’t played the game at all then” i have 400 *estimated hours on the game. 
---
Bottom line. i eat ass, hit me up.
---
Thanks man. How can you farm them?
---
I hope your adventures yield to experiences more tailored to your tastes. 
---
But be warned, there are players like me out there. And not to be confused as griefers, like somebody who will keep following you and keep trying to kill you, but somebody who wants a challenge and will try to fight you to see what you’re made of. 
---
At least for me there’s a bit of honor in challenging other players. I just wanna fight something other than a robot. I’m only level 62 and I’ve been playing since beta. I can hold my own against players who are 100+. 
---
hehe someone amgey
---
Ooops it should be 258
---
That post isn't even making fun of Fallout 76 though. If it's making fun of any specific game, then it's actually Skyrim since it's making fun of the intro to the game and then it makes a quick jab at how ALL of Bethesdas games are very glitchy and all of their current console games have the same main menu and same style of loading screens.
---
It really is getting to be a joke on ps4 right now. Can't even kill a cargobot without the game crashing and cucking my team out of 3 launch cards
---
There is indeed an actual bug like that, the map I saw of it was north of Harper’s along 65, I think.
---
Then onselling them on reddit :/
---
Yo i enjoy this game however  Bethesda hoed us hard in this game i want to love this game cus me and my buddy are playing the shit out of it but god damn if these crashes, bugs, etc arent bothersome af i understand all the shit this game is getting me and my buddy are constantly talking how dogshit this game is all the while playing it 
---
I seriously agree. It’s not game of the year material, but it’s nowhere near as bad as like everyone says it is anymore.
---
Gotta grief the other players of course!
---
i managed to luck into a jetpack, im on day 4 of looking for shocks though (bout 3 hours each try)
---
Sorry bud..  The game is awful. 
---
And actually, if we can find you a level 1 hazmat suit, or if you can get to level 10 before I get back on, me and a buddy are gonna launch a nuke to level him up as well. So we can level you up as well!
---
When did I say this is an MMO? Are you starting to make things up now? 😂😂😂
---
You know, for it to be an MMO, it lacks one crucial thing... the *massive* part. 24 players per server doesn't quite cut it.
---
Yup, keep thinking this is mainly singleplayer, I don't care. Enjoy!
---
Just the same way as this game was designed to be multiplayer? Wow, one could think that people got the hint when they said "no human NPCs, we want **players** to be the main content"; "the **players** are the interesting part of this game". Yup. It was designed to be mainly single-player. Totally. 
---
I repeat: good thing this isn't an MMO then. *shrug*
---
Sorry that you still fail to understand that a transaction between parties, no matter the currency, product or service used *becomes* market. 
---
Oh, single-player games can have economies? But, but... why FO76 doesn't? I thought that according to you, this was mainly a single-player game? 
---
This is getting ridiculous.
---
Hopefully, you'll use this as a lesson and won't buy any game from any publisher until AFTER you assess it's launch state.
---
Mostly just run around and kill stuff. I use many different weapons daily to keep stuff fresh.
---
What if repairing isn’t an issue? 
---
Just checked handmade. With all perks: TS: 186. TSE: 561
---
i haven’t gotten anything, try adding me? 
---
How would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Me(Turtle ) and Shia spend a few hours exploring the game almost every night , though it sometimes take longer to work out a idea based on places we have visited then for Shia to paint and draw it . 
---
X01 as ultracite requires nuke materials. But all work. 
---
#DICKSOUTFORCARLOS
---
To be be fair a jack of all trades isn't really a build it's more of just playing the game with anything. Prob gonna get down voted 
---
Where did you move to?
---
I suspect some of the challenges are glitched as well. I know "fully rank up perk cards" shows 0/7 for me and I have several fully ranked. Just saw a screenshot today from a 100+ level player and that showed 0/7 too.
---
Yea speeds have got better, but you also have more devices utlizing that data bandwidth. Depending in how many people in your household, you have a mobile device for each person, multiple set top boxes, multiple pcs and tablets.
---
If a device has pulled an ip address and the lease is still active, most routers will have set aside a chunk of bandwidth for that device, no matter if its using it or not, if the device is plugged in its probably keeping its lease updated.
---
So in my situation I have 100mb, there are 3 cellphones utilizing the wifi, minimum 3 to 5 pcs running, 2 consoles, 2 set top boxes, a pair of laptops, one isnt used much, and a couple pi's. So roughly 12 devices have leases at all times, so my 100mb connection is down to 8mb per device if all things are even, but they arent quite. If you have 20mb and 10 devices your down to 2mb per device.
---
Your internet speed is not affected by more users in a client/server situation, your device communicates with the server, not directly with other users. Your speed sets how fast the server and your device can communicate. More players taxes the server more, but not your connection to the server. Reasearch client to peer and peer to peer connections/relationships and their differences, you will understand what im talking about. 
---
If you understood better about how console patches and updates work, you would understand that to replace/add code you dont just add a snippet and recompile. In consoles you have to swap whole cells/chunks of code as we dont have a decomplier/recompiler app. The pc update was the actual size of the update. Your crying about the patch being too big, and im just happy they are patching, its not like it cost you any more to get a bigger patch?
---
And the engine runs pretty good for its age, I mean they took something that was never built with multiplayer in mind and made it work. Many automakers have also been using the same engine block for years, and tweaking it as time goes on and you dont see car guru's crying over this fact?
---
If you actually read my comment, there wasnt much sugar coating, I called it a diamond in the rough, not the greatest thing since sliced toast. I noted it had multiple bugs and disconnects being a big issue? What more is there to acknowledge?
---
Maybe you should try the game instead of regurgitating what your favorite youtuber has told you to think, I mean 34 slots in a server, have you ever even logged in? And im not defending them and their practices, but im not getting my pitchfork out ready to rage every time somebody gets their feelers hurt. And improve? They've done that every week since launch, ya there not perfect. But they are learning and most importantly they are trying, give em the time they need and it will get better.
---
Wait there is more to youtube that car crash videos?!?!
---
I get level 50 gear from the miners. It's usually crap, but it does drop. 
---
Tried looking for over 24hrs of game time and them some.
---
Gave up then weeks later a friend who already had brought them himself at the launch we brought them for me.
---
Correct!. I dislike how explosive has nullified other guns. However if you look at the post more I didn't highlight and damage perks, mostly utility. Thats the idea of jack of all trades. Be good in most scenarios.
---
Unpopular opinion, communities are the worst part of literally any game.  Bethesda just has a bigger more well known franchise and unfortunately some better iterations in the franchise behind it.
---
This is the way of things though, it could almost be a math formulae.
---
New game fan-base = ( "last game was better" * "this new game is worst yet!" ) / Hype-train
---
It's world of Warcraft expansion syndrome.
---
The only difference is '76 is this new terrifying direction for the franchise.
---
Sure, some could argue that "project vault 13" would have been the first online fallout.  But I honestly do not believe that people would pay to play an isometric view online version of fallout 1-2 if it came out of Bethesda after them releasing 3, 4. (I didn't include NV here because I know the comments will be "Ugh that was made by obsidian!")
---
Wow come on, every list I’ve seen goes into explicit detail why fo76 is bad. Specifically because their trying to dispel talk like this thinking their just on the hate train. It’s a very poorly executed game by Bethesda, why can’t people just hold them accountable.
---
Hit me up man 
---
As head if the NDA, I commend your actions. The NDA endorses modern solutions to modern problems. After all, most players are no better than common settlers and deserve to die. The NDA commends your actions.
---
Getting nuked for one stray bullet? No thanks
---
*I didn't knoooow the gun was loaded and I'm soooo sorry my friend!*
---
I’d assume you’d have a higher chance. If not, maybe the chance is the same but it’s better mod? 
---
That’s a good question, I’m curious how that would work. 
---
Or interested in this question too. Are there any mods that are only unlocked with higher level armor? 
---
I'm assuming that's including demo expert? 
---
[lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ado58j/_/?st=JQN3BGK2&amp;sh=3f9531da) 
---
An extremely childish and cringy rant, yes.
---
Because Bethesda is a big company that should've known better but chose to try and milk xmas. Also FO4 was a flop so everyone expected them to try and make amends for that. I'm glad people are shitting on a game that deserves it, maybe Bethesda will start making good games again
---
Game is bad. THE END
---
You cannot drop any item with an Atom store paint job on it, it warns you beforehand that it will destroy it, if you do. I assume the Camo paint job was bought in the Atom store. The x01 head probably was painted as well, thus it destroyed the whole thing. 
---
This is to prevent 1 person from making 100's of painted power armors and passing them out, when people could buy the paint jobs with real money/atoms. 
---
There's a level 1 hazmat suit on top of Poseidon Power Plant, or that one from the first Harper's Ferry quest that has you investigate the town.
---
As a content creator I cannot make fallout 76 videos without getting backlash from people. 
---
In my opinion fallout is glitchy at times yes but the game is so well made, learning to pipboy weapon/armor switch mid battle or correct vats usage is one of the most thrilling experiences to date in a fallout game. 
---
I want all of this fallout hate to stop. The only thing it's good for is gaining quick views and upvotes and it is truly getting annoying seeing and hearing all of this negativity over a fun game.
---
It is! Better Perk Loadout i think its called. Super handy. I mostly only use it for crafting now. Swap out 30 perks at once is just the biggest quality of life thing i can find.
---
No
---
1. Explosive damage already ignores any and all kinds of DR other than universal damage modifiers and those given by cushioned/dense.
---
2. Baliistic weapons already have dog shit penetration compared to melee so why make it even more dog shit?
---
Ha
---
He looks like you hit him in the head with a barbed baseball bat name Lucille.
---
every try Shadow of War got it for 12 bucks and god damn is it endless fun 
---
Have you tried going to a different area when this happens? Is it all over the map or just one small area? Like others have said I would try removing the game, clearing out your cache and reinstalling. I assume other games play perfectly fine so it's not like the console or hard drive are dying? 
---
Haha it’s hard to say, I’ve bought sweet legendaries for less than 100 caps before, but then had people try to charge 5000 for stuff. How does 800 sound? 
---
I'll post one of them here, hopefully the Bethesda folks know about this one too:
---
Okay, first of all you need Cheat Engine loaded up and installed. Having it running in the background triggers a server-side switch that will make this process easier. It helps (But isn't required) to have a 'lag switch' that will let you force a disconnect.
---
Then you have to craft a huge number of items - around 300 or so. The server will limit you to 250, so you can get around this by handing off some to a friend. Once you've made the 300 items, store them in an object in the world. Then quickly take them and place the item you want to dupe in the container, and hit your lag switch. When you disconnect and log back in, you'll have both the 300 items AND the item you put in the container - but a duplicate of the item will be in the container.
---
You don't have to install cheat engine though it is helpful, once you have 300 boards just make your friend trade you anything for more than 0 caps and you'll be disconnected.
---
Had 3 now (jetpacks), used old, sold one and have another spare, all while looking for 2nd shock.
---
Also got Stealth Boy on my spare Blackbird Torso (seemed fitting)..... so they do exist, keep trying.
---
Yup. I am able to insta kill literally everything except scorchbeasts. Just gotta find the fun around it.
---
Sounds like you watch shitty youtubers or read too much gaming content. 
---
Just so you don't end up spending time hunting for it, travel agent is actually a lv 26 charisma perk.
---
Bethesda makes billions on the shelf life of their games. Fallout 76 is not some indie crowd funded passion project. They want that sweet live service steady revenue that’s all the rage now. They’re counting on, at the very least, a small but dedicated, and therefore reliably exploited, player base to stick around and create and inflate the value of something where they put the absolute minimal effort into quality control. I’m not even talking about fo76, I’m talking about any Bethesda game. They get away with it every release because some players will shout down anyone trying to complain, even though *that’s entirely against your own self interest as a customer.*
---
If people don’t bitch loud enough for everyone else to hear (and therefore steer clear of the purchase), then large developers will take your silence as a success, and will continue those practices for as long as they can get away with it.
---
*Now* I’m talking about fo76, because only now has the player base proven they’re fed up with the Bethesda business model and how it blatantly takes your money and then takes a shit on everyone’s patience and intelligence as a thank you.
---
You want better games, at this level of business, bitching is the only thing that rolls back bad behavior (not forever). You can’t expect everything perfect, sure. But you definitely can’t expect it to be better by silently “voting with your dollars.”
---
❤️❤️❤️
---
He ended up coming back after a few different server hops! I was so happy. And he seems to be here to stay. He’s a “sluggish” diseased megasloth so thankfully he’s chill. 
---
I was working on my Power Armor and I heard explosions in the front of my camp. Someone was shooting him, and he still didn’t attack. Thankfully I was able to get out and tell the guy he’s cool
---
Not to mention it's obvious that we are talking about communicating with us which he is choosing to ignore to make a nitpicking argument 
---
That is awesome!  
---
I was thinking a group would be about 3-4 people, that way the group can remain organised, have a decent amount of firepower and there wouldn't be too many voices trying to butt in at once in trying to make decisions. And only one person would sell junk at once, that way if that person is killed, they have 3 people to keep an eye on their body while they come back to retrieve their belongings. 
---
I was just havin a giggle mate
---
Works for all med containers. Aid and chem boxes, bathroom mirrors, and doctors bags. Also it may take a second so wait for the "X" (or whatever is the search button) to disappear.
---
And anecdotally, Disease Cures do seem to pop up as the extra loot quite a lot.
---
Oh! the dupe feature patches. Good stuff. 
---
And thats your problem right there " We expected a lot more ".. if you go into a game expecting the perfect game you are going to be in for a rude awakening.. like i think RDR2 multiplayer sucks FAR more then fo76
---
Yes. What's interesting, is the second shot of 2 shot is based on a standard receiver. Standard receiver is 83 and hardened is 103
---
This isn't a new issue. Fallout 3, Oblivion, Skyrim, they all had bad issues and they haven't done their job to fix it; instead, they left it up to the community to fix their problems. ES6 will have the same issues. They need an EA amount of bad rep, because they don't seem to understand that their products aren't up to standards. FO76 was just the resounding gong of their sloppy dev work.
---
Oh. I've never bought one, I had no idea. Thank you for the info
---
This deserves to be on the top you sadist 
---
hmm an indie developer with a massive rpg game that kicks ass after a few years vs a AAA game studio who literally have said they were working on their rpg since FO4 back in 2015
---
Agreed. Whitesprings during a nuclear blast. Make sure there’s tons of other players. 
---
Get yourself as many Molotov cocktails (easy to get crafting recipe and components) and play in pacifist mode.  You’ll be able to tag a bunch of glowing ones for XP and legendary loot with each throw from a distance. It’s my experience the most kills are next to the tennis court. 
---
If you don’t have power armor, get a good hazmat suit and as much healing salve as you can craft. 
---
Get the perks: 
---
Glow sight (S) - extra damage on glowing
---
Butchers bounty (P) - extra meat to craft for healing 
---
Fire in the hole (P) - sighted throwing (not the best though)
---
Green Thumb - double crafting flora 
---
Super duper (L) - bonus crafting goodies. 
---
Serendipity (L) - helps you evade some damage when you’re just trying to buzz out 
---
I’m sure there’s more but I leveled up pretty quickly once I had most of these set up. 
---
Welcome to bandwagon and internet culture.
---
The American one from the Atom store
---
The economy is broken, the weapons are not balance correctly (who uses a plasma or laser rifle?).
---
The only thing that can be done now is to balance the weapons correctly, then raise the maximum lvl to 60 and then lvl55 or 60 legendaries would become the meta. Bethesda have to ensure that no more duping happens, not sure they can tho.  A day later after the last patch there was a new dupe.
---
I've been playing since beta too, though I'm probably not much of a challenge since I never pvp, lol. I understand why people would want that though.
---
THIS IS AMAZING -Lord Shaxx
---
You’re bitching about bitching. How ironic.
---
With the build you can see in the video I run nuke zones just in a hazmat suit. It does cost me some stimpacks, but it's pretty easy going.
---
Jesus Christ dude, if you're so mad about this issue, stay off gaming forums for a whole. Hell, do that anyway, ain't nobodies life was ever improved by talking to anonymous jackasses about videogames. A big company that sells popular games released a big turd and it's rare for something to be so universally panned and be such a common punching bag. You may feel that people shitting on the game hampers your enjoyment of the game, but your enjoyment of the game hampers people's schadenfreude -- both sides have to just Deal With It.
---
It's a fucking game.  Relax, jerk-off, and then re-evaluate your priorities.
---
Companies care about their bottom line. A bunch of negative press hurts their stock price, and thereby the company. If we want this absurd BS to stop, you have to hit them in their wallets. If the board see's a drop in stock, they'll stop doing these anti-consumer practices.
---
So, you're free to not listen. Rest of the industry is free to try to make things better.
---
And yet i  hardly hear anyone angry shouts or memes/hate group talking about the Pure cancer that is RDR2 MP.. P2W as hell.. or is that acceptable now from people these days
---
Ticket time I think....
---
Don't think you can drop nukes in Skyrim lol
---
Honestly, the lack of a MP "idle with basic functions but very nerfed" mode, sort of like MP co-op worked in Left 4 Dead when a player dropped or idled, is one reason I don't play more.  Before my spouse and I met, she was in a lengthy relationship with a true WoW addict (and other sorts of addictions too, it turned out) who would use the game as an excuse to default on doing his share.  I of course do not do this, but it triggers bad feelings on both our parts, so unless I feel sure I can drop quickly or hide safely while handling household tasks for 10-15 minutes, I don't log in.  The long time it can take servers to pick up is part of this, too.  I only occasionally work cooperatively as a result--and never in a group of more than two or three.  There's just not enough flex time for me.
---
That said, she found my Dr. Girlfriend-esque secondary character pretty funny.  In co-op, I coarsely demand to be given all cigarettes found, because I wish to eat them.  I'm only sad not to have the Jackie Kennedy pink dress and pillbox hat, really.  Hell yea, dollhouse game!
---
&gt;When did I say this is an MMO? Are you starting to make things up now?
---
I just assumed since you're convinced online = multiplayer. it's even worse then, because you want to nerf a mechanic in a game that's not even a mmo.
---
&gt;Yup, keep thinking this is mainly singleplayer, I don't care. Enjoy!
---
it's a fact, so I will.
---
&gt;Just the same way as this game was designed to be multiplayer?
---
if it was, then there'd be some detriment to going solo. like "playing" Overwatch "solo". there isn't. the game is 100% just as enjoyable.
---
&gt;Wow, one could think that people got the hint when they said [...]
---
they also said canvas bag.
---
&gt;Sorry that you still fail to understand that a transaction between parties, no matter the currency, product or service used becomes market.
---
and there's the dictionary definition again. good on you for being able to look up "market" on the saurus. doesn't change the *fact* that a market, by mmo standards, means items for cash. **period**.
---
&gt;Oh, single-player games can have economies?
---
if they're always online. Diablo 3 had an economy, even though it backfired, long before multiplayer was added to it.
---
&gt;But, but... why FO76 doesn't? I thought that according to you, this was mainly a single-player game?
---
first, being singleplayer doesn't necessarily means the game will have a market. that's a baseless notion, your question doesn't make sense.
---
second, I know you're just being cheeky. what I said was that, in my opinion, the game shouldn't have a market at all because it doesn't have to be always online. we've been over this, remember?
---
Agreed, it's been quite rough. Caught some people in the act of duping and exploiting not long after the server crashed so that's awesome. 
---
This is an excellent thought.  Does higher level continue to affect multipliers?  I though the SPECIALS, perks, weapon bonuses and buffs were the only calculated damage rules.  
---
Other games do play fine. I play comp Overwatch daily with no issues.
---
The texture issue isn’t the whole map, as you can see in the video things in the distance have loaded just fine, but it is no exclusive to this area. If I manage to get a long play session this issue will happen in multiple areas through my gameplay. (I have videos of it happening consistently for over an hour). I don’t know about the redownload advice because some people seem to have similar experiences (although it’s definitely not the norm). I’d like a Bethesda response but I guess that’s asking for too much.
---
I’ll probably redownload the game sometime soon when another invisible enemy kills me and I rage quit lol.
---
fyi just bought these

Collect all the Korok seeds, get a golden turd.
---
That's Flatwoods, not Grafton, Grafton is huge...
---
Amazing lmao
---
Yea, find a hazmat suit for your level and we'll get you in a nuke with us
---
Isn’t that the flatwoods monster?
---
Are you farming the queen repeatedly?  If not you're probably not seeing as many imo.
---
Try a harpoon with flechette. It’s basically a heavy shotgun.  Couple that with stabilized and one gun army for extra zazz 
---
Vats pistol builds arent that bad, with proper set up, you can fill a crit meter in three shots, have tons of action points, and refill your ap bar fast or instantly if you are lucky with grim reaper’s sprint
---
Hope you enjoy the piece :) 
---
\*5th crash in the last 20 minutes\*
---
Don’t care if there aren’t consequences after a nuclear fallout 
---
No luck :( Guess I'll come back to it later this week. 
---
I think I've seen a nuke drop on somewhere that wasn't there or whitesprings maybe 3 times ever.
---
This is literally the greatest FO76 story I've seen to date. 
---
You still playing? I’m a solo player, level 23 but can’t get into the game because I have no one to play with 
---
Couldn't they just destroy the building?
---
You just said you don't give a shit about people's opinions then proceed to share yours by directly replying to me?  You see the problem here?  
---
I also understand why people wouldn’t want it. To each their own. Ultimately what we have isn’t ideal, and it could be better for both parties. Some say a separate pvp server will do, and I agree. Thank you for communicating, after all the shot I got today I’m happy some folks out there still have some rationality. 
---
Yeah I've heard two shot does some weird stuff like that sometimes.
---
But yeah that would make sense then, it sounds like they made the explosion just deal the damage of the weapon so it's "doubling" because you've got the ballistic damage from the projectile and the damage from the explosion. This is backed up by explosive + demo expert being a ~3x damage increase instead of a 4x. It only effects the explosive portion of the damage.
---
Honestly that needs to be fixed before they start moving legendary effects around. Idk why they didn't just keep the FO4 system of the explosion doing some set extra damage, instead of the entire damage of the projectile, or they should make it some percentage. 
---
HAHAHAHA. I love it. You probably killed all your Sims when you were a kid didn’t you. Take off the pool ladder and whatnot. Don’t deny it.
---
An explosive gun will 100% kill you if you shoot something too close. I kill myself at least once a day, if not more. Usually with gunfu targeting.
---
A TSE 50 cal should do extremely well against the queen. I'm finding these days that most people are doing relevant damage to her. Killed her yesterday in under 3 minutes with mostly heavy gunners shooting her.
---
Those are probably your best mutations to prioritize first. Buying them is by far the safest way to get them. Eagle eyes is super nice for crit damage. Bird Bones is nifty too.
---
I have a minor correction: Prime plans are acquired from the queen and other scorchbeasts. I hunt scorchbeasts and very often come across a plan from killing one. The queen is guaranteed, while a normal scorchbeast is rare.
---
I forgot where it was, but I found some large water purifiers at a shack that only needs power. 
---
I like to set up my basic CAMP by the crossroads next to whitesprings station. Mainly because I want to share my crafting tables. I added neon lights, blinking lights and strobes. You can’t miss it. 
---
Same mate 
---
Yeah, the unpauseability (and lack of a Left 4 Dead style 'idle but keep up, operating at very diminished power' AFK system) is a reason I don't play more.  I'd just drop in and out, but the servers take so very freaking long to connect, and too many quests require time investment (assuming the server doesn't crap the bed and fall over anyway).  
---
Taggerdy's Thunder (the charter members of the Appalachian BoS) was a unit of US Army Rangers, part of the 75th Ranger Regiment (as per their unit logo, used primarily in Camp Venture).
---
This post is a good r/copypasta
---
I Honestly skipped RDR2 until they remove P2W from their MP..its why i didnt get on my ps4 to play it and also fallout 76 has its problems but like a old boat it still keeps on ticking that will get better over time.
---
Just got them today - in the same boat with flux.
---
Had a 2 shot auto pipe rifle....
---
Fuck. Wait, maybe theres a mod for that. Haha. 
---
Ah. Brainfart. Blast zone in white springs please. 
---
There's still a good amount of twitch streamers playing the game who have a lot of fun. Watching a few convinced me to play and I'll say I've had fun so far. I'm only a level 22 but still it's not a bad game, not perfect though. A fun thing I like to do to shed weight is to give ammo, spare meds, and plans to players leaving the vault. It definitely gives you a good feeling helping out new players. You can tell most appreciate it
---
Ok all those are total BS. I've never heard of those before. I don't really spend a lot of time on YouTube or gaming sites. They are mostly worthless.
---
I much prefer word of mouth. Gaming message boards and reddit for example. The things I read on this sub are definitely valid. 
---
more like r/bethesdabootlickers
---
Nice try Todd
---
as a man who DID work for Blizzard Bethesda needs to get their shit together
---
Why didn't Bethesda see this coming, it's a known issue in similar franchises?
---
Hell yes, love it.
---
And do I count TWELVE flamer turrets?  
---
Speaking of glowing ones, do they still count as ghouls for the extra damage perk on legendary weapons?
---
Same question for scorchbeasts and Scorch buff  weapons. 
---
Theres power armors all over the map that can be world hopped for them. Collect about 8 or so and then load the lower power fusion cores into your power armor. Get into the armor and then server hop. This will refill the core that's currently in your armor. Repeat this for all cores and you'll have a bunch of full fusion cores
---
Wanna head down to the winchester and have a pint and wait for all this to blow over?
---
None, will have been scrapped for steal while crafting or questing, done it myself...
---
You sound like you are very new to the internet...
---
Also, how can you make a post like the one you posted here and then say, " I don't give a shit about people's opinions, to be honest. "
---
It sounds to me like you got absurdly emotional about this and now you're trying to play it cool, like you never made a cringeworthy rant about youtubers hating a game you like...
---
There's no capacitor that increases damage but you should always take anything with armour piercing like perforating capacitors I always take Armour pericing over mag size increases
---
Yes!!  I got bored with Fallout after leveling up to 60 and launching a nuke. So I bought Skyrim Special Edition on a whim to fill the void.  I had last played it on ps3 on a 720p TV 5 years ago. Seeing the special edition on a ps4, modded, in 4k  was INSANE!! My God was that a masterpiece!! Bethesda is capable of such incredible things!!!
---
This pretty much
---
Yeah man the media is a very negative place for games like the right now 🙁
---
Likely you repaired something and the mod was broken down into scrap, it's a known "feature" no player wants that Bethesda hasn't addressed yet. If that's what happened there's not much recourse
---
Then I don’t give a shit about your opinion. Get over yourself.
---
Nope that's the thing w no head.
---
This was an alien w no legs flying on a rocket. The rocket was its legs.
---
I took the SS on my Xbox so not sure how to share it here. 
---
You can accidentally scrap mods if you are crafting and are low on whatever materials it is made from
---
People screamed about that shit constantly man
---
i actually enjoy the game, feels like i’m the only one tho tbh
---
He raped a few people in that game, Pretty Sarah in Westside was also one of them.
---
Hmm, I must have miss-counted then.
---
Yes.
---
Ruthless
---
Idk this game’s pretty bad dude lol. I’m over level 200 and I think it’s still very deserving of a bad rep. The only reason I played for that long was because I’m a Fallout fan, and was hoping there was still something about this game. 
---
There really isn’t. I was just addicted to the level grind, Everyone’s probably heard the rants that’s it a rip-off modern day survival game clone, with elements of Fallout pasted on, but that literally is what this game is. A still broken mess. 
---
I’m well aware Bethesda’s doing a good job at patching bugs, but this game has really bad core problems that can’t just be fixed with these small hotfixes, such as the entire endgame lol, the junk looting gameplay loop, there being less than a handful of interesting quests, the map feeling pretty shallow, the list can go on. 
---
This game definitely could’ve been great with more time, I just don’t know how they can fix it now without a massive expansion or overhaul to the game
---
Could be a bug or exploit, yes.  Negative for your other questions.  First encounter he took her workshop, second was open world. 
---
i got a 3 star auto pipe rifle and a 3 star bolt action pipe rilfe
---
I was sort of meh about the game. Maybe I'm the wrong person to even be a part of a gaming community. I'm disappointed about what happened, but I've never been able to work myself up into a frothing rage about it. If anything, I'm confused as to why Bethesda, Blizzard, and other publishers are taking such an anti-player stance when it comes to their games.
---
76 gets the hate it does because it's a game with major problems from a major publisher that should have known better than to release a game so early in development at full price with so many bugs, on an engine not suited for multiplayer. I had fun, but I do see the problems.
---
And at the same time, its irritating to hear "hue 76 sux" on every media channel you partake in even when you're discussing another game entirely. 
---
Yeah Flatwoods - glowing purple dude. I took a picture when I killed one.
---
The achievement I got was something like “6 different creature types” and I thought “huh, what is that one ... alien?” But never checked.
---
This is awesome
---

---
Also here's that build. With this SPECIAL set up you'll be able to switch between shotguns heavy weapons and melee while also being able to switch to use all the crafting perks
---
Fuck right off with your bullshit rant post. You know what's exhausting? People like you that play,pay and continue to support scumbags like Bethesda, period end of discussion. The game is a heaping pile or shit. (Not all the Bethesda employees but most definitely the higher ups)
---
might try that for the next go round.
---
I had shocks...but lost them due to repairs breaking down mods instead of all the bulk stuff. I am the sad.
---
We bitched hard enough Warner bros removed micro transactions in shadow of war
---
which can be changed to semi, and pistols
---
Nope, you have it backwards, Google it :-)
---
What level are you 
---
No. See my other comment. 
---
I wish I knew. Check the FO wikia. I was past level 40 before I learned about the plan cap. 
---
Hey, come over to r/fo76filthycasuals. It's just a group of people who casually enjoy the game as it is. The complaints are all followed with a /s
---
Or your game glitched the name... we ain't lying :-)
---
Well, only if the effect stacks.  Does it?  If it does then dupers own the game field. 
---
Do you expect to see that here on this sub? A fallout one? 
---
Yeah it's cool that raiders respawn permanently around you and can dc when they have had their fix. super cool i'll just use my imagination and pretend these are world warping immortal griefers. You are roaming dicks in a terribly made bounty system barely rewarding "raiders" for actually looting and there is zero incentive to hunt bounties if they don't just disconnect on the spot.
---
Destiny 2 hater hop
---
The brotherhood of steel will soo kill you for this.... 
---
Yeah have done that. Fingers crossed but I do not hold out any hope whatsoever. 
---
109. Absolutely no reason I need a camp, everything I need is out there.
---
Only ever seen one disconnect on Xbox 1 in all my time playing
---
Lost last few scorch queens, come back in to cranberry bog low on supplies and ammo. Always an adventure. 
---
Exactly,made me so annoyed that I stopped playing 76 and went back to skyrim
---
Just don't watch their videos. You don't need validation for spending money on this game. You don't need to defend enjoying this game. 
---
Todd Howard killed my family and is now trying to wrestle me into a canvas bag. HELP
---
It was this guy
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Flatwoods_monster#Mythical_Flatwoods_monster
---
Ah awesome, just wanted to be sure bolt actions were there.
---
Do both of them count as pistols and rifles or just the bolt action?
---
People are sheep enough said
---
Returrrrrn the slaaaaaaab.
---
Yeah flatwoods monster, grafton monster has no head and looks like a hairless gorilla on steroids 
---
Try buying a small junk item, often that will reset their caps so you can sell.. Also they seem to reset about 24 hours after you sell to them. 
---
heres a interactive map i found and use online for camp resource locations and workshops.  https://fo76map.com/
---
So after that long are you bored or are you still enjoying it? 
---
I’ve had my eye on this game but I have heard a lot of bad things about it and as I’m new to multiplayer (I’m an avid single player gamer) I have been unsure whether to buy this or wait a while until I know more. 
---
I *loved* fallout 4 but have the 0kb bug and can’t play it now, so I really want 76 but I can’t tell if it’s good or not as I see so much complaining but you have tipped me towards the “buy it” end of the scale! :)
---
I have that pretty much all the time. Apparently they reset every 24 hours but I honestly doubt it. The 200 caps limit makes no sense. At all.  
---
I just looked and I can't find it.
---
I thought it said... "kill something out of this world" but not at all sure. 
---
They were vague about the whole fucking game pre launch.
---
i have a 50% fall damage chest and 50% fall damage left arm and i can jump from whatever i want and not die
---
DAM IT. I meant FLATWOODS. lol just realized I wrote Grafton in title. 
---
You really think that they wouldn't bring CAMP faction related stuff with it?
---
My fist build is similar. I had a guy puke animate in front of me before.
---
Sure, the first round is on me 
---
Brave thing to admit in this post.
---
Oh yea of course I used to have a blast playing sea of thieves with my friends. Those types of games are what you make out of them.
---
Congrats, remember my first one vividly!
---
Next you'll be taking on 4 lvl 80's in no time flat...
---
Driving it into complete failure is a total fuck you to your fellow gamers just as much as it is to the developer.  Some of us want the game to succeed because we are having fun playing it.  If people continually bash the game long after the game starts repairing its broken bits it will never be able to recover.  At a certain point the constant bashing of the game does more harm than good especially when a lot of the bashing is just that with zero criticism directed towards improving and simply shitting on the game.  I agree the game deserves the negative reviews it recieved it however does not need a constant barrage of bull shit some of it being false or outdated information.
---
If you are farming for Power Armor there are several locations around there, from Point Pleasant all the way north. I actually didn't see a lot of it until I was doing that. 
---
The WV mill has a bunch of low-level super mutants and some decent loot around as well.
---
Several good junk sites that are on the river for building CAMP. Sucks for fast travel though, it's too close to vault 76 and not close to anything else. If you are sticking to the forest it's not bad though.
---
Nm I just realized I typod the name it title and it was throwing me off. I did mean to put flatwoods
---
We haven't seen a patch in pretty much a month I really wouldn't be expecting much from this team to be fixing stuff anytime soon. The last patch was December 11th, it's January 7th and I don't think we are getting any patches this week. They attempted some fixes and failed with a hotfix on December 19th, I'll give them points for trying I guess but that wasn't any sort of real patch. 
---
Moral of the story is if you arent happy with the game in it's current state it's time to manage your expectations because it's not changing anytime soon. People have been blaming the holidays for the lack of fixes since the game released but we will see what happens now that they have come and gone. Also just a tip I wouldn't bother posting anything negative about the game on this sub majority of users are very defensive and apologetic about the game they genuinely seem to think it's normal for games to go so long with such majors problems not being addressed.
---
Nah. The hate is warranted and will continue until they fucking publicly apologize and admit they released a game in rushed, bugged, and unacceptable state 
---
I love this game. I’ve loved it since launch, and I’m going to continue loving and supporting this game.
---
It doesn’t deserve this much widespread hate. I bet the players that don’t go on reddit love the game too, because they’re too busy having fun ingame.
---
Thank you Bethesda for continuing to improve this game. I can’t wait to see what 76 is like 6 months from now when more and more content is added.
---
Fallout 76 is my favorite game right now, hate me.
---
Bravo. You might consider putting signage at your camp to indicate that your materials are not duped. It's sort of like buying 'organic'. 
---
So what would be the bug fixes and over hauls that have been released so far? doubling down that everything is OK?
---
Yeah it sucks I am not as rattled by it tho thanks to being a fan of Mass Effect Andromeda, it numbed me back then. 
---
Bethesda hasn't even released a patch in a month I wouldn't expect much from them. I do think it's partially a problem on your end though.
---
I logged and came back in, see me now?
---
It ends up being 6x as it is now. We'll 6x with the gauss, slightly less for weapons with receivers that improve base damage. Things is though, if TS effect can apply a damage multiplier before other weapon improvements are applied, explosive should too. If it was based on the weapon damage before receiver improvement or two shot effect it would be much less OP. For example, this would make a TSE handmade 269 instead of 561
---
Then you're starving and thirsty by the time you find the Damn thing...
---
AMEN!
---
&gt; Just search “the mire crash” dude. It’s not hard. 
---
&gt; I can’t find any recent posts. 
---
🧐👍
---
Todd, is that you??
---
And logical, since it's not, y'know, a shotgun.
---
I bought a jet pack mod for x01 off a reddit user and he sold it to me for less than vendor price 
---
Dear lord 
---
Going by last updates to Inside the Vault we should be getting an update today (update as in new info, not a downloadable update)
---
From my perspective, I could'nt really care less about No Mans Sky.   It could have been a good game andit wasnt. but it also came from a new game company without a track record of good or bad or even keeping their promises. It equates in some ways like to one of the bunch of startups that produces and puts out incomplete games on steam in order to grab some cash before people get upset.  lots of promises up front.   
---
Bethesda is different. While Bethesda's track record is pretty spotty, it has also produced or helped produce some of the best most fun and interesting gaming experiences around.
---
I think people are upset that they were cheated but also that we know that they are capable of putting out a good game.  instead about a year before it came out, Bethesda strong-armed a group that was trying to make a multiplayer mod for fallout cancelling that project, tried to get everyone to start paying for mods that had always been free, and now churns out a bunch of garbage thinking that everyone will just accept it.  Some of us think we have a bit of a vested interest in the future of the company and the fallout brand.  
---
The onus is on the community to let Bethesda and Todd Howard know that in no uncertain terms, that we will not accept this new model they are pursuing. Instead of letting it go to hell and eventually die, public opinion is used to exert pressure and to let them know to abandon this course and go back to making games that the community actually wants so fallout can continue to be a thriving franchise and not die due to experimenting with the formula too much. And you realize that if nobody complains or they think only  few people are upset, then imagine every other game that comes out is going to have this trash in it.  
---
Multiplayer is great but i'm not sure Bethesda and Todd are mature enough in their internet savvy to be the ones to introduce it in a meaningful way.  They have fought against every complaint.  circled the wagons until it was clear that people werent going to accept their poorly thought out strategy and implementation. 
---
What platform? It's mine!
---
People try to shelter kids too much. The truth is, kids don't really notice any dark themes or sexual references. That stuff totally flies over their heads. As long as they know it's a game and therefore *fake*, it's all good.
---
I'm having fun in the game. I'm not a hard-core player, nor am I probably very far into it, but what I've encountered has been fine.
---
There's certainly room for improvement (NPCs I can relate to, rather than robots, would be nice), but I definitely don't hate the game.
---
Don't worry, it will all end when ES6 is rushed out to reclaim trust and everyone will tear that to bits too.
---
I'm at 45 and have done some, but I've randomly stumbled on way more overseer spots than ones I was trying to find on purpose.
---
I can have fun playing with a sack of shit, especially with friends involved. Difference is that the bag of shit has no monetary value - It didn‘t cost anything. 
---
I mean, there is a reason people are reacting so badly, it ain't just cause it's a fun ol bundle of joy, lotta people feel like bethesda just gave us a jigsaw with less than half the pieces, not to mention how long time fans feel about bethesda moving away from fallout tried and tested traditions, I fall into the latter, I like my fallout games where there's multi choice dialog and and things I do change other things in the game, lot of people just see this as a shitty, half added that clone, even if the fox it, it's still just s clone of other survial/crafting games that have been around almost a decade now, and I guess a lot of people including myself just won't ever see it as anything less than a that clone that was rushed to grab cash, but if you enjoy it more power to you 
---
I've noticed everytime I leave game from the enclave bunker (vendor area for x-01 mods) that I have to force close my game when I try to join a new game because i get the infinite loading screen. I've tried it atleast 10 times and every time it's the same result. After I force close the game it works normal and spawns me at the service entrance. 
---
Don't forget that the Enclave also shot first and nuked China as indicated in the past Fallout games. 
---
Definitely could be. I’ve talked with people running the game on Xbox S and X and they have less lag and shorter loading screens. I’d like to know what other people running it on the og Xbox are experiencing.
---
So balances should only hapoen in MMOs? Is that what you're saying? This is a good one.
---
Yeah man, it's totally a fact that Fallout 76 is singleplayer. 😂😂😂
---
Oh boy, I don't know how some people can live with their own delusions.
---
Oh! The canvas card! Here's where I know you have no arguments left. Well, you've been circlejerking for a while, so I guess you didn't have many to begin with.
---
Again, good thing this isn't an MMO then, so it doesn't have to apply to MMO standars! Yay!
---
Yes, we've been over this again and again and again.
---
*Bottomline*: First: you, for some weird reason that escapes all logic, think that this is a single-player game. It *can* be played solo, for sure. But that doesn't make it single-player. Sorry to break it to you.
---
And second: you think that this game shouldn't be balanced because... it isn't an MMO? Weird. But then again, you haven't made much sense since the beginning, so I'm used to it by now.
---
Good talk.
---
checking now,,
---
Go to xboxdvr.com and type your gt. It should be easy from there
---
DINKLEBURG.
---
I agree the anger at the state of the game on launch should have been a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the anger scale. It was and currently continues to sit at a 9-10. Well beyond what it should be and to the point people are rewriting history and actively attacking anyone who dares even mention they like the game. 
---
When you reach the point that you are going after people just for liking the game shows you are reached whinny self entitled brat stage. 
---
Damn it Todd! How many accounts do you have??
---
Everyone was expecting more from Bethesda. 76 isn't a bad game but it isn't exactly that good either, and because of how big and successful Bethesda are people think they deserve to be critisised 
---
Is this rust?
---
joining in you now :) 
---
I remember that terminal.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
Are you going to be in game tonight?
---
But the single player has none of that so your point? yeah its buggy for a rockstar game but the bugs are tame.
---
I don't know, man. I mean, I *hope* they do. 
---
To contest a workshop you have to go to the bench and lay claim to it, if you just shoot stuff it will just count as attacking them like at their camp. 
---
This is why some people will block the bench off, then there's no way to contest them without getting at least a 10 bounty. 
---
1. Sweet Tato Soup gives food, drink, and health regeneration.  Corn for AP regen and carrot for perception. Growing 8 each of tato, mutfruit, corn and carrots plus Green Thumb is plenty to keep you fed and healing between fights. Note: health regen only occurs when your action bar is full.  
---
2. Fusion core running low? Server hop and it’ll be full again.   
---
Great work and I love the head-cannon reasoning behind the camera. 
---
To each their own, friend. I'm loving the game and I feel it was worth every penny I spent on it.
---
Little far from home
---
It displays 0 but if you sell them something they will display what caps they have left.
---
Because they are another players turrets 
---
Yeah definitely. Of a few dozen players only one tried that though, lol
---
God I know I did - similar to this I liked walling them in when a stove caught fire. XD
---
To be honest I wasn't that into the building in Fallout 4 either, just did the bare minimum to get through quests.
---
At first, I thought I'd give it a try it in 76, and built a simple little camp, next time I logged in, it was gone, and that's how I found out about that issue in beta. After that the only time I deployed my camp was to build a PA station and repair my excavator armor after getting stuck with a broken leg in the middle of nowhere.
---
My play style also is full encumbered and I haven't fast travelled since level 4 so I probably wouldn't go to my camp even if I had one.
---
Instead I know where most every workbench, stash box and resource spots are and just wander the wasteland. 
---
So you do you, and who cares what anyone thinks :)
---
So in the wise words of a childhood  hero of mine: Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down but until tomorrow I'll just keep moving on
---
LOL, guilty
---
Please link me to where I said the game "works great and has no issues."
---
I really would like to know where these imaginary words you're putting in my mouth are coming from.
---
I see the Souls community is making its way into FO76.
---
Outstanding.
---
Well I've ran into several game breaking bugs so..
---
I don't think it matters... I think some guy made a spreadsheet of what mods have what chance to obtain from scrapping, maybe that has more answers. 
---
At least... as many as I could fit lol
---
Wish we could have 60 people in a server, but I think the cap is 24
---
I mean folks have been shit-talking Bethesda about their buggy games for a hot minute, so has their basic approach to DLC. I mean it's such a pervasive thing that you can literally buy a horse armor skin for your Raider Power Armor. 
---
Do you know how to do this on PS4?
---
I haven’t noticed a difference between levels...I learned all my mods for the hunting rifle from level 1-10 rifles I picked up. Now working on combat rifles and handmades 
---
Cranberry cobbler and cranberry juice for experience boosts. Whitesprings nuke zones with a automatic tesla rifle is a good way to do it. I recommend the heart of the swamp event. As well as constantly running the queen.
---
Well, there you go!
---
You're lucky I haven't seen your camp, there would be nothing left. :P
---
Tried, multiple times on different servers, and I always get the "this vendor doesn't have enough caps" or something along those lines message. 
---
I think it just says sludge spouts or something
---
Oh heck yes, I keep a vampires +swing speed switchblade to "use" in a corner after a fight and save on stimpack! :D
---
Hey what's it like working at Bethesda these days?
---
Lol, it's a tough sell sometimes but this is the least creepy I can be
---
Come visit r/Artifact, please
---
i figured. there’s clearly a few problems with the game, and there have been blunders with like the bags and whatnot, but the reaction just hasn’t been valid for what happened, it’s just been too extreme.
---
I also lol'd really hard at that, lol
---
No.
---
The current system sucks, server hopping or buying from a duper should not be the only way to access rare items. 
---
If you want them to remain exclusive the Commendation price can always be adjusted.
---
You're saying your bad experiences should mean I shouldn't enjoy the game? 
---
Yeah man I just started. You can't find people to play with in this sub? 
---
Add me bruhv!
---
You have shit taste in games, and you like it when companies give it to you from behind. Your proble, not the people who are upset.
---
This is the only reason for the Defcon 1, the Defcon sensors were not programmed to see scorched or super mutants so they don't affect it at all.
---
N.p
---
Health regen is similar for the mutation as well; cheers Taar! 🍻
---
I'm the one who printed all those recycle labels in the background. Thousands of them in fact. High tac Arlon vinyl with textured laminate. Printed on a large format HP latex printer.
---
And my love for this game and it's community grows even more...
---
You sir.
---
Are an evil genius.
---
Looking at your map and fast traveling to people until you stumble upon a camp and then just blowing it up is not raiding.
---
Until we have real PvP mechanics, you can continue pretending you are "raiding" but it's total bullshit mechanics and that's why people consider it grief.
---
Oxygen not included as well is amazing and its in early access beta still
---
I played for a few weeks, haven't logged in since.
---
But sure, that amount of time played plus a single Reddit post is *definitely* indicative of insecurity and being offended.
---
You've found me out. My secret is no longer safe. You get the golden ticket. Congrats.
---
Cute, but very silly idea for fundamental reasons bro
---
You are talking about a trading group, say 4 people.. in a server with MAX 24 people. This cuts into your already possible customer base. Just how many of the remaining players will want to buy whatever shit you are selling? Not many.. how many of the remaining players are new with no means to buy or are just wanting to play the game and learn. How many of the remaining players are high level and drop more shit in paper bags than you have to sell?
---
Do whatever is fun man, but be prepared for disappointment
---
oh ffs, The long dark did not cost 20 bucks when it first came out and that game is a quarter of what fallout 76 is.
---
I thought they just pretty much used farm tools
---
Thanks i traded for a two shot explosive
---
And plotted / cut with a mimaki plotter
---
I agree also. This is very sad for me because it is 100% true.
---
Thats funny. Ive done the same thing with shooting at the ground. 
---
Hahaha. I was witness to a triple-nuking (one after the other) of Whitespring last night and there was a crew with a CAMP outside the back door, piling up bodies like cordwood. The flies and buzzing sounded like the three Vertibots hovering 6ft over your head for a while.
---
Pointless without an admission of guilt and accountability.
---
How the new nuke code aren't out and the old ones won't work
---
You didn't say games for $20 you said games for $20 that have way more content. Anyone that has complained about lack of content for 76 is a Fucking moron. 76 had way way way more content than most games. And bugs were expected and they are getting and have been fixed. 
---
Do you need full auto perk to make higher damage
---
I bought it on sale for $40 about a week or two ago. I played for maybe 5-10 hours and experience so much rubber banding and crashing, not to mention stuttering that I put the game down. 
---
Sadly the game is not good at all for what I have come to expect from Bethesda over the years and is more akin to what a 3 person team releasing a pre-alpha survival game would make.
---
And you know that for a fact do you?
---
I just hope they don’t scale new content on the assumption everyone has a TSE. I want new content to be difficult for people without and if TSE makes it easy mode so be it. I can always choose not to use it. I do think they knew they would have some gamebreaking issues early on that they would have to find a way to fix. Hence why legendaries can go up to 5 stars but only 3 stars (4 star with scorched killer) exist currently in the game. So once they fix duping they can release higher star weapons to drop and while TSEs will probably still be very strong at least they won’t be the absolute best anymore. 
---
Was she wanted?
---
everything is suppressed
---
Mate a guy defending this game threatened to stab me the other month...
---
Get over yourself nobody claimed you are subhuman get over yourself with your victim complex.
---
Haha!
---
Shit up fat, sweaty neckbeard. The game is FUCKING ATROCIOUS GARBAGE. If you like it, you simply have trash taste in games. I don't see how this is debatable. They fucking swindled you.
---
Incredible, well done 
---
No it doesn't, I've played both for about 100 hours now and have encountered at least a dozen times the game breaking bugs in 76. Worst bug in rdr2, got rammed by a boar while skinning the legendary deer and the pelt got stuck in the ground. It was still saved at the trapper, just couldn't sell it. Out 20$ which can be made up by a random encounter. 76, lose my home a half dozen times and spend hours getting supplies again to rebuild.
---
Please post more things like this
---
T pose
---
I tried this game for almost 10 hours and it's trash imo. It performs like absolute shit and it's bugs galore.
---
The fact Bethesda thought they could get away with this baffles me. I'm happy they're getting shit on so they never attempt this bullshit again.
---
This game, at least right now, is a fucking disaster.
---
I will continue to “pretend” to raid in this role playing game, I like the idea of that. I’ve stated around the comment section how my style of “raiding” is usually carried out. 
---
I’ll use the mechanics to the extent it’ll let me, which isn’t much now. Pretty much all agreed that a separate pvp server will satiate the thirst. 
---
There's a mod that makes paper bags, plans, and certain other stuff glow in neon colors (I think it's actually two mods, one for bags and one for the rest). I would not be surprised if they could do that for corpses too. Having said that, it *is* a mod, so take your own risk.
---
Graham Crackers has it
---
Lol.  I’m sure he thanks you for the fun as well
---
Create your story and stories for other players or "NPC's" and treat it as such. A guy screaming in the mic? The rads must have gotten to him. Guy won't talk and only waves to you? He must have had his tongue ripped out by a deathclaw! :D
---
But but what if somebody robs you 
---
You've been stuck for a whole month? damn. How much of the story does it cut off? I got stuck yesterday....

shhh dont tell anyone... lol

Your art is most sublime. Have you considered adding psychological manipulation or perhaps befriending and gaining their genuine trust and love before transcending them into art? Again, marvelous work. 
---
Would you rather have us dupe and farm Whitesprings forever? Lmao or just all be farmers, hold hands and sing kumbaya? 
---
Let me remind you, some of the first footage we’ve seen of this game is a player shooting another player while he was on his knees, gettin his head blown off. 
---
Put on hazmat suit, now what?
---
Thank you
---
I’ve written 3 sentences about the game. You need to get that stick out your ass. Haha. 
---
Think ultra has better damage resistant and the x01 is better energy resistance. I personally use excvator for the carry power. 
---
My husband and I both play.  If anything, I'm annoying him by hogging the screen time after the kids go to bed. 
---
I just had a situation like this!!! Except the deathclaw

 couldn't hurt me there us a trick to making the mobs safe for handle and it involves maxing the perk cards for a "secret prek

Once you have a few more levels Grafton steel works swarms with muties - at least it does for me

This happens to me on Xbox sometimes, where the compass varies from being a few degrees off to being completely backwards.

i did the fort defiance event and i helped down a scorchbeast and i couldn’t find the corpse.  i think maybe highlight the corpse only if you got a shot in. 
---
Kinda wonder if you copy/paste this from someone else. I've seen this kinda post so many times its not even funny.
---
For you maybe ever been escorting 3 low levels and been jumped by four?  I basically yell over mic "FOR THE EMPEROR!" and open fire telling the rest to run.  Granted eventually my .50 kills them but Jesus that has happened twice now and each fight took 2 hours 
---
I just remember reading the beta results and then saying that FOV was something they’ve never worked on or implemented because of clippings and animations. I’m talking like November notes I think. 
---
Damn true, never have one with me. Forgot about Rad X too. 
---
Man, Hooch is crazy!
---
Add PvE penalties to the wanted players. And give low-level wanted players the ability to buy their bounty with caps for those that complain about a "stray bullet" triggering their wanted status.
---
* Have robo traders charge them higher prices
---
* Charge more for fast travel. 
---
* Maybe have some of the PvE perks turn off when a player is wanted, or limit them to their 1-star effect.
---
Yes, I get that this is a game with PvP, but having a wanted status is not from playing PvP. This is not someone who won a PvP battle, this is someone who destroyed an unguarded CAMP or slapped a passive player 20+ times to kill them. Wanted are not the same a PvP.
---
100%...at what point to people just move on an leave the rest of alone?   
---
its enough already the voice was heard ...its just a droning meaningless sound now
---
i think a lot of people are going the extra mile to hate on 76 because theyre hoping if it crashes and burns hard enough, no other company will try this again. 
---
I don't get why they don't just add a global cooldown to all crafting/actions. It could be as little as .5s and people wouldn't be able to spam actions and cause problems.
---
Yeah fair one. Wasn’t trying to be aggro with my post there.
---
What? People expressing opinions?
---
I still need regular leather coat actually, have traveling leather coat. Looks same as in FO4. Not for sure regular one has been seen in game yet, though it is in the loot table..
---
You'd get downvoted for that also I've posted some of the issues I've had with the game got downvoted. It happens get over it not all ppl agree with each other.
---
No Mans Sky was an extremely ambitious title being developed by an indie company with no experience.
---
Fallout 76 is a huge name franchise that was developed by an AAA company
---
Probably because there isn’t a point to it other than being a dick.  
---
It does. And the duration resets every time you log. 
---
I thought getting hot casings ejected into your face was part of the appeal of this game, along with various other gun features
---
Or just get the healing factor mutation.
---
Can’t live without it and now I sell stimpaks.
---
You haven’t even finished the tutorial section man
---
Of what? Junk? There's lots more junk out there and I haven't actually died since I was somewhere around level 60. 
---
I do have some of my better stuff in my stash, but there are stash boxes all over.
---
Nothing else anyone can steal and even with your camp you're just putting stuff in your stash.
---
I didn’t expect it either. Thought I’d be putting it down after 20-30 hours. But here I am, 250+ hours later and still playing daily. Get ready to lose lots of sleep. 
---
So again bug fixes, over hauls, hot fixes. They are literally admitting the game needs work by releasing updates to address the issues. If they didn't think there was anything wrong they wouldn't be releasing these updates. 
---
I haven't been able to get past it, and don't really have time to get another character to that point. So I'm not sure how much it cuts off exactly, but I haven't been able to get to the BoS or Enclave yet. 
---
It also doesn't help us console players
---
Changes have been made but the game still has MASSIVE ISSUES and that launch was completely inexcusable 
---
So what's with all the crashing for fallout 3 nv skyrim and 4
---
He’s literally the one who updates the website. All the codes are up though
---
More power to you, man. I don't know how you can keep it fresh after 500 hours, though. I'm surprised you don't have more insane legendary stuff.
---
T-51b has the best physical and energy resistance but less radiation resistance, so if you can manage the radiation easily then go with T-51b
---
I've sunk something around 250+ hours into the game, and I've been having a blast doing so. Does the game have flaws? Heck yes, I'm not delusional, but there *is* a ton of fun packed into the game.
---
Yes but what if you weapon needs repairing and you get robbed then you got nothing to repair it with 
---
Let's say the turrets are so useless as a meta example of why we should fight against automation!
---
While I agree the OP statement makes is “easier” to deal with the queen, but I like dealing with the extra adds and possibly getting more legendary loot. Plus it’s a good XP farm if you need it. 
---
99%?
---
Seriously?
---
That's a joke.
---
I'd almost dupe just to make a 1000 ivory grips and leave them somebody to find. XD
---
You can have a pet Giant Sloth in FO76? Despite all the crap the game have (according to 90% of the internet) this may be a compelling reason to buy it. 
---
This reminds me of that parking garage in fallout 4 "the gauntlet" I believe it was called. A whole parking garage run by raiders full of all sorts of boobie traps. I love it !!!!
---
Nope. I want them to say it. I want them to publicly admit and go on the record that they messed up and released that sorry sack of shit and apologize. Pretending like nothing happened while releasing patches is not acceptable. 
---
Or ppl wanna find out if the game is broken or trash that could be a reason I've had reviews keep me from wasting money on a game several times.
---
I just have all chameleon leather armour.
---
I don’t know if it stacks but that’s just how the legendaries fell and I don’t want to risk it lol.  
---
Almost never get spotted even when a group super mutant warlords surround me and I just keep head shotting them...when I do though I use marsupial to jump over them and make a quick getaway.
---
DOES NOT work for level 91 glowing deathclaws, if they spot me I am deaded.
---
I think these make more sense. If these players are getting wanted status (and that does not mean PvP, that means killing passive players and attaching CAMPS), then they should be treated as hostile by the environment. Can't use other players CAMPs, Cant trade, Cant fast travel, Player dot's hidden on map/HUD, etc.
---
It's not that far off.  It fires an explosive shell from an unrifled barrel, it's not like it's game breaking having it fall under that category. 
---
Thank you!!
---
Shame on you for not reading the warning before claiming a workshop.
---
Smh 
---
Crying manchild, huh.
---
More like, "I'm irritated because every piece of media I subscribe to/read/listen to has people screaming about it and none of it is original."
---
A lot of these people know they aren't going to like the game, but they get it anyway just to play it for an hour and then copy/paste what everyone else has already said.
---
I'm meh about the game. That does not mean I'm in love with it or that I hate it. It's just meh to me. Maybe my issue is that I SHOULD be working myself into a frothing rage like everyone else, but I just....don't feel the need to do so.
---
But if that line of independent thought makes me a crying manchild Bethesda shill, then sure, think what you want. God forbid someone have a middle ground point of view rather than a definitive "hate or love" viewpoint.
---
If only the server wasnt full
---
Today was my first day playing and I have to say, as someone who hesitated to buy the game because of the negative reviews I was sad that I bought into it. 
---
Sure it’s not quite as polished as far as fallout games go but the hate just isn’t warranted. Mind you I’m sure at launch it had much more issues. 
---
Not only was I instantly hooked by the visuals and the gameplay the player base is awesome! I had two people outside the vault give me a few supplies like meds and ammo and it made me feel so much more involved in the world, though I’m still getting used to there being now real human npcs. 
---
Overall I am regretting giving in to the negative press but I’m super excited to see how bgs further developed the game. 
---
You are part of the problem.
---
I think they mean the defense events *after* the first one.
---
Please send me the schematics
---
I have spare weapons, and can get what I need to repair just about anything pretty easily, I also use perks to repair everything to 200% when I do fix it so it lasts longer. Worst case I use a weapon I picked up for a bit, but haven't had to do that in a long time.
---
   
---
The game punishes you for doing pvp, it's even a waste of bullets and stimpacks 
---
Lol yea I did all chameleon and then went to 1 with bolstering and stuff. but in kinda stumped. 
---
Oh ok, cool wasn’t sure. I wonder if you could tape it if it goes aggro on enemies? Prob not. Thanks for reply!
---
Right. But had I listened to these fools I wouldn't of bought the game.
---
I'm glad I am not a sheep.
---
Oh I see 
---
Personally I'd prefer if TS applied consistently. They could pretty easily fix the massive overpowered damage by reducing the bonus explosive damage to something like 20% of the projectile. That would bring it in line with others, and you could boost it to 40% if you use demo expert. 
---
Negan’s comin’ out of the next vault to get her back
---
Did you pull that insult out of 2010?
---
Who’s being hurt by the amount of hate? I don’t see why you guys must defend a huge triple A company after they totally screw up. I don’t think many lines have been crossed by youtubers and only ones who have target the players when they shouldn’t.
---
Man, read the instructions when claiming a workshop - people can initiate PvP against you when they start claiming it off you. If he has already been to the location you are currently at he can fast travel to it and start attacking you - workshops = PvP plain and simple.
---
Get your wife to play, no more problems.
---
Subnautica is a masterpiece, yes. **Now.**
---
When it was initially put out, it was short on features and looong on promise. There were massive issues with performance on even the most high end of machines, and it was routine for save files to get corrupted. The devs for that game also promised multiplayer from the *start* and ended up finally coming clean that they were never going to actually make good on ever implementing it.
---
If we are comparing games at release, let's do it with all the facts at hand.
---
You end up finding one?
---
Wow that was amazing. This got me thinking. I haven’t done any of the animal taming yet but for people that have will your pet attack other players unprovoked? If so I now won’t to make a trap arena and once they are inside I hit the switch, the gate opens and they have to fight a deathclaw or something. 
---
The constant hate is what made me sub to the gaming circle jerk subreddit
---
Don't forget their home alone game!
---
The game is so much fun! It’s buggy and has its problems but I’ve been playing since the beta and I love it. Once you get over the issues it’s enjoyable 
---
Yeah, I'm less talking about micro transactions and more about this idea that any game with a few bugs, an annoying design decision, or not exactly what everyone had hoped for are just "shitty, incompetent devs" and that gets circlejerked.  I'm all for less micro transaction, especially ones that affect the game. 
---
Looking at the games I listed, only really F76 had micro transaction issues. 
---
PUBG - "buggy mess, spaghetti code, shitty net code, incompetent devs"
---
NMS - "devs lied, scammed us with the trailer, nothing to do"
---
Atlas - "fuck early access games, unplayably buggy, reskinned ark"
---
Sea of thieves - "boring, no content, only thing good about it is the water graphics"
---
Realistically, all of those games are fantastic games. Maybe not for everyone, sure they have bugs and that can be frustrating, but the levels people take it to are just ridiculous. 
---
Actually the single player does have microtransactions. How ever we are comparing two online MMO type games not GTA V and Fallout 4.  I must say it is amusing how people go off like you do and I bring up GTA Online and they can't even keep the topic on GTA online for more then a sentence before talking about story mode as if it makes up for it. 
---
GTA Online is a game mode you have to pay 40-60 USD to access that at launch was empty as shit. Has a lot of half ass updates and delayed bug fixes. With at least 3 speed glitches and god modes that I'm aware of. And is cynically designed to rake in that sweet MTX money.   The game is such an unbalanced cluster fudge that when the Night Club update was released Rockstar had like 5 or 6 streamers live stream activities in the update and not one of them lasted more then a half hour in public lobbies before they were required to go into private lobbies to continue playing. Quite literally 20 USD will not even buy you the newest high end car that was just released. 
---
Rockstar has literally made billions off of this game. They have been more then capable at any time in the last 5 years to separate GTA Online from GTA 5 and offer it as a free download. Much in the same way Epic separated the battle royal mode from Fortnite's story mode and offered it for free. And even with Fortnite the game's BR mode would only be worth like 20-30 USD retail so they over charge for skins. And 8 USD skin is nearly half the retail price of the game. 
---
There is no were near the same outrage and anger towards those two games as FO 76 has had. 
---
Building a shed and having them launch fireworks when they started being too big of hassles was my favorite
---
Haha I was going for it at one point. Stopped because of negative effects of others. Got class freak thankfully, so gonna go for it again soon. 
---
That was so much fun, we got the SBQ and three more i think, lol
---
I level twice :)
---
Now i have to take a run around in watoga to fill up on some lead for my .45 tagger :)
---
Just let me know when you are doing the next please :)
---
Losing your junk isn't that bad, but you better bet I have springs, Black Titanium and ballistic fiber in my stash ;) everything else is fairly easy to replace. All nuclear materials also go into stash of course.
---
Auto-stim when my health drops is a real advantage for this build.
---
What do you get out of randomly killing someone who doesn’t wanna be killed by you? PvP in this game is stupid and pointless so why even bother with it just bitch till Bethesda makes a PvP only server then go around and randomly kill each other till your hearts content   
---
Limited use in regular play?
---
Try getting a full team with empath and empath serums.
---
Mmmmmmmmm. Tanky.
---
Is it done yet ? :)
---
You are carrying 11 lbs of lockpicks, you don’t need that many. 20-25 is more than enough.
---
Wait what do you mean:
---
"Should you be killed, you'll lose more caps in the process; higher levels beware"
---
You don't literally lose caps when killed by someone with a bounty right?  You mean lost junk or something?
---
I don’t know why this is being downvoted. I haven’t run into any game breaking bugs when I play with my friends either 🤷🏼‍♀️ the biggest annoyance is trees cutting through my walls and getting disconnected every now and then 
---
^THIS! I have a modest camp, a 3x2 with 4 interior foundation bits in an "L" shape and a 2 foundation front porch...fits all the crafting tables nice and snug, fill it out with a few instruments, chairs, plants, bed room set, and a wood stove and it is cozy as hell!
---
I do feel like the succulent pack is a must though, one of the only small items that makes sense on table surfaces...antique lighting pack made a huge difference for me too with the candles and lanterns sitting nicely and cluttering things up a bit.
---
Add me man. I got to restock as well, kind of a slow kill lol
---
Then leave, and quit your bitching. 👋👍
---
\&gt;I don't even get what he's saying. "I'm angry because a shit game gets shit"?
---
Just because you or some popular guy on youtube think that smth is shit it doesn't actually mean that all people think so too.
---
\&gt; a game cynically designed to rake in that sweet microtransaction cash 
---
Do you really know something about microtransactions in FO76? The game obviously has many problems, but if you're going to 'fight' with microtransactions in game industry, FO76 is definitely not smth to start with.
---
\&gt;I don't even understand why you guys keep playing F76. 
---
Probably because they like it, lol?
---
Welcome to my life of being left handed. Grow up and deal. 
---
I thought workshops were intended to be PVP zones. I'm confused as to why you would get a wanted tag for trying to take one over.
---
Dude no man's sky gets shit to this *day*
---
You're assume I haven't played the game. Why?
---
The 32 per server limit was what I found because I couldn't remember so if thats wrong feel free to correct me. I know there are multiple servers so I may have just worded that bit poorly.
---
I know how patches work. They wouldn't have needed to make it so big if they bothered to make it work in the first place. You seemed to interpret my issue with the day 1 patch to be it's  big so its bad, that's missing my point entirely. If you buy a table and its missing a bunch of pieces but you are promised the rest will get there eventually you'd be pretty pissed right? So why is this any different. They shipped an unfinished product. And before you say thats normal for games these day's it doesn't mean its a acceptable practice.
---
The engine would be fine execpt this isn't some small studio that needs to fall back on it and keep patching it up. I'd wager a solid %60 of the problems with the game could be solved if they just changed/upgraded engines. It'd add a ton of extra dev time sure but considering Bethesda's size and love of reusing assets (which isn't inherently a bad thing) it'd be a good investment that would draw a lot of good press which they could have really used right now.
---
They aren't improving, they're fixing the game sure but they as a company are not. They still release products that a broken for a lot of people that are filled with bugs that would be ripped apart if in any other game. Are some people overreacting? Sure, but a lot of the excess hate is coming from frustrations from previous Bethesda games overflowing into this(plus the whole pre-order bag scam etc.)Theres a fair amount in the game that I enjoy but not enough to excuse the rest and nowhere near enough for me to ignore the actions of Bethesda out side the game. 
---
Why should I expect it to be good by the time they were done with it, Oblivion, Skyrim and Fallout's 3 through 4 are made by mods because they were to lazy to fix it. It could end up good like NMS is now but that's not a practice that should be made acceptable.
---
Also that car analogy was a little weak. You're comparing apples and oranges my friend.
---
Really? Did you get wanted then? I just tested leaving them at my camp, one inside the circle and one outside. When I came back they were both gone. So they do despawn when the player who left them goes far enough away.
---
Singed Fortress...
---
I can tell you haven’t played it yet it’s super fun my 12 year old cousin prefers it over fortnight
---
Right behind the clubhouse with your missile turrets firing into the windows so no one gets any do or loot.
---
It's poorly thought out. The reward isn't worth the risk.
---
It is and its also published by EA. Google what trash EA has done recently. Are you seriously trying to compare Fallout 76 to a  " mobile collectible RPG"
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVkpFiRhKw8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVkpFiRhKw8)
---
Wooo looks like a blast, totally mind blowing!!
---
Just want to point out some things I've noticed in this thread. One is people saying "just fix the dupe bug" like it's that easy. You'd think if it was an easy fix then it would been implemented already? For reference, gta online STILL has dupe glitches, over 5 years into the games' life cycle. That is because it is not an easy fix. This sounds like an angry comment but it is not, too many people just dont understand that some bug fixes are just not a simple feat.
---
Second is people claiming that Bethesda kept fucking up with decisions like the PA edition bags and rum and whatever, but you know the devs, the people making the game, do not make those decisions? Those fuck-ups are not the fault of the developers. For all we know every one of those fuck-ups were not even Bethesda at all but were Zenimax, their parent company. At least pin the blame on the right people. The developers are not the greedy people, the corporate heads are the greedy people. 
---
Please dont push all this hate on the developers, they are the people trying to make this game better with the tools they were given.
---
Here, take some [karma.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwA79JwS6Q)
---
Haha
---
Are you Austrian and or German?
---
Yes, shame on them for not making basic logic and reading comprehension tests mandatory before allowing people to play the game.
---
 We need news from Bethesda, some of us remain faithful from the beta. but there are days that I would like to uninstall, I have lost many objects multiple disconnections I've launched missiles and I've been out have to endure a fucking unbalanced game Missing missions I can not get out of my armor All I want is to know what Bethesda is going to do. I love the game but every day it takes away the desire to connect me, 90% of my friends do not play it anymore it's a new game, bethesda should be constantly communicated but they only give us a bot that repeats messages, throws the smoke bomb and disappear 
---
Sounds like a battle a had yesterday!
---
I may buy it when my next summer break starts (so I can binge play it and hopefully all major bugs are fixed) and become a sort of Sloth master. Anyhow, hope Carlos does well in post apocalyptic Appalachia. 
---

The game deserves all the hate, hell, even more. Of course people whine. We waited 3 years for an AAA game and we got this greedy shit. And all the hate would never exist if they implemented a refund system. No refund means even bethesda knew that the game will flop but they still released it, hoping to catch the most ungarded fallout fans they can. And they still can't squeze out an apology after all the shit they've done.  And looking at the techinal side of things, the game was better for me during beta. Framerate was stable, i met a few bugs. But when i wanted to check on the game a few days ago, it was a total mess. Stuttering, flickering in the distance. They implemented fucking duping with an update. So personally i hope people will shit on the game even in 2020. 
---
Whitespring is kinda bad for farming legendaries. I'm level 152 and I've found 3 Two Shot weapons (Handmade, 10mm, and Sub) and 4 Explosive (x2 Radium, pump Shotgun, and AR). Never a Two Shot Explosive. I refused to use one or buy one due to bitchery of the cheaters.
---
I farm EMS, which is funny because I'm a Paramedic. I also farm AWOL, West-Tec, Sugar Grove, military bases in the bog, Excelsior House, and sometimes Heart of the Swamp spawns a \*\*\* Mirelurk Queen but damn that quest soaks up the ammo
---
What have you been doing for 250+ hours in the game I did the missions and launched the nuke and now I’m kinda just waiting for something I wanna keep playing it I love it I’m just lost on what to do next 
---
So you what you're really asking for is no one to play pvp, no one to even threaten you unless they get an even larger disadvantage. Why even buy a fallout multiplayer game if all you want is sunshine and rainbows? 
---
This is a sandbox game that we all can play in, some want to build a castle, some want to smash the castle, others want to smash the castle smasher... and then there is a the guy crying about how others play in the sandbox.
---
Farm simulator 19?
---
Isn’t it annoying tho walking around and not being able to run q
---
Hi
---
I saw someone say +25% but i have not seen anyone provide any proof for this, they could have just be making up numbers
---
If Rockstar made Skyrim it'd have a plot worth a damn and wouldn't need mods to fix it. 
---
Must have gotten full was empty when I went into the nuke 
---
*sigh*  workshops = PVP
---
Mephala, is that you?
---
Bethesda needs to be taught a proper lesson. I say the more hate, the better.
---
Butthurt Bethesda fan boy 
---
even if you run out of caps , they leave you with a 2-hour debuff with -50% damage to other players
---
will try, GT is Spawn3232 :)
---
I would but I'm not a bitch sooo lmaooo
---
I can run, I just can't sprint. 
---
Really not that bad, and I get to see more of the map and content this way. Takes me about 5 minutes to get anywhere I need to and with all the quests done it's more like wherever I want to. 
---
Roses quests were probably the roughest because of all the back and forth but still fun.
---
At some point I'll strip off the weight but still having fun wandering around and haven't felt the need quite yet.
---
Lucky me I'm in 
---
&gt; Get over yourself nobody claimed you are subhuman get over yourself with your victim complex.
---
It's not a victim complex, someone actually called me scum over this fucking game. I can literally go get screenshots and prove it.
---
Same. On Saturday-Sunday I played from 11AM to 6AM the next day 😂😱
---
I feel like this entire post is about 2 weeks late. I'm basically on every platform and everyone who means something has already had their say about it and it hasn't cropped up at all for me lately. 
---
You glossed over some of the biggest issue with Fallout 76, and those aren't even the game itself.
---
I also feel a lot (at least 50%) of the hate has been geared towards Bethesda's rolling out and percieved lack of quality assurance regarding the game, special edition paraphernalia (Duffelgate), and the in-game currency (Atoms) and pricing. 
---
Your edits are cringey and accusatory. If you didn't want opinions, don't post on Reddit.
---
Imagine how great it would feel if fall76 was on Steam and you could refund it. OMG amazing.
---
"Wanted" status is reserved for true scumbaggery: killing other players who did not fight back, attacking/destroying camps, etc. I feel like if you're acting like a shit, maybe an increasingly forceful slap on the wrist might be warranted.
---
Why was it unacceptable? I couldn’t connect at midnight launch but that was not unexpected honestly. I was able to get on in the morning and have no trouble with the game since. Yeah there was a bugged quest that got patched, a couple disconnects but nothing terrible. I’m playing on Xbox One X. Was it worse on other platforms? I’ve never understood the “unplayable mess” people claimed.
---
OP is literally Hitler.
---
I got handmade plans at watoga train station first try
---
Happened to me too at around lvl 20. At the time I was using different weapons to stock up on .308 had around 1000 rounds and had just switched back. Then all of it got shredded into meat.
---
go explore, the map is huge and there's all kinds of stuff to look at! pick a random direction and go that way and see what you find :D
---
Not really the point 
---
Bethesda was respected. The made this. This is a fucking describe of a game and you need to stop shilling this kind of behavior
---
Dude. It's a mmo now. Not a single player. It's like comparing toon link to OoT link. There's a lot of similar things but it's a basic thing. So you had a couple of asshats fucking with you. That's not the games fault. Cheaters are everywhere. Blame the right people if you need to scold someone.
---
How is that acceptable? Bugs shouldn’t come standard! I had one of the worst PC Beta experiences ever, but I like the game and I want to see it improve.
---
Even with class freak, the chem reduction and non-incombat healing makes it pretty weak especially if you have a vampiric weapon which makes it completely useless.
---

he’s refuting your claim that no one has encountered game breaking bugs
---
Oh man. The haters need to see this. Absolutely beautiful. This is the kind of stuff that keeps me coming back to the wasteland. 
---
Hmmm I have to try this tommorow 
---
One person threatens to stab me do you think I’m sitting here thinking you want to stab me or do you really want to form what people think of you based on the opinion of one cunt?
---
Maybe if the game didn't have so many problems it wouldn't have had such a big hate train.
---
Want to have people say good things about your game?  Actually make a good game.
---
Indie titles with small / individual developers on Steam like Factorio, Rimworld, and Undertale are all sitting happily at Overwhelmingly Positive reviews because they had a developer that gave two shits about their game.
---
Of course, half the problems with FO 76 is all the other stuff.  Support tickets full of personal information being sent to other users.  "The Great Canvas Shortage of 2018".
---
The fact is Bethesda could have done much better, but they just half-assed the game and the support for it.  If it turns out like No Man's Sky and becomes something much more two years later, then great, but I'm not holding my breath for the company that re-released Skyrim 5+ times.
---
Have you played rd2? The story is fantastic
---
I lagged myself out for a couple minutes just boiling water
---
It's been this way on the fallout series for so long now it's almost tradition.
---
Dueces
---
My god this was so good. The third victim was the best one. You’re a kind souls showing such compassion 😂
---
R/accidentalracism
---
I know what he meant. Just saying that if there is a way to gain the mod with some other ingame system it needs to reflect to the amount of time and effort equaling the server hopping so that not many people are going to bother getting it. Let's say, a quest you can do once per day and rewards you 1 token and you'd need 30 tokens, so the time gate in that sense would be 1 month of daily logins. 
---
Currently the jetpack mod isn't available to anyone who isn't willing to spend possibly unlimited amounts of time repeating a boring task that gains the person nothing besides the ability to obtain the plan which is pretty much the same as saying that it's not available to everyone.
---
The House That u/Vault101manguy Built.
---
No but I wished they did
---
**MOVING AT THE SPEED OF SOOOOOOOUND!**
---
Nope...I'm in XBOX1
---
Be the NPC that the wasteland needs! Meet low level players at Vault 76 or Flatwood and give them building plans, water, stimpacks, or ammo. Follow them around for a while helping with whatever they do. Don’t talk to them, only gesture. If you’re in a team with them and they’re building a camp, build them a decked out garage with a fusion generator and power armor station. Show them your own badass base. Show them your best outfits and power armor, whatever you think would be interesting to beginners. Then vanish into the night, forever burning that early game memory into random players minds. 
---
I had this idea as well! So far anything I've tried to tame could only be pacified though. Some real potential there for sure.
---
You realize Final Fantasy 14 cost 60 when it first came out ( eight years ago) and was a flop. Such a BIG flop that they fired people and got new ones to revamp it.
---
a quick copy/paste of the original game on wiki should prove how bad it was.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final\_Fantasy\_XIV\_(2010\_video\_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV_(2010_video_game))
---
2 weeks late? No. Im seeing gaming media turn around and say "okay maybe its not THAT bad" but the majority of their autistic followers are still screeching reeeee at anyone who has anything remotely positive to say about the game.
---
I'm having fun playing it.  \*shrug\*  
---
Thank you for saying this.
---
I do when it kills ghouls before I can, I don't mind people tagging enemies, this is no different than use TSE weapons, it's selfish .. I plan to to start blowing up camps if this happens too often. Kill them like the rest of us.
---
Oof
---
When I read it I thought AT the workshop, not across the whole map.
---
Cool, if you do a final build let me know, I might work  on my base tonight, we will see, still need to get motivated.
---
Just completed that at level 55.  They were all Mr Gutsys both Majors and Colonel.  Didn't die but used all my plasma grenades.  Helped I had a scorched beast attacking also.
---
Minding my own business...
---
I logged into the golf course, Scorch beast battle, travel to Watoga, head to my Mayoral office, over run with 10-1000 Mr. Gusty lvl 52’s,  logged out. Log back in, complete a few rounds of Monster Bash, head to scrap winnings at the Watoga station and die several times from I don’t know what. 
---
Is this from a game glitch?  I respawned 4 times and died each time.  Traveled back to my base and all seemed fine.  Just curious 
---
(I did hit the scorch beast a few times before heading into hotel.)
---
Thanks in advance! 
---
Would suck if you didn’t have much food and stiff to stay hydrated and constantly was in the red cause then you don’t have a lot of AP 
---
Plot twist: I deal with both. 
---
Source: Two stepdaughters since ages 2 and 4. 
---
Weep for me. 
---
Sorta like the cutting edge game design with FO76 lmao.  
---
&gt;So balances should only happen in MMOs? Is that what you're saying? This is a good one.
---
I'll agree that's subjective. but factually, lots of people enjoy these weapons immensely. and you want to rain on their parade for no good reason, seeing as this isn't a mmo or competitive game in the caliber of Overwatch, if you draw that distinction. do balance on a """multiplayer""" game really outweighs fun? I should think not.
---
&gt;Yeah man, it's totally a fact that Fallout 76 is singleplayer.
---
it is. unless you can prove what I said is wrong and there's some detriment to playing solo.
---
&gt;Oh! The canvas card! Here's where I know you have no arguments left.
---
you implied Bethesda's word is good for it. the biggest piece of evidence as to why you're wrong is the canvas bag.
---
&gt;Again, good thing this isn't an MMO then, so it doesn't have to apply to MMO standars!
---
doesn't change the fact market = cash for items. otherwise, a "healthy economy" as you put it yourself means squat and shouldn't have brought it up to begin with.
---
&gt;Yes, we've been over this again and again and again.
---
and you still can't seem to differentiate my personal thoughts from facts, so I keep hammering it.
---
&gt;you think that this is a single-player game. It can be played solo, for sure. But that doesn't make it single-player.
---
it's the opposite. it *can* be played in parties, but that doesn't make it multiplayer. if your line of thought was correct, there'd be some detriment to playing it solo. there isn't. and most of the mechanics would be geared towards multiplayer. they aren't.
---
&gt;And second:
---
I've addressed this already.
---
Make the healing minor, and maybe make it so if you get too irradiated, you get feral-like penalties. Like having a debuff to INT, or being auto-marked as wanted, since you're feral. And make the debuffs get progressively worse the more irradiated you are.
---
It's not based on one cunt. Literally everywhere i fucking go there's a shitload of assholes like that guy that just...absolutely treat anyone that enjoys the game like shit. Hell even here in the comments there's people like that. Like...For fuck's sake man, open your eyes. The anti-FO76 circle jerk isn't reasonable. In fact they're anything but reasonable.
---
I encountered something where I got the notification I was attacking another player even though I was standing at my camp doing nothing. Said player wrecked me several times. I blocked them and traveled away but it happened again, and he somehow knew right where I was even though he was blocked. 
---
Also got destroyed without fighting back just like you described, I'm level 130 with 500 DR outside of PA and almost never leave pacifist mode. It gets really discouraging after a while. 
---
It was super fun before every shmuck had a duped tse shotgun, fights would last almost a minute each round, having to take cover, flying around, it was great.
---
 Caps be damned, as long as we were both having fun and kept going i could care less. how much I was losing/gaining.
---
Now its a one-shot-trade-off.  A thought for a quick fix would be replace some of the novelty\* perk cards for explosive resistance?
---
\*blood sucker, quack doc, scrapper?...
---
Kill wendigos and mega sloths, they drop screws every time i have killed them
---
Where does it specifically and clearly say they can PVP you whenever wherever once they invade, not just at the workshop? It doesn't.
---
I think the OP assumed that workshop PvP happened in or around the workshop. That's a reasonable assumption. Someone contesting a location only to fast travel directly to you for a kill would surprise many who expect actual workshop PvP.
---
It warns you that others may PvP to take it. But it still is wanted. Makes sense to me if you do mission to clear it and then build it if someone takes it to that’s sort of like stealing. 
---
I just learned in monster mash that someone can kill u and they are not wanted. Lol.  Live and learn. That one is PvP but usually no one else there. I was just farming XP killing ghouls. Oh well. 😂
---
Im still enjoying it. I mostly go around killing stuff then finding other players and dropping the gear for them. Its a fun game, but it is not fallout 4. Similar combat, not the same RPG.
---
This is so sad. Alexa, play Civilization
---
Over 500 hours and thinks the game was a let down...umm ok.  I'm at 376 hours and one of my top 10 games all time and I'm so old I played pong as a kid.
---
Definitely need a ton of free time and steel/copper
---
Hey man, you actually got 500 hours out of it. It got boring for me already, although I bought it a week ago. Idk what to do. I finished all the quests and now what? I dont feel like I remember any backatory although I tried to listen to thw holotapes and read most of the letters I picked up and terminals I came across. Ita just not the same as the previous fallouts and I regret it a lot.
---
What's really a pity is that people think it's OK to use perks as a band-aid for bad game design or bad server architecture
---
This is amazing 
---
Yeah I'll come back when private servers and modded are out back to playing fallout 4 now.
---
I'm leaving a comment here that I pposted elsewhere in this thread that I think better explains my position.
---
&gt;I respectfully disagree and I believe that if Subnautica developers could do it, a fully fledged AAA studio should have also been able to do it just as well if not better. Nothing stopped F76 from being released in early access and tested until it worked, then released. The fact it is MP should not be an excuse. They chose to make a MP game right? And lastly, their response afterwards was, in my opinion, lacking. It was a big turn off. And this is coming from a huge Bethesda supporter, but their reaction to this gave me pause. 
---
&gt;But honestly, I am happy that you enjoy the game! 
---
&gt;I hope you can also understand how I just do not want this standard of product release seen as sufficient in this industry, when in my eyes it is not. 
---
Now, granted I didnt know about the MP situation with Subnautica, but surely you can see how one game releasing as early access and one game being a full release changes the dynamic of your argument a bit right? 
---
I do appreciate your reply though. 
---
Mix Rad emitters and the tesla arcs. The hazmat suit makes you crazy squishy. 
---
Reasonable price. There’s ya problem. 
---
Bethesda doesnt, the entire fucking gaming industry does.
---
Minus the few decent developers out there, but also the hardworking ones working at the comoanies with shit business practices, tbh feel sorry for any digital artist eorking at EA right now.
---
I might have a screenshot from a fight I had with one.  Let me see if I can find it.
---
Nice.
---
I loved setting up trap bases in rust.
---
I'll have to take a shot at doing this. 
---
POE I've spent nothing on and get increasing content. TF2 has been around pretty much forever. Minecraft is 30 now, I bought that when it was 10. Planetside 2 I grinded up and got to lead platoons of 48 people without spending a dime.  
---
What was your point? 
---
Atrocious. I love it.
---
I guess it would but I've never had that problem, always have plenty of food and water, whether from finding it or what I killed. Even better now that I can swap between full can do and pharma farma depending on what I need.
---
And I do know that I will get lots of hate on this comment, but this is only my opinion. I dont mean to offend anyone.
---
Make sure you have a TON of the emitters. Enough of them will overwhelm non power armor or hazmat
---
Dang your set 
---
Yeah, I find the limbs all time. Its the ultralight combat armor chest I can't find.
---
All the time and only on this game. Nothing to worry about. Just had 2 in 30 minutes 
---
It wasn't the allure.
---
Pre launch all they talked about was how to protect ppl from griefers.
---
Its tuned heavily that way at the detriment of pvp. They did talk about a new mode coming shortly.
---
Hopefully its a bit more compelling.
---
Im just south of robco research center. I'm close enough so that if the event AWOL Armaments spawns im always in range to get the quest pop up. Its my favorite farm spot. Plus its fun to get use out of artillery.
---
Which is another one of the "God-damn humans working at cross purpose in Appalachia", Enclave killing the Chinese survivors as they were considering coming out to the responders took yet another toolset off the table.  What could they have added to the responders or firebreathers?
---
You mean 3600 .38 rounds?
---
I get the same blue screen as well. Not sure why though either, I upgraded my drive and no other game has ths error.
---
I’ve gotten that recently but my hard drive is an external USB one that runs every game faster than the solid HD inside the PS4 I think it’s just the game 
---
It slows the scorch queen. 
---
Thanks for all of your help!
---
This is how we left caves. We stopped complaining and returned to our fur.
---
If you are on Xbox I can gift you a few hundred rounds
---
You'll get down voted for anything, I see people asking basic questions and get down voted just for that. Half the people here are trash, don't let it get to you.
---
I think this is one of those "spymasters" things - yknow, the programs that advertise everything sock related to you cuz they know you just bought a pair of socks? etc. I saw quite a bit about fo76 because two of my friends got it, and there was some stupid shit bethesda did...yknow, the works. But probly 2 weeks or so after I really haven't seen anything much about it. If you are, you're still playing it, watching things about it, and the programs are picking up on that showing you all the popular stuff which is mostly hate. I really don't see anything anymore. So, what I'm saying is, disconnect from *all* of it. Give it a bit of time. then come back.  
---
I think it's exactly the point. You've proven you make bad decisions, so how can we believe your story? =p
---
Jokes aside, that actually seems like a nasty bug or potentially something which could be exploited.
---
No what's really a pity is people with no qualifications thinking they get to decide what constitutes bad game design 
---
Glowing mass?
---
A *Ice* gun
---
That fires *explosive* rounds?
---
Wat
---
I think if we just had separate PvP servers they would be empty or full of 1 clan. Instead, I think things like battlegrounds or maybe PvP areas (with rewards) will help with the thirst for PvP. As of right now, there is no reward for basically any PvP at all.
---
This is the best thing ever! hahahaha!
---
500 hours is pretty good value for money.
---
Here was the first attempt at my base that I was satisfied with. I made a few prior to this but wasn't satisfied. However with all the camp issues, I built better ones but they got deleted. I still get people commenting on this one, but I have long moved away, but was cool at the time.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ZBg8d1i](https://imgur.com/a/ZBg8d1i)
---
You waited 3 years for this? Then you would know this was basically a huge trial run and youd know they stated this from the beginning, youd also know this isnt fallout 5 and so you werent actually waiting 3 years for it at all and youre just talking out your arsehole.
---
Also refunds? I refunded mine. Get rekt.
---
Berserker Gatling plasma?
---
Where did you get those neon letters?
---
Yup, its why i chose to highlight a few key perks. I saw a level 130ish duper. I tried trading with him and his only weapon was a prime TSE combat shotgun. Thats sort of what inspired me to want to type all this up. It just looked so boring to play the game with 1 weapon in your inventory.
---
My biggest problem is that Bethesda has not apologized or acknowledged anything. I still play it, but I just want someone to say "we did a terrible job, we are going to own it".   
---
They told us they would communicate more. I haven't heard from anyone for weeks. They told us more would happen. That hasn't b een happening. This isn't worth arguing until someone outright says "we know its bad". 
---
The food you get from feed the people gives an xp buff. Also sleep before doing anything. Then There are perks that boost do while in a team. That's all that I know of. 
---
I'm also trying to level up as fast as possible atm. If your on Xbox I we could launch a nuke and farm whitesprings for awhile. 
---
Yeah they put in alot of work. The game when it was released was garbage but after years of updates it is legitimately good. 
---
The face for damage and wings to get her to ground 
---
Hoping one day I'll see an update that means I'll get my money's worth. 
---
You being fed up doesnt change the fact that the game absolutely was a travesty at launch and still has trouble even *functioning*
---
That's crazy, I seriously feel like I'm moving at least 1.5x faster lmao
---
I would posted that screenshot to every media form
---
You find the plans to build them and you'll get them higher level events
---
We have a lot in common (both mine are stepndaughters since age 1.5 and 4...first time I met the youngest we played barbies for 4 hours).
---
Can the players open the security door if you're not quick enough on hitting the activate button? Or they have to do a level 3 lock pick which would take too long to crack before they roast? 
---
Early levels, I would stand on roads so they had to burrow farther away.   Nope.  Teleport right through structures, no problem.
---
U don't a riflemen has a plethora of weapons many autos in the game 
---
I enjoy the game, but I have stopped playing until more content is released. I'm bored of it. I have over 200 hours on it so far. And I am flat out done with everything I want to do in the game. Hopefully they will add things faster than what they are currently doing.
---
Come see me in game, I'll replace the ammo.  Have a ton of 10mm.
---
Just transfer all your caps to an alt so you dont lose anything for being wanted 👍
---
There a screenshot at the top of this article.
---
http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/how-to-claim-workshops-in-fallout-76/
---
&gt;"Other players may initiate PvP with you by attempting to claim it from you"
---
So they try to claim it which starts PvP and then they go find you just like they could follow you if you were in PvP with them. 
---
I mean, it is pretty clear.
---
Yep
---
Its a heavy weapon I think
---
I was able to retake the mining exhibit work shop without being there... Twice! I have dismantled all structures and left and still took it back. 
---
Doesnt offer much I just drop the nuke in low lvl areas
---
How sad for you that people don't share your opinions. 
---
It was acceptable to me because nothing I experienced really hindered my enjoyment of the game other than not being able to connect at launch.
---
Fuck Fallout 76 and fuck Bethesda/Zenimax even more for releasing this hot garbage. Y’all can defend it all you want but if this game didn’t have Fallout n the title it would be regarded as one of the worst games ever created. The only reason people even play this trash still is because it’s a “fallout game”. Fuck Bethesda for making a mockery of my most beloved franchise
---
To be fair I walk up to them and they disappear.
---
I feel the opposite, like for me it's stopped working
---
I get that, but I dont understand why, Bethesda said from the beginning this was entirely new to them and it would be a very rocky road, considering that I dont think they should have charged 60$ for it, but still, I hope companies DO try this shit again, shit if nobody tried anything they werent comfortable with the gaming industry would be EAgames right now.
---
Based of the extensive collaboration and communication with the community as promised by Bethesda after the rough launch we have absolutely no idea and no information whatsoever.
---
(I love the game but it’s now the 8th January and no contact whatsoever)
---
Hey man, stop ragging on his ^^^^^Concentration C.A.M.P.
---
He says in a different comment that he allows people to return for their stuff. 10/10 great experience he’s providing 
---
Word.
---
Thats how I understood the post. 
---
To all those saying "thats how it works". Please explain to me, within the warning you get. Does it explicitly say that when you take a workshop that a player can travel to you and kill you without a bounty .. OUTSIDE OF THE WORKSHOP.
---
I've never read it in all the ones I've claimed O.O.
---
So if you were able to, would you change the game’s state at release?
---
When they slapped the label on the vault saying 'The best and brightest of America' they meant 'The best and brightest *sociopaths* of America'.
---
Whitesprings, it’s a bit of a hike to get there at low levels.
---
Watoga too, even more of a hike.
---
Settle down? Settle? Settlement? Another settlement needs our help?
---
Love this haha
---
Yes it is complained about hourly on this sub. 
---
&gt;I’m chaotic neutral! You have to accept it!
---
So much this.
---
Yeah that was one of my motivators to make this post. I see level 60s with TSE handmades and just shake my head. They're destroying what chance at fulfillment and achievement that 76 can give them.
---
My weapons aren't anything amazing, but i have an insane amount of strong 3 star armor that i'm waiting to sell. Its sort of a PSA too kinda. Legitimate TSE guns are not that common, duping is what made them as common as they are. I think i've had maybe 2 TSE guns drop at all.
---
LOL sure kid, I lost brain cells just watching that vid for one minute but god, you played trash like that for years. Have fun with that.
---
All energy weapons need a durability buff.
---
Barbarian with 15 STR, Scaly Skin, and Strange in Numbers with 3 mutated teammates puts me at around 200 DR or so, plus Blocker to reduce even more damage. Throw in Talons, Twisted Muscles, and Glow Sight for offense and you'll be fine. If you're solo just swap Strange in Numbers for Lone Wanderer.
---
Maybe I was bugged before and just thought I was moving faster, and now it's working as intended. Not sure.
---
I have almost all the mods for most armors, and as far as I can tell, the level makes no difference to the chance. Also the body part doesn't matter: You can scrap minimum-level arms to unlock everything.
---
I just crashed after I got the eye, and it was gone when I logged back in. Quest was on the next step. Went back to the bodies, and Shannon had it on her, along with the Holotape from the previous step.
---
it just doesnt hold up. it just *doesnt*...   
---
i played in the beta, and having issues still going on that were in the beta is really bothering me. the pvp is garbage, i have to lie to myself to make the story work in my head... dont get me wrong, i am a huge fallout zealot, i just... dont... like... this one. i like it less than fallout tactics. tactics was a good game in comparison, and its story made more sense.   
---
idk, i have 32k hours on new vegas, close to a literal years worth of play time, and i have nearly as much on f03... and this game i have put down at 500 hours. that should mean something to someone. that should be a red flag somewhere. if I cant play the game for more than 500 hours, then its no good. i probably would have put this game down a lot sooner if i wasnt predisposed to loving the game no matter what its choices were. 
---
Yeah I agree, for a while I was literally keeping exorbitant scraps just b/c it seemed uncommon, so I better stock up.  [This guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CMHez8jQUjRcTUDOWjXKNor9yFnr23iPgo84d58_VrY/edit?usp=sharing) was pretty helpful for rethinking that.  
---
I agree that an extra 200 might be the sweet spot, but at the same time you'll always be able to fill that extra space in no time and start to have to manage it and have it feeling tight again.  
---
It might be nice to have a separate stashes for Junk, Ammo, Weapons with unique limits.  Then you'd be thinking about how much of each is impacting your weight.  For weapons it would be dope to have a display case, rack that was # of item based rather than weight and accessible only by you (i.e. C.A.M.P only, other players can see the display case but not open it).
---
Pretty sure this falls under rule 4.
---
Jesus. That's terrifying. Props on the creativity, though. It looks like it says something just on the other side of the door, on the inside. I couldn't catch it. Does it say something, or am I seeing things?
---
Thanks man. Now I know why all the noobs run away when I try and give them stuff....
---
Hmmm interesting. I've been looking for mods for the ultracite it would be nice to know if t51 plans work too
---
Well then you probably know where I work... And good job on the signs I guess? :D
---
Got it. Thank you!! 
---
Thank a lot man. I'm also using the "All Night Long" perk in the meantime to minimize the attention to eating and drinking. Stacking perks and mutations to remove the need for them completely would be crazy!
---
shut-up and take my up-nuke
---
10 hours? Bugs galore? Shit I encountered my first proper bug at about 25 hours. What on earth did you do?
---
Im glad they tried something new, I hope they DO do it again, gaming would be bloody boring if nobody wanted to try something different, witcher wouldnt exist, divinity OS 2 wouldnt exist, shit. They said from the beginning this would be a mess because it was entirely new territory to them, I dont know what on earth you expected.
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
People saying the same thing over and over. No joke, this has been said over and over.
---
Not to mention we were lead to believe that BGS Maryland, Austin, Zenimax Online Studious, and ID software ***ALL*** played major roles into the work done with this game. I honestly feel like ZOS did the cash shop if anything. 
---
This is fucking amazing. Well done.
---
There are a few games with more content at that price point. Horizon Zero Dawn might objectively have more content (story and things to do). Battlefield 4 might objectively have more content (100+GB). Both are visually better looking.
---
Both have often been less than $20 for all their game.
---
Fallout might have more quests (infinite, online experience) and more things (it'll eventually break 100gb in data and that doesn't count the online connection) but then you have to ask yourself, is the content worth it?
---
Is grinding and sustaining your character every few minutes, or managing your inventory a worthwhile experience? Are bugs and crashing games (I can reliably recreate a crash at this point after the nuke patch) worthwhile? Obviously there's something good about this game. I'm at over 200 hours.
---
But isn't the quality of that content worth measuring just as much as the quantity? 
---
Another user mentioned a combat zone, mich like the one in the division (not sure what the name of the area is) but I think that could yield to a remedy as well.

You evil bastard. I love it.

Ok set minimum bounty you have to reach 
---
They are a possible reward from completing the scorch beast queen event
---
Okay? If Bethesda doesn’t care to respond why shouldn’t people continue to point out the flaws of their games?
---
You on dial-up 12kbps? I hear thats pretty great for gaming.

Did this actually kill them
---
NMS definitely got hate, but it died out pretty quick. At least you weren't seeing it all over the internet after 2 or 3 weeks. Not this multiple months long attack against 76. I get that the target audience was much larger for 76, and thusly upset far more people. 
---
But I'm with OP. I don't like the fact that I can't go anywhere remotely associated with gaming and not have some anti-76 sentiment be the first thing I see. But this is just my opinion overall with gaming. Everybody has become so angry. Grabbing pitchforks the moment there is one aspect they don't particularly like. 
---
With 76 it was warranted, because Bethesda really did shit the bed. But this continued tirade isn't going to change much now. They've heard what needed to be heard. Over and over again. They'll change it or they won't, and at some point it feels less like attacking the devs and more like attacking anybody who dares to enjoy the game. And I think that's where OP is coming from.
---
Just waiting for the right time?
---
If they can ruin the dupers, I will be happy. Until then, fallout 76 sucks. You can't have a forced multiplayer game and not judge it by the people who you have no choice to play with. The fact that Bethesda has not addressed this issue makes the game and the company bad. Sorry
---
Haha, so evil.  Awesome!!!
---
Tricentennial isn’t worth it IMO. You just get a couple skins you’ll probably never use. 
---
Scorchbeast Queen drops the recipes. 
---
You can head over to fo76bazaar and scoop one for serum for  around 500 caps. That may be easier.
---
They're taking up space in the server one way or another, what's it matter if they want to play heroes and soak up some xp? 
---
Not all glowing ghouls are bloated, only higher level glowing ones
---
Autism personified.
---
I love the game bitches. I didn't play fallout 4 though so expectations are lower than you over privileged children that didnt get spanked as a child.
---
Well, the blood is high for gamers who feel increasingly used and abused by game companies.   And Bethesda has been held up on the pedestal for a long time.  This is just a hard course correction. It was a bad time to release 76 right after the Diablo Immortal fiasco.  Bethesda/76 are just unjustly taking the heat IMO but I can admit it is functioning as a scapegoat in a fashion. 
---
Please do more of these.
---
where is it at i cant find it?
---
I constantly ask myself that question.
---
Really? I probably would've mini nuked myself just to make sure the building gets totalled.
---
With the sneak and escape artist perks, coupled with high agility, I simply use armor with carry weight reduction and other useful affixes (I do have one piece with harder to detect). I rarely get spotted, and when I do, I simply hide again.
---
Also, ultra-light mod on everything.
---
There definitely is a way to tame them and send them back to camp but I don’t know the details (there are videos on how). I do believe you don’t get the option to tame if your CAMP budget cant afford them but don’t know how much they cost. You have to have rank 3 animal friend for animals and from what I’ve read rank 3 animal friend and rank 3 wasteland whisperer for some creatures. 
---
Red Dead Online is dead but Red Dead Single player is one of the best games ever created so most of us don’t gaf about RDO. I got more than my $60 worth from the single player and I don’t play the online. FO76 on the other hand I was bored with shortly after the beta as the post game content is pretty much trash and the game is impossible to play for more than 10 minutes without several frame rate drops. Not to mention character animations, object textures, and AI intelligence for enemies are on par with games being released about a decade ago. Also, with the red Dead argument I didn’t really have much expectation going in to Red Dead as I was more hype for Fallout. Bethesda made a mockery of one of our most beloved franchises of all time and if 76 wasn’t Fallout game it would be regarded is one of the worst AAA games ever created. The only reason people even play and defend this game is because it is a Fallout game. 
---
That does not clearly and in detail say they can PVP you anywhere, and it is very easy to assume it is talking about the workshop specifically.
---
Coming from someone who bought the tricentennial, go with the original lmao
---
Wasn't that the beginning of nuka-world?
---
Stimpak not a drug. It's made from antiseptic and blood pack. Good ol' donor blood.
---
When it allows it to double dip on damage buffs, ya it kinda is.
---
I think the issue is we can't get numbers. We see no HP nor on hit damage :(.
---
Bethesda, ftw
---
Do you use combat armor ? marine armor ? Orr?
---
Haha if I encounter somebody in a railroad station I’ll place myself in the bathroom and start puking. 
---
Definitely hungover lol
---
Me too. Not the first game it’s happened in but lately in the past week it’s been a constant annoyance.
---
The skins you get with tricent are not even all that cool. Not compared to the stuff you can buy for 20 in atom shop. Blackbird is wayyy better than tricent paint 
---
Oof I thought he was talking about the green glowing ones 😂😂
---
Just reached the control room. Sorry it took so long I accidentally scraped the damage mainframes so had to find them
---
Tricentennial comes with a pretty cool PA paint and some other little bits. 
---
Do ... do they have cocks?
---
I got the tri edition and you get some skins for the laser rifle 10mm and power armor. I think they look cool and I use them, you also get a special salute emote which I use all the time
---
Oh I think comparing Fallout 76 to Subnautica is *seriously* flawed, right from the start. I'm just saying.. if you *are* going to make a flawed comparison like that at least trying to get the facts right as best you can.
---
I've done that plenty its chill 
---
I am not to sure on that I haven't played in a while but i do remember it being pretty fun to run through there with all the explosions and traps setting off behind me haha.
---
Selct the power armor chassis from your inventory then place it by hitting x. Repeat for each set
---
yeah idk, something about the story, its like super unmemorable... like i instinctively DONT want to remember it... 
---
every time the overseer said something like "i remember this place being____ before the war!" i would think in my head "ACKTUALLY what you mean to say is "what vault-tec taught you this place looked like before the war!"... and that isnt fun. doing that over and over. and over. because the story just doesnt make sense if everyone was from before the war... 
---
I just hope Fallout 76 with mod servers turns into a bat shit Fallout version of Garry's Mod.  
---
It's inconvenient (which is why I suggested an easier way to swap), but to optimize your build, you'd want 3 points worth of perk to swap in and out for Hacker/Lockpicking.  
---
You'd also potentially swapping Starched genes on and off.  Could have situations where you're approaching a location with Covert Operative and then swapping it off once your inside/closer.  Team/Non-team.  Camp/non-camp.
---
Obviously, right now it is inconvenient to swap, but a solid perk like Good Doggy is not being used except for the split second you are eating dog food.
---
So, yeah, loads and load of swap options, but it's daunting as fuck to even think about it right now b/c it's so shitty to swap in/out + your unused perks are cluttered b/c of packs and not being able to get rid of unwanted/duplicated perk cards.
---
This is fallout 100%. Nicely done. This is how the spirit lives on. 
---
Not to be defensive of Bethesda, I'm as irritated to them as most, but how could they know? I mean the first time the glitch was done would have been completely to chance. Beth are novice when it comes to multiplayer, if the same method exists in other games, they may not have known, or even thought to look, and I doubt it'd ever have happened during internal testing. 
---
But that doesn't excuse them, they should have fixed it as soon as possible. 
---
Just time in genera 😜
---
I found the X01 calibrated shocks once, I traded it to my friend for an X01 jet pack and 2 calibrated excavator shocks. I regret that decision. 
---
Back to my original post, there should be a test.
---
Thankyou for your comments, weve talked to our guys in HR and will have Todd Howard personally come to your door with an apology in the form of a beautiful serenade. We hope this will make you feel better about our game so that we can continue to work on improving it in the foreseeable future.
---
-Bethesda
---
If you build on an acid deposit, you can make a 2x1 room where they take damage.   I put a door to nowhere with lockpick skill 0 with a sign that said “hurry”. It doesn’t do much damage, but they cant fast travel.  
---
I had a friend be wanted and hide in the back.  Lurking in victims.  They pass the tripwire and close the garage doors in front and behind them.  They’re then trapped trying to claim the bounty.  Because it’s my base and not his, the victim becomes waned when they pick the lock and I toss a MIRV grenade and dispense of the bounty hunter.  A little more trollish but still fun 
---
Note that some mods can't be unlocked by scrapping. Deep Pocketed, Ultralight and Dense for most armors, plus the BoS combat material. You have to buy those, usually from the Grafton vendors.
---
I wish they let them still all fit in a single stack again. This was my main seller until my armor page was stupid long.
---
Yep, stealth sniper with VATS.
---
Headshot - dead, headshot - dead, headshot - dead, repeat until reload (lever action rifle).
---
If I’m seen I runaway and sneak again and they lose me pretty fast (ghouls and mutants are easy to outrun and lose), then I pick them off from distance in the same way.
---
When you can kill 5 of them in 5 shots without having a TSE weapon and not alerting them you can more than handle your own.
---
If for some reason you’re not getting the stealth bonus despite not being detected you can still kill them in two shots each (same if they actually do detect you, two headshots is all it takes, or one crit).
---
And this is without using stims or manipulating health levels to have higher damage and special stats through perks
---
I'm with you. I bought it for $30 two weeks ago and I'm loving it thus far. I have only experienced one major issue so far, which was low fps on a good computer. There was an easy fix though, and I've been enjoying the game ever since. I'll readily admit that Bethesda cheesed the launch like nobody's business, but the hate train is over the top.
---
i disagree. i have 6 times that number in witcher 3. i paid more for fallout 76. 
---
Should also be noted... me enjoying the game is **not** an endorsement of its release state. Those two are not mutually exclusive, it IS possible to enjoy a game and still be critical of its development and release handling.
---
TL;DR  I don't like when people talk shit about a dodgy game that I enjoy.
---
Had a player today freak out and start shooting when they saw me in the Asylum today lol they stopped when they realized I was friendly lol
---
No problem to point out flaws, but when you sound like a broken record. Tends to get annoying, instead of people repeating themselves just move on. 
---
" I think it’s important to let Bethesda know that the release of the game was unacceptable. "
---
It's been what 2 months, how long are you and everyone else that types this out going to go on and on about the "release".
---
So this gets gold but when you suggest hitler had the right idea youre a racist.
---
Ok then
---
Thank you. The world is now a better place because you decided to stop playing a game and graced us with this announcement 
---
I mean you did go in full well knowing that this car was faulty. People have been posting videos about the car and the subreddit is blowing up about why it’s no good. I guess you went ahead and bought it though. 
---
Look at *Ugg* here! Takin' it like a *champ*!
---
Sorry, player, *(leans)* but you know... There. Are. Rules.
---
I dont get why people put their base at a popular nuke spot
---
I thought the lowest was 1. If its 0, ill try that but it seems like people are wary of it. Ive heard of people screwing over people in trading. 
---
I’m not going to say you are right, and I’m not going to say you are wrong. You already know what is what, but I’ll just offer a solution. Watch new people. The people whose media you consume are probably the kind of people that benefit largely from these kinds of circlejerks. Take note I said “probably.” For instance, I haven’t played Minecraft since Ocelots and Hoppers were added to the Xbox 360 version, but I still watch EthosLab because he’s a swell guy and is interesting when I’m burnt out on other stuff. I quit playing League of Legends, but I still watch BoxBox because watching outplays and funny fails as well as his personality are all what I watch for. Flesh out the media you consume a bit more, and go back to those other people for content you’ll really enjoy.
---
If you can supply the mats, Violet Flux and the legs, then talk to PresidentJoker in game, he built Calibrated Shocks for my Utracite armor.
---
Lol you pay people to cheat and make the game worse for everyone. Good job. 
---
Sounds like the unstable isotope mutation.
---
You should video this! That's a great idea.
---
why are you so dumb dude. you act like a fucking kid
---
Yes they died
---
We should both be nominated for sainthood. 
---
Works for me but my character seems to burn through food and water with the mutation. Even with three ranks of the All Night Long perk. Is that expected?
---
I would guess a bug since that perk is for melee items no? 
---
Most unique clothing sells for about 25-30. Ranger, golf, civil war, etc.   Not hats, though.   
---
Well once I read some of the posts here the actual issue now seems to be if this is by design by bethesda, which I hope as hell it is not.
---
Now if I take a workshop and I am not on my main toon god forbid with some duped superbullshit TSE gun these people have I will put absolutely minimal effort into it, and if I see it being invaded I will just dc from the server. So now the question is if that is good design, I would say hell no.
---
It was a shit launch, if we forget about it then Bethesda definitely has. I love Fallout, I really like Fallout 76. This comes from a fan who gives a damn.
---
It says "fire!" a bunch of times
---
I kinda wanted the bunkers to have more stuff in them than they did. In fact Free-states kinda sucks in content, it's why I think Ash Heap and the Mire will be added to first in content. I guess Toxic Valley needs help too. The Forest, Cranberry Bog, and Savage Divide feel like they have a decent amount of stuff.
---
They spoke about someone with a bunkerful of Sugar Bombs, that's the content I want
---
They have to pick it lol
---
On PC: press the button on the Power Armor Chassis in your apparel list to use it just like you would press to wear a regular armor piece or to consume a food or water item (E) instead of the button to drop (R).
---
On PS4, I’m sure the advice is the same but with different buttons.
---
Newegg just had it on sale for $25 if you sign up to the newsletter. Not sure if still on sale. The PC version is just a code you redeem via Bethesda.
---
&gt;Is pvp fairly common for most people?
---
I'm maybe 120 hours into the game and have only experienced maybe five (seven, if you count a couple of people who attacked my camp when I wasn't there) people try to goad me into pvp by attacking me from out of the blue. I never attack them back as there is always something in game I'd rather do, but I've had a couple of them persist in following me around, attacking repeatedly, and basically being pests until they give up and go away. I'm annoyed by it so my response is always to dawdle, send them friendly waves, and stimpak myself until they give up.
---
I've found that the number of people attempting to draw me into pvp was higher when I was a much lower level, which tells you something about the players doing the attacking.
---
Thats one HOT camp you have. After the visit to Hell you can respawn back into Hell AND take your material possessions with you when you die. Love it.
---
If you continue the main quest line, you eventually get access to a place called the enclave. There you can buy a marsupial mutation serum, but it costs a ton of caps. 
---
I wanted the marsupial mutation too and I just swam around in irradiated water until I got it 
---
- Every person on the bandwagon.
---
Watoga shopping centre
---
Those players are trying to bait you into getting a bounty yourself; at that point, they kill you and get bounty caps from you.
---
When their fun is a detriment to the fun of others? For sure, they should be nerfed and balanced, in line with the rest of the weapons. By that logic, those who enjoy destroying CAMPs should be left alone. Why rain on their parade?
---
Do I need proof that Fallout 76 is multiplayer? Seriously? Jesus, this is some next level delusion. The denial is so strong it seems to blind your logic.
---
So... you are comparing the devs stating what they want the game to be to some marketing fiasco in which they have no saying at all? Okay. Weak, but not your weakest argument.
---
Oh I do differentiate them very well. I mean, I'm not the one claiming that a game in which you are put together with 23 other players, which directly affect your gameplay, is single-player.
---
Definition incoming... Market: "a market is defined as the sum total of all the buyers and sellers in the area or region under consideration. (...) The value, cost and price of items traded are as per forces of supply and demand in a market". Weird, I don't see the word "cash" anywhere on that definition... but oh well, I guess I should just trust you since you are a reputed economist.
---
Okay, I get it, *you* think this game is single-player. I'm sorry that the devs, Bethesda as a whole, and pretty much everyone who isn't delusional disagree with you.
---
No problem! Part of the fun is seeing a map with a lot of new players. Even tho the game has some issues, its good to see people picking it up. Anything we can do to help out. 
---
Nah. You’re just paying people to cheat. Nothing else you say justifies that. You’re cheating yourself to. That’s basically the endgame now so congratulations you can grind a little easier lmao. 
---
Thats what I said! lol
---
Don't get the tricentenial. Not worth it. The weapon skins are for weapons nobody really uses. Posters are lame. The vault boy outfit is cool, but there are plenty of outfits in game. The salute and power armor skins are ok, but you could if you really wanted to spend the extra money, you could buy better emotes and power armor skins from the atom shop
---
She was not wanted. 
---
Being in the event area will increase the difficulty of the queen fight.
---
Nah I'm not waking up in a cart again!
---
Von't everyone gets in ze haus, ja?
---
Either over the cliffs to the west or near the bottom of the golf course, I'd say. Keeps your camp right outside the nuke zone unless someone really wants to nuke your camp lol
---
"that's sketchy as hell" ...no shit haha. Bloody brilliant though.
---
Best thing I've seen in this game so far. Hands down. Good job.
---
My only question his how did you build your Camp in town? I thought that area was a no build zone.
---
I wish we had a perk to re-roll Legendaries once; because, how often is a robot going to poison you? 
---
Out of curiosity, how many points of charisma do you have, and are you using any gear to boost your charisma?
---
Never have took her down. No one is got strong enough weapons when we go lol. 
---
Get Green Thumb and harvest the pitcher plants in the cranberry bog. 8 adhesive per plant. But do it quickly, they spit poison if you're not fast enough. 
---
That's fine! I disagree. 
---
Cheers mate. 
---
I would choose not to support the assholes that cheat and (supposedly) cause server issues. It’s fine though. Those morons are cheating themselves.m in the end. Really takes the joy out of good drops when you paid a cheater for the best. 
---
Im strongly in favor of pvp, for what should be obvious for devs: pve makes them have to write the story/events, While pvp we make our own events/ stories.
---
 How long do you expect players to just kill bots(any AI) which are all boring to fight, the mothman was kinda cool but in general every bot is simple. Players are fun because we are all different, and unpredictable.  It's a sandbox, some people are going to be dicks, welcome to a post-apocalyptic multiplayer game, where dying doesn't penalize you in any real way.
---
What you mentioned that got me excited was factions, imagine each landmark having a bonus/debuff  relative to a players faction, or the npc of that landmark attacking someone who is not of that territory.  
---
That said there are things that need to be fixed, like the damage exploits, dupes, and server hoping in general.
---
To me in most cases common sense would dictate they are talking about fighting OVER THE WORKSHOP.
---
Fighting halfway across the map randomly to me does not really constitute fighting over a workshop.
---
Now consider that they can take the workshop and now hold it, why the fuck can they still PVP you anytime later and collect full caps which is what this guy did (I didn't even care that much about the shop and ignored it, he ganked me at harpers about 10-15 mins AFTER he had claimed the workshop from me).
---
Thank you for your advice. But the explosion I saw looks like a green/yellow spherical blast, rather than the mushroom cloud caused by the unstable isotope mutation.
---
That'd be so crazy making!
---
fo76bazaar on Reddit? 
---
middle of the map for cheapest fast travel costs anywhere on the map, fast travel point to Whitesprings nuke zones, the spot I picked is the flattest/biggest spot i've seen in the game.
---
I know I shouldn't be surprised, but I just needed to vent because of this game breaking bug wasn't a thing I wouldn't have made this post.
---
It’s not gatekeeping to look down on people that encourage the cheaters. Especially considering the same people probably turn around and bitch about server stability. 
---
My build allows me to beat people to death with brass knuckles for 700 damage
---
That's the thing. I've already got the speed demon mutation, and I don't wanna get random ones and start trying to get rid of the ones I don't want and end up loosing the speed demon one. Man this blows. 
---
Wow, this is really cool, the illustrations are so good! Keep going, I want to see a journal entry of you fighting the scorchbeast queen 😁😁😁
---
Thanks for the post it is precisely what I meant/thought.
---
Don't forget also that once they claim your workshop from you, they can pvp you ANYWHERE at ANYTIME (even 20 minutes later) for full caps.
---
Nice touch, Beavis.
---
I agree. I was just saying some people out there don't care about it
---
Post it whenever you’re about to start it, you’ll usually get a decent amount of people to join and most at kitted out enough to kill her.
---
Yep. Idk how to hyperlink it &gt;&lt;

I have been playing quite extensively and enjoying the game a lot. However there are definitely some major bugs and issues with the game, some at points have made the game borderline unplayable.   
---
1) First issue is frequent blue screen  **CE**\-**34878**\-**0** errors when I'm looting, crafting, in my pipboy or most often when I'm in my stash. This happens mostly when over-encumbered, however happens frequently when I am not also. This is annoying especially when playing solo as going in to use a chem or drink water then crashing out in the middle of an instance is frustrating. Especially when if owning a workshop you then lose it. When doing inventory management with the stash, this happening repeatedly is an issue as it also makes any timed effects such as food spoiling all spoil.   
---
2) Second issue is my most frustrating one. Getting Stuck in Power Armour. I cannot stop this from happening. I've tried the suggested fixes in forums of deleting the chassis etc and finding a new one, dying and restarting the game etc. The simply lets me leave the Power Armour a single time, as soon as I enter any chassis again I am stuck. Why this is a problem is because most of my armour is deep pocketed and I enter power armour for hard fights and fight over-encumbered, then after I cannot fast travel, I cannot walk without losing all my AP and walking like a snail without resetting my whole game again. Fast travelling I have also found to be a single time fix, however I cannot fast travel when over-encumbered. This joint with the lack of Ballistic Fibre and high costs before level 37 perk left me at one point unable to use power armour and unable to repair my own armour, therefore permanently over-encumbered. In addition to this I have also lost my whole Power Armour set trying to fix the issue and get out of it
---
3) I have found other random buggy issues like being able to remove or move CAMP items therefore having to build the whole base from scratch because 1 wall will not move, scrap, store or anything. Another smaller bug is once when I moved my camp to another location I randomly had 74 defensive walls in storage even though I only had about 12 previously up. In turn this bugged out my storage making me unable to build even after scrapping everything in storage so it was completely empty. This was fixed by closing the game completely and re-opening after scrapping them, however is still a notable bug.  
---
These are the most frustrating bugs I have encountered within the game so far, if you have any further questions then please do not hesitate to ask  
---
What console though? I'm on xbox
---
Yeah I get it, I think it's related to the last ps4 update. I also get a constant " your headset is disconnected " ( even though it's not ) or my controller just shuts off, which in mid fight is annoying.
---
“Hans get ze flammenwerfer!”
---
Your statement is insane to me. I have 300 hours plus and i just saw a new giant enemy i had never seen before , it charged right at me and i jumped like a little girl. I killed it if course. A behemoth. 300 hours in and still surprised. 
---
100 hours alone is just collecting camp plans. And i still need alot. 
---
Like most mmos you gotta kill the scorchqueen a ton to get all the loot. One nuke doesnt cut it. Not to mention just play with people. I always bump into someone and play fir hours with them. I had 3 friends on my friendlist before fallout 76, now i have a ton. 
---
I simply pick based on the legendary mods. The type, etc. is secondary to me because stealth builds really should be hit very little (currently, I have two leather, two marine, one combat). Since I have like 3 strength and no power armor, I choose carry weight reduction as my primary focus. I do have harder to detect and stealth field each on one piece, but not really on purpose.
---
It was and I don't think anyone is going to forget anytime soon. It's also pretty comparable to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final\_Fantasy\_XIV\_(2010\_video\_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV_(2010_video_game))
---
Which I just got done commenting to another player about giving props to ff14. As if it was better than fallout 76 lol.
---
Seriously tho, I do have a bad memory but its really not that bad to forget about the launch already. You must really think low of people.
---
I see

He's on PC. 
---
Mind if I hop on this deal as well? I’m on xbox and I’m willing to trade for some mutations if you have any to spare. 
---
A chance for Farmer, Captain of Gondor, to show his quality. 
---
Whelp, just a matter of time until the game environment is exceedingly hostile.  Even if the dupe bug is fixed, unless the duplicated inventory is removed from the game these folks are gonna be around like this for a long, long time. 
---
Drop gun fu to max adrenaline.
---
Dump power user, grenadier, full charge. 
---
I got the same adhesive from stand next to Phoenix Watoga vendor back to back about 10 times last night server hopping for plans so... I disagree with 24hr cool down.
---
Giving extra time before you log into a new server (from main menu )  seems to help me with farming items ( plastic plates at high school ) 
---
I log out, wait 5 min, log in to new server bam everything almost every time is back.
---
You're a fucking maniac, I love it.
---
Nice! But no, it’s not drawn out, it’s clipped, if anything. But with weird pacing.
---
I'll try that next time. Thanks!
---
Oh and one more thing, it is not when they "start claiming it off you" They can take it and then pvp you at anytime for full caps, even in this case 10-15ish minutes later after this person took over my workshop.
---
I believe All Night Long only mitigates the negative effects, but doesn't slow down how quickly you lose thirst/hunger. Also, starving/dehydration prevents passive healing and fast travel, so healing factor isn't in effect at all.
---
It's all good no worries I found it. I'm new to Reddit lol so still learning all this stuff too. 
---
Regular for sure. I can’t even recommend buying that but it’s your money. The game’s ok and you’ll probably get $40 of entertainment out of it.

After completing the quests at the Camden fairgrounds, fast travel to the Charleston firehouse starts a daily quest for one of those (i.e. Dross Toss) every time you arrive there. Shouldn't daily quests only start when you're in proximity to the quest location? (i.e. "Hey Responders! *Sanjay* here!")
---
Fucking brilliant.
---
Duping has ruined the game and the fact Bethesda has been completely silent on the matter is inexcusable. I mean, their silence in general is a joke. 
---
Many things need to happen for this game to stay relevant in 2019.
---
I’ve got the marsupial mutation twice while in The Mire, that top right part of the map. Maybe players are more likely to get it there? 
---
Down vote purely for the political message.  Sorry just get so sick of everyone bringing political views into everything nowadays.

---
Are you, by chance, a professional athlete?
---
Better than the current use of ammo, but no, I don't like this idea.
---
I've been wandering all over the map before progressing through any of the story on my second character.  I'm almost at 50, just from exploring, crafting, killing, and events.  S'been pretty fun, and a nice change of pace.  No quest list and markers reminding me that I have stuff to do.
---
A hunk in a banana sling 
---
Explosive Harpoon Gun with Flechette rounds could be fun...
---
Is it when they hit glowing enemies? Could be the glow sight perk
---
A SM one shot me, I went back to the station, grabbed my 50, emptied round after round into the green cuck 
---
Can't think it would be difficult coding to add a block to spawning once an area has already been triggered with spawning active and then locked at the initial level.
---
So you can get all of them in a day.
---
Yeah I'm on ps4 and even though I vowed to never play this game untill the next update, I still couldn't pry myself away from it. I was looking around for some solutions for my problems with crashing every 7-15 minutes, and someone mentioned turning the depth of view down. I had mine at max but once I turned it down to a little over half I noticed that I didn't crash nearly as often. I didn't get enough time to really test if this was a temporary solution, so in the half hour I played I noticed that the game only crashed for me when I wanted to leave the server via social menu, pretty much every time (rip server hopping). 
---
Aside from that actually disconnecting from the server hasn't happened THAT much to me, only like, every 3rd server when I hop, which doesn't happen for a good hour.
---
Heavy and Sturdy leather plans are relatively common at Responder vendors. I think they even show up in Flatwoods. If you do the full Responder tour, I'd be surprised if you didn't find at least one.
---
 (2x Grafton, 2x Morgantown, Flatwoods, Charleston, fire station, Camden Park, Welch, Lewisberg) 
---
AWOL Armaments Event. Holy. Shit. So many stimpaks. getting ripped to shreds while in PA is not cool.
---
But it is hand cranked! I didn't notice that is why it shoots way faster. I that the gatling sucked and didnt pick it back up till after i leveled my martial artist perk
---
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT IM SEEING!
---
happened to me the first time last night. 
---
I got disconnected from a server while I was in Whitesprings and wearing leather armor. So..I immediately joined another server. 
---
The first thing that was out of place was the congratulations message about achieving the "Ground Zero" trophy, even before my screen finished loading. 
---
I was like "huh?" and then I saw my head rolling around the front of the whitesprings entrance and then my body crumpled and the nuclear red wind effects kicked in. 
---
haha.   
---
I wonder if it has something to do with "timers" that determine how long after a nuke has gone off that legendaries/high-level monsters exist in an area. I joined a server last night where Whitespring had already been nuked, and people were clearing it out. As soon as the nuke evaporated (the red circle went away), the same player (Silas-somenumbers, on PC) launched another nuke at WS. And after *that* one was over, he dropped another one.
---
Except for the like 5 cartoon videos and the 45 minute presentation.  Say what you will, but this was one of the most open games in a while content wise
---
Ah gotcha, I understand now. Well thank you again for the full confirmation. Your insight has saved me a lot of time.
---
It does not fire 500 rpm.  The tooltip is completely off.  I would guess that it is the slowest automatic ballistic in the game.
---
Hmm I believe a perk card lets your melee damage have a chance to give radiation. Maybe that?
---
I do still have this sneaking suspicion I should wait until it's like $25. I wish they would just release it through Steam and quit punching my balls.
---
Yeah no problem! I wish there were more answers out there, but I guess that's what we're figuring out!
---
I'd offer some calmex, but i vendored all mine
---
&gt;When their fun is a detriment to the fun of others? For sure
---
and we're back to the sniper argument. every other builds outpaces them in Whitesprings. should we nerf everything but snipers so their enjoyment isn't spoiled?
---
&gt;Do I need proof that Fallout 76 is multiplayer? The denial is so strong it seems to blind your logic.
---
I don't see where my logic is flawed so please point it out: there's no detriment in playing solo, the mechanics are mostly geared towards singleplayer and player interaction is something you may or may not engage in. go on, I'll wait.
---
&gt;So... you are comparing the devs stating what they want the game to be to some marketing fiasco in which they have no saying at all?
---
Todd presented the game. Todd is also very high up. ultimately, it's up to Todd and the Bethesda owners to decide what's what, from the scope of a game to the marketing.
---
&gt;I'm not the one claiming that a game in which you are put together with 23 other players, which directly affect your gameplay
---
hardly. that's the point.
---
&gt;Definition incoming...
---
are being dense on purpose? you keep spouting the dictionary definition of "market" as if it had any bearing on this discussion- at all. because the mmo definition of "market" is considerably different.
---
&gt;Okay, I get it, you think this game is single-player.
---
I'm simply basing my assumptions on the game's mechanics and how it was designed. still waiting for you to point out where my logic is flawed.
---
&gt;I'm sorry that the devs, Bethesda as a whole, and pretty much everyone who isn't delusional disagree with you.
---
not really. lots of people outside of reddit agree with me. on Bethesda's forums, for example. like I said at some point, try communities other than this cesspool.
---
&gt;but there's literally nothing here to discuss if you keep dismissing obvious facts.
---
funny thing, I was thinking exactly the same.
---
Very creative. But I didn't notice anything pop up telling you, that you are wanted.
---
Don't you get wanted for roasting people with traps? 
---
If you post a picture I can help you out
---
So why all the confusion behind the you can play solo?
---
Haha, I see what you did there, the "blow" anyway 😉😉
---
They initiate PvP with you by claiming the workshop, there is no "end" once you initiate PvP until someone dies.
---
They don't say anything about fighting over the workshop.
---
Create a penniless Raider alt. ;)
---
Ha. Ha! Ha! ...ha!
---
Prime receivers  have the same damage increase as “hardened” for ballistic weapons. My question is how much more damage to scorched does it deal and is it worth the cost of the special ammo. 
---
Story checks out.
---
Kinda genius. More fun than some random destroying your camp or just repeatedly killing you. 
---
Found a quad ammo Laser rifle with +10% damage while aiming. I swear I didnt even get through one full reload before it broke.
---
A quarter decade of high school?
---
Is ammo not valuable in this game? 1 cap per bullet at least, and more for missiles and such?
---
Oh nice. If they do something like that they could also implement a way to limit certain weapon types. Two players can go in and select on a terminal what kind of fight they are getting into. I think the possibilities are endless. We could have massive faction warfare battlegrounds, small PvP arenas, and also intense PvP survival (buildable) zones for those who like the combination of camp + PvP.
---
SameOverdriveIsMoreMySpeedSayIsThatASquirrelBye.
---
That's awesome. Can't wait to see more
---
Seeing the number of upvotes on this post makes me think you people are still in the denial stage. Game is shit bruh. It deserves all the hate. 
---
I give them one free stimpak for näiveté, after that YOYOMF.
---
Ya xbox message me at AngelOfDeath116 so I don't forget 
---
lmao, ruthless. 😂
---
Overly generous I believe it's called in the Charisma tree
---
There's a no reloading legendary effect, afaik. But it doesn't give free ammo, just means you don't have to reload.
---
It's called a magazine you liberal
---
In 4 there was the “never ending” legendary prefix.
---
I think the closest we have in 76 is the “quad” prefix that gives you 4 times the clip size.  (I have a quad handmade rifle for example)
---
Who hurt you?
---
Probably half the time I've been playing has been with a friend of mine, maybe that makes a difference. Though one person did attack me once, but that was after I accidentally got wanted by attacking a turret that was attacking me.
---
was getting a lot of server unresponsive ( or whatever) with controls disabled. Figured someone was duping and craft spamming or something. Sure enough nearby in a sack by the tinkers bench at whitespring station was 200k+ plasma ammo.
---
I posted before, only got one guy. I’ll add you in a bit 
---
It’s inconsistent I agree but holds true for me for locations like the gyms (lead weights) and for ballistic fibre.
---
Yes, the difference is very noticeable not extreme but I’ve collected all the prime receivers and tested most of the heavy guns and rifles and can tell the difference. 
---
so if the weapons were legit it'd be ok? because that's on Beth's end, not the people selling equipment for cash.
---
At your service,
---
#ma'aa'aam
---
They can, and I’m just hoping conversations like this can open doors to new ideas so that the game is tailored to our desires. 
---
I think the game is still a baby and there is a ton of room for improvement, people just need to stick to it and not leave it hanging. 
---
If you don’t mind waiting a bit longer you definitely should. Give it a month and then just buy Anthem. Maybe try Fallout 76 in 6 months and you will definitely get it at a lower price. 
---
In the situation I observed, the player was indeed hitting glowing ones at nuclear whitesprings. But I'm not sure if this was just a coincidence because I use the 'glow sight' perk with my ranged weapons and it does not initiate the small green blast on them.
---
I think someone posted about this a few days ago, that it was one of those alien turret things from Fallout 4 Nuka world.
---
Cool story kiddo.
---
fyi this game isnt finished 
---
Does anyone know alphas?
---
Bugging one's inventory so that it cannot be saved by no means crashes the server.  Period.  Dropping items on the ground (which is literally all they do) does not crash servers.  If you want to say they crashed the server by spam-creating boards, I'd give that one to you, but not since the patch from about a month ago that curbed that.
---
Absolutely bud, it was def worth giving a shot!
---
That would require server stability. We're not there yet.
---
That's unfortunate. I play on xbox. Oh well thanks anyways man
---
10/10 would bake again.
---
I'll be the better man and say that we agree to disagree.
---
We have been circlejerking for hours now; the horse is dead and beaten. The main point is lost in analogies and semantics.
---
I know that for the devs to balance this game is the right thing to do. I'm sorry to hear that you disagree.
---
The game sure has its problems, like bugs, optimization, story choices, but just like fallout 4, the gameplay is pretty damn good, and thats enough to keep me in, because i simply dont have time for 8 hours of lore every 10 minutes like some people want
---
I have them, can confirm. Dropped on the queen. 5 violet a piece for the shocks
---
Maximum science.
---
Hahahaha. Oh God. I sure you're hoping you're posting this in the context of
---
 "As someone who worked for possibly the worst shit storm creator, Bethesda needs to fix their shit, cause I've seen the consequences"
---
Because Blizzard may be the biggest shit show in online games ever. 
---
So did you work for them when Diablo 2 arguably invented/at least popularized the duping to sell for real money problem? 
---
Or when they proceeded to turn a blind eye to people selling accounts full of duped items? Duping which they never fixed? Ever. Or the bots. Or map hack? 
---
Or was it during WoW, where they've never fixed duping and turned a blind eye to ppl selling accounts?
---
Gotcha. Do both legs share one plan? Or do you need two
---
I have some Orbital Strike Beacons to make introductions with you.
---
Swapping servers resets the timer. Plenty of people have gotten all 18 in 30 minutes or less 
---
You're greatly exaggerating the situation. I haven't really noticed much F76 talk, all that died down 2 weeks after the game released. All the critics have already reviewed the game a long time ago - the subsequent talk was about Bethesda's behavior. I think it's in your head. 
---
You just seem to be angry because the people don't like the game, make fun of it on the internet (oh, the horror!), and because it's on "top 10 worst games" lists - rightly so. How dare the critics be critical!
---
Everyone but you is calm - you're the one so seething with anger that you have to rant about it like a mad man. It's just a game, bro. Chill.
---
Yeah the plan is for both legs
---
Yes mate. Given up till the duping problem is resolved. Server stability has been in the shitter for weeks now and as much as I love the game, I'm not going to waste my time reloading and reconnecting every 30-45 minutes.
---
So Power User/Full Charge wouldn't be needed for a Vats/PA build? I go through quite a few Fusion Cores on my main in Nuke zones. I could use those extra points though.
---
Damn, tri is 60 now? That would've been good payment to people who bought full price. 
---
Thanks so much man. Time to finally start going for the sbq
---
Ok will do. 
---
At the risk of ruining my honey pot...

Keep an eye on daily event quests down the southwest corner of the map. Breach &amp; Clear is a literal gold mine of all kinds of ore &amp; scrap.

Another settlement needs this oven
---
Then Witcher 3 is arguably better value for money, but 500 hours is still a lot for one game with no DLC yet. 
---
my man, you have mastered the concept of iterative KPI driven product development.

There is a mod for that.

However, there isn't a good testing environment.

Check the market sub. Plenty of people selling the serum recipes

The pvp is obviously supposed to be over the workshop.
---
If only man I'm on xbox. Thanks for the offer though!
---
Jeez I was kidding my apologies.
---
Afaik, jet doesn't exist (in fo76). That little shit Myron hasn't cooked up a snortable version of Brahmin shit yet.
---
I brought it up because I’ve recently acquired a tse shotgun that’s primed. With flux running roughly 50-100 caps per piece that brings shells to just over a cap per round when buying the flux. I’m just curious if I’m better off taking the prime receiver off the shotgun to use regular rounds. 
---
I believe if you put on the subtitles, they'll show.
---
They say 'Thank You' in Mandarin when they ded
---
Yeah well the same guy bought me my PS4 and gave me dying light to boot. Good guy. As for fallout, I really enjoyed the survival mode in F:NV so I'm guessing I'd enjoy 76.
---
Took me a week of several hours a day server hopping to find two shocks. Ridiculous. 
---
I did get 4 jet packs, a few stealth boys and a half dozen headlamp bright during the process to fund my frustration. But it sucked. I’d just pay the going rate if I wanted them now. 
---
Same lol
---
work for them when Diablo 2 arguably invented/at least popularized the duping to sell for real money problem? 
---
Or Diablo 3 where Blizzard essentially acknowledged they know people were exploiting their prior games to gain high end items to sell for real money .... By creating a real money auction house.....
---
Which they closed down because it "undermines Diablos core game play".... They introduced a system into their own game which undermined the core of that game's play. 
---
I wouldn’t use it as your main weapon, but a prime receiver just for the queen works well.
---
I've noticed that sometimes some of the ghouls are technically Legendary, but dont get the name prefix. Mostly of Diseased or Gangrenous ghouls. maybe its a conflict with the naming that something cant be diseased and legendary at the same time?
---
This reminds me of when I was playing Fallout 4, and received a Gamma Gun that did more damage to Ghouls.
---
Wow, what a bullshit post. You probably don’t even have 100 hours logged into 76 and you’re claiming you played New Vegas for 32,000 hours? Yeah, nice try.
---
If that is the case then it would be the other way around and they would have to PvP you to claim the workshop and not that they claim the workshop to PvP you.
---
Also, the fact it doesn't work the way you thought it should should be a hint that "the PvP is obviously supposed to be over the workshop" is false. PvP is PvP and in claiming a workshop you open yourself up to it.
---
fallout 76 is very open about cutting content to be reintroduced at a later date.. *for money*....
---
I’ll have to remember that quaint expression the next time I get revenge after being ganked by a mutie.
---
What the fuck ever is rule 6? Anyways here's a workaround.

---
Ah ok gotcha. Just a guess, but I'd say probably 30% since that's the damage bonus for all legendary specific target prefix bonuses. Like hunter, exterminator, etc.
---
How did you build it in the middle of town?

\[Gumbies bellowing\]THE ARCHITECT SKETCH!\[repeats\]

then you should know lots of people there despise player interaction more than me.

---
You should be able to craft it at one at mabye the cooking
---
Regularly, but only on one ps4 in the house. We are going to reinstall to see if that helps. 
---
That’s my assumption but I figured I’d ask. Thanks though! 
---
Thank you for your insight! This definitely sounds like the card that's causing the melee blast. Unfortunately, no one on Youtube has showcased this card yet, so I will look into it.
---
Frag mine needed for the explosive bait needs a Demolition perk 
---
Sorry buddy. r/Fallout is down the hall on the left, right next to the toilets.
---
Specs? 
---
My argument is that that is stupid as hell design, the pvp in this case is supposed to be over claiming the workshop.
---
If I leave it alone and just let them claim it then they can have it, case closed.
---
The fact that they can then kill you say an hour later for full caps is garbage bullshit design pure and simple.
---
Don't forget this game is rife with dupers, so pvp in most cases is absolute dogshit anyway.
---
So If I want to capture a workshop and someone wants to take it from me, then go ahead, but to let them then greif you for caps anytime and anywhere later? Terrible design.
---
I don't care. I am 32 year old, full time student and have a job. I don't have time to spend all day server hopping. 
---
OP is the worst type of dick sucking corporate sycophant. Aim your anger at the company that sold a shitty product you tedious twat.
---
If she owned  a workshop then she was in pvp mode, regardless of where she is in the map.
---
I suspect it is lag: sometimes when i press R to open the corpsebox and R again to take all, it instead puts into the corpsebox whatever inventory item i have that happens to be highlighted.  I have to slow down to visually confirm that the operations are executed as intended.
---
Of course, part of that problem is that almost all the commands are executed by E, R, and space.  With an occasional Z or enter.  So lag creates a misinterpretation of context and a goofy result.
---
Ah yes ive had one or two quad guns so far and not gonna lie i was a bit disappointed when the first time I saw one and it didnt have four barrels😂
---
It is possible, but I'll never know because I can't see them.

Reminds me of the evil toaster from Old World Blues. It seems you've built him an XL version.

They do. I'm not sure if its a week after getting them or a specific date but i believe its a specific day of the week
---
Keycards stay. Weekly reset is Tuesday for me, so probably Monday night for you if you're American
---
No keycards stay
---
I heard there’s some major dmg debuff that you get when you run around broke. I wouldn’t know I stay stacking more caps than a Lids store.
---
I’ve been thinking of doing this, then re-doing my SPECIAL stats when I get to level 50 to offset the remaining negative stats. Do I only need to equip the starches genes perk when taking radaway? Or does it have to stay equipped all the time?
---
Definitely unstable isotope. The green/yellow blast you see is when the user has strange in numbers perk card applied. It amplifies the mutation which in turn changes the animation. I use this and always get asked when people see it go off.
---
Especially one who wants to show you his "camp"
---
I think they should either nerf the damage or make the higher level enemies more tanky and increase the amount of protection from armour. That or at least make it so u have to hit the target in order to do any damage otherwise noobs will just kill things by shooting at the ground. They need to fix this issue before they implement any pvp mode
---
If it really stresses you out switch to pure melee and imagine the goddamn savings galore!
---
If you are going to use radaway, or a decontamination arch, equip starched genes level 2 to prevent loss. It doesnt need to stay equipped at all times, but it is beneficial if you are forgetful at times
---
Thanks I haven’t really toured the vendors just Flatwoods, Sutton etc will have to make it a mission

It wasn't released in a good state and all it really is is fallout 4 with most of it's features removed them released again as a "new game".
---
Also No Man's Sky didn't get this much hate  because it was an indie game basically while Fallout is an icon and Bethesda is a big well known developer.

I mean it’s possible. For NV. I don’t wanna go math but wouldn’t 500 hours at this point be like 60 hours a week?
---
Take perk in perception that shows resistances.
---
Well said
---
Thank you, friend. I thoroughly agree with you entire post. So much so, I feel like your in my head. To many entitled children with no respect for anything.
---
I agree with this.
---
However, with Martial Artist and mods, it feels... Okay.
---
Feels great with faster firing but then no explosive.
---
Just invite a random player and snap the pic while the invite is pending... It counts. 
---
I don’t understand why the victims don’t simply fast travel back to Flatwoods, for free, to escape the death trap?  Those flamers don’t do jack shit for damage...plenty of time to figure this out.
---
I hope one day I find a camp like this one.  I’ll intentionally enter it without any junk, let myself die, and then my body will drop an orbital strike beacon.  More fun ensues!
---
[Barter 55] &lt;lie&gt; I'm here to talk business. Interested in putting out a cookbook?
---
Grafton steel is bugged and will give u a bounty for attacking a building/ turret @ least on PC and for me. 
---
Oh, really?  That's not the experience I've had and I almost always hold a workshop. 
---
The second encounter she did not have one though.
---
Shit game is shit. 
---
De... Spa..
---
Nish
---
Inquisition
---
Maybe it was the glowing ones... maybe they sometimes blast like in previous games??
---
I have some explosive bait. I wonder if I gave that to you if that would count towards the quest??? 
---
Add me on PS4. zombiemann77 I probably wont be on until tomorrow though. If you still need it by the time I log on, I'll try to help you out. 
---
Compared to Korean internet, maybe.
---
I'm talking more relative to what I'm use to. It's nothing on my end.
---
Is that a goddamn Nazi uniform
---
As far as I can tell, the game is extremely sensitive to your connection quality. Your ISP's probably dropping a ton of packets during peak hours.
---
Mine crashes when i have to many legendaries
---
Yeah pc
---
Don't group pics have to have the person in the pic?
---
Doesn’t part two of the holotape mention that it doesn’t have a head as well?
---
Yeah I feel you about that. Isn't heavy leather a mod? Should work, bummer it doesn't
---
Underrated pun
---
People get off differently. The pleasure I get out of pvp is probably the same for them duping lol
---
Reported for foul language
---
No face mods for FO76 yet, sadly. I'd love to import my gorgeous face from FO4. Can't seem to replicate it in FO76... not even close. Maybe some face sculpting wizard can offer their services!
---
I believe it's just r/fo76bazaar
---
They just look for two people on the map. The great thing is that by the time it is in the cache, it's already been duped. So it accomplishes nothing.
---
DArk as a dungeon all day  my man all day :).
---
They should definitely limit the pvp area to just the area around the workshop. 
---
Also fuck the wanted system... They should just make passive mode a full opt out from pvp for you and your camp 
---
Wait they’re not speaking in the Mandarin dialect? That’s interesting...
---
Ranger outfit sells just as well but is not as easy.
---
+ karma because I like dad jokes 😁
---
So I set the  iPresentInterval back to 1, and everything is quiet again, but I don't get that silky smooth frame rate :(
---
I checked my monitor (Viewsonic XG2401) refresh rate, and it was at 50hz, I set it to 144 and got my smooth frame rate back...but the full speed fans came back after a while.
---
I can play the game for hours on end with maxed out display settings... but as soon as I turn the frame rate up, so go the fans. Pretty disappointing!
---
Awww. Your little feels get hurt because no one liked your post
---
Did you fucking trap it lmao
---
Isn't the customer who buys and plays the game the primary motivation for designing the game well...thus he is inherently qualified...
---
They used modified weapons that were derived from farm tools, like the kusarigama. Which is a Kama (farming sickle).
---
Damn.that's lame bruhv. We should have threads for each system or something.
---
Alright sounds good man! 
---
K sent add.
---
I hope you grabbed some lunch trays while you were there!
---
No, they don't. 
---
what about console players what do we get NOTHING!.
---
Why BS only reprieve's the pc players i am unsure but why cant console players get this too. 
---
I have found like 6. No shotguns though, I had to buy those!
---
Alright sounds good man
---
Which features were removed that have nothing to do with NPCs.
---
I appreciate your time and advice!
---
hes on xbox i believe
---
You either have severe problems with reading comprehension or just love strawman arguments. Not sure which one though. 
---
You could almost say it's... *delightfully* devilish.
---
Something tells me you have 20 minutes of game play under your belt if that. 
---
My problem with the game isn't actually because of the game or the devs. I think they agave done an amazing job with the game seeing as they leapt out of their comfort zone and into a whole new realm of gaming we all know and love Bethesda for its single player games but a lot of people who are willing to pay for online services would like to get their money's worth. I for one I've only played fallout 3 and by the end of it I got bored because I was only playing by myself there was no way for me to invite friends into my game. I spend at least 60 bucks a year on Xbox Live therefore while I have Xbox Live I prefer playing with other people in the fact that Bethesda is doing their best to have this happen I think is amazing.
---
The problem I have with this game is the player base I am seeing a whole lot of low levels for example players that are under level 20 jumping into nuke zones. If a nuke zone is supposed to be endgame content I think Bethesda should completely eliminate level 1 hazmat suits. I understand that some portions of the map are more radiated than others in some zones will be difficult for players to go through without hazmat suits. I think that if hazmat suits must be in the game for low levels they should be a fraction of the protection against radiation as level 50 hazmat suits. I also think that nuke zones should also have more radiation in them so that level one rad sponge is not good enough to use as a team but instead require level 3 rad sponge to do its job I think right now the nuke zones are too easy therefore people are skipping the game and going straight to Nuke zones when they drop. 
---
End game content does not come at the beginning of the game.
---
Awesome
---
&gt; Well, the blood is high for gamers who feel increasingly used and abused by game companies.
---
Who keep buying those games and keeps paying all those aspects that use and abuse them. 
---
I'm not even going to touch on all the players using exploits in the game as a whole. 
---
Yep, candles, lanterns or plants on every table. 
---
I just sent you a request not too long ago
---
Get handmade plan, make level 15 ones and scrap them. 
---
I heard there's a handmade spawn somewhere in Berkeley Springs, but I'm not sure exactly where.
---
No, they don't, just take a pic while wearing the proper stuff. You don't even have to be in the picture. See here for details on what works for this weekly:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abo7fx/weekly\_challenge\_take\_photos\_near\_vault\_76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abo7fx/weekly_challenge_take_photos_near_vault_76/)
---
Server size is 24-32, you stated 34... a little off but meh, next point.
---
If the game was "broken" pre the first big patch, how/what were people able to play during the beta, or did they play a differeant game?
---
Table comment, missing pieces? Refer to above, are you telling me the beta players played a different game, or did the devs try some stuff during the beta, and find a better situation/solution than what was shipped on the production disks which were probably made before the beta. You dont just produce over million or two discs in a couple days or get them around the world to distributors and retailers.
---
Unfinished? There is easily a 100 hrs you can put into the game if you give it a chance. Yes we are a little short on end game at this momemt, but I definitely got my monies worth out of it. You get a full first chapter at launch, with FREE dlc chapters coming out in the future, and with new content coming this month I'll be getting a few more hours of value out of my purchase. I can think of a couple titles that came out at a higher price tag than fallout, with less content.
---
And you think a new engine is gonna fix everything. Consider a consoles life span and development curve, the ps3 is a prime example. A lot of the launch titles were kind of lack luster and as developers learned how to utilize the power of the new platform they were able to create more and more impressive games. The first couple games on a new engine are either gonna be a flop or underwhelming.
---
And quite honestly calling it the same engine is like calling a dodge neon the same thing as a dodge viper, yea they are both cars and made by dodge, but one will make you yawn and the other make you wet your pants.
---
They are fixing the game, they are trying to communicate with us, we went from one BGS redditor to 5 in the first month, they have to be guarded with what they say  though or the speculation army blows it outta proportion. They are trying to communicate as best as they know, without causing bigger problems.
---
And the bag fiasco? They way they originally handled it was bad ill agree on that. But hardly anyone bought the PA edition for the bag, they bought it for the helmet. Im pretty sure there are a ton more people on the bag hate train, than who actually got the PA edition.
---
Skyrim, oblivion, fallout made by modders? They may have been fine tuned, enhanced and expanded upon by modders, but the base games were not made by them. I spent countless hours playing each, all with no use of mods. Yes, mods might add to the game, but its still enjoyable and playable in its base form.
---
What do you like about the game?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tGblFfqNW-Q&amp;t=102s
---
Server hop Wotoga Station until you can buy the plan to make them, construct around 10, scrap.
---
I haven't seen a reliable spawn for handmades yet.
---
I hope this helps! 
---
What is stopping people from going straight up aggro against you for this prank? I could see people vandalizing in anger then stalking you after they incur a bounty.
---
The only place I've seen them drop with any sort of consistancy is from the golf club wendigo/glowing one. You're better off using your time hopping the penitentery for the even Patrol Duty, until it rewards you with the plans
---
it's far too slow to compare to explosive automatic weapons.  It's not that great, even with the shotgun buffs.  Now that it weighs a ton again, it's not worth it at all.
---
They took the only half decent legendary weapon away from me, instead of worrying about the real problems effecting this game.
---
Replied to the wrong guy I think lol
---
I've never used .38s
---
Energy weapons are pointless in this game.  Ballistic seems to be the only way to get through it.
---
It would be incredible.
---

I have both frag mines and explosive bait. PS4 name elsewhere in thread. I'll stay online for a bit. Hope this catches you in time. 
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Workshops are your friends. Gives resources, experience, and plans all for simple defend quests.
---
I played THE CRAP out of it, but I think I'm burned out/ran out of things to do. You definitely get your money's worth though. Got a lv. 160 and lv. 90
---
I'm down with this idea, I've been finding lower levels and giving them loot. I'll be firepower, my PSN is the same as my username on here
---
Wasnt my post originally but theres no need for foul language. Also reported you for bullying
---
You shouldn't have to login, launch the game, wait for it to load, then having played for 20 minutes hitch-free run into a bug that REQUIRES a restart/relog to continue to playing normally. That's something that should be ironed out in a beta, but what 76 had was more a demo, but, with marketing
---
Interesting! What level is he / you?
---
Some of the glass cannon builds are super high damage, so it can transcend the slap mechanic.  Look up Rad Rage build on this sub, for example.  Weird, but not cheating.
---
And because the game was not seriously tested before launch, none of the make-shit-up-as-we-go-along mechanics are remotely balanced.
---
And his teammates are not blocked, so of course they can tell him where you are.  Utterly silly mechanic.  Lazy design, but not cheating.
---
And pacifist is just passive: you can’t do any damage to him at all.  No risk to him even with a glass cannon build.  Ridiculous design.  Encourages griefing.
---
And even if he dealt a quarter of as much damage and 4-shotted you, outcome is just as odious.
---
This will become a classic game design case study overnight.
---
Can’t add you because of your settings :)
---
Nah you can tame pets and I think he’s glitched cause he not moving anymore 
---
or screw deathclaw talons onto the knuckles of your power armor, or the the hydraulic power fist assembly into the wrists of your PA, or big ass retractable mole miner gauntlet wolverine claws into the forearms of your PA 
---
I’m level 76 and he like 25 
---
Super duper produces 30% more on average.
---
Go for big guy. You’re the equivalent of fart in the wind as far as I’m concerned 
---
Preach, son! 🙏
---
Pure melee is insanely good when something is in range.
---
It isn't imposible solo, but being a sniper doesn't make it easier for you. What typesbof weapon are you using? A 2 shot would be nice if you don't want to go the broken explosive route. 
---
I had the same gripe about several enemy attacks and how their damage doesn't match their gun. They are the only gutsy that annoys my melee build as I have to sprint attack or stealth to make them miss at point blank as I screw them over with higher DPS or else my HP slowly drains away to 0 as I run out of AP from all the Dodgy procs even with 15 AGI.
---
Didn't know they were selling the recipes. Probably don't have enough caps for them lol. 
---
Can you mod a Zealot's weapon with the Scorched-Killer mod and gain even more vs. Scorched?  And then couple that with a Prime receiver?
---
My house is right on the golf course. I like to live dangerous. My house has been blown up so many times, but it's so damn convenient I don't care. 
---
Vast majority of gamers and critics think 76 is bad. It's just you and few other weirdos
---
Lmao wow the more you know
---
I think I met him too...[https://imgur.com/u7Kj3pU](https://imgur.com/u7Kj3pU)
---
There's really no reason why you shouldn't be picking up every cosmetic item you find to sell to a vendor later.  They have a weight of just 0.1 and the lowest you can get for them is like around 3 caps which is still good for the weight.  The better items can sell for like 10-20 caps which is a totally great weight to cap ratio and the best items can sell for 20+ which is fucking awesome.  They are basically free caps since they take up such a minor amount of weight.
---
Same plus I hit my breaking point with bugs
---
You get accommodations from legendaries as well. I'd like rewards not to include them as whitespring is overfarmed enough.
---
I continuously dc on my first login
---
Everyone but you is calm - you're the one so seething with anger that you have to rant about it like a mad man. It's just a game, bro. Chill
---
You don't find it useful to get four copies of the Basketball Hoop plan?

Channels like Yongyea foreshadowed a culture of youtubers who perpetuate controversy for clicks. The floodgates opened with 76 and spiraled out of control.

The passwords expire, the actual nuclear key cards dont.

Speaking of starched genes I’m level 80 and I’ve yet to receive it, luck is 7 and I’m respecing it to be higher does anyone have any helpful ideas on how I can get it?

On top of the spa building 👍
---
This sounds like the most probable explanation of what we saw.  Thank you!
---
I picked up an instigating explosive ultracite laser pistol from a lunch bag someone dropped, and sold it to someone at its suggested price 322 right away. LOL
---
Combat shotgun is best as it is the only one to get mods that pierce armor. Use the “superior” piercing one: Perforating magazine. Shotguns do not get piercing from any perks, so take what you can.
---
I noticed you have no Gunsmith. Shotguns lose durability fast so be prepared for that. 
---
Beyond that I can’t help much despite focusing on the same thing with my build, cause you are going for vats and crit and I didn’t.
---
Sneak sneak sneak sneak you can walk right through without shooting practically anything
---
These kind of "well someone else is doing it worst" arguments are bad, you know that, right

Remind me of a couple a years ago in a private server in Minecraft my 25 years old or so friends and I built a giant Oven and spawn villagers and burned them alive lol this is another level tho hahaha nice, saved it for watching later 
---
Using a .308 that puts out somewhere over 100 damage and a shotgun that I've modded that has 128 damage (I think). I've put my cards towards shotguns, pistols (I use a .44), and rifles.  Nothing in automatic or energy.  I haven't had much trouble until this and the Mayor of Watoga line.
---
Hahaha! 
---
Thank you for your service.
---
We will all just trust that a naval base in Oklahoma makes some sense.  ;)
---
Damn, spot on with that one mate.
---
Negative. But super duper works 
---
Works if you have an arch(beat the game). My solution has 30 rads a sec plus an arch 10 seconds away other wise. For those who havent beaten the game. 
---
Really? I'll fish around for that official say so. I'd like to start modding again.
---
Quick tip, sometimes when farming, I drop my unwanted legendaries in one of the suitcases outside the whitesprings station. Im not the only one either. Always check there, even if its just to sell whats there to the vendor for caps.
---
I made obstacle courses with mazes for them to be able to get to the bathroom. Or put them in display for the neighbors on the sidewalk to watch them starve to death. 
---
Oh nice, I havent gotten a mirelurker yet. Do you know where exactly on the map you found him (I know it is still a random spawn but its handy to know the areas to look).
---
Might be a good idea, but there are some choke points that make that very difficult, at least in power armor.
---
Thanks chief 
---
Sweet, tomorrow my dude
---
Truth, they're not really going off much since the last patch either.
---
You would think it would, at least a little? I’m a Doc in an expeditionary command adjacent to a Marine unit, but that still leaves the question; we have the land, but where’s the water? 
---
Talk about an unlucky duty station. 
---
Yeah, the problem with these weapons is the the low RoF they have when you get swarmed, which happens near the end as you noticed. If you're on xbox I have a 1* 2shot LAR you can have. Perfect for a sniper build, and should help out. 
---
I hate griefers. I know its part of the game but there is really no point in it besides wanting to be an ass. Sry it happened 
---
Oh for sure, but the vestiges are still there.
---
I mean, hell, there are still people making fucking harambe jokes. This shit ain't gonna end any time soon.

This is comedy gold

I've seen more than one recent looking corpse, it makes me ask some serious questions about the timeline which doesn't seem to be though all the way through.
---
Thajská, i am realy thankful.
---
Is there a perk you need to tame or is it just pacify
---
It is probably in a basket somewhere.
---
Haha well yeah. It's part of the game, and I guess people just gain satisfaction from it. I guess higher levels just get bored, so they resort to that kinda stuff.
---
Search on YouTube fallout 76 how to get pets and you’ll see a video with the thumbnail it’s a death claw click it and he shows you some places in the mire it’s really useful video 
---
Thanks, on PC though.  What are the specs on that?  
---
Recently went to an antiques store wanted to buy all of there typewriters for some reason.....
---
Not really. It highlights the selectiveness of the outrage. It also points out how stupid the reasoning is. 
---
Bethesda does something wrong and everyone loses their mind demanding blood. Mean while many more other game developers do the same or worse and they are carried all the way to the bank on a wave of praise and accolades. 
---
Ignorant people who have no idea what they are complaining about need to be informed.  Otherwise they continue to spread their ignorance. 
---
Hahahahaha this made me laugh more than I thought it would
---
Spend all night harvesting the grafton steel workshop and junks from all over the place. Make a bunch of .50 Cal bullets until I have 1000. Somebody let's off a nuke at the main fissure site, shoot the queen until she is almost dead, game disconnects, log back onto a server and I am in a non nuke cranberry bog and out of ammo again and have no workshop. Repeat process :'(

Just pacify I have 5 points in charisma and have a level three pacify animals (the one with the bunny) and a level one pacify (the one with the scorpion 
---
I'd have to double check, but it's ballpark 250. Powerful, but still keeps the game challenging. I just got into BoS since I found a 2 shot laser (which sticks btw).
---
I like how you pretend other people that actually play the game don't have jobs or lives. I see this a lot from people like you and it's just an excuse. Why cheat yourself to the end? What is there even to do at that point? A big part of the point is the satisfaction when that good drop happens. 
---
I'm married and we both work demanding jobs. We manage not to cheat and to just enjoy the game for what it is. Some kind of miracle I guess? You don't *have* to server hop for vendors. That's how you *chose* to play the game, and then you chose to cheat at it lmao.

Bummer to hear ya lost an explosive Gatling gun.

 I do have that mod for my ultrcite armor and it works OK. I would rather have a jetpack but it's what the queen dropped. 
---
Oh I have caught lots if pets, just not the Mirelurks. So you found it at the lake with the crashed vertibird north of abby's bunker?

Up north between the water park and the Black Bear Lodge seemed to be a good bit. I was only up there once but I pulled quite a few

I haven't been able to find or make a laser or plasma weapon that was worth switching from ballistic.
---
Get class freak.  Decreases negative effects of mutations. 
---
I'm proud of you dude! Keep up the good work! 
---
BARNaby Jones!
---
What is the best way to get rid of the mutations you don't want? Do serums and mutations overwrite each other? If they do I was thinking to use serums of the ones I don't want so they drop off after an hour.
---
I just happened to see this, sorry for the late response.
---
I’ve found it especially useful when either hiding from other players, or raiding within the confines of not being a dick.
---
For one example, if I believe someone is coming to steal my workshop (the ammo factory is a big one), I can ‘sneak’ with chameleon armor and this has two benefits; the first being that I disappear from the map, and the second being that you become *completely* invisible to other players unless the happen to aim directly at you. 
---
This allows me to immediately attack them, killing them after a few well-placed shots from a distance without them ever knowing I was there. 
---
The second also applies to the ammo factory as a good example. If you can slip into the factory undetected, and it has already been claimed but the ammo machine itself hasn’t been locked... You can jump on top, sneak, go invisible, and just constantly steal ammo without becoming wanted. I feel this is less of an asshole move than outright stealing the workshop and killing them. I have not stolen a workshop before, but I can imagine it would also be useful if you can effectively hide and the defender returned to kill you, it’s definitely an upper-hand. 
---
&gt; everyone was allowed to retrieve their junk plus of course any bait items
---
This is the difference between you being a complete jerk and a hilarious prankster. I'm very glad you opted for the latter, because wow is your trap impressive. And very funny to watch.
---
I can appreciate an evil trap as long as no one gets hurt in the end :) 
---
Happy to know you're enjoying it mate :)
---
Thanks I was worried I would have to make a new character to tame a animal because I’m a level 60 but only have 5 points in charisma. 
---
Yes the SBQ does drop mutation serum recipes and even the serums themselves. I almost stopped doing the queens fight until I started finding these :D
---
Thats a stupid question.
---
The game is missing a good plot and meaningful choices. 
---
The pitch for this game was like "let's remove everything that makes these games worth playing and just release it as an empty version of Fallout 4 where you walk around and listen to a few cassette tapes".
---
The laziest game design I've ever seen.
---
Praise! Quick question when is the next update for Xbox?
---
I would remove sturdy frame since you said you are using a hazmat, you won't be able to equip any armor over it. Instead consider blocker and getting serendipity in luck since you will be low hp.
---
VERY nice!!!!
---
Yeah this is news to me and I have claimed tons of workshops
---
Indeed chameleon is fun and useful.
---
But I have a piece of Cloaking, which is a different legendary effect than Chameleon.  That is the one that I don’t see a benefit from, and was wondering if anyone uses it happily.
---
Or when you just can't get enough of a Ps4 blue screen.
---
I have my camp next to whitesprings as a fast travel spot then i go to the whitesprings vendors. The enclave vendors at the bunker. Fast travel to watoga. Fast travel back to camp. Fast travel to flatwoods. If I have enough extra stuff I also go to Sutton station or top of the world to hit the raider vendor. 
---
Well the rifleman perks work for the laser rifle so you don't need to switch many perks. But the short answer is no, energy weaponsare god awful and break too damn fast. Also theres no type of armour penetration for lasers so they just get outclassed by ballistics atm. 
---
Sometimes it's just fun to launch around lasers, haha. 
---
He's a warm hearted person who'll love me till the end
---
I started by doing that shit 
---
I appreciate you for this
---
I like fallout 76 (it's far from perfect), change my mind.
---
I definitly play as an Enclave agent. That's my whole character in game. I do things that I think an Enclave agent would do and how they would do it. I encourage everyone to try it. My other two chars are a BoS recruit with a bad attitude but a heart of gold and a free states member with a split personality that doubles as a raider. I play accordingly. 
---
As for griefers being raiders, I dont think they're all role playing, but it is correct and canon techniscally to label them that way. It has been stated that a raider's favorite past times are torture and murder. Someone shooting up a base that cost a lot to repair is the closest thing to torched they have. They can't steal all your shit, so they wreck what they can, hurt, annoy, and frustrate you on purpose.  They really are raiders, whether they're role playing or not.
---
Even after all this time, I sometimes reach for the save button instinctively. 
---
Lol, from all the comments on all the threads about this exact subject latley it is almost a given that somebody will destroy your house there now.
---
Hopefully they will change the build area restrictions around the place (they probably wont but it would be nice).
---
Yeah, really sucks. I'm just hoping to get blessed by the rng gods for another explosive fun.
---
And their still constantly adding more. I’m honestly gonna give this games a run for its money now. I’m super excited.

Here I thought I was confused, been noticing that for a bit too. Thanks for sharing.
---
I keep having to align myself on the map, then ignore the compass, which is quite annoying.
---
So true, friend. Glad there are some who realize this.
---
I’m getting the exact same crashing when accessing my stash as well. Just started yesterday. I’m on PS4
---
yeah I've never spent much time up there so that's probably why I'm struggling to find them atm
---
After a lot of reading about it before, the all night long perk doesn't actually do what you think it does (I did the same thing).
---
It doesn't slow down how often you are hungry or thristy, it just reduces the affects you get from being thristy and hungry.

There’s one in nuka world, and one in a parking garage south of Boston.

I will now be initiating workshop claims and then fast traveling to the owner and murdering them all day every day. Thank you for the instructions. I have been looking for a way to kill people more often.
---
I just wish we could hear em raging lmao
---
I get annoyed at the band wagon effect of "this game sucks" without people actually trying the game after the nasty bugs were ironed out. It's still unstable with the server crashes when one too many nukes cause server instability and the lack of anything that mimics the dragonborn shout in Skyrim to ground ("totally not a rip off dragon") Scorchbeasts leading many a melee player to get annoyed.
---
You should definetely get one soon, as you need it for high level enemies. Farm some legendaries at white springs anytime someone nukes it.(happens plenty)
---
I was using mainly fully modded hunting rifle and maybe pump action shotgun to about level 60-70. Also I was technically only level 40 until about level 90, because I didn't want to lock into the specials until I've figured what kind of build I want and planning it was harder than I thought, so I ended up just playing instead.
---
Or buy one, about 1k should be enough for most on PC. On consoles I think duping has been more common that people might want to donate a two shot for you if you just ask.
---
I don't get it.
---
  Nah but that’s my next step to teach him to sing
---
My man!
---
For just two shots you need to kill probably maybe a hundred legendaries. For TSE, far more.
---

Well fortnite is free you load into map kill some enemies get battlepass $10 get skins repeat. Fallout load in map do repeatable events collect stuff to repair your stuff kill stuff repeat.

shias sidekick turtle here , &lt;.&lt;  &gt;.&gt; we have spent quite a bit of our playtime hiding in shacks and crouching in bushes from scorchbeasts and we perhaps should have expected that finding a place called deathclaw island might have a reason for the name . 
---
If you see a dark skinned girl in a fishermans hat and a blonde in a Ushanka hat running for their lives do us a faor and lay down some cover fire so we can beat a hasty exit :P
---
They never fixed that, the fix they did was making the reward not go to all the players on the server.
---
And yes they've known about it since the beta, it's just not important.
---
Why the fuck do you not get wanted for this? Players get wanted levels, but not you?
---
I fucking love it, but holy shit, what a massive oversight by Bethesda.

Do you get any high lvl players or just the new ones.

---
So all together you can complete all of fallout 76 content in 24 hours maybe faster depending on how good you are. I've done everything without trying twice.
---
Yeah perk and damage is way too much.
---
Out of dozens only one guy tried to destroy the base. I let him get a few licks before shooting him in the face, lol.
---
That sounds right. Impose soft penalties that won't downright ruin you when you go roleplay a wasteland asshole, like you said a slap on the wrist rather than a punch in the gut. Give dickish players a hint: go ahead, be a dick to other players, we're sure you won't mind if the game returns the favor.
---
This was one of the funnier things I’ve seen in a little bit. Nice job man.
---
It's just the cop uniform. I couldn't find the Responder's version.
---
They're only for if you're really into cracking codes. You can just toss them and go to this site https://nukacrypt.com/solved when you want to launch a nuke
---
...so you've played all previous fallout games and there dlc along with mods. Clocked in about 500 hours knowing game has issues. Not gonna say you're wrong as 76 has many flaws but this is an online game that is supposedly to be supported for a couple of years. My thoughts play another game or something and return later on in the year. Hell man game been out about 2 months now with a few patches due to holiday. Give Bethesda a chance to make it right. 
---
I think soloing it is way easier than with a team. Seems more stable and less lag. Then again TSE weapons make it a breeze too.

---
You, Sir?/Miss? are 1 of the great things about FO76 making your own adventures, having fun and sharing it with others. It was a fun read.
---
Pure explosive even one non-shotgun is way high damage. It could be justifiable on weaker weapons but not high damage weapons or high rate of fire weapons.
---
I'm running only bitdefender, uninstall it and it does the same. Tried everything yesterday, rolled back 5 nvidia drivers (using ddu), downclocked the video card with afterburner, tried all the shitty things advised by bethesda support and still the game crashes 5 minutes into each session. All this time the other games and all synthetic tests show no system instability.
---
The only thing remaining is to do a clean install of Windows 10, but I'm not gonna bother for just this game alone.
---
I'll just give up on the game and hope for a fix. Bethesda can go and suck a frozen onion!
---
My camp is kind of in the middle near Arktos Pharma so I go Grafton-&gt; CAMP -&gt; Whitesprings -&gt; Enclave -&gt; Watoga x 2 -&gt; Haper's Ferry -&gt; Pleasant Valley. Never calculated the cost of my run before.
---
Yeah I was not going to buy this game from everyone saying how much it sucked... But I thought to myself a true fallout fan would love it because it's still the same style. And I bought it and Im glad I did. 
---
Happened multiple times for me tonight. I finally gave up.
---
It will occasionally tell you some place you have already discovered. Just have to pay attention to the name when it tells you it added “so and so” to your map.

They don't give you wanted status but they also don't give you anything for killing anyone

You can place near the river and the edge extends that far

Saw a clipboard at work....almost scrapped it
---
Nah, most of the time you only need a couple of cores. Just relog to recharge them, bring some more on a nuke zone.
---
If you have an explosive weapon you don't even need to max the shotgun damage perks. I have one point in each with explosives maxed and my non TS explosive shotty still does a bit over 500 before adrenaline kicks in.

Vats isn't even needed beyond using a crit to Cripple a SB/SQB wing.

20, 30, 40.. point remains.
---
I like how you said 'had' at launch. Sums it up perfect.
---
Maybe you are right; content was a poor choice of word. How about playability? End game cont.. sorry, bad habit.
---
If this wasn't an issue then while is it being brought up over and over? We are not pulling this out of our asses. Obviously there is an issue that needed addressed long before launch.

Also, Do you need a hug?

Lmfao a dead pickpocketing deathclaw stole your lockpicks. You sure it dead? Might wanna double tap it.

Alright interesting bug though never heard of stuff being transferred to corpse when looting. Though the weirder thing being it was lockpicks.
---
I believe excavator, raider, and ultracite do not have skins.

This.  Killing a load of enemies at once will have them disappear before your eyes.  No loot and the server gets confused and misses drops.

Ahhhhh. I honestly did not know there was a difference! Thanks!

Kys ya duper loving scum ❤️😘👌🏻

Yeah the game is great despite its flaws. Ive only just hit the stage of being bored with it. Its the only game Ive played since its release so Ive had my moneys worth. Everything new they release and update is a bonus now, looking forward to what they have in store
---
Incentivizing prosocial behaviors while curbing antisocial behaviors leads to more welcoming, inclusive, healthy communities. Speaking as a parent, the kids who love smashing other kids' sand castles often find that other kids stop wanting to play with them, while the kids that help make each other's castles awesome tend to have maximum fun.
---
Also, how *dare* you trash-talk Farm Simulator.
---
I don't think there is enough data to determine what it causing it.  I have read when dupers do their thing it just disconnects one of them.  Not everyone on their server, that is how the other guy (who is on the same server) gets the duped stuff.  If everyone was disconnected, the duping would not work.   I think the game is just unstable.  I have been playing with my son on the same server in the same house on two different consoles for the last couple of days trying to help him figure out another bug (weapons disappear for him) and I have gotten the server disconnect when he did not, and vice versa at times.
---
I found them at Graftons station, on my lvl 104, 7 times in 9 hops, try there
---
great arguments you got there
---
I did something similar with radiation traps. You should try it as it doesnt destroy walls and even if they try to spam stimpack hotkey it won't work. They even work through walls. Got it to 60Rads per second with 4 traps 
---
I have the full official release of Subnautica on PS4.... Barely playable after a certain point due to frame rate issues far beyond even those of the SBQ in 76. Not to mention it crashes more often than 76 (full game crash, not server crash).
---
I know it's a PS4 port (and they are releasing frequent patches to fix this), but they're not calling it an early access port either. This is the official PS4 release of the game, in a worse state than the ps4 version of 76.
---
And it's a 3rd party company doing the port, I know. Doesn't make a difference.
---
Also Subnautica doesn't have any NPC's and tells it's story through the discovery of the datalogs of the dead explorers that came before the player. Just sayin.
---
Partner got that today, and i got blue screened. Hadnt had issues for a while. Idk.
---
I'd agree on that game but for others just because its and older game doesn't mean it doesn't have more content for cheaper the fact that a new game has less content of old games base version is sad.
---
Rando drop or trading
---
Preach 
---
Consumer awareness youtubers have existed long before 76, and honestly even the rpg LP/lore/guide/modding channels are dismissing this game which is telling as this game should be a primary content source for them it's in thier best financial interest to say its a successful game yet even they are disappointed in it.
---
I was sitting in my car at the time.

Do I need to recreate a new comparison for you?

PSA::: The main reason not to bulk unless selling is that your hard earned mods will scrap before your bulked junk gets scrapped.

Wish this would have got more attention, really useful feature 
---
I don't think Rad-X is 'bad' per-se. I think all they are are a advanced form of Potassium Iodide pills (Anti-radiation medicine IRL) 
---
And basically all Rad-Away does is flush radiation out of your body when you pee (water loss).
---
But Med-X is morphine, Stimpacks are adrenaline (steroid, but basically the same thing as a EPIPEN but much stronger) Buffout is pretty obvious. And Psycho, Jet, and fury are the bad ones.

It depends on the stock a true stock makes it a rifle but i think a brusing stock is a handgun, and the reciver changes it from auto to non auto

Up till now my offense was about 1/3 knife, 2/3 rifle. Now after level 100 I'm moving points from strength to perception for more Rifleman perks, since everyone has to do 1 million damage per shot in the endgame apparently.

Helping a friend put together a stealth armor set to play sniper overwatch while i go shotguns, heres what we came up with for the wishlist:
---
Chameleon Mutation, All weightless heavy combat armor with the BOS and ultralight mods. Hope for 3\* reduced fall damage on both legs less likely to be detected when sneaking on the rest. The last legendary effect is really a toss up, +rad resist for nuke zones or +luck for crits. Sadly had 0 luck finding pieces so far but getting super smash bros for christmas has them distracted anyway.

Going to have to take it out on some overencumbered level 10 that just got their first bounty

So much this; consensual PvP (where both kids decide to smash each other's sand castle) is fine, but non-consensual PvPers can eat sand.

It was a normal scavving run. MODUS needed scrap for his bots, and we needed caps. Simple, right? Well, we'd made out way out of the savage divide and down to the ash heap, snatching anything that wasn't bolted down and stripping everything else for bits. We'd just raided a hardware store and were making our way down a hill on a path when our CO, Pin, noticed something. There was dead stuff *everywhere.* We'd all noticed, but we assumed that it was just ash heap wildlife doing what ash heap wildlife does. Pin knew better. Being our specialist for the ash heap and western savage divide, he knew this place and everything in it. He pointed out the craters. Odd dips in the ground, splattered with blood, gore, and what looked like shards of metal. Our explosives expert, Barne, said it looked an awful lot like the same destruction artillery made. However, it couldn't have been because of the *angle* of the craters. they weren't directly down, like the holes artillery leave when coming directly down from the sky. Most of these were shaped in such a way that it's as if it was pointed at directly. Barne was on pin and needles at this point, being afraid of whatever the hell's out here that can carry and fire something with the firepower of artillery. Barne was just finishing up his inspection on the environment when our sniper, carrion, said we'd been in one spot for too long. Carrion was particularly paranoid, being our survivalist, trapper, and sniper specialist. He'd earned these titles with *experience.* and in his experience, when you stayed still is when things started tracking you down. Pin agreed and took point, everyone else still packing up and trying to stay nearby. About 20 feet out, we heard a distant crack. Everyone stood still, still on edge from our inspection of the craters. Pin pointed eastward and said "Carrion. Get your scope on that bunker, *now!*" Before Carrion could even take his anti-material rifle from his back, Pin was a smoking crater of warm, mushy bits and collected junk. Barne began freaking out and losing his cool, diving behind a large rock jutting out from the ground. Carrion hit the deck and begn searching for the bunker from which they were being fired upon. I, being the only one in power armor, had trouble finding cover I could fit behind. While searching for a spot, several very large projectiles whizzed by. Once by my chest and twice by my legs. I slid into a large ditch, the acid deposit inside gnawing at my x-01 armor. Carrion's voice came over my short-range radio a few seconds later. "I've found the damn thing! It's...What the *hell?*" After a couple more second of silence, I decided now was a great time to be inquisitive. "Care, now's really not the time to get tongue tied! Tell us what the fuck we're dealing with here!" I'd make sure that my frustration with him right now would be clear in my voice. Carrion called out, "Barnes, what model robot could carry that kind of firepower?" Barne was absolutely baffled. "At this range? Hell, it'd have to be one hell of a sentry bot. Is that it? Some kind of experimental model? I swear, if it-" another HE round cut his sentence short, hitting dangerously close to Carrion. Carrion dove into a new spot and responded, sanitizing and sloppily bandaging his hand. "It's a Gutsy! A Gutsy is shooting at us!" Carrion would receive no response from us, as another shell hit near to him and a stray rock flew through his eye and into his brain, killing him on the spot. The chain of command dictated that I was now the leader of our squad, but the chain of command didn't matter here. Not anymore. "Barne, put on your damn helmet!" shaking, stuttering, and talking gibberish, Barne loosely put his helmet on and locked into place. It had been a while since the last shell. In the distance, We heard a voice in that classic drill sergeant demeanor, "^ARE ^YOU ^READY ^TO ^DIE ^FOR ^YOUR ^COUNTRY, ^YOU ^COMMIE ^SON ^OF ^A ^BITCH?"
---
Okay, so sending a direct message to someone who hasn't initiated that kind of communication seems to step over that boundary a touch....
---
Nope.
---
Thats great to hear, its defenitely a true fallout experience for sure.
---
Well they are kinda blessed. Not the server but the zone.
---
Once the game spawns some enemies and you kill them, those enemies would respawn exactly the same, as long as you stay near. They usually instantly respawn if new player gets close. So when you see a large group of legendaries you can stay in area to keep those locked and just wait for them to respawn.
---
Lol
---
Can you prove it?
---
I did that too at first but they changed the bulking weights in a patch.  Now all you save is the plastic burned in the process, except for - and im getting this from another source - lead and aluminum.  But I still use those up quickly at high levels.
---
What? I did that quest a while back what do you mean 8 stimpacks every time you load a server!?
---
sometimes strange in numbers can mess it up, or if you join a team. try unequipping any mutation perks then re equipping them. 
---
Glad the servers are better for you, I havent noticed any change since launch unfortunately
---
Sad very sad 
---
Just has been rumors so far. Plan on checking into this myself tonight. 
---
Im on Xbox. That sort of crashing has been always present, but its more frequent for me now, and especially when transfering items between me and my stash.
---
Plastic spoons. I'm glad I've searched 100 of them for a plastic spoon.

The keycard machine eats them upon use. *Never* go to launch a nuke with only one keycard; if you screw up putting in the code, you can use the second card to try again.
---
This Sir is absolutely brilliant, just out of curiosity couldn't you fast travel out?
---
I really struggled to find western plans too, I knew I've seen them before, but I thought they were level capped out of my high level char like handmade and level action. Until I found them from Watoga BOS vendor, about 800 caps.
---
I had though unlocked most of mods for it, as western isn't so rare weapon.
---
The quality of mine come in waves some days it will disconnect me or my game will crash in the period of 2-3 hours other times I have basically I problem for 2-4 days
---
You guys is lumping man comeon.  So without reading comments I will say I agree with you the news and videos and posts around FO76 and how bad it sucks are just pitiful at this point, but so are the videos claiming how good the game is.
---
The game was released in a horrible state, do I blaim Bethesda.....not entirely....they receive funding from backing companies to get a game released before a certain point.....they should have pushed back and said it wasn't ready but hindsight is 20/20.....so no reason to dwell.  Comparing No mans sky to FO76 is like comparing apples to oranges, there wasnt as much posted because the game didnt come from a major publisher like Bethesda, it's not a fair comparison....Bethesda more then has the resources to have prevented releasing a game in the state FO76 was released in.
---
With all that said,  the game is improving, and those improvements are directly related to requests from fans and customers such as larger stash, fixes to camp, fixed explosive damage on weapons, ect.  In the last few weeks they have done a great job fixing a slew of major issues.  And there is videos posting good fixes ect. On the game showing what's been improving and so on, but they get buried by the same people you pointed out feeding into the echo chamber trying for a video.
---
The game has a long way to go.....but it is heading in the right direction so I have high hopes.  And while the micro transactions and ridiculous objects like the rum nuka cola bottle are crap, they also fund new game additions and are one of the reasons the dlcs are set to be free not paid.

Too hard to explain in text exactly where it is but there are many YT vids about it, its upstairs from a green Spa building

I got the plans to upgrade the suit after scrapping some. It costs cobalt flux. A shielded suit is part of my care package to new players. 
---
My teammates try to take any alcohol they see before i find it because i drink it immediately for the temp stat boost.
---
My character has been addicted to alcohol 18 times now lol.
---
The game is built for addiction. The addiction happens when you run out of carry weight and you have to go back to scrap or sell, then you do it again because of the noises that play when you do those actions above
---
Damn

My parents told me a story where I walked in on them having full blown sex and went up, sat on the bed, and ask "what's for dinner?" To this day, I have zero memory of the event and had no idea I did this. Kids are literally blind to that stuff unless it is pointed out to them.
---
Part of your care package to new players? What do you mean?
---
A non legendary pipe rifle can take out a scorched beast in 20sec or less with the right build. tse is meant to be extremely rare and that's the balance

Why not a 3 wide building with a donation hall 2 deep? You could put flamers on each side so you'll definitely hit them wherever they stand.
---
Since you can't place furniture that won't get destroyed, I'd suggest some wall decor to "liven" up the trap.
---
Last question: Where did you get the flame trap plans?
---
Fast travel would break. Not break the game, BGS will do that with this update
---
It just doesnt work in its current state.

Even bounty related PvP is shit, as the bounty hunters always have the advantage of first shot no matter what. Needs reworked

Agreed!  Avoid Youtube.  Play the games you like at the pace you like.

This one is/has the potential for fun.  It's hard to go back to Fallout 4 because of how small that map feels.

I make two weapons, a shielded suit, a piece of armor for every limb, and drop it in front of new players along with stims, radaway, food, steel, and wood. Oh and also some ammo.

No no... this food is soiled. There's raw fertilizer in the bag.

That will prevent you from hurting other people by accident and engaging in combat you don't want, not from being damaged by other.

OP: **Workshops are PVP content**.  The game specifically warns you about this before you take the workshop.  If you don't want to PVP don't try to hold a workshop, because someone who does want to PVP is going to view that as an invitation to fight.
---
As to the other half of your question: you're getting dropped in one shot because endgame weapons are crazy powerful and, because of the dupe exploit, dirt cheap and pervasively used.
---
Oh darn i thought you found one and didn't know what mob gave it 
---
Lvl 119 just got this today. Holy shit it's amazing. 
---
Reminds me of when a friend and I trapped a new player in prison. My friend manned the door control terminal and I lured them in. Here's a video for those interested: https://youtu.be/IaT-RY1G780
---
Tbh this is the kinda posts I wanna see here.
---
Because I'm waiting on the main story to do it with my buddy who hasn't been on in awhile.  I'm currently lvl 75 and I burn through stimpacks in nuke zones and sidequests.
---
I think the base price with 1 charisma and no perks is 5k my charisma is 6 with hard bargain lv 2 it’s 3880 caps

I don’t Think so, pretty sure those are both mods that go in the receiver slot.

He is the greatest. Follow him around for a bit and just listen to his wisdom. 
---
Yea, this weekend I was at Whitesprings drinking from the sulphur water fountain and all of the sudden he appears out of nowhere and starts pounding on me, I defeated him pretty easily but he scared the shit out of me. Maybe it's something to do with that water fountain because another time I was drinking out of it and a deathclaw spawned and started killing me.
---
Fps, long gameplay, lore, environment. Piecing the story together. Base building ( I would like more budget, bigger area).
---
I wish I had people to play with. The few people irl I know, I only played with a couple times before the gate train too then away. 
---
( I play on PC btw). 
---
Holotapes, I get to listening to eventually, unless I'm in a really into the quest or exploring.
---
Loot n shoot, yeah, but other games do it too. 
---
Pacifist mode doesnt stop incoming damage
---
It's a very expensive workaround. Glad it has worked out so well for you though :) 
---
Yeah this is a good point, I didn’t originally consider this
---
I mean it has double the chance to freeze and causes explosions. How could it not?
---
This is the biggest crock of false information crap I have ever heard.
---
The rewards most certainly do not “get better” in any way. You’re simply out the extra documents it takes beyond the first.
---
Do you play on Xbox?? I’m over level 40 so I don’t know if I qualify but some good under armor would be incredible.
---
Only on Reddit do people praise jerks. 
---
Can only offer you knowledge from FO4 as I've only managed to find one -fall dmg piece in 76. The Acrobats (-50% fall damage) legendary effect is additive so 2 pieces with it will negate all fall damage,but it only applies to legs. If you used console commands to add it to anything else in FO4 it might say it has the effect but it didn't do anything. I'm guessing the same applies here in 76 as the game engine is the same. Just a case of Bethesda adding it to the armor legendaries RNG without restricting it to legs.
---
Well my camp no longer disappears into nothing and that was only major gripe so...yeah.
---
I still crashes (PS4) and the rare server disconnect (Australia) though
---
Ok I got it to proc once in a 3 hr session with 9 luck at level 3 with the card with a super sledge. So something funky is going on. Maybe Bethesda will fix this card soon.
---
Why not six on each side?
---
Omae wa mou. SHINDERU!
---
Get the base game. I have the tricentennial edition, and literally the only thing I use from that is the power armour paint. It’d be cheaper to just get the base game and then the few skins you want from the Atom shop. 
---
Do you need to be near the workshop you own to be flagged for pvp? Or can you be anywhere as long as you own one?
---
I still complain because there’s still people who defend them like you. They deserve exactly 100% of the hate they are getting. If you disagree with that statement you are defending them. This was a train wreak and I don’t want them to ever try this shit again. Frankly, I’m proud of the community and their reaction. Until of course, I see a post like this. 
---
Cool, but maybe call it a sauna instead? ;-)
---
I've gone back and forth about getting this perk forever. It seems useful, but everything dies so quick I'm not sure it's that important to know vulnerabilities. 
---
I'm not even kidding, I had a quarter of a second worth of "WHAT ARE HIS SETTINGS ON?!?!" before I realized it was real.
---
This comment, OMG
---
Heavy is type, on legendary you really cant tell. Diference is in resistances they give and how they look. I had everything with this skin working, got loads of leather armor parts. Only heavy leather arms dont work, Studdy or light does, all kind of chest work, and legs works too i belive. I will make video as i come home and make another post, becouse ppl dont belive me lol.
---
Laser weapons (currently, maybe bugged) do not seem to benefit from armor piercing, so their effectiveness falls off harshly at higher levels.
---
Ur question was asking for a way to not get one shotted. I told u
---
Ikr? But you commented back so it must be true.
---
I'm camped at WS - I FT to 76, run down to Flatwoods (responders), run to Sutton (raiders), FT to my camp FOR WS and Enclave, FT to Harpers (freestates), then FT to Watoga (Watoga and BoS) - am I missing any?  Only 2 FT charges, only around 50-60 caps I think.
---
Yeah. This game is getting worse. It's better than it was at the beginning for sure. But oh my god. They are making it so hard for me to stay
---
Sorry for the late reply you can read that but back to this response I haven't spent a dime in either gta *online* since we have to ignore a part of the game for the argument to be valid or rdr2 or fallout 76 just $60 for each and gta rdr2 has vastly more content. Fallout is getting shit because it's an buggy filled empty mess.
---
Good idea building in an existing house, will give you extra space to build turrets, and greifers can only kill the doors so less to repair.
---
Blah blah blah. I'm a little bitch. That's all anyone got from this post.
---
Unfortunately that Atom Symbol doesn’t appear when you’ve put the chassis in the stash or take it out. So I still have to play Chassis Roulette to find the power armor I want. THEN the symbol will appear. They seriously need to display the armor on the chassis :(
---
You’re using a hunting rifle so no legendary effect so...yeah.
---
Plus you have shotgun as a secondary weapon so I’m guessing you’ve got perk points in that too meaning both rifles and shotguns, as well as stealth are under powered perk wise.
---
You can’t really be a jack of all trades in this game at the same time. 
---
TSD weapons. Everything is vulnerable against those. Literally had a group of people all with duped ones drop the queen from 3/4ths health to zero near instantly yesterday. Those of us without TSE weapons were just like "wtf was that?"
---
I didnt ask any questions
---
There was this one guy at a lonely camp on the far left of the map literally far left I crafted a few missiles , 40 mm and made it rain on him got a 150 bounty , he left since his camp just vanished with him and I travelled back to mines , I got one shot back at camp, I’m close to level 90 lol 
---
"SEE YA LATER SUCKER HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!"
---
Let me know if that works.  Only way I know of to get rid of mutations you don't want is using radaway to get rid of a random mutation and keep trying until you get rid of the one you want to.  I ended up keeping all them cause it's a really pain in the ass to pick and choose.
---
I'm sure someone will help, but for future reference, super are a good way to snag frag nades.
---
Did you deepthroat Todd though? 
---
I made it solo with gating plasma helping me the final stretch used like 10 cores or so
---
But dat wear and tear tho...oh wait, the luck perk that repairs your weapon when you hit stuff...you should see it kick in for a ripper it’s insane 
---
Only way to play 
---
I've not placed any turrets tho, feel that they are a waste with budget and effectiveness in mind.
---
Also building in existing houses makes sense to me, why create a new structure when you can just take over an existing one? 
---
They’re not his kids. That’s his excuse. 
---
Back off, brah. Lots of people have bad parenting skills you can’t police them all.

I call it the bike chain of the gods - thats what it reminded me off when I saw it at this angle...

flawless logic. let me try: there are birds outside my window, so you must be wrong.
---
What are TSD weapons? 
---
Been using the same fusion core for 3 weeks up to 45 fusion cores
---
Anyone here want to explain to me why having a base there is bad? Ive only ever seen 3 bases there so thats why i ask if thats a problem.
---
&gt; but other games do it too.
---
And that is where I would have gone with this. 76 being a fad chasing mass appeal sort of game scratches a lot of different itches so what you will find is there are other games that focus better on the particular itches that appeal to you and are generally made by developers that are more deserving of your patronage and consumer loyalty than bethesda is after some of the shady moves they've made with 76.
---
for example...
---
&gt; Fps, long gameplay, lore, environment. Piecing the story together. Base building ( I would like more budget, bigger area).
---
This sounds like you would enjoy subnautica it too is a first person game where you explore a set map of well crafted distinct environments and build bases towards your survival as you piecie a story together you find through others logs and automated systems. You even get power armor.
---
You make a lot of good points. You are asking for trolls and then feeding them, but still, your not wrong.
---
I do think Bethesda should get more grief than other games and studios. Skyrim and Fallout 4 quality of games did not lead up to no man's sky. We want them to do better. If we didn't care, we would forget about it after a month and move on... But no... Many of us still get mad that we have to wait on their next big release to get a fix we thought was coming with fo76. And we want to make damn sure they understand what went wrong. I believe Bethesda is a good studio... I want them to do better. Yet, I can't help but feel frustrated by the blind meme hate that doesn't even apply. "Every aspect of fo76 must be horrible and we must all comment on it at every opportunity!" Give me a break. 
---
With the explosive weapons yes. but correct me if I'm wrong here everyone, if you vats someone in pvp it shows theres as well? I know it shows up for the whitesprings bots as well as everything else and everything seemed to have its own unique res values. 
---
Have you tried walking the rail from the mountaintop?  Do it w/o PA - seriously cringe worthy
---
I don't really have a route right now. I used to be fairly centrally located with my camp, with Whitespring, Enclave Bunker and Pleasant Stations close by. I would then fast travel to Vault 76 and hit up Flatwoods for Responder,  port back to camp, hit both Watogas,  port back to camp and finish with a Harpers Ferry. 
---
Noe I've moved my camp next to a waterfall in the Mire and have no clue which route I'm going to take. 
---
That moment came to me when I could don a full set of T-60 power armor.
---
After that a lot less fear. 
---
Oh good idea!
---
I had to hop off but will hunt them all out tomorrow.
---
The reason it looked a little different when you put into google translate is because google translated uses simplified Chinese while this is dragon written in traditional Chinese. 
---
I’m sorry to say that it doesn’t actually mean anything, it literally says drunk dragon (sharp) tip. It’s probably the name given to this machine. There’s no reference that comes to mind with the name for me. 
---
You are welcome. Glad I could help!
---
The flamer I picked up off a ghoul and had ammo for it so decided to burn it. Usually just my Gauss and my handmade. 
---
The main reason they are useless is because the resource production is shite. I had a loop where I had two places with 40+ tin cans that would give me all the lead I needed for a typical run. They need to massively increase the production. Plus, PvP isn't fun, so there's no incentive to fight over them, either.
---
The game is literally the worst multiplayer experience of any game I've ever seen. The solo experience is fine, but there's no reason to interact with people. The only time I do anything with other players is in the nuke zones. 
---
Your peasant ness is no much for my power ness
---
Whoops,  meant TSE. Two shot explosive. They are currently extremely broken endgame legendaries that are very pervasive throughout the game due to dupers. They kill pretty much everything in one shot. 
---
Love how every post of this exact type eventually gets edited by the OP to be the equivalent of "EDIT: WOW YOU'RE ATTACKING ME FOR LIKING THE GAME" when I never see that in the comments.
---
For me it's two steps forward, one step back. Server stability has been the worst for me. 
---
Huh interesting. I love learning new stuff about this game. Thanks!
---
To be fair, he IS a liar. Bald faced, too, not just half truths or whatever.
---
Have the most up to date codes been found yet?
---
You know.. I'm not to really care.. but when a Level 40 has a camp outside with missile launchers and I can't even see what I'm doing from the blasts...  
---
You are getting taken out.
---
Why do none of these players just fast travel away.... is common sense not a thing? OR shoot the damn door. 
---
Oh yeah, I remember that one now. The pink paint job reminded me.
---
Neat story but you should spec into commas for future stories.
---
I have my camp at the little pond where you can see the front and back doubledoors of that infamous hot spot; so its at least not farming mobs when no one is there.
---
As for turrets, I only use 2 Artillery. I throw the blue smoke grenade when people are their farming.
---
\- throw the smoke grenade next to the tennis court if people are farming in the front
---
\- throw the smoke grenade under the porch/stairs if people are farming in the back
---
\- throw the smoke grenade directly above the roof if people are farming on the 2nd floor
---
Having two artillery does increase the duration of how long it will shoot. They are basically equivalent to mini nukes.
---
Yeah they have 
---
failing that, basically anywhere that has 3 or more dots in proximity is probably a workshop. I mean I haven't combed the map or anything. if you know of any exceptions please share.
---
P.S. The drinking fountain in whitesprings cures diseases. I felt like that should be in this thread for some reason.
---
From what I remember with Fallout 4, robots have strong ballistic (meaning bullet-based attacks, the game calls it 'damage resistanc'e) defence, but weaker energy weapon defence.  I'm assuming, but not absolutely certain that's the case since I don't have the perk that shows their weakness, just going off what I remember from 4.   If you're fighting robots, aim for their torso, or arms, head shots on robots actually end up doing less damage than body shots.  And removal of all robot arms on most robots will force them into a self-destruct state that will destroy them regardless of their remaining life.  I believe the only robots that have actual weak points are the Handy/Gutsy units where their thruster is the weaker point, and Sentry Bots have their fusion cores exposed while overheating.
---
The basic idea is that if the target is using metal armor, or is made mostly of metal, they have weaker energy weapon defence.  If the target is animal or has any kind of thick hide, those hides are resistant to energy weapons, but have weaker ballistic defence.
---
Super Mutants tend to wear metal for armor, which means they are more vulnerable to energy weapons due to their weaker energy defence.  I'm looking at the wiki, and it seems like they all do possess very strong ballistic defence, but weaker energy defence, but still pretty high for both.
---
Scorched on the other hand have basically equal-parts energy, and equal parts ballistic defence, so it really doesn't matter what you're using on them, just shoot in the head.
---
Not really sure about feral ghouls, but from what I remember in Fallout 4, feral ghouls have thick, leathered skin, and their stats in that game indicate higher energy defence, but lower ballistic defence.  Again, assuming it's the case for 76.
---
As for other enemies, somebody with the perk would have to give a better judgement.
---
And yet, the RRP for the games at launch was the same.
---
I swear there's never anything like this on PS4! Everyone on PS4 is always helpful and supportive, I've never had anybody even really attack me and I've been playing since beta. Things like this make me wish there were a few more diabolical people on PS4.
---
Bravo sir, this is amazing, and your murder church as well! 
---
Yeah. My list of QoL fixes alone is staggering. Let alone trying to balance anything. All fallout games ran into the issue of the player eventually becoming too strong. This time it matters, hopefully we get something soon.
---
Share them please if you could
---
Thats cool
---
But he's never wrong about what he says about the game so...
---
You don’t think FO76 will be much improved in two years?
---
I have naturally 5 points. +2 from herd mentality, usually +4 or +6 from magnetic personality. Maybe +1 from gear.
---
I’ve seen the same layout on 5 different servers today , pointless since by you not being there you can’t farm correctly the remains of ghouls 
---
Can you ride the missile? 
---
Will do🤙🏽
---
You can be anywhere to be flagged according to a post I just read about a guy who was contesting workshops, then fast traveling to the owners to kill them. Very shitty mechanic.
---
You can use any station in the world.  
---
You have to exit the power armor and place it in the station.  You can either place it there while exiting, or be out of it and place it from your inventory into the station.    
---
Then just like a weapons or armor workbench, you'll have to go into the repair/modify menu.
---
I sadly was not directly on top of the silo hatch but it would be an interesting theory to try
---
one is stagger the other is cripple, stagger stuns the target cripple reduces movement in that limb
---
I've had to queue up to join people several times. Have only had an emptyish server twice, and that was after maintenance/patches.
---
I wish she'd drop those for me. I only ever get the explosive vent mod. 
---
&gt;Fucking. Shut. Up.
---
Nope. I have the right to say whatever the fuck I want. 
---
Are you trying to share Rank 3 of rad sponge? If so, does the issue occur with all rank 3 perks? Are you able to share a rank 2 perk?
---
Do you have Magnetic Personality, or is someone on your team sharing it with you?
---
Are you using Strange in Numbers to boost the effects of Herd Mentality?
---
What platform are you on, and how recently have you tried (and failed) to share rad sponge?
---
Aww, where did the video go?
---
It's all removed :(
---
Try with your camp. Go up to your camp and choose the "repair all structures" option. 
---
3 star legendarys
---
Oh course I was on the table, how else am I supposed to get away from the ghouls?
---
I do, but since the last patch I haven't been able to hit the queen as consistently(people keep bring out high damage weapons and making her invincible) and doing the scorched earth event was my main source of pure cobalt flux. Four are needed to make the suit, I have more on a mule but I have to wait for my cousin to get on later.
---
PM me your GT and ill message you on xbox tomorrow when I have more. 
---
I have no opinion on fo76, since i havent played it. But it's pretty easy to see The Long Dark was 20$ without discount when it was first launched in early access. After it left EA, the price was raised to 30$. Now I have played that one and that seems pretty fair to me really, especially with the volume of updates the developer has created. 
---
Not sure why you're calling folks sheep?
---
https://steamdb.info/app/305620/
---
Kill enemies with multiple stars, the more stars the higher the chance of a multi effect item. Usually a 3 star can spawn wherever 1 star enemies spawn, they're just not as often spawning.
---
I have mine set up near the walk way close to the fence and I have the 3 turrets (well, 4 if you count the spotlight) set to a power switch that I keep turned off if I'm not around (got a big arrow pointing to it if anybody needs help).  I just use it as a fallback point when I get spotted.  And it has all the amenities for anybody that needs them (except an arch - working on getting the flux for that)
---
Add a perk card maybe that puts a balloon over corpses?  This way there is a slight cost for people who want it but those that don't can still stay emmersed?
---
Someone posted that they stood on the hatch but they just slid off when it opened.
---
Is it possible to get a honey beast?
---
It's a cop uniform...

Pint sized slasher and grifter’s fit, please. I’d gladly threw real dollars at some fan favorites.
---
Heck why not include outcast power armor paint, or unique weapon variants a la New Vegas. Or the Riot Gear. That would sell like crazy and we all know it
---
Exactly
---
I was like you once, then I finished the story and the game suckss.
---
(ignoring all the bugs)
---
The camp owner was onsite but looked to be afk. Gained a 120 bounty by taking out the launchers and knocking him out. But so much more peaceful.
---
Yup! 
---
Being sold one thing and getting another IS bs. I agree. This is the one solid, unassailable critique of the game... The thing that was fucked up so bad they deserved to get snacked for it.
---
But even that comes down to the marketing/packaging team... Not the coders, testers, and producers. The game itself is solid - the special edition content is hot garbage, just like it always is.
---
See also, MvC3's "infinity eggs", Halo Special Editions NeoNatal sized Helmets, and an almost infinite number of derpy looking statues.
---
Doesn't make it any less forgivable, but the lesson I would suggest is "quit buying this bullshit".
---
Until I read this post,  I assumed it was the same- that PvP over workshops took place at the workshop and people could just let it go if they wanted.
---
Well,  even less reason for me to take workshops now. 
---
Okay bud I’m level 70 played the game and I think it’s still terrible. The sheer amount of bugs makes it worse. The lore is s**t it’s like destinys grim-ore cards. They f***d up the lore entirely too. Still not fixed and it’s January wtf!?!?
---
Look for 2 people or more sometimes. When the lobby lags just check its usually a high level and a lower level. Or just check all duos we literally just watch from a distance and stY hidden until we know everything is in the stash
---
upvote just for saying "jesus fuck"
---
Wdym? If I use 4 explosive bobbleheads does that mean +120% explosive damage?
---
I had that happen once.  Nothing in any compartments.  And only a 2 or 3 enemies that time.  
---
Inherited workshops seem to be bugged. You can complete their defense/retake events even when you are on other side of map and never even been at them. All this while you are only one so it can't be a teammember completing them for you.
---
The whole resort is connected including the bunker entrances.  
---
Everything else are out buildings.
---
Because you're exploiting a bug? Which you have to go well out of your way to encounter, btw.
---
And since that particular dupe bug has only been around a short time, I'd expect it to get squashed pretty quick. Which is why there patch team is doing a good job.
---
This is how software development works.
---
The last few days I've been getting it literally 10-15 times a day. Always when i'm either in my inventory or at a vendor. Bethesda Support's response, when I asked them to look into it (because I know many have been getting it) was to reboot the system. Riiiiiiight. 
---
Now use 50 and see what happens lol
---
I see where your coming from. What do you think the punishment/loss should be of those raiders who's bounty has been collected?
---
Nice where is this location on the map?
---
GTA Online also had hacks and dupes for YEARS and Rockstar did nothing.
---
The what?
---
I'd go as far as to say that if you're wanted in this system Fast traveling should be disabled.
---
This is what blind fanboyism looks like.
---
Wow that sounds powerful.. itll be ages before I find that many lol
---
It's been extra rough for me in the last few days. I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I usually wind up disconnecting almost immediately when I first sign in.
---
Thank you for crystallizing a thought I had.   My “moment” came once I switched from sniper to melee and got a 3* deathclaw gauntlet with faster swing  speed.  Before I cowered from the mob.  Now I wade through it.  
---
He also claimed to have played close to 32,000 hours on FO3 and 3000 hours on Witcher 3. This guys a joker or just living in his mums basement.
---
Next to Seneca rocks visitor centre 🙂
---
I launched a nuke and went to the hatch and nothing happened, idk which hatch correlates to which silo 
---
I’m with ya. Over 150 hours and only level 38. I’ll get there in time
---
Saw a 27 up there today so I came in swinging All Rise style then got him in a team and did a few WS runs 
---
I am trying to share rank 3. Honestly, it seems like it happens when I share any perk *most of the time*. Every now and then, I share one, including radsponge, and it sticks for awhile. It happens whether I have magnetic personality, or if someone is sharing it. I don't use strange in numbers, because when I did, it did weird things, like half my mutations would temporarily disappear, or the positive effects would just stop. Ps4, and last time we all got together was probably a few days ago.
---
I love how holier than thou types like to dogpile on people on reddit. Maybe you should just hold your tongue
---
Consoles too? It's rough out there.
---
Sadly, this is always a issue when this type of game rolls around with this system. What would you put in to help counter balance this?
---
Look, while I agree, the fact of the matter is they haven't given this game an update in since Dec 19th, that's kind of pushing it. I can be as patient as the next guy, but you can see how from an outsiders perspective that this game is already dying (or looks like it is).
---
Nice pictures. I was further away and was enjoying watching it. As it disappeared off into the clouds I thought to myself, what was that 'record video' hotkey again. LOL. 
---
I craft level appropriate missimg pieces onto power armors i find in the world.
---
But I really need to rush to the endgame so I can go around whining that there's not enough endgame content though. /s
---
So buildings like the golf course aren't connected by another secret tunnel?
---
cant sell ammo.
---
to vendors, at least
---
Not that I have found and I have spent a lot of time there.
---
Yep, that was a really bad time for square enix. hopefully bethesda can pull something like that off and revitalize fallout 76.
---
What game are these from?
---
You can, just dont shoot on them, when they are in workshop/camp.  
---
I was thinking that as well. It would be neat to have a bot with a couple of C.A.M.P designs IE Raider themed walls etc.
---
I’ve tried with a couple and didn’t have the option. Could have been cause of my level though 
---
pmed you
---
Game is multiplayer Fallout 4 with no npcs. What exactly did everyone think it was going to be? I'll admit its far from perfect, but they didn't lie about what the game was. And the the BETA gave a very accurate indication of what the game was going to be like. I was annoyed by the canvas bag thing, but they're fixing it. And the game has been getting better. I'd like some new content, but I've played over 100 hours. For all the people who just want to complain,  without providing reasons, get lost. And buyer's remorse isn't a reason. If you don't like the movie, too bad, you don't get a refund. You are allowed to complain, but not endlessly about the same tired excuses.
---
what if I plan my build around handmades? you're telling me I should punch stuff until the game decides I've been a good boy and drops me one at a astronomically low chance?
---
Buddy you need to leave the forest
---
I think that one is Middle Mountain Cabins. The map shows 3 cabins with green roofs. One has a chimney.
---
Like glass-box that u can open and close. They were even in fallout 4
---
Then why do you still play it? If the bugs and lore are so bad, why were you invested enough to get level 70? I feel like if you think a game is terrible you would quit it in the first few hours and work on getting a refund lmao. I'd get maybe level 20 at the max, but 70? You're either lying or you're just being a complainer. Sad either way
---
Need a site Charlie code that is current please
---
Not sure where to post this.  Today I connected to a server and white springs had all the indications that a nuke had been dropped, flora/enemies etc. But there was no nuke atmosphere, no rads, no negative effects.  I'm not sure if this is a normal after effect, I'm level 90 and have never come across it.

---
I server hop for specific reasons. Example when I know the only reliable spot to get a piece of armor I want and the plans are either taken or the incorrect ones.  
---
You have two choices... Wait for who knows how long or hop and try again.  
---
Has nothing to do with rushing or getting there, it has to do with a loot system flaw.
---
I dont know of any glass box. Could you give a little more info?
---
Why did this get removed?  
---
Considering how often I'm not been arsed to take back a workshop, but never seen a take back workshop event of anyone else, I think they are personal quests.
---
&gt;If someone else shows up before me does it just turn into the usual 'take the workshop', just with all my stuff already built?
---
I think the workshop is still yours. Maybe someone would need to test it but then, hard to imagine anyone bothering as workshops aren't exciting to begin with.
---
Hello Again, 
---
Stealth is so fucking broken I had to turn the game off (frustration factor off the charts), I'm level 105, at Top of the World (2ND Level): I'm in stealth, and my caution mode keeps blinking from "DANGER" to "HIDDEN", while I'm cloaked,  in complete darkness, not even moving. All my stealth perks are equipped: Sneak(Maxed Out), Escape Artist (Maxed Out), Ninja, &amp; Covert ops &amp; Light footed.
---
I'm trying to give the game the benefit of the doubt after having already been kicked out so many times already, now this as it has always been since almost day one, I mentioned this early on with the Beta, but obviously it's not important enough to fix. Also what's still broken: stealth, then enter water, then swim in water, then exit water, go back into stealth = "STEALTH ISN'T THERE" (sometimes for a short time/or when I get attacked), I mentioned this to with the Beta, obviously again, it must be something they just don't care about fixing.
---
Aquaboy/Aquagirl is still broken: can enter water &amp; swim in water &amp; breath underwater = no harm (advisable to use hazmat gear or you might get a disease). Aquaboy/Aquagirl: collect water even with hazmat gear on, still get irratiated
---
Also experimented a long time ago, if you think about it, (common sense speaking), wearing your Hazmat gear keeps you safe from getting waterbourne, airborne contamination, "BUT IF YOU LAY DOWN ON A SLEEPING BAG IN YOUR HAZMAT GEAR", you still get the disease. Go figure.
---
Half the time, I can't get on my friends team without turning everything off and coming back on (multiple times), sometimes that doesn't even work, so this  game is supposed to be fun if you play on a team, "Good Luck" getting it to work, because it doesn't work very well, or your invisible or your teamates are invisible or you try to invite someone to your team, and you get kicked off the team, or the "Team" in the "Social Tab" says your on a team, except there are no names in the lower left corner of your game screen to indicate such, and with all this, how are we supposed to "enjoy" playing this game when it just doesn't work..
---
Have a nice day everyone
---
I actually haven't even seen the Flatwoods Monster yet, or the Mothman. After 200 hours of play. I've seen several Grafton Monsters and a fee Mega Sloths. 
---
I need to start hunting. 
---
I built a paintball town. People just dont want to pvp 
---
They're all playing it wrong that's why! You should be using their silly anti-pvp system to be an irritating unkillable pile of shit.
---
Only encountered one duper who could stack enough crap to override that reduction. It's like Unreal except I don't even need to dodge!
---
It's really kind of a "have to make your own fun" sort of title, not following the crappy guidelines they set up for a completely unfinished system.
---
Treat it like Second Life griefing, but with guns.
---
A short time? Sure, ok.
---
Can you lock the doors?
---
Does no one else remember the launches of Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Skyrim? (Yeah, I know Obsidian made F:NV, same rule applies.) Bugs, crashes, and problems galore! Skyrim's first patch killed magic resistances for PCs and made dragons fly backwards. Fallout 76 is par for the course, in a few months it'll be pretty good and once the dlc launches, it'll probably be well received by everyone.
---
Yes on tbe shocks. I got one on my third server hop and the second a dozen hours of hopping later. 
---
Have never seen the jetpack, though. 
---
I agree about this it opens up an opportunity for other players to act as bounty hunters and military forces to combat the raiders. Makes the game more immersive in a sense.
---
With this strategy you haven’t built anything except extractors. After the retake you repair any damaged ones with workshop materials you didn’t blow on worthless defense. 
---
No. I leave them open anyway so ppl can use workbenches and beds.
---
How do you suppose people with no development skills or programming knowledge provide a relatively large tech company with constructive feedback? Good luck. Some can, but I would say the majority can't.
---
WHAT
---
Yeah the game seems to like to disconnect you when you have workshops just set up.
---
Yeah...um..no..
---
At level 204 I have 9 sets of PA, that don't get it done, I want the ability to name then or at least show me the torso in the name of each.
---
Because I was hoping it would get better. My friends kept playing it and what not. I stopped around when the server crashed when I was at the end of it(I did this solo btw). 
---
I wasn't really trying to be rude; it was just a joke and in my mind more of a stupid idiom.  Sorry if I hurt your feelings OP- please don't shoot up a school.
---
Thank you. Im lvl 65. Im getting there and its cool.
---
E
---
Why are you planning a build around something you know is that rare? You can perk yourself up for rifles. Unless it's a legendary handmade the gun isn't some god tier weapon, people only like it because it's rare. 
---
I’m a dad joke guy too being a dad myself. 
---
I got a good chuckle. Take my upvote 😃
---
I mean at the end of a nuke silo
---
My bad
---
Ad victoriam, brother!
---
That sounds good as long as it was reasonably priced, maybe around $10
---
That's strange, even with one teammate, you should have the needed 9 charisma to share. 
---
The only effect that comes to mind that could be lowering your charisma is addiction. You're not a junkie are you?
---
Long distance friend play? Check
---
Annoyed wife? Check
---
Bad mouth kids? Check
---
My fault? Check
---
We should start a club.
---
Thank you for seeing it that way. 
---
Ah, yeah I get the two confused sometimes. 
---
One of my favorite comments haha truly it’s what a Raider is, people are really missin’ the point. But this is just my two cents 
---
I was thinking that as well. I would drop $10 US for that option.
---
I’ve got the key and open every compartment and nothing at all
---
I was disappointed with my Tricentennial edition. I don’t use any of the skins it came with. 
---
Love the game, just disappointed with the extra freebies in the Tri version. 
---
Have an upvote for showing some logic, yup, too hard to know the real reason behind it, people seem quick to blame exploits and maybe they are right, but I know one thing from the youtubers I have been watching and that's exploits have been a thing since day one.
---
The game definitely has become less stable, at least from my seat on the couch, whatever the reason, the instability is the issue.
---
Some say shes still building up her final counter attack, mach 17 scorched queen dive bomb
---
Not a problem. I play as a merc myself so any one who plays as a raider keeps me in business.
---
You've played a game 10 hours a day for almost 2 months straight and are surprised you're sick of it?  
---
When is the last time you saw the sun or breathed in fresh air?
---
Handmade is not rare at all. It's limited to a level group and if you miss that you miss your chance. I was almost level 50 before I knew about it so I bought the plans from someone 
---
I have played this game for over 100 hours and I did have fun playing it I also hated it at the same time there are things in this game that just don't work I don't know how many times I have launched a nuke and the server crashes I have even crashed fighting the scorchbeast queen. The little bugs here and there don't bother me but the game breaking bugs are ridiculous the game can't even calculate your mutations properly if you have alot of them fallout 76 is getting the hate it deserves because it doesn't feel like a finished game 
---
So many people complain about the engine, but most don't really understand how engines work or are made. It is outdated? In some ways yes, in others it's been updated and works fine. If having the best engine is required for a great game, explain Minecraft.
---
my point is that sometimes, if you really want something, you have no choice but to hop.
---
you could achieve the 76K hours thing and not see a single jetpack. I'm not gonna that chance.
---
Disagree. That's walking the line of pay to win.
---
I have been all over the map. I just choose not to spend all my time at white springs all day sucking exp up from others and hunting legendaries cause that’s incredibly boring.
---
Thanks again, will check them out when I get home. Perhaps it's a very popular farming location and I was really unlucky, we'll see now that I know where to look :)
---
Very good point I hadn't considered thay
---
I dont think they can dude. Remember new years "party"?
---
Didn't make it that far but that still doesn't exclude part of the game  the guy that posted the microtransactions shit went about it wrong the microtransactions in 76 besides price isn't that bad I haven't paid money for anything let's use a new game with new game 60$ rdr2 expensive story up to 100s of hours of gameplay myself ran into 10 bugs in 60 hours. 60$ fallout 76 bugs every 2 mins the scorched still can't hold a gun straight a month later repeatable boring go here kill this. Game has gotten more buggy since launch can't fall back on singleplayer cause there is none. The end game queen rarely drops anything the world takes me walking up to items for them to load in, disconnects, crashes etc. The game is being shit in cause nothing works well not because of microtransactions and hacks which are starting to hurt the game.
---
I think it's literally luck, yes I get your point, if a player has already looted that power armour on that server, you see it again, miraculously fixed in the next. Its the way the multiplayer aspect works and its here to stay. Thinking its a flaw will be frustrating.
---
Lol, I'm not too sure, someone suggested that it could be the colour of the stripe but not sure if ti's related to the top stripe or middle stripe.
---
Just cut the red wire lol 
---
My wife has had to endure me playing fallout since fallout 3 and never really made any gripes about it until Fallout 4 and the Vault Tec DLC. She sat beside me on the couch and after a while she said "WTF are you doing? You're just moving furniture around and building a clubhouse. I thought you shoot people in this game?" With F76 she was watching and asked what I was doing and I said trying to find screws. "Screws? Now you're just looking for screws!?" Yes, yes I am. 
---
End game is interior decorating and hunting for the legendary paper mache masks.
---
Atom giveth; Atom taketh away.
---
Yes very frequently.
---
Ahh maybe it is that then, I'll have to keep my eye out to see if a daily quest pops up for it. 
---
Even if it was the most common rifle people would want it just as much. It has more to do with the damage:rate of fire ratio and that you can fit a drum holding 85 rounds if you don't mind forgoing armour penetration.
---
It’s got a blowhole 
---
It's limited to spawning at vendors for a certain level cap. You can still obtain the rifle by finding it in the world, and you can get the plans at any level from the event at the prison.
---
Why do you disagree with pay2win on such a feature? How would this give another player an advantage?
---
Me personally it would incentivize me to play because I dont want to grind again. Just my two cents.
---
&gt;The game's barely been out two months, and I think the patch team has done a pretty good job.
---
Wow, I'm sorry but is this your first online game?
---
The only time I had a worse experience was in Tree of Saviour where the servers went down for a whole weekend with zero communication.
---
Any other online game I played treated the game and the community way better. Most of them were tiny indie studios and some even lead and developed by 1 guy in his spare time.
---
You would think that a company with one of the biggest budgets, years of inhouse experience on their self-developed tools, 4 community managers etc. would be way ahead of any standards tiny hobbyist projects could set.
---
But I guess not when perspectives like yours exist and you start min-maxing cost-benefit.
---
"After 500 hours."
---
Christ. 
---
So you remember where this is? I marketed it on my map and accidentally moved it and now I can’t find it. 
---
It’s way up north, but I am at a loss :(
---
“Now you’re talking to me baby! That I like! Keep it coming!” 
---
Hopefully they can tailor the game so that it may better reward playing in styles like this. It’s a great way to keep the game moving. 
---
Perhaps its time for Bethesda to finally man the fuck up and stop releasing garbage. They are relying too much on people like OP that will support them no matter what.
---
Did you do the motherlode quest?
---
Ive done it a couple times solo without issues and I jumped into one part way through yesterday and still got loot.
---
Mob spawn amount can be grossly different though, Ive had a couple where im so busy with miners I cant fully loot and others where I get 3-4 miners all solo
---
That's strange you never saw this because this is what happens after the dust settles. The nuke zone remains in its initial state for couple hours and then the sky clears,but the enemies and flora stay for a while after that (not sure for how long though).
---
And it's the frustration that causes people to server hop.
---
Your desperation for attention is boring 
---
You really need to look up shit rdr2 is being shit on for p2w those video are why I'd didn't even give it a try.
---
You’ve got issues, man. Maybe you should see a professional if you’re taking a video game this much to heart. I hope you’re doing okay. 
---
Also Far Cry games have been extruded identikit trash since 2.
---
Reminds me of morrowing journal quest log
---
Finally someone smart these guys must be ignoring the hate on rdr2 online to fit the narrative.
---
I started to set my C.A.M.P. up next to Vault76 and give away starter gear like leather armor and lvl 1 guns with ammo.
---
I hope Beth will push out an update soon then I can set up a store there for new players.
---
Finally someone smart these guys must be ignoring the hate on rdr2 online to fit the narrative 
---
If all of them were left it'd be the ninth wonder of the world!
---
The way most people play games, is to set goals and achieve them efficiently. It's up to the developers to make that path fun. This is how people are wired and why most people play the game this way. Developers need to understand how people are likely to play their games and work around that rather than automatically expect them to follow the designed path.
---
Oh yeah. I forgot games are allowed to be bad because other games are bad. 
---
No, it's not. The game is trash and good for the youtubers to shame bethesda for it, lest they will keep releasing garbage
---
you think armor penetration is what makes these weapon op?
---
armor means squat in pvp. they deal upwards of 10K damage. no armor in the game can thwart that.
---
except, of course, of op armor. which doesn't work half the time.
---
If they do overwrite you could get every mutation and use serum to get rid of the ones you don't want. If they don't overwrite you'd need to use the serums of the ones you don't want first and then do the mutation run.
---
It's all speculation for now since I'm too poor to buy anything. :P
---
Over killing enemies is a big thing in fallout games as you get more powerful. Why do you need 5 points in Adrenaline when you're able to 1-2 shot enemies with only 1 point. 
---
Melee Weapons and Armor gain extra damage or DR if they are over repaired with Weapon Artisan or Fix it Good perks. Or if you find any with high condition. For example a Mr Handy Buzz Blade goes from 30ish damage to 70. 
---
Try develop a routine. For example my day starts with me selling to vendors. I sell chems mostly. So i always run Travelling Pharmacy. 
---
If you're stuck at work, try to develop a new build, or try to tidy up your current one. Single points of things like Marathoner (20% cheaper sprint), or four leaf clover can change your play up a lot.
---
I have raider underamor with leather pieces on it, 4\* machete in hand, 3\* knuckles in pocket and TSE pump in bag when someone is too strong. **I hate power armor**, have *one in stast tho, because you cant kill a group of super mutants in nuke only wearing hazmat, they have strong ranged damage.*
---
When i join server and there is someone with bounty, thats first thing to do. If i travel and meet someone with low level, i drop them some super stimpacks, *because I have 50-100 from queen fights*. When I get mad for no reason, I can **stab** you, shot your house once with TSE, then repair walls, dont suit me, I am on **drugs**. Between queen killing i had mr. handy buzz, so i was "repairing" poweramors of people who werent on my group, *i hate those tin cans*. Sometimes I stand in peoples fire, trying if they have pacifist on, if not, yeah thats my junk now. Life is hard, be life!
---
Hmmm 10hrs of non stop server hopping to get the Hunters Coat. Imagine how long it would take normally.
---
Therefore you forgot the 'I want it now' crowd.
---
However, Im in the 'I cant relax until I have x item as I know it will enhance my game enjoyment immensely' crowd.
---
It’s only negative is it increases your hunger and thirst, 100% worth it 
---
I would think adding in "PvP" damage would be best. IE Shotgun does 90 damage to PvE mobs. but in PvP it does 25. Mob dmg and PvP damage are both visible and makes it alot easier to manage IMO. Perks would need to be done the same way.
---
Is that the reason my base got completely destroyed!? I got a notification my base was under attack and came back to literal rubble. I didn't even have defenses up I just like posting there because it makes my crops look better without a bunch of crap in the way. 
---
Has FO4 improved at all in 2 years? 
---
Found 3 BoS officer Uniform plans tonight never tried finding them till now met people who thats the only underarmor plan there missing loot seems finiky when ur seraching for it.
---
Refer to [All MAX level power armors stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all_max_level_power_armors_stats/) for damage/energy resistance values of each power armor model.
---
Also note that some enemies (e.g.: General Gutsy) have armor penetration, so your build will need other forms of damage reduction besides damage/energy resistance, if you're primarily interested in tanking ability.
---
Thanks for the help, that's kind of sad it's not something with more meaning, but it's still kind of cool.
---
Also good on ur friend for that!
---
I managed a selfie with one leaving the tube 😭🔥
---
One of the best perk for any heavy gun/sniper build.
---
Decent with melee in a sense that ya can close gaps on people but not the most reliable for meels
---
Here here
---
Well I should have listened to them cause they was right! But I would have bought it anyway cause I'm a fallout fanboy.
---
Wearing a grin that's splitting my face over how adorable this is. Thanks for the feels!
---
I like the game, and the bugs are small enough for me to overlook and I completely ignore the atomic shop. I don't refuse to acknowledge its flaws but I enjoy the experience- And apparently that's wrong. You CANNOT enjoy a flawed product if that product's name rhymes with Fukout Seventydix, because it had bugs on launch and in the BETA. God forbid one game in the entire gaming industry caters to PvE preferring players or people who don't want to be KOS'd, despite every other game that exists with multiplayer since Pong caters to that genre.
---
Honestly the launch state has improved and will continue to improve if they still have a playerbase, but all the hate on 76 drives people who might like it away. And because of this, Bethesda, or even Zenimax might feel encouraged to end the project and shut down the game, or drop active development entirely and leave it in its current state. Overly bad press could KILL this game, and right now there's an agenda to not just kill 76, but to boycott Bethesda Game Studios entirely. People are pushing to end Bethesda and it's a popular movement. With the release of this one title, people have begun to call Bethesda a greedy evil corporation that is worse than Ubisoft or any other company.
---
I could even see the possibility of massive money loss and bad press being why Bethesda have been pushing the atomic store and its goods more. They're trying to make up for the lost funds and save the project that the hate train is killing. And right now it really looks like the game is at risk of ceasing development and dying like so many want it to. 
---
I had a ton of fun with my instigating yari.  Spearing mutants in the back for days!
---
"Because everyone is acting like the game is in the exact same state it was on the day of launch and it's almost maddening. "
---
No, its not exactly the same. In some regards, better, in some regards, worse, and its everchanging. It's a constant meme because Bethesda keeps fucking up something with the game (launch codes 2019??), so there is always something to write/talk/make memes about.
---
Although I am enjoying the game, I'd say it's definitely still in a state not fit for release. It plays like an Alpha the amount I get crashes and random bugs on PS4
---
I've been hopping quite a bit trying to find events I haven't done.  Faster than waiting around for something to trigger.  Some servers have 6-8 events, some have 0-2, I see nothing wrong with jumping to find something new to play.
---
Gta be like
---
My endgame content is the golf course!1!!
---
Did you know people build houses there and screw up my farming!11!
---
When TES6 launches with an outdated engine, 2012 graphics, frequent bugs and crashes and with an Atom Shop, we know who to blame. 
---
Is the heal amount the same no matter the weapon or is it proportional to the guns damage?
---
I have a vampire LMG and it’s pretty minor regen. Does, say, a vampires black powder rifle regen more per hit?
---
Yep, definiately a masterpiece, and I'm not even into survival games. Bagged it for free, but I'd gladly pay for it if I knew it was THIS big.
---
After watoga and whitsprings, I just fast travel like a slob. 
---
I am on PC and have an anti-armor handmade, but it is not going anywhere. 
---
U mean a display case?
---
Dude your a moron if you think it has more content than most games I've don't every quest twice without trying bugs should be expected  Especially at that level and I have more bugs now and game breaking ones since launch 
---
You barely even notice the negative effects with class freak, well worth investing some points into that perk if you plan on getting a lot of mutations.
---
That's not what I said at all. But ok.
---
Yeah I’m in the boat with you. I have no interest in server hopping. I like to capture workshops as soon as I log in and hold them as long as possible. Most of the time I just get lost in prospecting, building, and crafting. It’s slow that way but it feels more natural. I’ve put in about 80 hours and I’m only level 47. I power leveled between 20-30. I just don’t feel a need to grind nuke zones for that perfect weapon because if you had to kill the queen to get the weapon then clearly you didn’t need that weapon to beat the hardest content. 
---
Gotta get creative until new content is released. 
---
I dunno. Me personally I like the one shot one kill. Guess you never played any Tom Clancy-esque games before?
---
Exactly as skill up said if you haven't had problems good for you but a majority do.
---
Just call them "karma points" for events.  Then for a certain number of  "karma points" Graham will randomly re-roll one effect on legendary items.
---
Oh well, one day they will have to join the rest of us grinders when they figure out the technology to prevent duping.  Did that 10 hours honestly feel fun and rewarding? Lol sorry but you must know what it says on every loading screen by now. Yay. But hey at least you look cool right?
---
Not knocking farm simulator, it's a stable series and has a target audience. We play a game that fully lets us work together to build said castle and smash said castle. Why do you think they have the exact perks to be able to do as such(wrecking ball)? Like I said on another comment, pve gets stale fast, fo76 bots are boring and provide no"fun to fight" moments, players though they are/were fun. Recent tse weapons+dupers have unbalanced things in such a way that the only longterm\* fix would be an entire wipe, but good luck telling that to the community, 500hrs+ in, and I'd have to take a break but I'm in it for the long haul, this games great.
---
This is not the sims, where you only purpose is to build, if you have played other fallouts (Im not a fallout fan, or   
---
other story book games) then you know full well you pillaged, looted and killed plenty, leaving a trail of naked body's.  There are far better games out there to just "build  with friends" minecraft does this magnificently, even the pvp is better honestly, fo76 appeal is aimed at a different demographic though.
---
 As for the player base we can expect them to make fo76 free to play in the future, seeing the prices of the atom shop its certainly possible and sustainable, albeit with some whining from the usual crowd. I payed full price for the tricentennial and I'd be okay with that, anything to keep the flow of players in. The players that are on the way out are the ones that keep *asking repeatedly* for private servers, infinite stash, and single player mode. From the looks of it this is not that kind of fallout you anti-social quicksave-gods.
---
I'm no raider, I'm no whitenight/neckbeard, I build a shack with no windows, I don't bother asking for "immortal mode". If anything i'm just a traveling vendor that never has anything good but will buy your nuke cards.
---
Me too. I don’t even store them in my stash because they’ll eat up so much space. I just reserve 10-15 lbs on my character for my heavies instead of eating 100 lbs of stash
---
I finally got a TSE gun, though I think the 2nd shot is bugged because I watch it and the spread is at least 15meter's apart from eachother lol.
---
As such I'm really looking for a better TSE + last 3 star left arm. Everything else I've been collecting and running down newbie's to off-load gear.
---
2 nights ago I gave a lvl 8 and lvl 9 (they were running together) a two shot broadsider and two shot laser pistol along with a ton of legendary armor. Felt really good walking away while they were spamming hearts/wave. Glad to see another endgame player (I'm in a similar boat to you, though permanent) farming for the joy of helping others!
---
Outfits are important. First thing I saved up for in fallout 76 was the sniper outfit, because it looked way better than anything else, and now I feel like Annie Oakley with my Lever Action.
---
I think you misunderstood me.  I am not saying he can't do any of those things. Of course he can. I can't stop him and don't want to.
---
But none of it changes anything. He can rant all he wants, but it doesn't change the reality of the situation. People  will keep shitting on this game. The only thing that will help it stop bothering so much is getting over it.
---
I am going to do this from now on.
---
I like the game, oh fucking well. I don't make posts about it, but i can like what i damn well please. Bye Felicia.
---
I see your point, but on the flip side you could also be spending the entire 76k hours server hoping and still not see the jet pack either. I think the point OP was trying to make is that the game is a much more enjoyable experience if you play it as intended rather than just consistently server hoping trying to get all the rare stuff as soon as possible. We'll all eventually get all the things, either by the grace of the RNG Gods or through player interaction, so let's just enjoy the ride. 
---
No you can like it but it's hard hard to believe you only get one disconnect a week when you have all these ppl posting about getting 3 an hour.
---
Why just the golf course? Dont you mean any blast zone to farm nuked flora etc?
---
I never said I like or dislike the game, or that I was leaving. Weird. 
---
I had my camp built near here for others to use to their advantage only to find out assholes like you are destroying it. I think you should play the game the way you like to play and not get so bent over how others play. It’s people like you that deter newcomers from playing. 
---
Never seen it, I have about 200 hours of gameplay. 
---
Welcome to Survival Gaming.  I assume from your post that you're new here.
---
It never stops.  Go watch all the hate threads in other survival games.  Not in one single survival game I've ever played.  Constant hate this, fix that, whine, whine, whine.    It never stops.
---
I love the game, and I could give a big fat F who says otherwise.  Like if I'm enjoying a piping hot Pizza Hut pizza and someone on reddit makes a comment that Pizza Hut pizza sucks.  Don't care, nom nom nom nom.
---
If you like Fallout, welcome.  If you hate Fallout, we don't care.
---
Nuka cola recipe?
---
Yes,I have a normal explosive one with crystallizing barrel and it’s pretty darn solid. Highly recommend the barrel mod though. Bought it in HF it was called “cryolator long barrel”
---
Found the Nuka quantum grenade at level 4. My buddy Like you hasn’t found it still
---
If he feels safe there thats fine, no need to rush. He can stay in the forrest and kill boars to lvl60 for all I care.
---
Yeah I lobbed artillery rounds at a missile base set up at the golf club.
---
The guy was not happy.
---
I like Fallout, I can’t say I like Fallout 76. And I’ve been lurking here since before the game was even released. 
---
I thought this was an obvious oversight/bug on day one and would be fixed quickly.  Nope, it's a feature!
---
I like how they hold miniguns up in the air by their head like pistols when they hide behind a tree.
---
Next guns you'll find are gonna be lvl 30. goes up in 5s
---
Neither do I, the point IS to play. 
---
Last night I got booted while picking my nuke zone for first time on final quest after all the chores were completed to launch it. Rebooted. Quest restarted from beginning with no nuke keycard or code.
---
Yep, this is true.
---
Got the mutation and never turned back.  Went on one of my alts that's not mutated and it felt like I was playing as a fat slow dwarf that can't jump over a 2 foot tall bench....lol
---
&gt;I built an oven and then roasted players alive inside of it
---
overly sensitive mod is my bet
---
Where did you manage to find the plain sack hood without hoses or straps? I've never seen it on a raider bot vendor or in a raider camp.
---
I really like this idea.
---
Omg fuck these mods bunch of babies
---
 if you had to kill the queen to get the weapon then clearly you didn’t need that weapon to beat the hardest content. 
---
EXACTLY. 
---
Someone else said that one of the events at the penitentiary has a chance to give you the handmade plans as a reward 
---
There's a super-rare venodr who spawns in that location and is the only source for well over a dozen items.  
---
But he cannot spawn if there's a base there.  
---
So, anyone putting a base there deprives everyone on teh server of a chance to get the rare gear.
---
r/fo76showerthoughts
---
No it’s also in FO4. I have reade in a few places the recipe is in fo76 as well. 
---
Oh nice nevermind he just randomly died..
---
Yeah your moronic dumbass no one goes into a rockstar game and thinks they can run across the map during a quest. lazy well most games are like that or you have them yelling at you to come on constantly and I'm talking about the stranger missions you can do those however you want outright kill them run around whatever so you seem moronic.
---
Love it! I gave a couple of level 10s some 3 star weight reduction low level gear and a rank 3 underarmor each. The heart spams makes my day. The only ammo I've been crafting of late is 5.56mm and shotgun. Im so keen on finding a strong handmade.
---
Hope your situation is manageable. I essentially have a pinched nerve on my scapula. Any time i shift my arm away from my body its agony. Seeing a surgeon next week. Fallout 76 has kept me sane. Helps me not think of the bad things.
---
Wait, no, this is Whitespring not the Morgantown bridge.  
---
IGNORE ME!
---
I paid $60 (x2). Marginally better than an early Beta doesn’t count for any kudos. 
---
When and if it’s finally in release state and balanced, maybe I’ll consider buying one of their games again. I say that as someone who preorders from 2 studios, and only two, BSG and Firaxis. 
---
That’s the best they can hope for - short of giving everyone who paid full price for the game (and had to wait what will likely be 6mo’s to have a release state game) some kind of massive compensation.
---
This 500 atoms shit is honestly insulting, try 50k.
---
I’d watch it
---
The last thing was probably mothman. The first one might be Flatwoods monster but I'm not really sure.
---
2nd one sorry
---
The main problem comes that turrets don't give the base owner any xp unless the owner engages too. Most of the time the owner is not there and NPCs in that area are just getting killed from people who just want to play the game. There are pros and cons. Pros are that it's a base and if the person isn't a complete douche, there is crafting tables, stash box, and bed, which can help other players. One time someone even had a decontamination shower which gets rid of all the rads for free .
---
I'm personally not opposed to it but I could see the points people make about it being annoying.
---
Never seen it, 400 hours of gameplay.  I'm not sure if it's in the game, haven't seen it in the trading reddits either (and it would show up there).
---
**Has anyone seen the normal Disease Cure (not theAsh Heap, Forest, etc)...........the plan would say "Disease Cure Recipe" and nothing else.  If so, where did they get it?**
---
Just a FYI but I haven't seen Disease Cure in the trading reddit either.....lol
---
my first vampiric weapon was a switchblade, perfect for sharing xp amd staying healthy in a nuke zone.  You can barely see the blade when I wear power armor!
---
Guns and loot is generally tied to level. Level up to unlock higher levels of the same gun, and to start finding new stuff. Some weapons won't even start appearing until you are in the 30s and 40s. If you find that you are facing too high of creatures, slow it down. You are running to linearly through the main quest and getting ahead of yourself. Some further along quests will be nightmares if you are under-leveled too severely. Explore some more. Do some dailies and side quests and whatnot and get a few levels. This game really is designed for people to meander about and take it slow. It's a marathon, not a sprint to the finish.
---
Explosive damage bypasses armor.
---
That 76k hours thing is just a trophy to link the name of the game with some imaginary reward. Dont you get it? This game will literally be around till the end of the world. You have time to find and build "The Jetpack of your Dreams"
---
OMG you suck lol :P
---
25-35 is the toughest growth period. Melee can be a big help, but really just power through.  You'll get there.
---
Lol, imagine being this delusional that you don’t only try to justify harmful business practices and incompetence but you encourage it. 
---
Feels like every rockstar game I play I move fine and shoot fine maybe you just suck at playing games my horse does handle kinda shit sometimes. But what game doesn't.  good guess but I actually played it seems like you didn't see how dumb that sounds.
---
Make sure you're hitting ALL the enemies at least once.  If you're a melee character, bring 20 grenades and throw them into bigger packs so you get a tick of damage on everything.
---
Pick all of the legendaries up, then sort them out later when there's a pause in the spawns.
---
3 Star enemies can drop 1-3 star items.  1 Star enemies can only drop 1 star items.  At least that's what I've seen.
---
I think you misunderstand me.
---
People are free to retaliate as they see fit, within the confines of law.
---
You don't get to decide what "helps" and what does not "help."
---
Go back and watch the video, you clearly don't understand what I'm saying.
---
I'm not justifying it. I'm saying it's a possibility that the atomic store, which was intended to fund active development, is having its prices inflated in a desparate attempt to continue to fund active development.
---
Maybe that makes more sense.
---
We do this but we do put a couple missile launcher and a spotlight by the workbench.
---
Sometimes we get the retake the workshop completed without even going back.
---
I'd say it's a must have along with health regen (unless you're a heavy chem build) and marsupial. If your not using energy weapons, grounded becomes a no brainier as well.
---
Confined indoors. Ruled by authoritative figured. Inevitably divides into cliques. Pretty much. 
---
I get mixed lobbies. Often I'm with French or Spanish people though who don't know English well. There have been times where it's literally just been me and my brother on a server at night. Usually I see between 2-14 others. I'm glad there's never more than that though as the servers always crash when there's more people on.
---
"Ever 100+level player would be using their TSE on every lower level player..."
---
Not every. I would say not even most. New players simply don't have anything we would want. 
---
As I told another wanna-be "I'm not a griefer, I'm a raider!" in another thread... this game deserves a better class if raider than it seems to be getting. 
---
The game launched with $18 blue power armor paint. 76 was a half assed cash grab and always will be. 
---
They need to rebalance PVP pretty severely.
---
Until then, don't take over workshops.  They nerfed the output pretty significantly, so it's not even worth it.
---
Thar she blows!  Hand me your two-shot explosive harpoon gun! 
---
- Paladin Ahab's last words
---
That's moronic.
---
If you’re into a type of weapon and it’s working, no need to change.  Same if the vision you have for your character is shotguns and rifles.  Totally doable and I’d say don’t sacrifice what you love about your build.
---
That said, I did find that combat rifles outperformed shotguns - once they also had a silencer - getting sneak attacks on every enemy in a building outperforms whatever else.  
---
I didn’t find any handmade rifles or more than one or two lever actions so they weren’t an option.  If you got the plans for either they are probably great, I would generally just take the highest damage one.
---
That said, how are you using this gun?  Is it the backup to your 308 hunting rifle to save ammo against easy enemies?  The tactical gun you pull out when spotted and under pressure? Or replacing hunting rifle as your primary?
---
Jesus, what did you have to get rid of to carry so many?
---
You realize you can get it for free too, right?
---
Yeah, they've fixed quite a few things.  Me and my buddy had 2 major problems (forget what) and one of the patches killed BOTH problems....lol
---
Or do you realize you don't have to buy from the Atomic shop because it's all cosmetics that don't affect gameplay?
---
Naive is def the better descriptor if process, but the end result of that process is what most people consider “bad” gameplay.
---
Things like this really bother me, because as soon as the community say it most people recognized the problems of it right off the bar. BSG tester’s didn’t? The devs didn’t? Professionals who design and test games didn’t catch the problems everyone else did?
---
How.
---
Take 5 minutes, equip pharma farma, and run thru flatwoods and vault tec agricultural building. You'll hit 11 chem boxes and net around 30 aid items every time. 
---
Hey did you know cannibals are feed up with people?
---
Server hoping needs to be addressed, on several occasions I've seen and heard of players disconnecting and bragging about avoiding
---
* Pvp incident
---
* Scorchbeast
---
* Workshop taken/contested
---
* Players following them
---
* Mob spawn(the bad kind)
---
* Social interaction
---
Death is a trivial thing in this game, we should not fear it, I know it's something new to some fallout fans with their quicksave immortalities, but after the first time, you get over it. 
---
500hr+ I wan't this game to last as long as possible, and looking at the atom shops prices we can speculate a free to play future. As long as it doesn't go p2w(lunchbox serums) then I'd be fine with that.
---
Yea... none of that even comes close to answering anything I asked.
---
Kek, my brother had a house there for a while but got fed up of it being nuked and moved it quite quickly after. It's a shame as when I visited I was thinking how lovely the spot is for a house
---
Yup, same. Will I check a bunch of stuff when I log in? Sure. Server hopping just never seems like it’d be fun.
---
Here the best instructions I've found on how to wire the door. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmQZ4pKa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmQZ4pKayrI) 
---
I've read a lot of conflicting reports about which plans to buy. Does anyone know, for a fact, what the actual name of the plans are that contain these powered/keypad doors? I've found Grahm twice but I have no idea what the actual plans are named that i need to buy. This would be extremely helpful!
---
Have you heard of "Bartle's taxonomy of player types?"
---
In short terms, it says that there are different types of gamers with different motivations for playing a game. 
---
Fallout lends itself to every type and that is  why we see so much diversity in gaming styles amongst the community.
---
This is great. Absolutely perfect.

FO76 Market Reddit

FO76 Bazzar Reddit
---
Those two trading reddits.  Someone should have the Stimpack Plan / Recipe.  It'll cost you some caps.  Even if it takes a while.......you can always buy stimpacks.  Probably 5-10 caps each is the most I would pay.
---
If you want to go the mutation route, healing factor helps a crap ton.  After a fight is over, you regen 100% of your health in like 5-10 seconds.  It's so good I dump stimpacks on the ground and give them away to newbies constantly.  I think I probably dumped 20 stimpacks today, maybe 30.  Bonus is it works in nuke zones as well, as long as nothing is attacking you, hit a radaway and your health auto-regens as fast as the radaway goes away.
---
My personal favorite [https://imgur.com/YkOSWsT](https://imgur.com/YkOSWsT)
---
Pop over to whitesprings, and you'll have someone kill you quite fast.
---
“Kills legendary enemy next to a car Team rocket blasting off again” never to be found lmao 
---
Ok. Next time I guess. With her there will definitely be a next time. Lol
---
that's highly subjective. what if I can't enjoy the ride without a jetpack? what if the ride would be a lot more enjoyable with the jetpack? should I still just sit back and be miserable while I don't get it?
---
Hopefully not duping
---
If you want to stab enemies in face all you need is Bird bones mutation (+4agi) and shielded raider underamor (+3agi). With 15agi points and mainly escape artist perk.
---
With this you will be able to crouch in front of enemy and do atleast one hit with stealth damage.
---
If you want to make it hard, get Light version of whatever armor with +agi/better stealth legendary effects.  (I like ap regen, becouse with all that agi you can run forever young)
---
I don't understand what part of my post is giving you the impression that says he isn't free do it or  that he can't do it.
---
And I am not deciding what helps. He is. It clearly isn't helping, or else he wouldn't be making this post.
---
He has 2 choices here: Keep letting the fact that people will keep shitting on this game get to his head and bother him, OR, get over it. That is all there is to this. Granted, "getting over" things is generally easier said than done, but then again, a videogame getting memed into oblivion is hardly a serious thing.
---
Also, do note who keeps being insulting and immature here. It isn't me, chief.
---
Yea it definitely seems to be inventory/stash/shopping screen related
---
I seen the video the day it was up I agreed with a few points but I play rockstar games for the rockstar feel like I play other games for what they are. I just don't find anything they do singleplayer wise lazy it's just easy for them to do. Idk I expect gta 6 to be the same and bully 2 if it comes out I play for the story and the world like god of war the combat and map navigation kinda bad but I didn't play it for that.
---
As someone who has bought every BSG game and paid $120 for this one I might as well just have burned at this point - I don’t really care why they’re complaining but am happy they are. I want the complaints to be accurate and relevant, which they are often not - because I have nothing to lose from their complaints at this point and only something to gain. 
---
BSG needs to feel like this is donor die time, because it probably is.
---
I don't think this particular idea is outright pay-to-win, but it's walking the fine line because it's not cosmetic and actually effects gameplay. I personally like the current respec system, but if they wanted to add a full respec system I think it should be some kind of long and particularly difficult repeatable quest that has a 24-48 hour cool down. That's just my opinion.
---
The gun’s level is the minimum level to equip it.  Guns also tend to come only in 10 level increments.  So, you won’t be using higher level than 25 gun until you’re level 30, and won’t be using an upgraded version of your current level 25 gun until you’re level 35 and you find or craft it as level 35.
---
On the other hand, the game is not so closely tuned that enemy level implies absolute difficulty (in some MMOs, if you’re level X and fighting level X+5 enemies then the game goes out of its way to make that difficult.  Not so here).  And there may be big jumps in your ability to do damage based on perks chosen and mutations so that the game has a little more of a bell curve.  For example, now that you’re level 28, read about how the Four Leaf Clover perk that just became available has great synergy with doing criticals with Shotguns (you may be able to get back criticals about as fast as you use them, so you critical with almost every shot).
---
On the glowing radiating mutated third hand, you’re ultimately going to be using weapons with legendary effects of some kind that you got by killing a legendary enemy, so all this scrapping and crafting normal weapons is for tiding you over until you get to a high enough level to be finding and looting legendary things, and for learning some of the modification plans to let you craft improvements to such weapons once you’ve looted it.  Broadly speaking, aside from these legendary effects, anything you can find you could also have crafted, so there’s not much to find to gain power other than killing a legendary enemy.  However, some quests have legendary weapon rewards (for example, maybe you got a “Somerset Special” from doing responders quests whose legendary effect was +50% armor penetration, or the “Cold Case” quest gave you a 10mm SMG with additional incindiary damage).
---
Hate nowadays is a way to get attention, and attention nowadays is money. Do not think all this gaming sites, blogs, youtubers do this because they deeply understand the flaws of game design and even saw the worst game could show. It's all about clickbait now, people read news about fallout like crazy, and content creators make money on it by having more views/likes etc. Bethesda helped with that by agressively marketing the game before the launch.
---
The second thing is... well, this is realy, realy fucking bad game from realy, realy damn good developer. This is why it was so disasterous when the game launched. Noone simply expected such a bad game and some people (including me) was shocked by the game state.
---
And the last... Bethesda games are special for a lot of people. You can literaly live in bethesda games, and all of them till now was incredible. Fallout 76 is like a punch to the face from a loved one. And this, obviously, enraged many players.
---
Toxic valley is where I've seen them spawn.
---
Also google this with the "" quotes in there:
---
"Fallout 76" "toxic soot flower" "farm"
---
Happy Cake Day ChinaIsFree! The only dare you ever want to take is the dare to be all that you can be.
---
Even at 1.9k upvotes this is underrated. Come on sub, I've seen ridiculously bad posts with way more upvotes!
---
It is 12:20 am, my friends and I have been having issues trying to find the code. Bless  you for posting this.
---
I can help
---
Yeah thanks for your imput. It shouldnt be about avoiding loosing or gaining unearned loot.Just play the game.
---
This is good advice.  I'm lvl 35 and am at the end of the quest line.  I ran through all the Free States/BOS/Enclave stuff and am WAY underleveled for the 'endgame'.  This includes my gear, as I'm still wearing lvl 25 leather arms and 30 Combat Shotgun.  
---
I wish I had taken my time a bit more and leveled up to get lvl 50 versions of the few quest rewards, might start over and play it right.
---
Yup. Always people farming there(even without a nuke dropped), or people checking for X-01 mods, etc. I don't bother people without a bounty, but i'll spend 50 caps on travel for a 5 cap bounty just to shoot someone in the dome.
---
Pretty sure that the shoddy netcode and code made the game unstable and exploitable. Duppers are a symptom, not the cause.
---
Could have been all the ghouls inside came out and trashed it too. 
---
I remember reading people say that they could come back even after dying. I think by relogging.
---
A bike chain is simple compared to how that thing is designed. In fact, in my opinion, a chain would have been a simpler engineering problem, but at the cost of more required construction materials and no significant maintenance advantage. 
---
The Monorail Elevator has a single central drive shaft, so the middle of the five links likely rotates though 180° while massive internal drive chains rotate the other links up or down, and the link with the train has the rail and train on a bearing as well so people don’t end up upside down. 
---
Yeah, this thing in motion would have been an amazing site.
---
A full chain run in a loop, while a simpler mechanism, would require more material and any mechanical failure in either system takes down the entire system until it’s repaired, and at this scale it would make a lot of sense to go with a more complex mechanism that required less time and material to build. 
---
In my own estimation maintenance would be more or less equal either way. Simple but more parts to maintain vs. fewer but more complex parts to maintain. Either way a failure takes the entire system down. 
---
Seriously the world designer(s) who came up with this thing put some serious thought into it and I am impressed. 
---
There’s Boars ? Whoopie 
---
Nope, he just have only 250-400 HPs, thats oneshot with most weapons from stealth.
---
I sell things on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  I don't visit the vendors much anymore.  I'll only sell trash to vendors when I happen to be standing right next to one.
---
Seriously, go trade on the reddits.  I don't miss the days of when I had to say "crap what can I sell 500 of to this vendor so he'll give me his 200 caps" one bit.  I think I made 5,000 caps today trading things on the trade reddits.  I don't think I visited a vendor once.
---
Doing the same thing over and over, over time I guess is boring
---
What happens when you eat spoiled hot dogs? I've seen them, picked up 1 or 2 but dont know where they even go
---
Where did you find the switch man?
---
That's how it works with almost *every* game these days.  If this is the first game you have ever bought then I could maybe understand being upset, but really you should have known.
---
Possible that in the space to build in that the flamers would destroy each other?
---
Lol ya so far we’ve both had no one bother us since we started playing. They just go along their business and pay us no mind. I have barely played but she has way more time then I do. We share a computer to play otherwise I’d done it myself. 
---
This and marsupial and you'll never go back.  Unless you start a new build... that's the only real downside, the addiction.  I'm leaving SBs in the dust, confusing suuper mutants and flying off cliff faces.  It's great.
---
Yes, we have a daily ritual where we group up in the streets to rally in the favor of bethesda! Bethesda is our lord and savior, and can do no wrong in our eyes! We do nothing but constantly praise the game and mock the inferior sheeple who DARE dislike this magnificent product...get your head out of your ass dude, we're just trying to have fun.
---
They are bugged in all ways, (damage, piercing, broke too fast)
---
I offer a crafting service for these as well as other ultracite mods. Price is 500 caps + materials per piece. (xbox) 
---
They’re wrong in understanding what an engine is, but they’re right in effect. A lot of the more essential, foundational elements of Gamebyro or whatever they are calling it now haven’t been sufficiently upgraded or overhauled as they need to be.
---
There’s no reason the engine needs to be scrapped, but it needs a pretty drastic overhaul of quite a few parts that they just don’t seem interested in doing.
---
You get the plans to make it by playing the game one you complete I am Become Death shielded vault suit opens up. And it is correct that there is no level requirement for any of the under armors that you put shielded on.  It was the one Item I gave to my alt, he got a Shielded BoS fatigue and military cap.  
---
I am off to bed or I would make you one. I will check back tomorrow and see if you still need it if so I will hook you up.

Consider yourself lucky, the Quantum grenade is pure ass, blast radius of like 3 feet.
---
Phoenix, watoga train station, whitesprings resort, enclave. 
---
Then if I need more caps I hit the train station in the south east that’s got a lot of mole miners around it, Flatwoods for the responders, and rarely the free states vendor.
---
How is this not the top comment hahaha. 
---
Is anyone on xbox and have a serum I could buy for 1k caps? It's all I got :/
---
He randomly died, Im still hoping him. Found him a few more times since then add me in game Enzth.
---
I don’t get this particular hate.  I’ve farmed the Golf Club numerous times both Nuked and Regular without any problems.  Even with 6 Missile turrets firing at nice the level 50+ Ghouls last long enough for me to tag them.  The Tse shotty guys are infinitely more annoying.
---
Except for the guys with 100 duped turrets making me crash.
---
Is it really just the incredulity of seeing an auto farm that offends people so much?
---
I've loved the game since day one. I have yet to experience major game breakers. Minus the crashes but I get that more Playing Rockstar games then with fallout. 
---
lol, this is good meme
---
This is interesting! I have not heard this. So it effectively works as setting them to aggressive vs defensive?
---
I've been blown up by cars and explodobots and couldn't find it anywhere.
---
 technically been training with until last night.  Every day is Reclamation Day here in West Virginia!!!
---
I haven't server hopped for anything either. However first thing every login I go to the bunker, and yesterday I got the jetpack. Imagine the happiness! 
---
Sorry i dont check Reddit as much as i should ..  I can probably log in the week of the 15th and give you one - You're PC right?
---
We could have the best of both worlds... why not add Aaron Copland's "Rodeo" to the classical station?  At least "Hoe-Down," which is arguably the best known piece the suite.
---
If you mean something like display case, I believe they're considered shelves, but they are useless (at least for now, yuo can't display things)
---
Turrets work much better with a spot light.  They respond quicker and at a further range.  But if you can build a spotlight just replace them with a missile launcher.  At least they do good damage.
---
That... actually gave me some ideas...
---
Yeah im on pc. My ign is ulfyn. I should be free most of that week luckily
---
I lost my bunker buster fighting the sbq. I’m not sure how. It was favorited and in my inventory then after the fight it was gone. 
---
Pretty sure stagger is the animation enemies do that lock them in their Place, like wedingo doing a backroll.
---
Crippling a limb have a different animation.
---
Funny lol. Ive found 3 
---
Sorry if this sounds snarky, but if you're going to miserable because you don't have a jet pack perhaps you need to reevaluate why you play this game. The jet pack is cool, and I sure want one too, but my game isn't any less enjoyable because I don't have it. That's the beauty of not needing everything right now, you don't have to spend hours getting disappointment after disappointment grinding something that's mostly for show anyway.
---
Your base got destroyed and then you got downvoted for trying to help other players,
---
Bravo Community, Bravo.
---
Only need calibrated shocks for both legs. What materials are needed? I've got the caps for it
---
I was in a queen farming party, it seemed like most of them knew each other, they would have the lowest level player run in to trigger the scorched earth event. I guess they were covering all possibilities that way: a low level player, one person to get her to spawn. I guess after she spawns her health is set, however that is determined.
---
One of the guys had a ridiculous 2h melee build where he waited for everyone to tag her, then he took her from 95% to 15% in one hit. He said he was maxing his damage at 8k lol
---
Zein is correct.  I wish chemist did work though....lol
---
Except you will never know what plans uou have and don't have across two characters. You might remember on one but nobody has such a perfect memery to remember the plans on two different characters.
---
? What bunker? Lol
---
 None of those games have more content rust is just a shell of game, subnautica runs out of things to do after a couple hours, and long dark is just depressing tbh.
---
Found him 4 times in the last 30 min. If i find him ill msg you to join on me.
---
Eh, this is beyond that though. My sniper got blown off a ledge by a TSE pump from a dude in power armor a hundred feet below me. That's a little bit ridiculous. 
---
I read that in the Protectron voice.
---
I can craft T51 jetpacks and can say with certainty that it doesn’t work on ultracite PA. I wish though. 
---
I saw this a few weeks back. Somone had set down a 1x1 foundation with some stairs and then a platform full of turrets and generators. He'd smack a ghoul and all his turrets went mental. So I stood back and just lobbed grenades/unloaded 600 rounds from a minigun into his "base". Yes, I got a bounty, yes the player raged. I just let my girlfriend take the bounty then she'd bail. I'd wash, rinse and repeat this until the player ended up logging off. 
---
..Is there such a thing as "positive griefing"?
---
No he wss standing right in front of me because i thought he was gonna be cool. I didnt even do anyting with the workshop i just wasted 25 caps
---
Damn, I may have to go through my guns&amp;gear alt and toss some stuff on there.
---
If u are farming white springs throw a mol. Cocktail in the clubhouse and the jump onto the bus right outside the door or the ledge to the right coming out of the door by the pool and shoot from there. Ghouls cant reach you. Also helps if there are a couple high lvl players around, u just put a round in as many ferals as u can and let them finish them off for easy xp. When I was lower lvl. I took a submachine gun or auto 10mm and sprayed other people finished em off. Level up 10x in 15 minutes 
---
Thanks yes thats it. What "makes me special" is Luck.  And the Gods have definatly left us, it is the end of the world lol. 
---
Google "fallout 76 landmine locations".  It should come back with results that players are talking about where to loot them and where they are "live" in the world.  Like I think there are some at the entrance to Posideon Energy Parking Lot.  You'd have to disarm them (if that's even a thing).
---
I do know some landmines spawn in the bathrooms across from the Whitesprings Golf Club.  It's where the massive ghoul groups show up at Whitesprings nukes.  Go BEHIND that building, down the hill, across the fairway, and turn left.  The bathrooms are about 100 feet down the fairway, right side.
---
Hope that helps!
---
"But I need it now, I payed $230 I deserve it". Entitled players don't not wan't to enjoy the game for what it is, an adventure.
---
Try playing with friends, or just wave to another player, game will last alot longer with player interaction. Let's say you get the best weapon, then what? You end up doing what you should have always been doing, working with friends, build a fortress, raid another guys camp, get chased by the whitenight/neckbeards, lose some caps and have fun.  See who chickens out/dies in a nuke zone first without power armor/hazmat.
---
If someone murders you, you dont lose any caps so you must have attacked them back or first
---
Ah but he spaced it so they wouldn’t hit theoppposite wall. I did consider maybe the burn doesn’t stack
---
I get mad sometimes, when i spend time launching nuke, to farm hardeness mass, to craft flux for weekly challenge and some dick comes and loot my things, i even nuked fking grafton, why would someone go there and take my shit?
---
On queen if someone is using granades, he only makes game lag (crash). Also being there increase her hps.
---
But yeah i am raider, i sometimes kill / "grief" for no reason, but then i will repair your shit or give you something (junk/stimpacks) as compensation, i am just having fun, dont want you frustrated, like those idiots ruining my nuking plans.
---
I agree to an extent but sometimes you just really want that one plan. Some are literally only available through a specific vendor at like a 2% chance to actually be in the inventory. Who is realistically going to be casually passing by a specific spot for 50 consecutive play sessions in order to 'legitimately' acquire an item they are after.
---
I love this game but some of the strange machanics make server hopping a necessity in certain circumstances, which kinda sucks. 
---
Im not on till tomorrow but off the top of my head: 5 violet flux per piece, 17 aluminum, some steel, screws, rubber, etc. You should easily already have everything other than flux in your stash. 
---
Maybe someone else can chime in with the exact list. 
---
Enjoying the ride is compleatly up to you. Imagine your happiness when you get a Jetpack legit?
---
....1k? That's... nothing. Like, gun raid the Penitentiary for Gunpowder from the muties, and lead and steel from the can traps, equip ammo crafter and super duper and make 1k in 4 crafts...
---
I run around with 3k 5mm for my Gatling and \~2.5k for my 50cal and I consider myself "minimally loaded"...
---
Cool story kiddo
---
I server hopped for an hour one day and just said "fuck it. never doing this again."
---
Aliens movie quote:
---
 **Hudson**: Movement. Signal's clean. Range twenty meters.  
---
**Ripley**: They found a way in, something we missed.  
---
**Hicks**: We didn't miss anything.  
---
**Hudson**: 17 meters.  
---
**Ripley**: Something under the floor, not in the plans.  
---
**Hudson**: 15 meters.  
---
**Newt**: Ripley.  
---
**Hicks**: Definitely inside the barricades.  
---
**Hudson**: 13 meters.  
---
**Ripley**: That's right outside the door! Hicks, Vasquez, get back!  
---
**Hudson**: Man, this is a big \*\*\*\*ing signal!  
---
**Hicks**: How are you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me!  
---
**Vasquez**: *\[welding the door shut\]* Almost there.  
---
**Hicks**: That's it! Keep it up!  
---
**Hudson**: 12 meters. 11, 10...  
---
**Vasquez**: They're right on top of us!  
---
**Hudson**: 9 meters.  
---
**Hicks**: Remember: short, controlled bursts.  
---
**Hudson**: 8 meters. 7, 6...  
---
**Ripley**: They can't be. That's inside the room.  
---
**Hudson**: It's reading right, man! Look!  
---
**Hicks**: Well then you're not reading it right!  
---
**Hudson**: 5 meters, man! What the hell?! *\[Looks up along with the rest as they realize they're in the ceiling\]* ... Oh shit... oh *\*\*\*\**... 
---
Are they not able to break the walls? I’m not sure how this works. 
---
My wife is Chinese and she said your translation is accurate.  She said it sounds like something you would name a weopon.
---
Besides piercing, I do not think Laser or Tesla guns have any problems in my experience. I use them quite a bit.
---
So I found a dead Vault Dweller from Vault 94 in Harpers Ferry accompanied by "Here comes the chief" and a dead army soldier.
---
Man i havent watched Ethoslab in so long, he still does minecraft? 
---
The buttons you push that makes your fake weapon kill fake things is such a different game than when others push the buttons to make a fake weapon that then kills the fake things? 
---
Rest at bonfire
---
I've tried but the critters don't reliability spawn in the same spot and most won't walk thru an open garage door. Every deathclaw I've tamed has been very hostile to other players tho.
---
Watching it from the outside is creepy. If i were trapped on the inside I'd be laughing my ass off and thumbs upping. Then I'd drop a few grenades and get it over with... 
---
Very inventive.
---
Can someone point this out on a map for me?
---
I have that mutation, it's Electrically Charged.
---
Normally it's a white cloud lightning looking blast.  But it bugs out frequently and goes all purple, yellow, psychedelic colors pretty frequently.
---
FYI it doesn't do squat, won't kill anything higher than level 1 rad roaches, but looks cool......lol
---
Not enough hugs or touched in the underwear area...
---
You're gonna mess your buddy's game up being that high in level.  I say just play your game and start a new character to play with your bud when they get time.
---
Is that the one that requires cold nuka cola from a refrigerator?
---
You're a goddamn serial killer.  I love it.  But also hope I never meet you in real life.
---
Ahah serendipity is the one I was forgetting, thank you.
---
and I appreciate your minimalist take on life but you gotta understand that's not how everyone perceives the game. maybe not having a particular item, or just the thought of never dropping it, is enough to ruin the experience for some people.
---
and the jetpack is just a metaphor. I don't really play PA.
---
I have Two shot laser rifle (now on mule becouse it is useles) you need to shot like 6-10 times lvl68 super mutant (1-2 shots with most of other weapon, not even twoshot) and it breaks in 4? magazines. 
---
I used a [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14532/) in Fo4 and would love to have something like this in Fo76
---
I got 76 about a week ago, in the middle of the hate trains boarding session, and i definitely agree with you. Although the game is glitchy and the pr was shit, i still actually like the game and have fun playing it. So keep fighting the good fight.
---
I imagine it'd be about the same as if I hoped for it- except I won't be cursing the game for wasting months of my life.
---
Assualtrons in 76 have ridiculously flimsy legs. Two or three shotgun blasts to the knee and they're crawling.
---
I used a chain wrapped baseball bat I found for awhile early game, I’d like to see a full Negan build
---
one system u play on?
---
Been wanted, or in pvp becouse of workshop
---
Yes, but they're extremely rare. You'll occasionally get T-60 part plans from Distant Thunder, maybe some other events.
---
Gotcha, just let me know when you know I've got a good bit of stuff and I'm working on acquiring the flux now
---
I did that at 45 and went through all my plasma grenades.
---
Can't fast travel when your taking damage.
---
nope. It does not. Works only in vendors :(
---
Red dead 2 had by far the worst multiplayer release of the year. It's still terrible theres nothing to do till they add stuff. It only takes half a day to run through all of the red deads online content. I've been playing fallout since launch and still haven't finished all the quests.
---
You can probably find it on r/fo76bazaar. That's where most people barter. Goodluck
---
Sounds good. Ill be on around 4PM EST tomorrow. Shoot me a message so i don’t forget
---
I use Good Doggy and have 3 purified water taps at my base (the kind that hold 2 water).  If you're doing normal running around looting / questing you'll never ever ever ever ever run out.  If your'e sitting around for extended periods, you will need to scrounge up a bit of food so you don't get too low on dog food.
---
I've had people say "do this or that or this".  One Special Point and I don't need to worry about food or water ever.....lol
---
Ps4
---
Hmmm one day old account, interesting commentary here 
---
So it's the players fault it takes days of server hopping to get a single mod from a vendor?
---
It took me several hundred hops to get 3 from the enclave vendor I would NEVER visit organically, since I would only visit an enclave vendor once a day to get 200 caps.
---
Welcome to the Fallout 76, where endgame is made up and your specs don't matter.
---
Thanks a bunch friend
---
Another thread of PvE players circlejerking about making the game harder for PvPers.
---
Bethesda, please ignore. Maybe point the PvPers in a direction thats rewarding or fullfulling first. Flush out pvp. So the players aren't out bothering the powderpuff fanbase.
---
OP's Idea wont do anything but give pvpers something to farm if they wanted. We uaually wipe eachothers bounty before it gets too high. Totally avoidable and useless. 
---
No need to nerf or deter player interaction further. 
---
Nope, you'll be fine.  It's what I did, and I was just fine for the most part.  Just watch around the border areas, since occasionally a higher level critter will cross regions to come after you.
---
Your mom what?
---
Np, also if you are able to get all unyielding armor pieces you'll be really strong outside of nuke zones. It gives a bunch of strength once activated
---
Biggest regret of my life I wasted money buying a PS4 for that game. Once the game failed I just returned the game and the ps4. I'll never trust playstation exclusives again.
---
Did you ever play Sims? because this just screams Sims evil haha, well done
---
Is there a maximum amount of ammo you can carry?
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/vVkoPPU
---
Don't claim workshops.   Since the nerf they're not even worth it anymore....lol
---
If you are using it as a fast travel point, stop.  You can get more than enough caps to fast travel for days on one run through all the vendor cap pools.
---
thats annoying. On the one side players are supposed to trade with each other. On the other side you cant even see the details of the legendaries. Hopefully it will get fixed.
---
I hate the idea of paying for a full respec. That’s insane. 
---
Even games like Dark Souls allow you to respec a couple of times with an item find in-game. You can only do it a couple of times before that character is locked in for good. That’s the way to go. 
---
Make it a Nuka Drink or something we find. Doesn’t even have to be rare, but we can only do it let’s say, two times max - then we’re locked in. 
---
No one loses anything, he lets them get their stuff back + some free shit.
---
Tried removing roof and nothing under floor but it still wouldn't place. Decontamination shower arc will not place on **wood floor** no other way except on campfire. \*Food planted on campfire inside camp is safer.
---
I got 3 shocks and a stealth boy, no jetpack. I was server hopping for a couple hours for 2 shocks and the stealth both; the 3rd shock was just a random check.
---
Happy to help
---
I know the price goes down eventually, I just expected a working game at launch since they didn't say it was early access. Like when Subnautica was in its early access phase I got it for $10 and it ran much better than FO76. If I had waited until let's say today, then I would see FO76 is running way better now and there have been some patches even though there's still so many disconnects and bugs.
---
What's weird is that if there were other SM there, they would have picked up the gat and it would have been on each of their corpses (along with 100 5mm rounds), guaranteed. The item loot bug is weird. 
---
F
---
Nuke Cola Grape gets rid of 400 rads and ain't no drug. Just a nice refreshing beverage.
---
Nice
---
Well I’ve found some material for another subreddit
---
I camp behind Sutton Station(Raider), usually fast travel to Morgantown or Charleston(Responder), might walk the first time to loot McClintock.  Fast travel to Whitespring, walk to the bunker, ft to Harpers if needed.  Haven't touched Watoga.   
---
Caps seem pretty useless in the game once you have 5k or so.  I fast travel all over the place and still end up way ahead at the end of the day.   
---
I was wanted earlier and was waiting for someone to kill me so I could see stuff on the map again. I was waiting at vault 76. Someone with a tse double barrel shot me and it did slap damage. They shot me again and I died. 
---
I think first shot on someone if they are wanted is slap, as like a warning. 
---
Hope they'll add some fancy wallpapers so we can  cover the dirty walls with some delightful colors !
---
It's not that you're in PVP mode 24/7. It's that if a player contests your workshop, you and that player are now in PVP mode... anywhere on the map. So... yeah.
---
Major oversight on Beth's part as far as I'm concerned, but maybe not the bug you think it is.
---
5. A bar with a girl in a bikini as a bartender. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist 😅)
---
I could be wrong but I think power armor cancels out  any perks or benefits from clothing worn under it. I thought I was getting an incorrect carry weight  from my excavator armor. Turns out it was cancelling out my deepest pocket mods.
---
No I dont, I think all offensive stats in PvP is too high.  All fights should be like a boss fight unless lvls differ wildly.
---
Top of the World is pretty cool.  Camped up there for a while.
---
Tons of enemies, like 5-7 plan spawns in that one seller stall area.  Lots of different loot.  2 vendors.
---
Same. Every single time !
---
None that I'm aware of. It's just how much weight you can handle (and there's perks to reduce ammo weights; Bandolier for ballistics, Ordinance Express for explosives, Batteries Included for energy weapon ammo)
---
Oh for sure.  I dont hop unless I get d/c or have to physically leave my apt and I know I wont be back for a bit.  What I really want is to logon to the same server every time.  If I want to go to a different server Ill be required to start a new toon there, ala ARK or Conan type servers.   They then need to double, at least, possibly triple budget size for builds.  No clue what kind of server needed to do this though.  Comparing to ARK, we have generally 1/4 the max player count as their servers but the object count in the world (i assume) 10x more in FO 76.  
---
In the end my best case scenario would be the ability to rent my own private 25 man server, add any available mods, then also have the ability to customize all the server settings ala xp rate, food/water consumption rate, perks per level, max level, etc.   Not sure if thats ever going to happen though.  We shall see.
---
Good attitude that way they'll keep repeating this. Brilliant mate.
---
Also getting 1 punched by mutants etc, all pvp dmg lowered pls
---
Max level scorched / super mutants do hardcore damage to hazmat. At queen fight it is ok, becouse you got people to tank around, but if you go for flux farm, no way man.
---
Then again I refer to my "reevaluate why you play this game" comment. If someone just wants to collect all the stuff, that's cool. I get that. However you'll miss the entire game doing that, and won't get much more than bragging rights for the effort.
---
What's the negative to healing factor?
---
What console are you on?
---
I just wanna see some copbots. I enjoy the pvp aspect and I hope to see mutual duals free of bounty systems. You don't need to lambaste me from your alternate account just because I want to liven up the world. 
---
Had my base leveled twice today for the first time since beta. Random 80something I had never seen before. Earned a handful of caps from the high bounty, but my steel inventory took a big hit, and I couldn't fix my crops easily.
---
Later on at Grafton Steel two 70somethings with two-shot explosive shotties came in shooting. Par for the course I guess. They got wanted right away, so I took them both out the first time. Then they pinged a claim on the workshop so they could both hit me for full damage. We fought three or four times with deaths on both sides, after that I didn't want to risk any more caps.
---
 Thing is, this is that was the most excitement I've had in game for days, and I don't mind the fighting. The two things that irk me are being double-teamed and oneshot with presumably duped weapons, and the fact that they didn't utilize the workshop at all after they claimed it. Didn't even bother repairing the resource extractors.
---
B.I.G.G.E.R budget 😩
---
Mainly luck, it took me 3 hours to farm all the mutations except those I didn't wanted (the 3 that remove strenght, melee build obliged). You just remove then randomly and pray that it will only be those you don't want. You can also use serums but it was too expensive for me.
---
It’s fun. I’ve done it too.
---
The game literally warns you that by claiming the workshop you can be attacked by other players. It flags players in the area for pvp - there’s no slap damage, it’s real damage.
---
PVP mechanics still need a major overhaul for sure, but fighting over workshops is the funnest PVP experience I’ve had so far.
---
Try it. Embrace your inner raider.
---
Dude nobody ain't gonna give you free shit so get your head out your ass and get it yourself
---
My house is like 50 metres away :/
---
First time i killed the queen, we killed the queen slightly before the timer ended but fail scorched earth somehow
---
I have 15 mutations so far all from drinking toxic goo and using the decontamination arches to get rid of the rads.  Loving mutations! 
---
So far 4/4 times I've done uranium fever it has given me a handmade. I'm level 70.
---
As long as they put in a cool down on switching. People throwing on passive only to get into position then turn it off are terrible.
---
I'm lvl 35 and discovered the event 'Leader of the Pack' around 25.  3 legendary wolves that drop level 5-10 gear.  Some of it helped me at first, but lately I've been finding people to give it to or leaving it in a bag at a train station.  The vendors give you jack shit, someone should be able to use the stuff.
---
Yeah i have 15agi +4 birdbones +3 raider underamor and when i dont have AP regen armor pieces, it regen slow (cant play new character becouse he walks like 3x slower lol)
---
If he was in sentinel gear that's completely normal if you don't have a TSE weapon
---
I guess I've played so many zombie games and watched so many zombie movies that they don't scare me. Same with my girlfriend.
---
Wow, I knew with the whole duel nature sniper based PvP was already at a disadvantage but having to give a warning even to wanted targets seems even more shitty.
---
https://youtu.be/tg2PD-dwsIw
---
Still have the phantom weight bug. Literally unplayable for me... 
---
all of these “dupe fix suggestions” have been exactly the same everytime and the sub is full of them, maybe try looking around and see if someone else’s posted the same thing before doing so yourself
---
I've also hit people with one shot and they died. Like I said, there might be some hidden trigger for that warning shot. 
---
Whitesprings nuke zones.  Stay at the Golf Club.
---
Tag everything once.
---
Get massive XP.
---
Have your friend re-join the server.  All the mobs there respawn.
---
Farm endlessly, get lots of XP and legendary crap (.....and maybe 1 good legendary if you're lucky....lol)
---
Bethesda has made x01 mods almost at a legendary level spawn rate among vendors and it's absurd, especially when the game is full of bugs and always disconnects.
---
Debateable. Mothership Zeta implies that the Zetans actually started the war by using the ship's gun to trick China into thinking they had been nuked. We will likely never be sure one way or another. 
---
I'll do it. Add me at xXtrollingbeggarsXx
---
Figures it was said already and i do look. Just not at every last post i lurk here and there.
---
Cause they all died dumbass
---
I like to murder the poseidon noobs. Free caps if their level is high enough. Level 5s arent worth. That one is buying a pleasure kill.
---
If you found a way in I'd like to know.
---
Chem effects -55%, i believe it actually treats stimpaks as chems
---
I don't see why. like I said this is wholly subjective, there are all sorts of reasons to play the game- to explore, to quest, to fly around Appalachia in a jetpack.
---
to the latter, they'll be missing on the entire game *unless* they get a jetpack.
---
That... seems stupidly broken.
---
I have max of all so time to load up on some ammo!!! Thanks.
---
&gt; "I'm irritated because every piece of media I subscribe to/read/listen to has people screaming about it and none of it is original."
---
Not as irritated as I am that AAA companies are putting out garbage like this. I'll be honest and say that I don't want you to have fun. I want you to hate FO76 so much that you stop playing it. I'm probably as upset that you bought it as you are that I shit on it.  Because I know Bethesda can do better, and I want them to, and I want to buy their games again. But I won't if this is what they think fans deserve or will accept. You actively work against that when you buy the game. And then again when you try to silence the haters. 
---
Your influence on your boy's reminds me of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIdxVR_7ikg)
---
no luck... wandered around it for a couple hours before giving up.
---
To bad, maybe there are plans for it in future updates.
---
You can easily farm t-45 t-51 and t-60 armor parts in Watoga. First go to Watoga, go to the roof of the ermergency services, you'll find a first PA, then on the building in front of it where there is a crashed vertibird you'll find a second PA. Finally on the ground you can see from your previous position there is another crashed vertibird with a PA behind. Just jump servor if you don't find the one you need. (I'm doing this for farming fusion core).  
---
This is some straight up Biblical shit
---
Are you sure the Vault Tec Shielded plans aren’t instead from just finding all of the Overseer’s Caches?
---
(I got it while finding the caches after having previously become a General, so I suppose Enclave could also be necessary, but I’ve never launched a Nuke)
---
Ah okay didn't know about this but I will check it out asap. Thanks a bunch
---
I have gotten a few duplicate stimpak plans from cranberry bog events
---
Im sorry you feel that way. Ive felt the same in moments where Im finally lvl 50 and Im supposed to be all powerfull but I still have my shitty lvl 20 sniper and its one of my best guns. I then did some more quests and the rewards were worth the wait. By the way, the level of the weapons you get for compleating a quest depends on the level you are at so another reason for waiting. Like the Daisycutter. Mines lvl 50. My companion got one at lvl 20 and is now kinda stuck with it.
---
LOL,  truely awesome! 
---
If the people actually notice the good things in the bag, I am sure they wont mind the few donations. 
---
He has many choices.  That you can only delineate two possibilities from them simply shows that you're attempting to force them to fit into your narrow view of things, you fucking bully.
---
i like you delusion but this hate train started because of bethesda approach to the game and community played the game for 60 hours and its just bugged Fallout 4 without Npc , interesting quests , settlement making and lot of others things..... this game is best example of time eater you doing something for nothing because when you log off all you changes you make on server disappear . almost forgot to mention this leveling and perk system where 20% of cards didn't work or do something else. spawning of enemies in the air, behind you or just spawn underground...
---
at the end this is no class buggy experiment with few devs working on it .....  so stop defending this money grab because whenever i see somebody defending this game i want him to burn on stake.... because by accepting this crap you allow them to make future crap in same mannor
---
You are a hero, and I need this at my base. 😂 Literally just saw Escape Room tonight too lol.
---
The whole server gets hung up, and there's a good chance you'll make it through the 2 minutes of freezing every 5 seconds, sure.
---
If you're in the midst of anything taxing though, you may just disconnect outright. I only make it through the duping if I'm doing something low-key.
---
"Are we ... the bad guys?"
---
Meh fuck picking the lock, just teleport out. There are no enemies nearby and while you can't fast travel while taking damage during the flame jets, you can during their pause. So long as you don't go in with less than like 20% hp you'll be able to leave just fine.
---
Yes, same here. Sorry everyone. Im logging on rn to move my camp.
---
It's happened to me a few times. If you got decent loot from killing Scorchbeasts, I'd actually be excited about it. Pretty easy to take out with rocket launchers turrets.
---
The best waves are super mutants and anglers. All the rest are just a waste. 
---
Probabilities:
---
Bug: 99%
---
Not bug: 1%
---
I agree, it is bad sport. However, the game does allow cheating and people are impatient. The only issue is that it makes the PvP aspect unfair on us lot who don't hop, or dupe or whatever; because we obviously have less supplies and usually less effective weapons.
---
This gave me a giggle, nicely done :)
---
Yep. There are some extremely broken Legendaries in this game. Sentinel gives 15% damage reduction per piece. I do really like this game, but don't expect anything to be balanced.
---
Mobs in this world don't exist until you walk in to spawn them and they will always spawn to your level. If a highter level player walks in your zone hd will respawn mobs that are dead in his level. If you twi sit there long enough the next batch of mobs will always be the highest player's level.
---
That math checks out. Excellent work!
---
Callin it like i see it. 
---
Let them make a game we can play before they waste time on stuff like this. I just want to PvP. Wheres the PvP? Just finding players to PvP is a time consuming reasource sink.
---
Cute. Just sucks it's 4 panels a week, but that shit can be time consuming to make.  You might consider turning it into a book. Plenty of fallout geeks would probably buy it
---
Go to FO76 Market Reddit and FO76 Bazzar reddit.  Spend those caps.  Get some cool stuff :)
---
Yes, a lot of them on PC.
---
I only regret, that I have but one upvote to give for your craft, sir.
---
Okay now we’re talking sadistic levels of fun I think you may be into this a little too much bro lol but hey that would be a good laugh to share if you guys became friends and did that 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Most of the time you can see 2 of the 3 stars.
---
A Bloody / Swing Speed / 90% weight reduction super sledge will have:
---
Bloody in the weapon name
---
Swing Speed in the middle above the item stats
---
No way to tell what that 3rd perk is
---
Oh you have a full keyboard? Here let's use these 4 keys for everything.
---
Sadly the reality is I really think the majority of people see this game as a one player experience with pvp as an afterthought 
---
subnautica? ive seen little on this game, but ill look into it more. 
---
i really enjoyed Fo3 and Fo4 (mind the bugs). played a little FoNV, but at the time it crashed way to much for me to really get into it (please stop using that engine). also i think there were other games i played at the time (Halo Reach, Medal of Honor, BF3 a year later)
---
I would like to see a mix of Ark, Fo76, and Destiny, and maybe Black Desert Online. 
---
Static servers that i can continue to login into repeatedly, form actual bases with people (not just camps or workshops), and progression (Ark). The environment, lore, looting, role play (Fallout), and single player/co-op campaign that is heavy on the story, safe zones to meet up with people (Destiny). I through Black Desert Online in there mainly for number of players on server. 
---
That "Dual Universe" game looks promising. I already have one of the cheapest ship in Star Citizen. 
---
Im thinking the back end technology in the last two will help form a game that is one that i dream of.
---
Wouldn't a Fallout game on the latest Frostbite engine (Battlefield 5) look and feel amazing?
---
I definitely consider skeet shooter worth it. It compacts the spread so heavily you might as well be using a slug.
---
With 3 star Class Freak perk (75% reduction) enabled I think it's -12% or -13% chem effects.  Not even an issue.
---
On a side note, that might be why I'm having issues with stimpacks.  Regular ones don't heal for crap (like 20% health total) but diluted ones heal a TON (like 80% health).
---
A lot of people don't like it. If it hasn't grabbed you yet, it probably won't.
---
This is the best and funniest thing I've ever seen on this sub. Thank you.
---
Now I am hungry for some ham.
---
No worries.  The game eventually server hops for you.  Endgame comes in the form of having to repeat what you did before it crashed. 
---
Yeah, I'm assuming the duping has gotten worse on Xbox One. I can't go half an hour without a disconnect. Sometimes it's multiple in like twenty minutes. 
---
Haha! My wife says Fallout is my "Violent wasteland version of Sims" :D
---
Do you have enough space to build a cell? Was thinking you could get a tamed animal in a cell nearby so that players can't fast travel (due to an enemy being nearby).
---
Don't pick up every piece of junk you can find. Find two weapon types you like and only use those . That's the best way to manage your weight and to keep you from having to go back and forth. 
---
That's why I always trade. Never drop.
---
It depends on your build.  Rifle, shotgun, 2 handed melee, 1 handed melee, fist weapons.  All can be OP with the right build.
---
FYI I literally one shot people on ACCIDENT with my super sledge.  I have to keep pacifist on just to make sure I don't randomly murder people.....lol
---
Never drop and if you do drop something useless , that’s happened to me couple times either trade or drop something useless n the. Use that bag to transfer stuff 
---
This is funnier than the original post as that was funny lol
---
Curious, where did this idea come from? I've seen him spawn a few times while there's been a camp outside Charleston Station, have a screenshot showing him up while a camp is there too.
---
Sounds like the Never Ending legendary from Fallout 4
---
The way the current game works, it is pretty hard to find away to punish one. If I was Wanted and died, what would punish me? Losing caps, not really punishment. Maybe lose heavy amount gear durability? Would mean I have to now spend some time repairing my gear before I can go back into killing. Then again repairing my gear, not much of a punishment. These days screws and ballistic fiber is just piling in stash and it takes weeks for gear to break in PVE. Give a debuff? Sure, it would be punishing if there was much needed things to do inside the game that I can't afford having a debuff, but you see my character sometimes sits hours in workshops doing nothing but collecting resources, so debuff would mean nothing. 
---
I have seen game where you die you lose all your non equipped gear but when you die with Wanted tag, you lose all your gear. If you took this concept and watered it heavily down to where you lose only 1 piece of your equipped gear, now that would be punishment...But that is pretty extreme and what would be incentive for me to go into PVP at all? It would be same good are removing PVP from the game completely. 
---
The way the current game works, I can't think of a way to punish me, without going into extremes. Either time inside the game has to first become more valuable or somethings should be reworked and balanced in mind with PVP punishment included. If you already are going that far, then you can same good just come up with some boring activity that redeems stash space, that you lose from dying as wanted.
---
Shotguns feel like a sniper almost 😁
---
Hmmm psychopath much?
---
Has there been any progress or acknowledgment of these issues?
---
My progress is stuck on a bunch of challenges as well.
---
I see. Alright mate, have a good one. Try not to hurt yourself.
---
It is cute how you thought it was only going to take weeks to fix it... It is now over a month... I guess you could call that "weeks"... looking at the transfer window it shows a weight of 9 and if I am remembering a core is weighs 10... so the makes me think either they are complete idiots and don't look at their code at ALL or the "broke" this on purpose. Now I am like to give programmers the benefit of the doubt as I am one myself but if I programmed the way you all do I would be fired in a week not to mention embarrassed to even tell anyone I worked on this game... once again great design... Lousy implementation... it amazes me that you all make a living doing this... any other profession and the governments would shut you down for fraud.
---
They could just fast travel out if theyre not over weight though. You can't fast travel while taking damage, but flamers don't have a constant jet, they pulse, giving you plenty of time to open your menu and click the button to your own camp during their down time. You could also just log out.
---
If someone dies to this, it's because they choose to or aren't quite smart enough to realize it poses 0 real threat.
---
Any which way, hilarious house, love this post and wouldn't mind being a victim, so long as it's not right after a nuke zone lol.
---
I’m guessing you’ve checked that it’s not never ending Legendary  (If Neverending is in FO76)
---
Damage sounds right, but two-shot effect seems to double the rate at which any weapon breaks because condition apparently goes down for each hit, and two-shot causes two hits. I just cleared Harper's Ferry of mutants the other day, calibrated laser rifle did not get anywhere close to breaking by the time I was done.
---
Maybe if the durability is lower it is to trade for the low weight of the gun and its ammo, but this downside is easily offset by investing in gunsmith and weapon artisan.
---
Developers called it a PvP game. Tweeted about upcoming PvP changes. 
---
Reality is that it is a PvP game. Lets see what they change. Hopefully its something more productive than what this thread offers. 
---
I do that too.  Some things that help:
---
1. Emotes, especially the "come here" one.  Crouch repeatedly next to the bag.
---
2. Shoot the bag.  Sometimes this scares the noobies, but usually they get it.
---
3. Drop the items in the cash register at the Flatwoods Vendor.  They basically have to look "past" this loot container to see the vendor.
---
4. For the vendors that have windows / ledges.  Jump up on the ledge, drop your bag.  This makes it so they can't even get to the vendor straight on, they have to angle past your bag to activate the vendor.
---
Very much so it is not. Just explosive and anti armor. 
---
Love claiming workshops so jumping server is out for me! ✌
---
I have Bloody Mess perk which does add quite a bit of damage, but... bodies go everywhere.  Which is not such a big deal on close-medium range.  A bit challenging when fighting 4-5 at once to sift through the parts to figure out which part goes to which body. 
---
But its worth it IMO.
---
How do you make your own signs? Can't seem to get them
---
How many fast traveled or logged out?
---
But scrapping a helmet doesn't teach you the plans to make it. Only possibly a mod for it. Right?
---
Why? You can fast travel out during the flamers being down since they pulse. Then you can come back and nuke it to the ground at your leisure without hurting yourself. Or simply log out.
---
You guys don’t exactly have a monopoly on being burned alive.

Claimed the same workshop 4 times yesterday 😥
---
Ya you can't use power armor for sneaking but if your sneaking you don't need armor cause you don't get shot. The robots have crap perception excluding the assaultrons, as long as you take then out quick its no problem.
---
Hmmm.
---
I was able to craft using the ones from Grafton.  Not tried with the ones from Palace.
---
If there was something to play and something to aim towards to unlock these items, instead of inane ultra rare RNG shopping, then people would gladly do it over server hopping. Terrible, lazy game design doesn't need defending.
---
I one shot people all the time. I just lost my first battle today, they hit me with a mini nuke when I was fleeing the scene after destroying most of their base. Must have had some major explosive mods. Full power armor and full health lol. 
---
Itemisation in this game is way too unbalanced for PvP to be anything but shit I'm afraid. Melee about to stack strength and low HP bonuses to boost damage waaay into the thousands. TSEs being several times a player's health pool. Imagine only having crafted gear and being like 10% as effective in some cases? Then there's things like sentinel gear...some players able to take 1/4 the damage as others. I fear this will never be a proper PvP game.
---
I like how you're comparing Bethesda and Fallout 76 in 2018/19 to Blizzard and Diablo 2 in 2000.
---
For Diablo 3 Blizzard tried to implement something that they thought people would use since so many people bought items for real money in diablo 2
---
Which is something that you can do in fallout 76 as well btw.
---
People didn't like the RMAH so Blizzard removed it. I personally made enough money on the RMAH to buy Reaper of Souls and a WoW expansion. Though I'm glad they removed the RMAH. I would still like to be able to give my wife and friends items I find while playing solo.
---
Also you literally can not dupe items in WoW. It's impossible. All items are server side.
---
The whole "duping" situation in WoW stems from items that are taken from compromised accounts.
---
As for buying and selling accounts. A friend of mine bought an account and it was perma banned within a couple weeks. So no Blizzard isn't blind to people buying and selling accounts.
---

Well the game was in a far worse state when it first came out.  So the hate was earned.  They have been doing allot of patching and fixing allot of stuff that should have been fixed before the game came out.
---
You’re not a racist for that, you’re just fair-game subhuman trash. 
---
That’s exactly what I’m talking about when it comes to the negative reviews about this game. I don’t care to be downvoted because at the end of the day I’ve become friends with the people who took advantage of my camp. The people who downvoted me are just as sad as  tiny shrimp dick OP. 
---
One of the things I wish they'd change, the AP consumption from sprinting. While yes, sprinting was only added in Fo4 and was a mod in titles before, it's something that makes you feel agile and not sluggish. But when you run out of AP after 7 seconds of sprinting(without allocating points to END and Sprinter or whatever card, or unyielding), that's still sluggish. Wouldn't have as much of an issue with being sluggish if the ghouls hadn't become divebombing Lamborghinis since Fo4 xD.
---
AP regen+Speed Demon are the only two sure ways to be super agile constantly.
---
In the words of Keanu Reaves: Whoooaaaaa!!
---
my proposed solution is pvp-specific areas that disable legendary prefixes. the workshops are perfect for this as they kind of act as an arena as it is.
---
and there's armor just as op as the weapons. you're just not building your defensive build properly.
---
&gt;Stop moving around in there, you're letting out all of the juices
---
Even when you get the jetpack, you now need to farm up the materials to install it.  And after that you put in on, climb into your power armor, and realize you can only fly for about 5 seconds.  It's not a fast moving 5 seconds either.  Most times you're better off with marsupial and strange in numbers with a full team.  It may not be as high by only a short amount, but its certainly faster.
---
I depends on the context behind you being one-shot.
---
If it was a result of an insanely over-leveled player then there isn't really anything Bethesda could do about it.
---
But if it's a result of duping (easy access to extremely powerful weapons, massive buffs from stacking thousands of bottleheads and magazines) then HOPEFULLY when/if Bethesda fixes duping it would hopefully end up being a small percentage of the playerbase that are capable of this *assuming the playerbase grows and/or the exploiters leave the game*
---
yeah nvm totally right keeping duping and annoying people who are playing like regular humans.
---
New Gad or whatever that mess of a building is in the middle of the dry lake.  Once you're done there, there's another town to the north that's usually super mutants?
---
Your best bet is to carry multiple guns, and switch guns based on the enemies.  Super mutants use .308, scorched use .45, low level stuff use .38.  Spread your ammo consumption out to different rounds, and you'll find it a lot easier to manage.  If you .308 everything, expect to be out of .308 constantly until you're much higher level and can farm more effectively.

Good old cb

I have been looking for a game to draw me in tried fallout 76 used and loathed it at first because I got gang banged by feral ghouls on the way to the first CAMP and promptly returned it. Decided to give it another chance as a Fallout fan and I'm glad I did. I've adjusted to live vats and solitude of making my way across the wasteland finding something new every single day. Fuck the hateful ones who haven't even played the game yet make 10 to 20 minute videos about how bad it is. 
---
FOH you bandwagon jumpers.
---
I believe all the different responders uniforms can only be obtained by doing different responders quests. The responders cop uniform is from the morgantown airport quest, final departure. The responders medic uniform is for the flatwood quest line completion.
---
I agree. PvP can't work with legendary effects
---
I support your question. Stop playing like a month ago due to bugs and losing caps when getting dcnected doing workshops. 
---
😂 
---
Yah I’ve used CAMPS outside Golf Club to repair and stash stuff so I do appreciate the folk who do it.

R/whoosh
---
PULL THE LEVER KRONK 
---
Thank you for your help, that's cool. I'm glad that Bethesda at least got this right lol. Please thank your wife as well
---
Sweety, no need to be the rebel. I was given it 5 minutes ago. You see, I always get what I want. I got my shotgun, my man elected, etc...
---
I’m on PS4, but I think this is a cool idea! 
---
How do you think you’ll police "no armor" if you allow costumes? I think you’d need to make it underpants only? 
---
Everytime I see these threads I feel validated for being angry at the people who downvoted/argued with me for saying the exact same thing before people understood how whitespring works
---
how about you suck my toe
---
I had eight mothman sleeping bags beside my main bed for others to sleep in for the well rested perk. 
---
Fuck me, right? 
---
read back. the jetpack is just a metaphor for materialism.
---
I thought the same thing, there is a store function just like your camp which is so stupid you can't use it. I had the server crash 4 times yesterday so the store function would have been great as I had to rebuild everything each time.
---
In the words of Joe Rogan: wow man that’s deep.... so, have you ever done DMT ?
---
Durh.  And I'm calling it useless either way you look at it.
---
Play a real game?
---
I've always seen your posts on market subreddit and always appreciated it. My friends are not into trading and deep game mechanics(mutations etc) and I told them about you. Hopefully we will trade someday and they can see the difference mutations can make.
---
You willing to sell that 2 shot LAR?
---
Log out, hard reset your console. If that doesnt work you could try stashing it or risk dropping it into a public container.  Also you could submit a support ticket to Bethesda.
---
There is plenty of meat on the bone. Everything in a game cant be all about end game 👍
---
Imagine being this invested in a video game
---
Based on the blog posts, mid January. Don't have a source by apparently someone said 15th January.
---
Emergency protocols is better than jet pack. Marsupial mutation is better than jet pack. Jet packs are overrated. After 20+ world hops then applying xo1 jetpack i was disappointed.
---
tldr . Jet pack sucks
---
Wow this triggers my PTSD of my time in Germany

His terminal is next to the hospital/medical building back toward the airport. It's in the back of the building with the tinker's workbench in it. You'll see a protectron housing unit near the garage style entrance.
---
Love this! Nice work, I looked for a existing building to place a camp to save on resource but couldn't find one I like. This one is great!
---
On PC I was walking around with that sword for 5 minutes before the quest would update.
---
He's right about those perks
---
I second that notion, I found it wierd to implement the wear and tear system without the old repair system...
---
Could nerf it a bit and make all weapons from the category compatible. As in, repair this 10mm with this revolver. 
---
I find your plainly blatant over-reaction to be wholely and completely understandable. 
---
Next time pop a Psychobuff. And empty the entire magazine. It's not enough to kill them, you must reduce them to hemoglobin goo.
---
That's a lot of crashes. I'd be googling trying to find a workaround if I were you. You can't play like that
---

The only Jerk here is OP. Sorry I’m a cockspanker but...........
---
If time doesn’t sort it out, you could get a revolutionary sword and that would count too
---
But wait.... there are no NPC’s apparently 
---
Yeah that quest was a pain, until a schorchbeaSt showed up, it got the robots attention. And the timer went down and I finished the quest :) I never had to kill a single robot 
---
Yeah. If you notice the vendors are leveled. The higher level vendors sell better stuff. 
---
I think you also unlock the change to get the stuff by your perk cards. I’m level 3 armor and just now found heavy armor legs and chest and arm. 
---
I also buy a lot of the tweaks for different armor when it come up. I think Welch or R&amp;G was where I got mine. 
---
Uh did you sell it to the Enclave vendor? I saw one for sale and bought it. I am fairly certain it is yours.
---
They should define PvP this year. If they dont, they will re-release like ESO did in a year or 2. 
---
Theres not even a PvP progression, mode, reward system. Nothing. Unclaimed workshops and a sandbox pvp system that favors whoever shoots second.  Yay
---
Balance is another discussion. One shot is the name of the game right now. I dont see that changing soon. I think we are just getting pvp servers with no SLAP system or bounties. Thats a start at least. The develops seem committed to having a pvp playerbase. 
---
I just hope you cant switch from pve to pvp servers whenever you want. 
---
This. For more random details to help you find it, I believe there's a sign that says "Bot Shop" out front with the responders logo. Bunch of broken robots inside.
---
You aim first you kill first,it's like instagib gamemode on UT

There was a perk in NV called "Jury Rigging" that allowed you to do the second thing. Super helpful.
---
Yeah, I would love to see this implemented.
---
They could but they would have a bounty
---
Did this today, twice, and got an 1800 cap bounty. No one in the lobby came to claim it from me because they knew what we were all there for and didn’t want some ass clown ruining it to begin with. Had it for like four hours till I had to ask a friend to kill me to clear it.
---
Sorry but couldn’t you just alt f4/close application to avoid this?
---
I totally agree with all points.
---
Lets take a few things into consideration.   
---
No Man's Sky example = 10 Hours total of gameplay in the beginning.  After that, there was nothing to do besides repeatedly doing a few things over and over.   It was a chore to even try to get to the "end".   The "end" was just a cheap 30 second disappointing cinematic as well.  I just could not stand to play anymore after 20 hours, just felt like work.
---
Sure, with Fallout 76, I am level 103 and having difficulty finding stuff to do besides the dailies, checking vendors and killing legendary.   But this is after 200+ hours into the game and I still have more fun in this game than struggling on the 11th hour in NMS.   Maybe I am minority here, but I feel fortunate to have played FO76 because that 200+ hours was quite fun for me.
---
FO76 actually needs daily dungeons to go through for the end game, not just the nukes.  Something where you are rewarded at the end with random legendary and takes about 1 hour to finish.  Something like that.
---
A game in which you're struggling to find fun playing it, it's not worth playing it.
---
I’d like to see triangle foundations that you can make circular building with. 
---
Soon™
---
I can't lie. I spent 1.8k caps on the Hunter's Long Coat because reasons. 
---
7,8 @ 9 wow thanks so much!!!
---
Anything less than 5000 rounds and you are gonna run out. 
---
Run the .50 and a gatling gun alternately.
---
5mm to farm the .50 ammo. Burn the .50 on stuff that needs a good killing.
---
Oh, and for the record I’m not going for just the Gennie. All your shit gets blown to fuck because IDGARA.
---
Great for low level weapon types that drop everywhere and don't weigh much, completely unreasonable for anyone who owns a heavy weapon or other weapons that rarely drop. There are supposed to be plenty of things you come across that aren't worth picking up. Don't know if I agree with it, but the point of this game is meant to be deciding what is necessary to keep and what's not.
---
This game is 1000% better in a group. 
---
in fact this game is just rewrite of skyrim :D even scorchbeasts string is saved as Dragon :D [https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fallout-76-engine-code-seems-to-have-been-directly-copied-from-skyrim-and-fallout-4-1955244](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fallout-76-engine-code-seems-to-have-been-directly-copied-from-skyrim-and-fallout-4-1955244)
---
nullifies defensive builds?
---
the one defensive  build out there practically makes you immune to everyone in pvp.
---
So if I got myself some OP armor that would fix my build?
---
Any luck with it? Don't know whether it's bugged or im just dumb
---
fight fire with fire. if you got the proper armor, you'd be able to take shotgun blasts to the face.
---
sometimes.
---
YES. Fuck these people.
---
HAHA! IS THAT WHAT VICTORY SMELLS LIKE?
---
Ya that would be awesome. I think they should give it  a couple workshops around the map to set it up. Then it gives the option to repair and when its up it starts running
---
you mentioned "defensive" builds. well, just like you can't make an "offensive shotgun" build with an explosive one, you can't make a defensive builds without proper legendary gear.
---
I can help! Add me. Keah_selai.
---
What's your weapon?
---
Goddamn it paid for skyrim again. Except a much lower quality, less quest filled, grindy skyrim

I can't tell any of my gamer friends unless I want to get roasted, but I enjoy playing fo76. Yes, it's basicaly a pile of bad design decisions (like fo4), but I seem to be enjoying walks in virtual landscapes and discovering random junk.
---
Feel free to roast me
---
&gt;EDIT: You guys are an interesting lot. I've made a few replies to comments here, most of them agreeing with you, and I still get downvoted for everything I say. I wonder what will happen if I post "Bethesda sux" randomly in the comments section?
---
&gt;EDIT2: "Useless Bethesda Shill", "Todd Howard's Little Bitch", "Whiny child", "Cry more", "The game sucks, get over it." If you guys get this mad over a Reddit post, I'm hoping that doesn't extend to doxxing the devs.
---
&gt;EDIT3: Since apparently there's a select handful of you who missed basic reading comprehension, I DON'T SUPPORT HOW BETHESDA RELEASED THE GAME, THEIR CURRENT PR, OR THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES WITH 76. I don't see how "stop screeching in my ear about how much this game sucks with no substance behind it" equates to "I deepthroat Todd Howard on the weekends."
---
&gt;EDIT4: Alright, now we're using this post as an excuse to throw petty abuse at anyone who does like the game. Hope you guys are proud of the fact that you're actually degenerates.
---
You seriously need to relax. If **a videogame's press** is "exhausting" and causing you this much distress, it might be time to take a step back and examine your priorities.
---
I say this as someone who legitimately likes FO76 for all of its flaws and bugs. I'm one of the lucky few who has had a largely bug free experience and I like shooting shit in a Fallout game, so I have little to no ill will (aside from the business practices involved) against the game.
---
Seriously.
---
Calm down.
---
What do you do with the technical data to turn it into paints?

If you are using missiles, it causes lag and that's enough reason to destroy them

Went into west tek with 5000 .50 cal.  Walked out of west tek with 3000 a lot of people died.  Oh and I'm out of grenades and mines.  
---
To be fair, Rust was totally horrioble in the beginning and took a long time becoming what it is now. Given that amount of time, fo76 has a fair chance of becoming .... 'ok'
---
Thanks mate, watoga station had them for me
---
It’s not showing up when I go to add. My psn is same as my reddit if you wanna add me. 
---
Does it?  Cuz I’ve been in plenty of missile storms and automatic weapons seem far worse
---
if you can get it from Amazon, I would in case you have issues and need to get a refund, definitely don't get it from [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) they refusing to give refunds.
---
Get the cheapest version of this game you can get. 
---
If you like it, you may want to spend 10 more bucks at the atom shop later. 
---
If unacceptable, then don't play.  Simple.
---
300 caps is nothing really.   Requires you to visit just 2 vendors to earn 400, that's 5 minutes.   Sure you can only do this once per day, but there are 5-6 vendors you can do this at and earn over 1000+ caps per day, with very little time.  With the over abundance of junk everywhere, its very easy to bulk junk and sell.  
---
Not even sure how you "lost" 300 caps when joining event anyway?  The only way this is possible is if you died and could not retrieve junk, but that can be offset with stashing it prior to coming.  So junk is not counted.  Thus the only other thing you could possible count as a loss would but the travel fee.   No where in the entire game is there a 300 travel expense.  The most I have seen ever is 50 caps, but you never have to pay that much ever if you use Vault 76 as a free jump and your camp as another free jump.   Sure if you actually put your CAMP next to vault 76, you may incur the most possible cost for travel.
---
*Liberty Prime liked this*
---
Its feature welcome to fo76
---
Done!
---
Bloodied Police Baton. Does more damage the less health you have, plus 40% more damage with power swings. All my points are in strength, one handed perk cards and armor piercing. Anyone not wearing PA gets one shotted by a power hit when I’m 50% health. PA takes 2 power hits and a quick swing. If I’m frenzied and panicking I’ll just swing around a bunch really quickly and it’ll usually kill them in like 3-4 hits and since I swing so fast I’m like a wild blender lol
---
May I ask which shotgun you were given maybe I can say the same thing and luck out too
---
For brevity I'll just say the context is at least 50% of all PVP engagements I've had from level 20 on, now over 100. Most all level appropriate plus or minus 10-15. I'm an elder scrolls and Fallout veteran; it's not like I'm running into battles unequipped and underleveled.
---
In both this and ESO, ive been wanting the ability to set up trophies, displays, and mannequins for outfits and such, a la Skyrim and FO4. Especially given how much of FO76 is derived from the FO4 engine, I'd hoped that in addition to the armor paints, we'd be able to show stuff off in our C.A.M.P.s... :(

To warn the OP of the anti - consumer, cash grabbing practices of this horrible mess of a game. I am voicing my opinion and he will make up his own mind.

Go to Bethesda.net and choose digital while you’re doing your checkout
---
They probably had Fire Resistance. Not sure how much damage your flamers do per tick, but 60 fire res mitigates a lot per tick usually.
---
Yeah since Christmas it's been getting very bad on the PC. Freezing hanging crashing to desktop or crashing my PC. 
---
Then a regular junk repair would make sense since they are rare weapons.
---
I have crashed maybe 3 total times in the 200+ hours I have played it.   I am on PC though and not console.
---
Now disconnects from the server have been often, but that's not the same as "Crashes".  Crashes are when client fails and falls to desktop.
---
Hey man thanks a lot just got one but major thanks bro!
---
Duped weapons are the bane of the game stability.   They cause, by far, the most trouble for everyone.   Based on the design of the game though, there are very little disconnects and crashes.
---
If they make it so players cannot cause the server to go haywire or to dupe weapons, then 80% of the issues go away.   Consoles and PC will be 100% more stable.
---
No mate. 
---
I just think your base is ugly
---
Your divine roll on it is Instigating, Bloodied, and any of the following.
---
40% swing speed, damage on power atk, less incoming damage on power attack.
---
The next step is modding it at a weapons bench with the Swing Analyzer, if you want to try and force it along.
---
Sometimes the steps do take a few to kick in. And while its only be Miscellenaous, I have had some vanish outright only to re-appear later (specifically opening the miner locker, and the clown costume wendigo)
---
You make an important point; it's not just duped TSE weapons that are doing it. 
---
It just seems really crazy for me to be able to go toe-to-toe with the Scorch Beast Queen, but any 50+ and my, build, armor, chems are meaningless (I'm 100+). 
---
Why was this removed? I want to see what it was. 
---
Go on
---
I have a feeling r/falloutraiders would be right up your alley
---
my friend or i will trade check ppl before they enter the ring. at this point in the games' life cycle most ppl still around are there to have fun, so i doubt there will be too many ruffians. abide by our rules and have fun, try and be the fun police, and we have enough kit to PK someone before they can blink lol
---
Todd has been good at getting me to buy copies of Skyrim so why not lol.
---
Melee* 
---
You could build radios at your camp in the beta, still don't why they removed it.
---
Oh god, you get padded down by security on your way in??? Awesome! I hope this attracts interest.
---
I love skeet shooter. That plus enforcer means I can get a scorchbeast on the ground in about 3 shots. 
---
I'm running with maxed luck, better criticals and critical savvy too so shotguns are ridiculously powerful. 
---
There is a huge difference. 
---
NMS showed content in trailers that actually was never in the game.   Devs lied to the public about what the basic features were, on several occasions.  It took a full 2 years \*after\* release for NMS to actually get 80% of those features finally into the game.
---
NMS was the only game I ever played that I just could not stand to play anymore after 70 hours.  I was really wanting to "finish" it but felt more like work that anything.   I was struggling to force myself to play after 30 hours into it.
---
I have 200+ hours into FO76 and still have a blast, though I log on now and am struggling to find something to do because finished all quests and explored 97% of every location on map.   I am just hitting the dailies and the final unexplored now.
---
Big difference between the two struggles I listed above.
---
No the problem is Rust is fantastic. If it's your cup of tea anticipate giving it hundreds if not thousands of hours of your time. Many groups require players to have 300+ hours before even considering playing with them. It holds a special place in my heart but I had to quit because of that reason. I've gave that game 74 days of my life (1793 hours). 
---
Hah I can’t PvE scorched beasts for anything. They fly, I use a melee weapon. My whole build is based on that. Anything on the ground? 2,3 hits easy. I’m lvl 42 and just today took down a lvl 121,137,60,105, and a few lower levels. I’m not gonna lie I got bored of PvE so I role played a Mafia boss extorting players for 20 caps. Not much, but when you make the bold move to refuse, you lose. *everything*
---
The funny thing is the only reason I claimed that particular workshop was to put a shit ton of water purifiers down to use as currency to sell to vendors over a few days, looks like now I am forced to use my camp for that.
---
The problem is it is sad when workshops have become this broken and useless, they were supposed to be a fun part of the game. Nice work BGS..
---
I'm on it!
---
i had an instigating grognak axe, with the slugger perks and other melee weapon perks, she one hit most things with a strong attack. 
---
yeah, I keep pacifist on (use a Tesla rifle, so its basically required lol).
---
Most wanted guys are red hostiles to me and can be freely shot. Qutie few are still labelled as unaffected targets though. You can definitely get back to neutral status while still having a bounty up.
---
Server hop, I did that and it worked fine. 
---
That's totes Al Gore.
---
Once they fix the duping, those guys wont play anymore since they would have to play it right.  They would fall out of circulation in a few months.  I don’t see a relaunch happening, the fallout would be crazy, no pun intended.  This farming certain areas I would say is the same in many games.  I remember farming Mephisto in Diablo 2.  Farming The Warrior in Borderlands for different versions of the conference call.   After 50 you’re pretty much just fine tuning your build anyway.
---
What is this pylon you speak of though for mutations?  Where is it?  Is it named or just a random pylon?
---
I want to see the video?   :) 
---
Level 120 SaltySpitoon909 invite whenever 
---
If someone wants to sit in one area and farm for hours just to level up, enjoy. 
---
This doesn't effect any other player, that player just levels up quicker than someone playing the game normally.
---
The levelling in the base game experience is fine, there is no need to change it. 
---
Plus farming is a common thing in nearly all MMO's
---
Why combat it if it keeps player engaged and playing your game. 
---
Duping is an exploitable bug so that will get fixed 
---
And a relaunch just isn't going to happen ever. 
---
Bad for press, bad for players, and bad for money.
---
For melee builds being able to one shot makes sense. But being able to one shot with TSE-s is totally broken and one of the biggest reasons why bethesda needs to wipe all players of duped items
---
You're claiming to have spent 3.6 Years on FONV? or 1333.3 days on it? Then on FO3? So you spent 7.2 years on those two titles alone. You have to lie to make the story work? But yet 3 and FONV make perfect sense? I'm trying to find where the truth ends and the bullshit starts. 
---
You need 5 assassin's sentinels pieces. It's not remotely viable
---
Witcher 3 had dlc...For money.... \*SHOCKED GASP\* Get out of here dude. lmao
---
Added! Will join shortly. Only thing is to keep ib mind I am a rifle/sneak build, so let me get first hit on enemies for stealth bonuses!
---
Considering the replies so far, it seems that Bethesda hasn't taken good measures yet to stop the dupers and the load they make?
---
I uninstalled FO76 half december due to the persistent issues of DCs, won't reinstall it yet I guess till they fix the exploiting...
---
Hopefully they fix all the exploits before they release the new DLC, otherwise that one will massively tank.
---
After they released  a game that did not even match a trailer they put out showing game content.   After they lied about features, ect.  Took 2 years after release of the game for it it even be close to what they "said" would be in the game upon release.  
---
Bethesda is not even close to doing something like that.    Everything Bethesda said would be in the game, \*is\* in the game.  People may not like how its implemented, but its there.
---
This game is not even close to comparison of NMS.   Just look at the returns/refunds for NMS.  I doubt any future games that are released by Hello Games will initially sell well because people got burned so badly.  
---
There is a huge difference between bugs in FO76 and completely missing content from NMS.
---
Im with ya bud. Yeah, the game released in a poor state compared to what it needed to win its audience over to something new.... but its a fun game, and bethesda does seem to be trying. For Honor and Battlefront 2 did something similar, and they were left alone after a little bit, save the occasional reference. I think people are just pissed that even bethesda is doing "wrong" in a way thats reminiscent of other games
---
You are essentially turning off vsync when you set it to zero. With vsync on, your card wont go above your monitors refresh rate (typically 60). Theres a little overhead with vsync, but with a powerful enough graphics card, it's not having to work very hard to maintain 60 fps. When you turn off vsync, the graphics card will now use as much processing power as it can to generate frames. It will stress the card a lot more, but you typically will have less input lag. A graphics card could run hot displaying minecraft if its fps isnt capped...it would be silly high like several hundred or even a thousand fps.
---
Think of vsync kind of like setting cruise control. Car can go faster and work harder, but it doesn't need to. Turning off vsync is like mashing the pedal to the floor. The car will go as fast as it can, revving the engine, etc.
---
And flat out lies from the devs was ok?  \*multiplayer\*
---
Yes, you are correct, it took 2 years after release to get 80% of the game they said would be in the game upon release.
---
The release value of the game was about $12, but they charged $60.  Now I would say the value of the game is closer to $40.
---
"Show me what you got!"
---
"I like what you got! Good job!" 
---
Lmao, Now u did it, you have unearthed Bethesda secret... haha they hate smart ppl like you lmao 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
---
You can, it’s just extremely awkward. I’ve built (before) a garage where when I close the door, the light goes out. I don’t know how I managed it, but it *can* happen
---
Eh, semantics, but build is distinct from found gear, IMO, though the gear is complimentary (one hopes). You could make a perfect 'build' around a specific weapon and effects, but never find it.
---
Wait a minute, are you not getting that the people in Vault 76 was alive before the war. Or you refusing to believe it? Or did you just not understand anything?
---
I dont get where people find so much time to invest in this useless shit or what even motivates them to become so obsessed with it.
---
Ive seen someone have this on a black powder rifle so they can spam hundreds of shots super fast. Yeah its a bug but not sure how its triggered. He was fighting a scorchbeast too tho weirdly
---
More build space, not charge so much for Christmas trees and lights during holidays, bigger stash box space, make it so flora stops growing up through a concrete slab floor
---
hmm, if the garage door was closed wouldn't that mean you cut power to the door? (PS I also hate how the garage doors work in this game, why in the world don't they just have a built in switch from the start that opens and closes from either side?)
---
This is where I'm putting Mama Murphy's chair. 
---
Going to be a that happened moment for 200 Alex.
---
Incorrect
---
On sale now for 1000 atoms, down from 4000!  Not available after the limited time sale.
---
A lot of the Fallout interface comes down to lore (mainly the PipBoy and how computer interfaces are expected to be in the FO universe) but its a cheap excuse to not make such basic time-saving improvements which are very easy to implement.
---
It doesn't have to be a full color display that ruins the players immersion, but there are simple ways to keep things in check and to make it useful while still being visually appealing and 'natural' within the FO world.
---
Vsync off can also cause screen tearing. I have a 60hz monitor, so I run with ipresentinterval set to 0, and in nvidia control panel I override the vsync setting to "fast". It let's the card go as fast as it can for smooth input, but drops all frames past 60fps for no screen tearing. The cards fans do kick up higher since the card is working at its max. Just the tradeoff you pay. My fps go anywhere from 80 to well over 100 at 1080p on my gtx 1080. The nvidia fast vsync setting prevents screen tearing that you normally get when vsync is off and framerate is uncapped.
---
I only use quack. I didnt know it wasnt working for some people
---
I think you took those edits as....far more intense than I meant them to be. 
---
Those were all added out of sarcasm. I'm seriously not over here tearing my hair out over this. 
---
So more than half of what's there is heavier in bulk form? Ehhh...
---
If they’ve already been completely recently on the server, you’ll need to wait (I think it’s 90 minutes for events now?) to do it it server hop. 
---
Enclave bunker. You know, the only place you get mods fro xo1
---
If you're not on someone's watchlist somewhere. Someone's not doing their job
---
I actually got off for the night. I didn’t realize how late it is lol. Tmr we can for sure run through it!  And that’s fine by me. I was hoping to make sure we both get hits to get us both xp and loot. 
---
How does being to one shot with melee make sense but not with a bullet?
---
Duping is drinking milk while sick. It’s not a cause of illness. Though is it making it worse.
---
Stev? I have the munitions factory on my server if ya need ammo! Lets do this!
---
Just for clarity I think we should be talking about character builds and loadouts as if they were separate things, which they are.
---
OCDecorator. The 100 other mods I have in 4. Shelves on the wall that were vanilla in 4. 
---
And here i smcrying for more grifers, need that spicy risk factor)) 
---
It always sounds like a nailgun to me for some reason
---
+karma
---
Thank you so much!  You are very generous!  :-)
---
Levelling the place from inside the trap is so much more epic though. 
---
Well, my power goes from generator, to small pylon, across the wall with connectors, connects to a small pylon switch, then the door.
---
I guess in a sense, that’s the reason why the power went out, but i can’t figure things out as easily in this game as in fallout 4.
---
General, our settlements need our help building oven traps. Here, I'll mark them on your map.
---
Possibly a silly question. Have you attached the swing analyser to it? 
---
At 50hz, 1080p a gtx 1080 is barely breaking a sweat. At 144hz the card is likely giving it all she's got. At 1080p I doubt most GTX 1080s could maintain 144hz consistently. What you are describing would happen in any graphically intense game. Higher FPS will make the card work harder, get hotter, and the fans will speed up to shed heat. Perfectly normal.
---
Def! Added on psn, so lmk! I usually camp the munitions factory, so unlimited ammo for ya when we group up. :)  
---
Okay, I went back and did some math. Somethings off friend
---
FO 3 Release date October 28 2008
---
FONV Release date October 19 2010
---
24 Hours in a day. Lets say you spent 8 hours of day sleeping/Eating/Going to the bathroom that leaves you with a solid 16 hours of game play. 
---
64,000 hours from FO3 and NV would be 4000 days worth of playing ( Going by 16 hours a day here)  4000 days is roughly around 10.95 years worth of playing. Now i'm not a Mathematician but something doesn't add up.
---
Demolish card 5 star, heavy weapons cards, explosives radius card, 2 shot fat man + nuke zone, have a friend gather a kite.. 5 to 6 levels per engagement. Be a level 100 in a few days. Your welcome. I run full heavy demo and weapons. Level 105 now. Make my own nukes and 40mm. Easy and always loaded. Have fun.
---
Attention Gourmands: Human flesh is not acceptable currency.

January the 15th I can't find the link. But it's definitely due then 
---
Level 80 on second character after deleting my first level 40 out of frustration in my build (didn’t know we stopped getting points at 50).  Have a bunch of solo launches as well invite or join whenever I’m always solo. MikeGarr16
---
Yeah I have to say this has been my experince with nukes launched here too. It is buggy at the best of times but it goes really haywire when it gets launched off center. Nice when it does work though...
---
ATTENTION

Please Do Not Feed the Wendigo
---
Shaina1506 if you want one more
---
Your sarcasm lacks empathy. Sorry you could never ever undersrand.
---
Gotcha
---
Allow us to build small bunkers/underground tunnels
---
The handmade rifle is literally not available at any vendor after level 44(?) so you pretty much have to grind out the event at the prison for it. And just waiting around would take so much longer 
---
If the legendaries you described are good you can start fighting SB's now.
---
Do you carry them because you have the weight perks for 2.5 instead of 10 lbs in the stash?
---
No image so I can’t tell you 
---
Somehow I can't upload images 😅
---
You can do it now. 
---
Upload to reddit then take the link and post it here.
---
Thanks for clarifying. You can spot duper's because they think the rarest equipment is the only equipment.
---
Best ten pounds you can have in your stash.  
---
PS4? I’ve had at least three crashes a day for the past week. So frustrating. 
---
Tiny little orgasms about how wonderful this game is. 
---
I just got lucky. I saw the “one day only” power armor paint sale and thought the flame job looked pretty cool. 
---
I didn’t read it very closely though.  I have mismatched armor and there isn’t flamer paint skin for the raider arm or excavator helmet I wear. So I look like a fashion show nightmare now. ;)
---
I think bulking is more for selling than weight reduction.
---
If you pick up 10 planks of wood at the same time IRL it's not any lighter than 10 individual planks. 
---
You mean the nukes are just elder Scrolls sealed in underground vaults? You would enjoy The Hero with a thousand faces by Joseph Campbell. 
---
What you dont get and seem incapable of any sort of empathy is the fact the there are others that want the gear now, and wi continue playing.
---
I do agree with you that its crap, and we shouldnt have to server hop to get what we want.
---
Im going to be flying all around the map carrying 200lbs extra worth of gear while u slug your ass around in the normal areas, meanwhile having to go back earlier to a stash box then me.
---
There is a place near vault 76 that have some small cabins and the cabins shake and then you hear a woman screaming. Some of the journals talk about some ghost. 
---
That place creeped me out...
---
Was there when I first started the game. I never went back 
---
 You can find this on a  Raider faction vendor (i.e. Pleasant Valley/Sutton/Sunnytop Station)
---
Send you're support ticket in the technical section and then download error, even if it's not for that. It seems to be the only way that they actually send it to a real person. Its pretty scummy that support system is pretty much just a hole leading to a trash can unless you cheat the system.
---
one of these days i'll figure out how they work. thanks for the attempt to help :)
---
Where is this located?
---
Yeah i know there is stuff i still want too. Have you tried to find others who have it? Traders are looking for customers all the time
---
I never said it was okay. Also, they do have multiplayer now. What I'm saying is that while it had a shit release, they more than made up for it with constant patches. 76 still hasn't even attempted to do so. 
---
Good luck. Hopefully some day you can enlighten the populous.
---
i haven't touched the game in weeks, hoping they pull magic out their arse to fix this mess lmao
---
Isometric exercises, care to join?
---
Well if you got slapped in the head with a rocket powered sledgehammer pretty sure you'd die same thing with massive double headed axe
---
I think you got your math wrong.
---
You need 10 aluminium to make 1 bulk. Now take your bulk and divide it by 10. Now you see how much weight you win. 
---
ManyATrueNerd's playthrough of FO76 has been great fun. I love how he just bumbles along and has a great time. His only real criticism of the game so far is that a lot of areas seem to have a story (told with scenery and notes and holotapes) but the story doesn't go anywhere. It just... stops. There isn't a payoff. 
---
You find the Lone Traveler's body,and hist duffel bag, southwest of the power armor, just past the Site Bravo missile silo cover. I doubt that he'll be looking for you to recover his power armor.
---
I believe you can get them from the whitesprings resort, I think it's the pendelton vendor.
---
So these lights turn on by being close to either to a power source or a conduit/conductor. So in theory if you had you light far enough away from a direct power source (like a generator) and wire up a button that goes to a power conduit near the light then you should be able to make a light switch.
---
So if the switch is on the conduit had power running to it and powers the light. Turn off the switch and there is no power close enough to power it.
---
This is what would have happened with the other garage door example that was written here. If you have a garage door that is powered the door opens and the lights work because there is a close enough power source. Turn off the switch the door shuts and the lights stop working because there is no active power.
---
It happened again and I found what I think were dupers near the moonshiner's shack. They'd been there for like a half hour, occasionally disappearing but not moving, and the server kept doing the "controls disabled" for like 1 of every 3 minutes. When I went over to check it out they had a paper sack between them but they picked it up before I could see inside, so I just have my suspicions.
---
We are rust now 
---
Adolf Hitler would like to know your location 
---
Thank you. Someone had a base built right next to Miguel's camp so I thought it just didn't spawn in. Guess I got tricked.
---
Multiplayer is still half-a$$ed and more buggy than FO76.   I have never seen people in this game on multiplayer.  I did see floating orbs though!   Yeah.. um no.
---
Base building sucks, Co-Op base building will more likely get you a corrupted base than not.   Missions?  You cannot just group up and go.  You have to play "how" to do a mission together.  Meaning everyone has to join a single persons ship before starting mission.  Its lame.
---
It’s a set of plans. So far I’ve only gotten the small letters 
---
I had a quad laser for a while. It’s pretty great to be able to pull the trigger continuously for a while. 
---
I didnt know that was a thing. You sir are a true gentleman!!
---
Well, thank you for your constructive and high quality criticism, but my experience with roughly 150h in the game differs from yours.
---
While only receiving some stimpacks/water/ammo when returning just one of the data, I do get more (again quantity, not necessarily quality) when having, let's say ten technical data (again they show as just one, but I think they do stack) Sometimes even a weapon and/or outfit. 
---
You're talking about the clean white display case. So it's stupid, but the plan is "bookcase". The display cases plan at whitespring unlocks nothing
---
Losing all my progress, plans, weapons, perks, mutations etc etc, wouldnt make me want to play it all again.. Maybe for those that have no life and don't mind hundreds of hours.. For me, it would just mean I'm out, move on to another game.. 
---
I think the npc ghosts of appalachia are having fun with your bum.
---
it just seems odd to me since almost every other CAMP light has an "activate" prompt when you get near it to turn it on and off without needing to worry about switches and the sort. 
---
http://explosm.net/comics/3599/
---
My ticket didn't even get a generic response, don't blame them for this but still.
---
oh, I think my weights were off because of weight saving modifiers, let me recalculate
---
It was a prewar hoax. There is a nearby terminal that control those strange occurrences. I recommend using it to spook your friends. 
---
I had that on a black powder rifle. Somehow I managed to fill it with all my .50 ball ammo (I only had about 10), so I could just repeat shoot it until it ran out.  
---
It happened when I was being attacked by a scorchbeast, and then I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I didn't notice until the next time I equipped the black powder rifle. Once I emptied it, it went back to single shot.  
---
(Also, I'm on PS4 if that matters)
---
Today has been very bad but with any luck the 15th we can get a patch.
---
It’s his camp and his traps. The algorithms just register the other players as intruders when they hit the traps.
---
Oh lol, I consider myself to be a building expert and I did not even know that was a thing. Here I am building complicated switches and there is a simply prompt button. 
---
I am going to go hang my head in shame and look at these lights. Although now that I think about it I only really use the atom store fan lights anyway which is probably why I never noticed it before :P
---
Well u seem like the kind of lone wanderer i would share with.
---
Go to instant gaming you will get a code.
---
Go to Bethesda.com, there should be a redeem code thing. Insert the code there.
---
Now download your game.
---
In case you are not happy with the game, you can't get your money back. 
---
Where is the logic in that? 
---
How does it actually affect gameplay?
---
I use the glowing meatpiles mod from nexus for this very reason, granted it only helps once the corpse has BECOME a meatpile.
---
What? You can see the other person's actual character. Those orbs are other players but they aren't in your game per se. 
---
I've never had a base corrupt when building w/ people.
---
So far you've essentially said you've never actually played the real multiplayer and everything you said after that is trashing the experience you haven't had.
---
I think it could, but it definitely ain't working now
---
I tried to hard to like 76. It's a Fallout multiplayer I can play with my husband. How perfect! But it got so fucking frustrating to play. Between the glitches and getting kicked off the servers I just stopped logging on. I was too stressful.
---
It wasn't until I picked up Assassin's Creed Odyssey that I realised how miserable playing 76 had made me. I love the Fallout franchise but I can not handle this game.  
---
I suspect the single player nature of BGS previous titles allows them to get away with a lot of the bugs and glitches but in a multiplayer game it just highlights them and drives the player to insanity. 
---
Or maybe too many hugs and not enough touching. 
---
Jex is correct one thing i could not stress more is this game is not for everyone. Unlike previous Fallout you really gotta love the survival type games as well.
---
Also its 1000% better with friends but solo is pretty darn fun as well.
---
Lol those turrets from other people’s camps helped me level up, stop being salty.
---
Hi, a month later, I've a few questions.  
---
I've looted a 3 star gatling plasma (TSE and reload protec), so I'm thinking about making a heavy build and found your post. Thing is, I don't really know if it's "useful" : up to now I've been playing shotgun, and I go through ennemies as through wet cardboard, but I sometimes lack on ammo. I'm not sure the gatling plasma ammo are easier to find, and I don't know if there are any places where it's actually useful to do that much damage.  
---
What are your thoughts on this ? Except for Watoga and SBQ runs, does your build feel useful or overkill ? Do you often run ammoless ? More important, how fun is it ? I expect the heavy "BRATATATATA" to be nice, but I don't know.  
---
Hope you'll be able to answer this :)  
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Well if you got shot in the head by a rifle with explosive rounds pretty sure you'd die. Same thing with a shotgun....   Or a pistol. 
---
- Just have a cooldown on the explosive proc every three seconds or so, meaning only one pellet from shotguns and one every few auto bullet get the effect.
---
- Have both explosive and two shot be mutually exclusive on weapons.
---
And losing all my workshops? No thanks.
---
It really looks like it too. I bet it was used as inspiration for the one in-game. Cool find.
---
ok, good catch, my math was off because of perks, updated list, things look simpler, now. Waste acid is an outlier because it takes 10 to produce one bulk, but scrapping one makes 15
---
I've had that glitch before, but usually it just lasted for a few seconds then went back to normal. Not sure it has anything to do with the queen... Also, have killed the queen many times and never had any issues..
---
That's not how you balance a game. That's in fact the definition of unbalancing.
---
Honestly just want more build space not even a bigger size. Just want to add abit more to my amazing camp. Feels like i have the shell built but its a tad hollow.
---
That worked! thank you! 
---
Straight up crazy Raider shit right there. 
---
Love how you're getting downvoted for telling the truth
---
And i am a silly person, because i did exactly that and it worked... I thought it had to be done at the cryptos computer, i was wrong... 
---
This is fantastic,  have you considered putting a fake door at the other end that opens to a wall?   
---
I've built my arena,  which has high walls around the outside and a home for players to fall into down to the walled in section.  No doors out and when I can tame animals it will be filled with deathclaws 
---
I always laughed at that, mostly because I’ve had games I’ve played religiously for over a period of 2 years only to hit 3000+ hours before I lost interest.. twenty atoms seems kinda low for devoting 7600 hours of your life for in my opinion, and probably everyone else’s as well.
---
.. Or hug a deathclaw?
---
Good to see the devs haven't touched this one
---
Thanks for the reply, I'm just going to weep in the corner for a bit
---
That's one good guy and nine others just building a wooden platform with turrets on it. I destroy every turret platform I see at that spot.  
---
Yesterdays asshole of the day had his camp at the usual spot with his door open, a comfy bed and all the workbenches there. As soon as I walked through the door to repair my weapons and get the well rested bonus, he started to shoot me.   
---
It's noticeable that more and more players are "done" with the content of the game. They all turn into bored assholes making the game less enjoyable for others.
---
Do you want powercreep? because that's how you get powercreep.
---
If you can balance with a nerf, don't balance with a buff. 
---
That’s how Fallout76 works
---
Yeah but with guns!
---
If you want instant gratification, this game is not it.
---
Not sure about that.   But I know for a fact that I have stacked Zealot weapons with Prime Receivers.  Good 1-star beginning weapons for those leveling up to face the Scorchbeasts and Queen.
---
I think I was in my late 30s when I first went for a nuke with heavy weapons. I have gone for nukes many times after and I like using heavy weapons over melee because if the roof turrets. I either spazz out and fall through the roof or floor or I just cant hit them even in vats.
---
That's funny. The reason I stopped playing skyrim and couldn't get into is because I hated swordplay and the magic made it so boring. But fo76 is skyrim with guns and is still a bit boring. Just goes to show its not the game fighting style but how it's designed and implemented.
---
Maybe *you* could see other peoples character.  I never could, even doing the community events.   All I saw was orbs floating around attached with names... and a landscape spammed with those floating balls with messages.
---
So far I have had 3 bases corrupted because some stranger joined my game and moved parts around.   Next time i log in, parts were inside or floating.
---
I also read about other posts where during a multiplayer mission, people joined this guys frigate, they go into battle, but one of the team turns on the frigate, blows open the leaders cargo and takes his stuff.
---
Some are, played the piano, even repaired my damaged walls. Thank you 😊 
---
Blowing open the frigate pods of a players freighter doesn't drop the leaders items 
---
That's surprising, usually high levels frown upon seeing a base a whitesprings, must be hungry for that grub.
---
It wasnt sarcasm really. Just the end bit about looking cool sorry. I love the role play thing. I guess that outfit isnt me.
---
I dig that, reducing them to weapon categories so special or rare weapons can be repaired in the same way without having to utilize the junk system. 
---
76 was not released as bad a condition as NMS was released in.   All 76 needs is really bug fixes.
---
NMS was missing 75% of the game itself when it was released in addition to bugs.
---
90% of my time playing has just been inventory management, I'm such a hoarder apparently. I scrap all commons and low level guns. I've been giving lots away to lower level players but still can't manage a full quest without running out of space. I have been taking my time with the main story, and for PvP I've only been attacked once and because I didn't retaliate fast enough it meant by the time I was ready they had become no longer hostile. I just flatly ignore anyone I see "farming" or hopping or just rinsing whitesprings. Fair enough for them but I play my games. 
---
Please stop perpetuating this lie. There were no jews burnt alive in ovens. Jews started 2 world wars, because Hitler only wanted to deport them. That is what happened. None of this holocaust bullshit. 
---
So as the nuke zone eventually times out and goes back to normal if people are still in the area the ghouls stay as green glowing ones. As long as there are still people in the area they will keep spawning. Much more fun when this happens as you dont take and rad damage and can see things much easier. Sometimes the plants also stay at nuked flora so you can harvest flux as well but this has just been my experince with it.
---
Harmless base, no turrets, just sit down area, food for all, Walter, workbenches and beds
---
Aint that the truth.
---
This gets even more difficult if you had "Bloody Mess" perk equipped.
---
I have mine outside the golf club all the time, everything accessible on purpose and the turrets are designed to target the entry door, so anyone low level can kite mobs to the entrance. Of course, the turrets are only lvl1 and out of range to auto-pull spawns. But even if they did, that shouldn't be a problem, you can easily put a single bullet in every mob, where is the harm? 
---
Only twice some idiot tried to destroy the base... I do not understand why, but thanks for the loot anyway.
---
Whaddya want for it?
---
Ah right. I suppose a little 20 foot increase wouldn't hurt. Maybe BGS could add a quest that awards some sort of CAMP expansion device?
---
A lot of dupers seem to be leveling via stimpak crafting. I've been chasing them down today, they're ALL at the chemistry bench. Not even doing boards.
---
Some youtuber probably did a leveling "hack" vid that went viral or something.
---
True, the turrets tend to piss people off, nothing beats a grilled radroach in peace.
---
Then make everything one shot in pvp
---
You know this is a great idea but I feel like it'll be a while before they implement any non atom shop paint jobs just so they can milk it for as long as possible. Just like how they wont be implementing modding for a while.
---
A solution where I lose all my workshops isn't a solution. Just build a damn door in your camp so I can lockpick my way out.
---
Skeet shooter is a must in my opinion. Makes your shotgun allmost a sniper at longer ranges. It's one of the things that makes the build great imo. That said, you should absolutely get all the mutations and class freak + starched genes. I have 14 luck in my shotgun build.    
---
Where do you have points? Could you show your build?
---
I had to just stop playing. Seems to get worse day by day. 
---
Did you ever figure out how to tame the lvl 61 or higher Deathclaw?
---
I've had the recon icon disappear when they die.  Sometimes the icon stays forever as well.   Its like flipping a coin!
---
I always seen plenty around in Watoga and the base in cranberry bog (forward station alpha??). Would be happy to collect some for you but I am not on PS4 sorry.
---
They admittedly do not have a lot of experience with online games.  They specialize in single player mostly.
---
They may seek to imitate others ideas here, but hopefully they will figure out their own idea and make better ways.
---
Go to the vendor at Harper's Ferry and try to get the handmade plan! Do it now! ;) 
---
I hear yah.  Someone said “missile turrets cause lag, that’s reason enough to destroy them”
---
I’m like enemies spawning causes lag, players coming into proximity cause lag to, enemies firing, players firing, the time of day changing, looting piles, bodies turning into piles, reloading a weapon, switching weapons, eating/drinking, using a stimpac...
---
EVERYTHING causes lag mfr
---
Happy cake day!
---
I just caved in and got the carry weight perks and allways have them on..    
---
The best ones in my opinion are bandolier (if you use guns), the one that reduces chem weights and batteries included (if you use power armor).     
---
And get calibrated shocks on your power armor, or pocketed if you use normal armor..    
---
Also, it's a bit difficult to avoid picking up everything, but I have managed to stop hoarding every single thing and now just pick up things I need..     
---
I wouldn't mind if they reduced weights on some stuff, like weapons. Especially the early game is a bit annoying whe you have low carry weights, and you need weapons with a few different ammo types to not run out.. 
---
Im having lots of fun for 20$ i payed for it. For sure i would pay more if i new how much fun it is, maybe if there was a free demo or 1 day trial.  
---
heh, it's such a pointless detail i'm sure plenty of folks didn't notice. I've tried out a bunch of different lights in my CAMP for different rooms so I've experimented with just about all of them at this point. the fan is reserved for the living room and bedroom though :)
---
Yeah i have 8 mutations im lvl 173 so i have all points. It was mostly that i was weighing between skeet and class freak
---
This is annoying for my game, as i only ever get shitty legendarys. Even the 3* have only ever dropped 1*/ 2* armour and weapons. Is this a glitch or is it a game of chance? I thought a 3* enemy drops a 3* item?
---
Why would they give refunds? If you aren't certain that you're making the correct purchase, rent the game instead. 
---
Having extra money to spend means you can save time on a respec, which people can only normally do little by little as they level up. That clearly makes gameplay easier for those that have the money, and that shouldn’t happen with the ATOM shop.
---
I like this comment the most. Materialism sucks to me. Maybe thats just me.
---
Well i didn't told the details but i have a tse .50 who does 459 damage per shot, and i have only 30 % more damage on heavy guns,going for 90 % . When i'll have heavy gun maxed out with the perk that ignore 36 % of armor i'll be able to os even people with full vanguard set
---
Basically if you have a tse weapon and u max out the perk of this weapon you can only one shot, since players have an average of 250-400 health
---
The only exception i think is if the dude have a full sentinel set, but he must not move unless he lose those 75% damage reduction, and if he doesn't move he is an easy target
---
I hope i was understandable, sorry for my english
---
I want it.  I dont have it.  
---
Did you try to relog or restart the game? I have had some weird issue with quests, but this usually fixed it. 
---
There are limits after which game starts glitching bad, around 500 for weapons and apparel and 500k for everything else.
---
Think alot of us are hoping the reason why they have not said anything regarding the exploits since beta. Is that they have something in the works for it. Some way to detect it and ban all effected accounts.
---
Never hurts to keep reminding them daily that we need a solution to the whole mess.
---
vision problems or not i'm constantly losing bodies in even the shortest of grass (i'm pretty darn confident some of them just flat out vanish) and some of the notes are literally illegible. one thing I wish they would've borrowed from Red Dead was the normal text overlay viewing option for all the written notes, made it so much easier to read them. 
---
Thx !
---
Exactly what I'm saying
---
GTA Online was a free addition to a full price title, designed as an experiment. Rockstar themselves had no idea that the Online-Mode would be such a hit, otherwise, they would have probably put more effort into stability/content. 
---
I agree that some of the addition were simply garbage, especially the flying motorcycle with extremely precise targeting rockets. However, earning money in this game is relatively easy in my opinion, especially since the release of import/export. You can make so much cash that you'll drown in it, earning like 1.5m in a few hours is not unrealistic.
---
I've been running PA Shotgun since i picked up my excavator set and at lvl 150 finally have a [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f693887&amp;d=sb2sd2so2sp2su2pc2pe2e80e11e00ei1ef2ce0cu0ev0ic4ih2a71s72as2l71lu2lt1&amp;w=c71&amp;n=) I'm happy with. My Two-shot, no other effects, combat shotgun will kill the mole miners from the Uranium Fever event in 1 hit at close range, or drop a bloated glowing one to 50%.  I use mutations to give it more utility. 
---
Adrenal Reaction, Electrically Charged, Grounded, Healing Factor, Herbivore, Herd Mentality, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Unstable Isotope.
---
Works best as part of a group and corn soup is my main food. Share rad sponge with your team and nuke zone's only get dangerous when i get too many mobs on me. Just don't TSE mobs at close range, your friends are laughing at you not with you when that happens.
---
Today has been very terrible for it on pc not sure about consoles. But we gave up for the day and just logged off.
---
Please no
---
Thank u for the information ! I bought the display case plan days ago without knowing that's an invalid item and it was so expensive ! 
---
I'm a huge fallout fan and I have an xbox one yet I've decided to not play 76. These videos just changed my mind see yall soon...
---
if it's any comfort, it sucks and is not worth using:)
---
I'm not even hoping for logic anymore. Part of me hopes they'll say that PVP is working as intended and they have no plans to change it, then I wouldn't care anymore.
---
Lol no.  I use speed demon and several other mutes to compliment it. I love that mutation just use All night all day to counter its negative.
---
Its good as a gap closer and helping you dodge shots
---
Its to please all the gachi Fans out there. Ahhhhhh!
---
Makes sense, thanks for the info!
---
Maybe they could just tweak the damage things do to players a bit?
---
Morpheus: If real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain
---
i'll give you a set for nothing if you'd like, Username is: TrimUrMeme
---
Why not both? That is why i am curious about your build, because I am sure there are worse perks than those 2 (which are both great:)
---
Everytime I go to Grafton Steel there's at least one frozen mutant. Don't know what they put in the water up there...
---
A problem I see a lot these days is when people call a game "objectively bad"
---
That isn't a thing, objective looks at facts. "Bad" is subjective.
---
It can be objectively worse than previous fallout games, based on certain factors, and still be a good game in someone's eyes.
---
Generally the only weight savings you're going to get from bulking is all the plastic you're going to lose.  Aluminum and lead is all.  Acid if you want to convert 2 plastic to 5 acid.
---
Why does Bethesda have to spoonfeed a player's character's motivations? Why not let me make my own reason why I might wanna PvP?
---
Really nothing i wanna swap atm. Stupid points never enough
---
Get a high level to unlock the trailer at Gorge Junkyard repeatedly until you have a full set of Raider Power armor (and a ton of cores).
---
Can you post your build using the build calculator?
---
Guess you could call it a *conectration* C.A.M.P.
---
Yeah going back to a non mutated character is horrible! I am jumping on roofs, speeding around! (also jetpack is really fun)
---
Yeah one minute. I know there is some points others would swap but. Damage output is no problem
---
Come into Mein Kampf. 
---
Wow, the video really shows the magnitude of the excavator, they did a good job replicating it in-game.
---
but what time
---
A company having a smooth release of some merch isn't newsworthy
---
Yeah I know how that feels. I started working on a database for plans and other people on Reddit have too, so if you have any other questions on what plan unlocks what, let me know. I'm happy to help others not make the same mistakes
---
Now time would be okay?
---
It's important to show those major developers that they can't put out a dressed up turd like that and charge full price. Fallout 76 is literally a Fallout 4 asset flip with a tacked on multiplayer. On top of that, they add insanely expensive MTX. Does that qualify as a full game? Does that qualify as something you should pay 60 bucks for? Bruh, wake up. How can you NOT be mad when the fallout legacy is being shit on like that? Fallout 4 already was a step back with the dialogue options and the fact that they still use an ancient engine. But FO76 is just a slap to the face to EVERYONE. And you're sitting here being like: "It'S nOt ThAt BaD lOl"
---
It is. It is that bad. It is terrible and it is not what we were promised. We were lied to, we were betrayed, bethesda sold us an early access game for 60 bucks, and even for early access, the game is completely undercooked.
---
Wake up sheep. Just wake up.
---
Alrighty, question two: why are you STILL here, necroposting a thread from over two weeks ago?
---
im annoyed it doesnt spin
---
Awesome.  Ill friend you now
---
I dunno.. You can still earn it. Make it cheap like 100 atoms, would anyone really care? I don't even want to respec.. 
---
oh my
---
Yes it was, and thank you for clarifying.
---
In your previous reply I didn't know if you meant whoever has the better aim or shoots first, disregarding the slap damage / Rules of engagement 
---
Considering they immediately patched free stew for all, I highly doubt they have a solution for the duping issue. 
---
Just have to say, that jetpack is really fun and makes the gameplay more fun imo:)    
---
Also mutations &lt;3    
---
Pick the lock, get a bounty.
---
If other games can be played reliably on the same connection, the connection is not the issue.
---
Net code can be written to be resilient to a decent percentage of packet loss. In fact it should be written to be resilient to packet loss.
---
sure, pm me your in game name
---
How would you know all that. Think of reality if that were to happen. If this happened to me, I'd free myself come back and have a laugh with the guy. It's devilish and he never attacked me, just tried to lure me to my demise. The question of my fate was always up to me. Besides I doubt that a single mini nuke is going to destroy anything unless you've got demolitions up, and even then, probably not.
---
You or p.matters didnt answer my question.
---
Put this way, if I did a full respec as per the OP, how are you to know? 
---
What advantage does it give over another player apart from saving time? Key word here is advantage.
---
Other games have been doing it for for quite some time now with no issues, unless anyone can give me examples.
---
I just had the same thing happen. I dropped mine to see if that changes anything but it doesn't. 
---
That seems to be the most appropriate adjustment
---
Wherever there are human players, there will be nefarious deeds being done. 
---
It’s human nature. Throw a heap of random people into an online game and the sheer amount of fuckwittery that occurs is biblical in proportion. BGS will patch one method and the arseholes will find 3 more. 
---
Look at you lot with your cool families.
---
I got an eye roller sat on the couch behind me, her entertainment is scrolling through Facebook. 
---
How come you need so much coal?
---
Most people can one shot or be one shot.. Maybe they'll balance damage a bit later, but it's really easy atm..
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d393d78&amp;d=l22l71lt2s72a03ib4ic4id2c70cu0e82e11e41ee0pc2sb2sd1su1s01so1sp1&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
I have an anti armor handmade you can have for cheap. It's just 1 star though:)
---
lol right? do anything to the guys house and you get a bounty. If you want to exact revenge, go hope put away anything you might drop upon death and then go fuck his shit up... but frankly, it's not like he was attacking you, just trying to lure you into your demise. He plays upon peoples own foolishness rather than outright attacking. It's devilish and relatively harmless. Totally hilarious though.
---
Yeah i'm sure they'll balance it eventually.. They just have a huge list of things to fix, and that's just one of the many things they probably have planned..:)
---
This, can't cure stupidity and human nature.
---
Well he looted the guys freighter somehow.   Emptied it out.  Not sure the specifics now.   I am sure you can find details on it with a few searches.
---
Server dropped me.... Im rejoining my b
---
I 1 shot most enemies solo. Just thinking on negating some mutation downsides. But sure it actually would benefit me
---
Saving time is an advantage. We did answer your question, you just didn’t like the answer.
---
More themed items, i.E  Radier, enclave, responder, bos ect.
---
Nope
---
Walter? I haven't talked to him since Fallout 3.
---
Join my world... the whole server crashed.
---
How does this for for all thing work? You have plants and water available for people?
---
I chose my special targets on the assumption that I would eventually swap between a few loadouts (combat, crafting, and exploration). So each stat doesn't need enough points to support all three cases at once, just one at a time.
---
I don't actually swap yet. I don't have even a third of the cards I planned for. But maybe someday.
---
No I did not, hunting was great and all but it was boring af after a while 
---
I can’t delete the store blueprint my camp budget is over 300% can anyone help?
---
If your buying ammo, your doing it wrong. I craft all mine.. Shotgun, ultracite shotgun, ultracite 5.56 and 50cal. All of which i have 2500-3000 rounds each, except 50cal... Closer to 5k of those. 
---
Before evaluating the Internet connection, the question would be do you other games have an issue.
---
Packet loss is a known quantity, and you can develop a program so that is not affected by packet loss as much.
---
ye m8
---
As far as I know, arms and legs are considered limb mods so they’re learned from either. Chest mods are separate 
---
Oh I see the issue. You dont need any of the food enduranve perks. With reduced effects from mutations, you dont get hungry as easily from speed demon anyway, and food is plentiful. Same is radaway, so the perks that makes food better or not give rads are 100% useless imo.. Take points from there and put in luck instead:)
---
It's quite easy actually, I only keep the plasma gatling for killing SBs. If you have a beam focuser, a level 50 SB dies in 20 seconds.
---
The usual problem with the plasma is that it misses enemies that obviously shouldn't. But for a SB it seems to hit every shot, maybe because they have a big hit box.
---
Yes, I have planted all the food types, Water purifier pumps. So ppl can help themselves. Nothing is locked. 
---
They paid for influential youtubers to fly out and play the game, and show off the canvas bags they were given.
---
They tried to use YouTube to generate hype, and it backfired on them because they couldn't live up to the hype they were trying to generate.
---
you live by the sword, you die by the sword. if They didn't wanna have to deal with negative YouTube exposure, they shouldn't of tried to use YouTube as a platform to generate hype.
---
When I get home at midnight Aussie time I’ll post a video of my creation
---
If you’re taking 130% less dmg from a fall does that mean you are getting healed?
---
The ones you listed is all I know of. I've skirted the edge of the map all the way around, not found any more caves. 
---
Recently checked out Seneca Rocks too, found nothing. 
---
It's also usually easier to buy the scorched mods from the firestation vendor than it is to craft. They're like 100caps VS getting the ultracite. 
---
To be honest, they could have looked at other games of a similar type. WoW, SWTOR I'm betting they had similar problems..
---
Your house is a bomb site 
---
Good luck and get well soon.
---
I was trading another player.  Im in your world now.
---
It’s a hard question to answer by anyone but yourself. You have to really like fallout and not let all the current problems bother you to get into this game. There will be more good stuff rolling out soon enough, but the whole thing is up for you to decide.
---
I was on that track also. Its just bugging me the sprinting if very low end. U think it would be an issue? I dont sprint really much though tbh
---
Ah thanks for reminding me. Does it work on armour too? I have T51 that is getting mighty worn. 
---
On top of the mountains is wedding rings though
---
And it's a sweet place to build up top
---
I have 2 endurance and it's fine.. I find the endurance perks lackluster, and there are so many other great perks I would rather have instead.. 
---
Thanks for the info, no worries I'm sure I'll find one eventually lol
---
Yeah I do it from time to time. Until we are able to know if we pick a duplicate one i'll keep doing it.
---
Never hurts helping someone :)
---
If fibre and fitted (?) where limb mods I would be able to craft it on arms and legs now, yet I can only put it on legs.
---
That is true, using PA so i think the health would be enough
---
They learned from fallout shelter. The constant "Cha-ching" from leveling. The noises from looting. Even the fact that you continue leveling past 50. They know.... And I love it! 😁
---
Unfortunately I couldn't find all the armor suits. Probably due to other players coming and getting them? Idk. I tried a few different times but only found the one on the roof of the emergency services and the crashed vertibird on the ground in front of the emergency services.
---
Well i wasn't thinking about splash damage i was thinking in a event versus when there is no splashy splash damage
---
With PA you allmost never die anyway.. I actually like a point in the agility perk that makes you auto use a stim if you fall below 20% life. Then I don't even have to pay much attention:)
---
im overencumbered or id travel to you
---
Did it let you loot the mask?
---
Actually laughed out loud at this while at work, THANKS.
---
Haha, amazing idea though. So sinister and hilarious. Poor victim 2, he gave you a love emote and everything!
---
ME TOO! Hahaha
---
Haha green thumb for life! But yea, nah I swap cards lol
---
I hate duping, but to be fair, it's not their fault Bethesda released a game with tons of ways to dupe stuff.
---
Unfortunately it didn’t 
---
I'm sure I've read somewhere on a tooltip that it was made to save space though. I'll have to double check that I guess!
---
Just because the method is there, doesn’t mean you need to use it. That’s a weak excuse for cheating. 
---
Thats true. Gonna test, hadd 3 points so i swapped a few now
---
Start : White Springs Hotel proper, sell to vendors clear cap stash. 
---
Next is Enclave Bunker but grab what your gonna sell to them from the stash that is only accessible in White Springs hotel. 
---
Lewisburg Station (Responder Faction)
---
R&amp;G Station (Raider Faction)
---
Watoga Station (Special Faction)
---
Walk to the BOS vendor at the Super Duper Mart TM. 
---
Finally I go to Harper Ferry (Free States Faction) kill all super mutants take there assault rifles and sell those. 
---
This is the most efficient route caps wise in game especially if you have your camp set up strategically. 
---
I think the style can be really important to enjoying combat, but Skyrim and Fallout 3 to 76 have really basic combat so it's not interesting. There are lots of games that do combat really well if that's what is important to you in a game. I like exploring places more, so in Skyrim I just used archery with poisons to quickly rid myself of hostiles. You gotta find a game that has the right mix of realistic and gamey for you to stay enjoying it. That's my thoughts anyhow.
---
Social experiment starting in 1....2...3....
---
You should asking both of your sister and brother do they want to grown up to join which factions? 
---
we all know where this is going XD
---
I've enjoyed the exploration, story, combat balance in fallout 3, 4, and new vegas. It's just fallout 76 that I feel is lacking in the story and exploration and without those the combat is the only thing that sticks out and the combat in fallout games is good if it isnt the sole focus of the game. 
---
I'm just saying, Bethesda is just as much at fault here. If they would have spent more time on the game, these methods wouldn't exist.
---
Most rants generally are. Also, I wasn’t really defending the post. Just thought it was very obvious that it’d be a cringe, biased post. 
---
unfortunately it’s just aesthetic. :( i wanted one too 
---
You can have it with tresure hunt. already got 2 plans from those
---
If you are runnng either the launcher or the game as an admin, and not the account you logged on with, then the pics will be in the admins “users” folder.
---
I was rather upset  that Camden park isn't working either.
---
Yeah, I thought so. 
---
Just for clarity's sake, 'Slap' damage is a new mechanic to the series that yields a 90%+ reduction in damage output to other players unless the Rules of Engagement are met.
---
'Splash' damage refers to the area effect of explosives. If I shoot a missile toward your feet oh, it may not make direct contact but you will take explosive Splash damage.
---
Either that or a nearby suitcase always works well, I know I always check them out of habit.
---
it’s just as great as those random punching noises before it. love getting slapped while i’m in the pip boy menu. 
---
Wouldn't you literally die in seconds? I logged into a blast zone once and basically had just enough time to get my power armor on before dieing, had like 5 hp left.
---
There are 3 cultist masks in the game files. 
---
     
---
The normal one, this one, and another Ive not seen yet.    
---
      
---
Ritual Headpeice - id:Headwear_CultHat_D   
---
Ritual Hood - id:Headwear_CultHat_E    
---
Ritual Mask - id:Headwear_CultHat    
---
    
---
No idea where to even see the 3rd. Let alone loot the hood or the headpeice. 
---
Yes I do
---
Yeah it’s confusing maybe I wrote it wrong, but what I meant was, you can learn a mod from either an arm or a leg for an arm or a leg, but chests are the only ones you can learn from chests. Lol sounds weird in my head typing it 
---
To be fair It's not my fault the loaded gun was sitting right there and the guy was tied down.
---
Upset about lack of response on the issue? Sure. Upset about the lack of patches to fix it? Sure
---
But blaming them for people being scum is really not a good point
---
Please include me in the screenshot when this gets printed in a game studies text book.
---
Yes, yes it does
---
Oh yeah I know what you mean. There is exploration, but not the same level as 3,4, NV. Plus the enemies re-spawn or a player comes close and a new way of enemies spawn so investigating is interrupted by combat anyway.  So the combat is really pushed on you and it is just repetitive instead of interesting. 
---
Yes.  I bought one last weekend.
---
I found one last week as well
---
Maybe they should test the game before releasing a $60 beta, how's that?
---
Are there any trap doors in this game? I feel a man as clever as you can utilise them.
---
Yup exactly
---
Hey VSauce, Michael here.
---
Maybe they should stop selling Beta period. When you sell a game in Beta to players, most of these players don't do what beta is intended for. Did you play beta? Did you report all the bugs you found? 
---
Is any of this your fault? No, it's the gaming community in general for buying into paying for Beta
---
[Cultist blade?](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Cultist_blade) depends on legendary effects.
---
what location can you find him ?
---
That stuff definitely makes its way into a lot of forums after the youtubers rile people up. The stuff usually gets downvoted into oblivion on the subs I’m on but if you sort by new you can pretty easily find it. When it comes up. Usually in big batches the day that the youtubers upload something inflammatory and usually by people who have either not played or played VERY little. 
---
What the fuck is an incel cunt
---
I can mod all of my CA pieces with BOS. I think it might have something to do with joining the BOS. 
---
You. You are our true end-game content! &lt;3
---
No it's not the cultist blade.  Idk if it's even in the game but in the game guide it says you can get it from the lode bearing event.
---
I agree
---
We found the lazy farmer.
---
When there is daily challenge to pick booble head i travel to poseidon poweplant, there is spawn on top. When i had no luck there, i go to top of the world, on south of trainstation in raider camp, there are like 3places where booblehead can spawn. Looking for more places, if others share too.
---
They literally aren’t at fault at all. Yes they could have minimised the potential for it to occur, but they aren’t to blame. 
---
Games with minimal bugs still get exploited by people too. It’s all part of online gaming. 
---
Today a group of 4 came to my camp each with two-shot explosive shotguns  and destroyed it. One of them then proceed to two-piece me even though I had not engaged/triggered pvp. How is this even possible when I was at full health!? It seems like everyone has this shotgun except for me; there is at least one wise guy with this shotgun on every server I join. 
---
I do agree that it is sickening that people are enabling these cheaters, let alone giving them real money for these duped weapons. It’s also a bit disheartening that the pvp aspect of the game has become pay-to-win because these cheaters. 
---
A man of culture I see. 
---
Now now, thats not true to the extent that it would be a game breaking advantage.
---
Not to the extent or to the point that changing this specific aspect of the game that we are talking about is game breaking, making my argument seem more logical to me.
---
How would you know if I had done it if it was currently implemented?
---
I bought the beta. Never really had a chance to play or report. Servers were never online enough to really test, at least not when I could get on. Xbox
---
And then to drop the price not soon after release really soured any chance I'll partake in said betas again. 
---
Well that's your problem, sleeping bags you only get "rested" not "well rested"
---
Short answer: not yet. 
---
Long answer: there are a lot of bugs and unstable servers due to dupers and people with a large amount of overstated items. Also, make some friends who are ready to play the game or find people who play it.
---
Personally, i take a break and wait for the next update. 
---
i was online, can’t sleep may get back on. any specific reason? 
---
IMO Running both four leaf clover and crit savvy is a little overkill, i think you could use that on class freak and run speed demon mutation, Now are pistols good endgame? Are you running power armor? I ran a combo of Melee and pistols on my main and actually enjoy the variety on top of not having to worry about ammo. 
---
Yea. I guess the gameplay to get these things needs to be tweeked a little so that people dont feel the need to server hop for those things. I like those bits of the game where we can feel powerfull. Not weighed down by useless crap.
---
I was beginning to think the same about the jetpack till I found one last night. You'll find em eventually. It might be quicker and better for your sanity to just buy them from another player tho.
---
You're definitely good for doing whitesprings farming.   Just team up with people there.  SBQ might be a little more difficult but if your all rise is 50, you should do just fine.
---
In Enclave armory
---
Yeah, there are a ton out there. From what I can tell from your post, you've got 2 at map marked locations (poseidon and top of the world) and one south of a train station, but you didn't say which one?
---
I've only seen it come up once
---
just bored and have no one to play with maybe level up. 
---
I just have just one, so I am running around with one T60 leg. I found one last week also, and a jetpack the next day, without even server hoping. Except, when I was getting disconnected every 30 minutes I would go back and check the Enclave vendor each time; that is not server hoping, that is trying to find a silver lining.
---
I am down, i’ll hop on right now for a lil bit :) my IGN is luficr keep an eye out for me :3
---
You can't actually build your camp in this location.
---
Gunsmith doesn't specify type of gun.  So in theory it should work with all guns.
---
Xbox. I counted 6 yesterday. 5 were while checking my inventory in the Pip-boy or while transferring stuff to my stash.
---
That’s a shame, hope they add them in the future. That’s a really cool looking mask. 
---
Head over to /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
They seem to be enjoying their time spent playing. 
---
My $.02...if you like the franchise, jump in this one. Sure, it has some issues. Hopefully Bethesda has hired some coders that can actually write code instead of  10 ?"hello"  20 goto10
---
Thanks! I think I'll take a break and play something else for a week.
---
Then again, I might be back tomorrow. lol
---
I’d prefer it if you could create weapon repair kits instead. 
---
This is still on top, congrats. For the sake of my own, who cares...
---
Furnace, not oven
---
Charred, not roasted
---
Vault-Dwellers/Characters/People(?), not players
---
The only work-around I can think of is 'don't open your inventory or your stash'. lol
---
I understand completely, and honestly this is a big reason why I try my best to avoid buying into Betas.
---
🤣🤣
---
https://fo76map.com
---
I feel like shitty camp placements are specifically why the orbital missile strikes exist. They aren't useful for even the biggest, slowest enemies in the game unless you get lucky
---
Can you have both instigating and bloodied?
---
I know it is on a line from Pleasant Valley Station to Harpers Ferry ... pretty close to Hawks Refuge. 
---
I see it every time I decide to vendor run instead of fast travel.
---
first time i saw it i was like “wait a hot minute, walter white.” 
---
The problem is the game is still in beta but they tried to say it was a full release. So no, the problem isn't with the community, the problem is Bethesda. Or are you such a blind fanboy you can't fucking see it?
---
Yeah my YouTube homepage keeps getting slammed with videos shitting on Fallout 76 now. It's fucking everywhere. I've seen the hate extend to porn subreddits at this point, I can't even jerk off without being reminded "oh hey Fallout 76 shit game". I feel your pain.
---
Think you forgot a link perhaps?
---
Yes. But laser rifles still lose durability extremely quickly. I don't think I've seen anyone even using energy weapons in game due to all the problems with them (tank killer not working,  ash piles not spawning loot if you kill an enemy from far away,  etc). It's currently the worst weapon type, imo. 
---
JESSIE! WE HAVE TO COOK!
---
&gt;They literally aren’t at fault at all.
---
Holy fuck, get the Bethesda dick out of your throat. They released a game that's clearly still in beta. There are TONS of MMOs and online multiplayer survival games that don't have duping exploits. Bethesda are entirely at fault.
---
“YEAH MR WHITE. YEAH SCIENCE”
---
It doesn't taste bad. Just the odor when the water is heated. 
---
Holy heck !  
---
I would have just used my 2 shot dragon to down the walls personally but then again, I wouldn't have ever gone in. 
---
Without going to nuke zones, you very well could go through the game just fine without using any stims/Radaways or any other drug.  
---
Water/Food/sleep heals you. Rad Sponge could remove radiation.   The only issue would be getting rid of radiation in the game prior to Rad Sponge and of course requires two people for Rad Sponge to work.
---
Hmm in summary the major issue would be getting rid of radiation in early game and solo prior to getting Rad Arch.
---
Late game, no problem.   I'm usually selling Stims/Radaway all the time because have way too many.   I get down to 10 of each.  Never keep Super Stims because they weight 1.5 lbs each.
---
Also those square dirt patches you could craft in FO4, so you could plant where there isn’t a whole lot of dirt. Or even let us build crops that are in those potted planters you see around. And let us plant the new varieties of non-nuked flora, even if they are locked and can only be planted in their specific region. Like you can only plant cranberries in the bog, and irradiated thistle in the toxic valley. I want to build a pumpkin patch.
---
They are purchased from Graham mostly
---
Think the engines kinda meh with movement stuff like this but if they could replace a scorched head with the train and have it run the line upside down that'd be grand.
---
Oh thought this is kind of noob question like other 50% of this reddit. Also I didn't know this is in game. On wikis is some info, not much more than you know, only some stats, but not picture. So maybe someone got it. [Or maybe this is just datamined, idk.](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Meteoric+Sword) If i had time, i would investigate this, becouse 4\* machete is not as strong is i want to.
---
I would love it. I remember them from New Vegas. Stimpack for your gun basically.
---
Soon is toooo long. It's my pre-war money and I want it now!
---
Check the 'Looking for Group' for Fallout 76 on your Xbox to find people regularly selling all serums for 200-500 caps.
---
A timer of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 sec for Fire show and traps would be awesome !
---
My hero!
---
Gut mein Herr Brandt die Juden !!!
---
you got a mic? 
---
One at poseidon, second in raiders camp (have 3different places there where it can spawn) on south of trainstation near top of the world. Both are marked on map tho. 
---
Yeah I saw that one the other day. I want it!!!!
---
yeah
---
do you?
---
can you hear me
---
Because some people don't know it existed and they want to cook something instead of sit and eat hot pockets all day. 
---
yes, i have mine set to auto may as well do team then :0 
---
ok can you hear me
---
It's probably because of the plans, I followed the methods mentioned here, I kept server hopping to Grafton Station and found all the Boss Combat Armor Mods for Chest Arms Legs and the Deep Pocketed for Limbs and Chest. The one I unlocked earlier I guess it's for the Helmet which I still haven't found.
---
I love it. I don't attack or call you names but you come in here and do it to me. Now, did I ever claim this game wasn't in state that should be considered Beta? No, but you took as that. Did I ever say that this game doesn't have glaring issues? 
---
I can see you getting REALLY upset over this and I honestly got to wonder why. It's a game dude, a buggy game that should of been delayed yes. One to get a raging hate boner for? Not really.
---
not at all 😩
---
i have a mic and i’m using push to talk do you know what to do and also just speak through chat cuase i can hear you
---
You don’t gear up at 15, you grind to 50 and then really buckle down refining your build. As far as I know there are 0 benefits to being low level 
---
I've duped 512k 3 star TSE shotties, gave away few hundred at a time to a few people and this was back in October. I think 500,000 weapons should be enough? Or should i do a couple more iterations and get me few million?
---
Yep - and I do love the flair of the Pip Boy and I did really dig the companion app in FO4. Hope it'll make a comeback. 
---
I think a lot of the improvements you mentioned should be added to the game and hope the devs take notice of your list - since it's already linked to the master QoL list which seems to at least be seen here. Beth seems to be a bit lazy here unfortunately...
---
try setting it to team and turn off push to talk? 
---
No problem. I keep missing the obvious stuff too. Like "who needs excavator power armour" dooooh
---
dont think ive ever seen a bone weapon
---
If there is a cache at the silo ... then that is where it is from. I have all the others from caches but havent bothered to go launch a nuke yet.
---
You can get all in like 30 min:) Might not want all of them though, depending on your build..
---
Wow what a very well thought out and mature response. Kudo’s to you. 
---
Your hatred for Bethesda aside, your point is still invalid. Just because loopholes and exploits are there does not mean they should be used. That onus is 110% on the player, not the developer. 
---
Every single MMO I have ever played has had some form of duping exploit where loot is involved. They are inevitable, regardless of how watertight their coding is. 
---
I'm just a few lvls above that. The airport down by Charleston is great, as you can snipe muties effectively from a distance if you stay outside. Not very high levels to deal with. Crap ton of junk around there too for ammo crafting.
---
Serums are permanent.. The temp buff only removes the negative effect for an hour..
---
Yep.  Only place you're going to find it, AFAIK.
---
Read this in high school, sophomore English!
---
I mean you're passing the blame on to the community for Bethesda fucking up. How the fuck is it the community's fault Bethesda didn't make duping impossible, how is it the community's fault Bethesda released a game in beta state? You're clearly mentally deficient, which is why you get upset at being called a fanboy.
---
Just wait until player vending. You could create the suicide booth from futurama!
---
I don’t think people realise that these CAMPs are built to stop the exploitation of the Whitesprings farming method.
---
We all know if you want to farm, go to Whitesprings, but all that is doing is deflecting you from playing the game. You destroying these people’s bases is only going to make this exploitation worse. You are no better than a drugged up raider.
---
I wish the worst of in-game deaths from the highest levels of players who now have nothing to do except Scorched Queen farming and ensuring players like you suffer 
---
When servers are disconnecting every 10 minutes, lets blame player 1 because his misbehaving via bugs/glitches causing player 2 3 4 5 6... 32 to lag out, the blame is on player 1, thats your logic just to be clear. 
---
Meanwhile any other online game EX:World of Warcraft.... 12 million players behaving perfectly. FOR 15 YEARS you dumb cunt. Of course Bethesda is at fault for having shit engine/servers/bugs call it what you want.
---
That was... disturbingly entertaining... 
---
I'm gonna keep trying to do lode bearing as much as possible to see if I can get it.  I'll let you know if I eventually do find it.
---
When it works for a a few hours in a row, it's the best game ever. So yes, but have a backup game for downtimes. It's not that it is down for ages, it is just sometimes, for days, there are half-hourly disconnects, I personally kept logging back in, but maybe most wouldn't.
---
My only fix when I ran into something like this was to move camp, and throw away the generated blueprint and start over, still can’t get a really good feel for how building objects think they are hooked up.
---
I burn through thousands of shotgun rounds! farming it sucks.. Stupid plastic..
---
OMG, this and the Murder Church. Very creepy, but so creative.
---
Poor level 2-3s just got out from Vault and then they met you. But I'll have to admit, haven't lol'd this hard a while.
---
Why should ‘the game’ return the favour instead of the players? Why should game mechanics punish an explicitly allowed play style just because the players aren’t willing to? How exactly is that in line with ‘making your own story’? The slap on the wrist is someone else coming up and shooting you, not arbitrary penalties imposed by the game engine.
---
You can open all containers without mutations. The top ones just require standing near as possible, looking up, jumping and spamming the use (unlock) OR loot (container) key.
---
Wow going all out shilling and calling names huh? Great go fuck youself you brainless worthless creature 
---
The duper’s are purposely crashing the servers. That’s how the duping exploit is performed. 
---
They are literally causing one of the main bugs of the game, so yes my logic is 100% correct in that regard you fucking sperg. 
---
Is it, the dupers SwissAgent? I hope so.
---
All night long is 1000000% useless, it doesnt do what you think it does=/
---
The duping, constant dc's and lack of support from bethesda got me. I was somewhat ok with the story; however, you are right why put in the time if someone else is duping 1000's easily.
---
I just fill out tickets for the placebo effect, start every ticket ticket with “Hey Alexa”....
---
500 hours spent "I don't like it". I just find this really funny. Seems like you got your moneys worth!
---
You could use that perspective with any game idiot. You must be the life of parties.
---
This happened to me the first two times I approached the Queen on PC, though today it was smooth as silk, and I was part of my first queen kill. I searched this reddit for a similar scenario and saw no mention of it.
---
I want to see the time machine in action.
---
Everything was frozen but I could still hear the grunts, and swung at them according to the audio and killed a couple.
---
Seen plenty of bone clubs on the raider vendors, but never even heard of a bone hammer until now!
---
Just looked it up and they're actually a pretty nice pick for a few reasons. Would also love to know where I can reliably get one/some!
---
The glow had me cracking up. So good
---
That must be it.  There are caches at silos, and if a player on the server has launched a nuke, one of these caches will have an additional holotape...
---
Did you take a Rad-X? It suppresses the effects of mutations.
---
Happened to me on my two shot dragon, fun stuff
---
Hahaha does the fire traps not count for a bounty for OP?
---
He sure does! He just started a new series on a new server with VintageBeef and plenty of other guys. It’s a server with a very fleshed out Pokemon mod. Etho started out with Froakie (thing I got that name right, all I know is he eventually evolves to Greninja). I don’t watch him as often, but he’s still good old Etho.
---
Yikes. Child alert. I think you misunderstood where I took the whole conversation to so let me make it clear.
---
  "Maybe they should stop selling Beta period. When you sell a game in Beta to players, most of these players don't do what beta is intended for. " was what I said. Notice how I steered the conversation towards paid Betas being a issue? You claimed to have bought the Beta, which is part of the problem. You paid for a beta and did not do what you're suppose to do in a Beta. How many other people followed suit? Too many to count is my bet. It's a shitty design that's being used as a cash grab the people fall for time and time again. It does not excuse the game being in the state it was in when it was launched. I'm sorry that you have gotten into a rage over this and can't have a normal discussion.
---
I killed the queen about 30 mins ago on ps4.  Very bad fps, (outside radiation zone) and she dropped a 1* nocturnal war drum and explosive vents...I feel violated.
---
Oh, I always thought it was more creatures as well. That is actually kinda disappointing....
---
I keep seeing addictol thinking it is jet.  I keep being disappointed.
---
Getting plastic can suck sometimes, i agree. But as long as u hit the normal 3 spots, craft with ammosmith and super duper, its still not that bad. Just randomly collecting plastic, then hit those spots at least once a play session, you should have enough. 
---
This is amazing xD
---
Good times my friend.  Been hearing a lot of players absolutely loos their shyt when they see CAMPS at Whitespring for some reason.  Glad to hear it ain’t everyone.
---
Han, I use perk loadout mod. It's the bees knees.
---
&gt; EVERY top ten worst games list has Fallout 76 at the top, along with a diatribe that just says it's a bad game without going into why it's a bad game, even if other games on the list were objectively *worse*. 
---
Well if they went into "Why" it would be still be a bad game and it has well deserved its place on top of the lists. 
---
Would you care to share because im terrible at code breaking ive been at this for like 4 hours
---
Good for you. I wholeheartedly agree.
---
95% of the people in this sub are just proper cunts anyway.
---
Did you find the Teddy Bear “Cooks in the Camper”?
---
I haven't found buffout plans yet man :(
---
You see that ski resort over there?
---
You can climb it.
---
Amen.
---
Can’t remember exactly where it was or if it will always spawn but I came across a group of dead cultists that all had the unobtainable masks (both variants) in the mire. It was on that long main road I think, under an overpass. Hope that helps!
---
TBH I find it more convinient to just buy ammo from people.. So many melee people have ammo they don't need or want anyway, and people have a lot of shotgun shells!
---
Thank you 
---
Cool. Sounds like it might be a random spawn event but I will check it out. Thanks. 
---
I dislike the thought of those camps because they pull the spawns and others who are there don't get a chance to kill them.
---
The spawns appear because those people went there.   Thus, they are "for" those people not for the CAMP.   I would be pissed if I spent that 18 caps to travel there to look for a few legendaries to replace the normal armors and found out the CAMP took out the group that spawned when you arrive.
---
I go there once a day to try and replace my normal leather armor I still have with legendary leathers.
---
I carry around a daisycutter and two mini nukes for clearing out a camp if this happens to me.   A friend will get the bounty from my character so don't really have to worry about that.
---
Or I can do the orbital drop grenade thing where I go wack a wall and stand there and die and drop the orbital.   That might be a better solution that lugging around 7 lbs with two mininukes.
---
I've ran into quite a few references actually, from Teddy bears wearing gas masks near chem stations in Breaking Bad style please to things like what you've found here. I get a little chuckle everytime i find one
---
I actually lured my Fallout 76 buddies to The Forest by telling them that they could actually build full, intricate, functional bases that they can construct with their friends AND persistent servers so they can build up communities, and also the enemy AI is smart enough to run and get help when attacked, generate and follow logical patrol routes using in-game constructed markers, and even spontaneously mourn their dead at appropriate times. So... all things that are completely lacking in FO76, basically.  
---
Plus, while there are some hilarious bugs (who among us Forest players HASN'T been catapulted 30 feet into the air because we tried to interact with a log sled at a weird angle?), it's a team of like four people with a tiny budget making this game, not a AAA studio.  
---
Also, turtle shell sleds, ziplines, and hang gliders. I'll trade all the Fallout 76 nukes in the world for a good hang gliding session.
---
I had similar situation.  Was doing the AWOL Armaments and had 1 wave of Gutsies out (about 8) and a SB flew overhead and started attacking them.    (4 Gutsies on that side).   Those 4 robots had taken 10% off the SB and then it flew out of range for a bit.  I engaged the Gutsies and found only 1 survived and it was half health. One of the dead ones was a legendary and no loot or xp.  &lt;cry&gt;.  
---
Gutsies seem to have 100% armor penetration VS players Legendary mod.
---
I found it at the grafton vendors sometime between lvl 15 and 20, think it still showed up at 22 but at a lesser rate.
---
Yeah, a mod. But nothing IN GAME, that lets you do it. Which sucks and is risky, cause of whatever system bgs is using to ban people with modded clients.
---
🤝👍 If a nuke comes, I’ll server hop so my motel restaurant gets zero damage haha 😆 
---
Skipping the main quest until 50 has an added benefit that all the quest rewards are level 50.  They're not great, but at least they're max level. 
---
yes i had that at my CAMP.  and then they magically disappeared.  the missile launchers were gone, the wires were still there, the spotlight still there...all forms of turrets gone.   it wasnt until i moved and went into storage and scrapped every single item they came back under storage.  weird bug.  now i have 1 turret to protect an often attacked wall by scorched.  thats it.  im not worried so much about other players.  it wouldn't stop them anyway.
---
i also have the unscrappable industrial water purifier still in my camp - in case anyone is curious, moving and scrapping every single thing and deleting blueprints does NOT fix that issue as suggested by B.
---
Last two times I killed the Queen she dropped two 3 stars, other stuff, and plans for ultracite armor, did you check your plans goblintactics? That I guess, is the real point, the next PA. Although all it does it make ballistic DR a bit higher, whilst dropping the other two a bit lower.
---
I have 2 and the jetpack on my X01, so they do exist.  But I had to buy them from another player, who was trading with a friend.  As they spoke he mentioned mods, my friend was looking for Serums, but he didn't like the price.  So i jumped in and bought them when they finished.  Like you I check the bunker but never see them.  I suppose people just always buy before I get there or it's a rare plan.  Hope you have some luck soon.
---
If were on a team, logged off before Nuke hit, and then rejoined that server by joining your friend... will your CAMP be in the Nuke Zone?
---
That's why you store all your ammo in the trunk.
---
There are 3 nukes in fallout 76...just like there are 3 Words in every Dragon Shout.
---
The strongest armor in the game is made from the "bones" of the strongest creatures in game.
---
What Does it scrap? Should give you a hint - if no PA is mentioned in titel of the amour teen it´s for  the excavator
---
Ultracite PA I meant
---
+karma for being a great guy.
---
I never watched Breaking Bad ... but I know the scene. I think nearly everyone does! haha
---
Can I hit you up for some twisted muscles/talons sometime?
---
You see, I'd take the loot 
---
That took three years btw...
---
Its so dang useful i couldn't go without it now lol.
---
One exception I would say is Tesla Rifle. It is not good for killing enemies but it is good for “tagging” them in areas like nuked Whitespring or Prime Fissure so you can still get exp when others kill them.
---
You can respec your points when you lvl after hitting lvl50.
---
The Proper People an urbex channel on Youtube did a video on it, I was watching it yesterday pretty funny to find a post about it today.
---
[Blue Dream Urbex](https://youtu.be/03yLySD8jOg) 
---
Can't remember what it scraps into and I'm at work and can't check. I did check the excavator armour but I probably just missed it as I was rushing. 
---
No big deal, was 'only' 400 odd caps from a vendor, I'll get the back with in the next century.
---
And once it was apparent it should have been stopped if they wanted to preserve any semblance of an in game economy. 
---
People will always look for an advantage. Saying "oh but you just shouldn't" isn't much stronger than saying "but they left it in!" but expecting people to just "not" has never worked. Otherwise we wouldn't have police and laws. 
---
Honestly the current hang-the-server exploit is quite obviously an exploit but the earlier put stuff in a chest and magically one appears again isn't too different from the Perk you can unlock which magically gives you a whole new whatever you are creating. How can you tell the difference between a benign bug, exploit or feature? 
---
I'm just incredulous they shipped the game like this. This is what alpha and beta testing is for. I'm also quite incredulous of the level of effort exploiters will go to! 
---
Maybe because I have zero interest in RPing a trader but I honestly don't care about people with duped TSE guns. I've never needed to buy anything from a vendor bot. Sure I *have* but in the 90 levels I have played I haven't *needed* to.  Atom provides. I don't think there was ever going to be much of an in game economy. 
---
I'm curious to see if the Jan patch actually patches anything. 
---
Never seen anyone mention rubber banding in F76.
---
this, the radiation in that electric fiels is insane.
---
Really makes you wonder if the guy actually made it work, because something is definitely going on with that thing 
---
Explosive Vents are leg mods.  I thought they were torso mods when I got mine.
---
I drop them in baggies inside of stations in lower level areas. Like Sutton and the one near Poseidon energy sometimes even in flatwoods if I see a lower level around.
---
no?? 😂😂 where is that
---
Haha, right? Only problem is, the markers aren't exact and things are all labelled. TRying to sort through everything to see bobbleheads that aren't at marked locations is a chore. But a chore I'm willing to do for that camp spot.
---
Is it supposed to look like the huge one in the middle of the Ash Heap that you can see on the map or is there another one? Because this looks NOTHING like the big one in the Ash Heap, for starters it's missing the huge tower at the base.
---
It's player instanced lists, if I view that vendors list same time as you I will see something different, except player sold items which we will both see.. So no, it's not that someone bought it, it just wasn't your turn for it given the odds mechanic they use
---
Obligatory Bagger 288 reference: https://youtu.be/azEvfD4C6ow
---
I stopped playing because of the bluescreening issues. I can't play for 15 min without crashing. 
---
Had another oddity, got mods I already had learned from blueprints. Seems like that doesn't flag them properly... *sigh*
---
People blow up Whitesprings camps, that's just something that happens. If you have turrets aggroing the mobs, someone will come for your camp
---
I use a hazmat suit in nuke zones and don’t die. I have a regular pump shotgun plus a 2-star mole miner’s gauntlet. The first cripples them so they just hobble around and the second kills them so I don’t waste bullets. I may hop on cars or whatnot if they rush me but really the enemies just don’t seem hard to me.
---
I used to crash a lot too, but then I threw away all my notes and holotapes that I don't really need (except for some funny/interesting ones) and now I barely ever crash.
---
Want them to say it. You sound like this crazy girlfriend i had once.
---
Will it attack people on your team? Or randos that show up?
---
My favorite is when we get the queen down to 1/4 health and the server drops me...and by the time i reconnect to my team part she has just hit the ground dead...and the server doesn't remember any of the damage you did so you get nothing.  :(    
---
And the last two watoga fissure site nuke zones I went to, no queen ever spawned at all.   Xbox   
---
How people are playing this game still boggles my brain. Yes the game did not deserve all the hate. Yes I sunk about 300 hours into it.
---
Is it a game I can keep coming back to over and over again like Rust, which I have sunk 3000 hours into?
---
How can anyone be so enamoured with the game’s world after this much time? Even IF they fix the game, even IF they add NPCs, what’s the point?
---
Do you really want to go back to old locations after they are fixed or have npcs?
---
It’s time to move on.
---
Does this work wile the 'guests' have the healing factor mutation?
---
I didn’t notice levels but I know  Vendor Wallace and the two at Watoga usually have the better plans 
---
Will be online tonight app 7 pm CET - PSN: Frank1971 - Need only field medic, but will assist you with good grief
---
I have built a Camp where you can fall from without amour and then need to be revived... very easy... 
---
It depends on whether or not you use Tesla Coils on power armor or the Electrically Charged mutation. If you do it's completely worthless to you since the instant you get close to an enemy you'd do a sliver of health negating Instigating's effect. If you don't it's an amazing roll along with Bloodied and Swing Speed.
---
It also removes what's left of living with decisions in today's games. Pick something and work with it. I hate that people want games to cater to player's need to be super overpowered.
---
Happened with my .44 two shot revolver. 
---
Did not know what triggered it though.
---
Do you people have this as a canned response? YoU mUsT hAvE 20 MiNuTeS oF GaMePlaY.
---
No i have a 50 level character and i deeply regret it since im not a masochist.
---
Quality is horrendous for me (PS4) worse and worse every patch. I turned on my game after 2 weeks off and crashed within 10 minutes. I'm done with this trash for now. 
---
Eyeballs are tasty
---
Pity trap doors arent a thing.
---
I used the guide to find him. Just took a dozen hops. Got him to spawn twice first time he died while I was holding him second time he vanished while waiting for people.
---
are you a potato
---
I'll add you, but not sure if I'll be online at 7pm CET or some time later. 
---
My buddy that always runs in excavator armor found the jet pack mod for me the first time at the Enclave Command center sales terminal.  We run a full team and he's the only one that saw it for sale.  
---
I found him some cool excavator armor mods while wearing my X01.   I do tend to get more X01 headlamp mod options while wearing my X01 at the vendor vs when I have on no power armor.  Coincidence?
---
Then again...team of 4...all over 100 hours of game play and none of us have found lvl 50 T60 left arm or a T51 right leg.  LOL  The random is very strange indeed!
---
You and me both my friend. My apologies for being stupid hahah I misinterpreted your post
---
Missile turrets are the worst. Will gladly incur bounty to destroy some annoying twats missile turret camp sitting at the back of the golf club. It’s laggy and loud AF with a bunch of those going off endlessly for absolutely no reason. 
---
Murphy’s Law: ‘If the server can crash it will crash.’
---
How many caps?
---
3k?
---
That's a good idea! Thanks!
---
This looks sooooo cool, it's just brightened my day up at work 
---
That's true. I've got a quad one I use for tagging.  It also has ridiculous durability. Need something to tag quickly before the jerks come in with their TSE shotties and kill everything.
---
I still find it weird that it's classified as a heavy weapon, but benefits from rifleman. 
---
Jex is correct hopefully they have some planned balances to go along with the bug fixes soon.
---
Especially if all I was offered was Atoms. I'd wash my hands with FO online and probably Bethesda for a couple of releases. 
---
Happened to me once and it was horrible. Couldn't run fast or jump high, how do people live like this.
---
On the plus side it means I get to sell all the Rad-x i find to get or some caps from now on!
---
Use a powered door that doesn't have an inside connection.
---
Maybe not a cave, but there is that crevice with the bonfire to the SW of The Palace?
---
You just gotta put it on a flat ceiling, not angled. So annoying, if they'd made it a bit lower hanging it would spin on angled. 
---
We’ll see... hopefully as it is 1 out of 2 trophies I’m missing... will probably be online for 1-2 hours...
---
There was NOTHING stopping you playing the game without power leveling. That's on you. 
---
I only skimp read through this, but I have heard a lot about it. I haven't heard anyone say yet, it is both their faults (Bethesda &amp; Exploiters). I did see one comment that said 'The dupers are purposely crashing the servers', this is perhaps paradoxical. Say 'Sam' buys a TSE and gets on a server to use it, he will be victim of the disconnects, and instability that the process that enabled him to have the TSE, caused. If that is indeed the cause of the server instability, which it probably is. The dupers do not want to play the game, they want to make money. They sell to those whom, do, want to play the game, but will barely be able to, because of those who are crashing the game, to sell to those who want to play the game. IF, the dupers crash the game completely, they will completely have no market. Until the next fuck up on another game. So, now I get it. And yes, I do realise that that I did not reintroduce 'Sam'.
---
I agree. Most bases at Whitespring are not for "tactical rally point", but a lazy way of camping the golf club. Beth need to make it less popular as it's becoming number 1 base spot on the entire map.
---
Get a third one lol.
---
Sorry, dad joke....
---
And the half room extenders with cloth windows! 
---
It's been a while since I did this but the last time I did it I could loot anything my turrets tagged. So as long as I return semi frequently to loot I did benefit from it.
---
Don’t forget most of the community. They hate duppers and are quick to assume everyone is a dupper then turn around and only use dup guns and the people who did work really hard to get just a decent legendary is just laughed at or mocked for it not being “god tier”
---
To me it's a pretty boring place to build a base, get a bit more creative and use the natural landscape to build something much more interesting 
---
You do get your budget back if it dies but its unlikely it would if you moved.
---
Good question though, what creature do you have tamed? Depending on what you have it might be hostile enough for robots to kill it for you. 
---
Im approaching 550 hours played. I barely swap servers at all anymore. Theres always more stuff to kill around the world. Only really swap if the post blast zone starts spawning random enemies instead of ghouls.
---
You gotta ask why you're playing. The only times i've server hopped extensively was to get mutations and in the first couple weeks when whitesprings cap stashes where insane. 
---
Play long enough and you'll get everything, play fast enough and you can move on to the next new game after burning out.
---
I like the game.  Sorry you don't enjoy it.  It has flaws,  yes.  But I like the game.  
---
For quite a while I had a camp overlooking Silo C, not far from Site Charlie. Anytime I'd see someone at Charlie, I'd head on back to camp and watch the Nuke launch. 
---
From my Camp I could also watch it detonate if it hit Whitespring or Watoga too.
---
Sort of. It appears to be a bug when it doesn't let you apply the mod. I came to that conclusion because I've been able to apply several different mods since then without issue by going to the armor/weapon workbench and selecting the mod. Just did that yesterday with a "polished" mod for some robot chest armor.
---
Dude I've gotten this error more than 75 times now. I've refomatted my drive. Reinstalled 76. Called support, everything. Bethesda is saying my damn PS4 must be broken. While all my other games play just fine. 600+ hours in Monster Hunter World and I've never had a single crash. Bethesda can go F themselves. I'm done for now. But can't wait for them to get there shit together an fix this game. 
---
Orbital Strike Grenades are a LOT more fun.
---
These bases dont do shit but steal kills for no ones benefit.
---
Because it’s laggy to have a shit ton of turrets when spawning in. It’s loud AF to have a bunch of missile turrets shooting ghouls that the player is getting nothing for anyways, and it ruins the spawn for that server hop most likely. Happily destroying stupid turret bases behind golf club now. Low level player trying to level up? Go play the game. 
---
Did you manage to find anything?
---
I may have another look down there tonight and see if I can grab a screen shot of the bomb.
---
It may load in different areas each time the server loads 
---
Crawling but still able to use their head laser.
---
a level 15 instigating multipurpose axe carried me until level 50 so yeah
---
\*UPDATE\*
---
Just found 5 of them, they cap at level 45, differing durabilities but all sold by the vendorbot in the Top of the World Resort (the one inside the wooden building - near the pie machine)!
---
It needs some server hops to reroll his inventory but it is obtainable from there at least.
---
IDK
---
Agreed
---
Myself an my team-mates are very peaceful guys. But two things we won;t put up with at a Nuked Whitespring. We all run in Pacifist mode but will remove it for one of those turret towers pulling all the ghouls towards the back of the club house. Then we'll cheerfully destroy the turrets so we can focus on killing the ghouls. 
---
Second, if you are running around with a really powerful TSE and one-shotting the ghouls, we WILL block you and keep getting in your way until you either blow yourself up, switch to a more "sharing" weapon or piss off.
---
We all run with low damage melee and make sure we all get a hit on each enemy and save room for any others in the area. 
---
Just an opinion here those who play the spec more may know better.  You may want to have Modern Renagade to swap in with Action Boy early on.  I find it useful when vats runs out and the enemy has just a sliver of health.
---
Outside of nuked zones you may want to use cracked shot instead of the glowing damage bonus.
---
Damn. Saw that shit on r/choosing beggars. Gotta see the comments
---
I used to live just a few km away from that thing. It's much more impressive when you see it close up. 
---
Drops are not dependent on your characters luck, so yeah not sure why you think you have to have High luck for good drops, heck I have 3 luck and have pulled 3\* legendaries from every 3\* legendary creature ive killed.
---
You lost me at ‘My Thoughts’ 
---
For one TL;DR
---
Secondly, sorry, really don’t care what you think of the game
---
Thirdly, yawn, another ‘I have an opinion post’
---
Good idea on the food I forgot about those. I"m assuming they all stack in including mama dolces food.
---
LOL!  this kind of bug i can appreciate! :)  
---
cl highlights live actors and corpses. Sooooo yes, just not the the level you want. But too much for some. 
---
Yeah I guess whitepsrings nuked is about the best spot. I'm on PC sorry.
---
You can learn chest mods from arms and legs. I build all arms and scrap them to learn mods and learn arm, leg, and chest mods all the time from arms.
---
I'm only saying so because there are a couple of fixes around for things. I think there's an ini file edit for crashes from memory. I'll Google it myself and edit it here
---
250 hours? Pfft, filthy casual.
---
Just kidding, but am way past double that. I am *really* hooked on this game lol.
---
What happened?
---
I like how your user trial and error to build it.
---
I'm surprised people still build there considering your base is probably gonna get nuked eventually. I got sick of people/enemies so I built up on a mountain away from everyone and everything.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/adrn4b/well_look_what_i_found_browsing_on_new/?st=JQNO1BMG&amp;sh=23a7e582
---
I could. But my TSE, stacked Perk deck and number of upgrade points would rob it of any meaning or any fun. Rolling low level newbs for junk I don't need is pointless it isn't "raiding". 
---
Well, the question is, how many explosive boobleheads you have.
---
Agreed. Farther out in the golf course, fine, it's a great place to build because of the flat open space. But anywhere close to the buildings full of ghouls and you're just being annoying to the other players. The sheer number of Camps I've seen in the exact same spot on the river 🤦
---
This is what I’m doing now with my second char. Made it to Wallace yesterday, level 15 and also got the handmade and brick walls. 
---
Currently building and scrapping handmades for the mods. So many screws!
---
I stumbled on it during BETA but for life of me can’t remember where.  It was two bears wearing gas masks on a counter strew with all kinds of beakers and a Chemistry Bench nearby inside a broken down Camper home.
---
With rifleman or not, it still does so little damage basically made it only viable for tagging ahahhah
---
His "camp" where he crafts "juice concentrate"
---
I'm talking about both weapons being explosive, unbuffed starting damage. I'm not a duper or cheater so I have no bobbleheads, they would effect both weapons anyway.
---
5 Queens earlier.  Crashed about 10 times.  2 of which I never got the end reward and loot. 😪
---
They need to fix this.  Also the stash box crashes.  It's getting to breaking point worth this game.
---
My first and second SBQ fights finished with a solid 5 minute spinning circle of "you're not going to get any loot" before the body disappeared.
---
I gotta call BS here.  I have never had a problem farming the area when a CAMP was behind the Club.  I’ve also never once spawned or walked into Whitespring without huge lag spikes even when no one else was around.  I’m not saying shyt don’t lag more when other players are around but that’s just it, it lags for so many reasons that singling out someone’s CAMP is more about that “Go play the game” part at the end then anything else.  
---
Why so many quotation marks? They are named The Scorched, no need to call them "Scorched". Really ruins the reading.
---
Has its benefits, anyone in nuke zone and having a friendly base close by, specially if they have rad shower can save time, or anyone running low on water for health can get a quick fix. Scrap items fast or bulk. 
---
Make sure to have 3 points in CHA so you can force your party to equip it and even the lvl 1 will make nuke zone radiation negligible if everyone is in power armor.
---
Get another friend to share Ghoulish lvl 1 and you'll be constantly regenerating as well.
---
What economy?
---
 Not a game that was released a year too early? It simply wasn't ready 
---
I would settle for that those little single rail cars to function on the train tracks.  I have seem a few of them around the train stops when going to see the vendor.   Put some see-saw rocking thingies on it and let our characters "fast travel" between stations.   Make them go fast like a roller coaster and not require caps to travel to the next station in line.   (Unless track is broken, then have it crash :)
---
This is exactly what I do and why I welcome them.
---
give me a second lemme re enter the game, sit tight
---
Did you find the Back-To-The-Future reference in the one near Bog Town?
---
I've found 4 two shots, and 3 explosive guns. Didn't find any till I hit 150. Got my explosives from heart of the swamp and irrational fear events. The double shots all came from the whitespring ghoul farm fest. No Tse's yet. 
---
Yeah.  I never crash, but I do not keep holo/notes.  Only ones I keep are the ones required for the daily.  I think there is a holo or something for the "Kill Windigo Wearing Clown Outfit".   But I dont think its required, it just changes the quest pointer to go away from the rusted door to point to the Windigo Cave.
---
And a Fatman that heals the enemy
---
If you had over 50 i belive there will be not much difference.
---
Now lets talk, i readed that Two shot is not 100% damage buff, but more like 60%. And blodied gives 5% damage per 5%hps = 95% + nerdrage.  So even if twoshot was 100% Bloodied is stronger, also weapon break slower, but you have to have super low hps.
---
I don't do it purposely, only if the servers disconnect or the game crashes, and when I join a friend.
---
Okay then I have the same kind of setup.
---
I was wondering if I missed something about giving people cooked stuff. :-)
---
The last couple of days on PC have been trash for me, 20-30 minute disconnects without fail. But today I was on for ages, and finally got to experience what they probably intended, I had two workshops that I defended about 5 times, and did a nuke zone and got some of my first stable flux. I really hope they get this together, because it really is a good game.
---
First of all, this is amazing.
---
Sorry for my bad english but you can try to automate it if you want with a poweres door wit the code to opening it on neon top of it, so people can open the door, get inside and it automatically closes after a few seconds.
---
Then you have to place a pressure siwtch or a laser detector in order to activate de flamers.
---
Just an idea to imporve an already amazing design.
---
If you dont have those plans I can craft the items for you on pc.
---
Because all the content is explored by me already. Thats why. Give me Content.
---
The best one of these I've ever seen is this guys:

I don't want to spoil the details, just if you ever see this guys house by the Overseers Camp...stop by and follow the instructions on the door   :D
---
Im resolute until level 50. Then its swapping time
---
Nope just just pointing out that there games with same content or more with less cost since someone thinks you cant get a $20 game to beat fallout.
---
This is so beautiful! That is the true spirit of the wastelands! I admire your ingenuity and dedication!
---
I have a nocturnal damage increases at night and also increases with each consecutive hit. 
---
  Have not had for long but I like it.
---
Do you mean the Ritual Mask from Lucky hole mine/Mothman Museum ?
---
I think he wants to level up using duped mats to make stims for coming.   Nobody wants stimpack recipes that bad. 
---
Awesome, thank you for the reply! I only have a bloodied explosive Gauss rifle and I wanted a two shot but now I don't lol

it says i am talking. my mic is working.. do u have discord?

[Well, the Top of the World is a real place in West Virginia...](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1&amp;q=top+of+the+world+west+virginia)
---
Not in the game yet. They got it from the dev room.
---
And before you ask no, you can't get into the dev room legit nor are you supposed to know about the dev room
---
No I already got that. 
---
my discord is sigh.cropper

https://discord.gg/Z4mGHee
---
Oh that sucks rip 
---
https://discord.gg/Z4mGHee join in here it’s a fallout server. for some reason i can’t add people or people can’t find me 
---
Nope I am on 100Mbps fibreop.
---
Maybe have it treat other players that turn red as normal enemies and not need to manually change it (xbox) would be nice.  Its only happened twice but both times some random killed me I was just running along and ended up dead without returning fire of any sort &amp; passive on.
---
Second,  people are running around with passive on and hitting players trying to get them to fire back.  Then you end up wanted and they kill you without becoming wanted themselves.  This type of player is why we now lock our CAMP doors.  had never locked them before but its super annoying to have randoms trying to PVP, have passive on and just come in and no damage attack you while you're on a workbench for 15 minutes.  At least if they pick the lock they become wanted.  \*sigh\*  Sorry other wastelanders, Ive put a stash box on the front porch for you but no longer full free access to camp for this reason.  
---
All good, I usually have 3 stoves so no one is waiting. And a stash box outside so ppl can make quick deposits so they don’t become over encumbered. That area in white springs can over load u fast when they come out lol 😆 
---
I mean, unless you're building a gun specifically for Fissure Prime runs 🤷 which is kinda the whole idea behind the Prime Receivers too
---
Great job! I don't have a Yahoo account otherwise you'd have a new follower. :-)
---
It’s less my character and the enemies looking like they’re teleporting around and when I hit them it’s not registered.
---
I change my perk loadout based on the situation. One loadout might be for farming resources another for launching a nuke. Even being in a nuke zone has a different loadout between whitespring and SBQ. For example you won’t need lock picking skills when fighting SBQ but you might need tank killer. 
---
Except for when I saw it posted on fb I was like, That looks familiar. Oh yeah, stupid Fallout. So yeah, it looks SOMETHING like the big one in the Ash Heap. 
---
Two shot also does weird things to accuracy!
---
Congrats. I had been looking for the Quantum Grenade plans as well, *and* the Barn set. Logged on to do some stuff. Like gather some fusion cores. I know there's two at the one end of the bridge. When I go there, and also start gather junk, in a toolcase are the barn plans. Go into the other room to get junk, in the toolbox are the grenade plans! 
---
Yay me! Now I finally have all the building plans!
---
Time for another camp rebuild!
---
This makes me wonder what a wildlife photography game would be like, like hunter called of the wild but instead of a rifle you have a canon
---
once u have ur stuff on th card u scan it, follow me and do as i do
---
ABC greenlit it and already sold it to Fox because the cow supported trump 
---
Yeah I guess.. But you lose out on hardened reciever, so I'm not even sure the damage is worth it.. Also, having a gun JUST for that isnt really needed, but to each their own..
---
&gt; 2: After you go up the stairs to the command center, there's a hot plate (screws/circuitry) on the right-hand side next to a coffee pot. Sometimes a Nuka Cola Quantum will spawn, which feels very rewarding.
---
This is on the left hand side by the way.
---
Getting a second ps4 so my wife and i could play games like this, ff14, etc. together turned out to be a really great investment. Sharing interest in a game is great, but actually playing it together, instead of taking turns watching each other play, is way better.
---
when you went on computer put fabricate, and if it says fail, make sure u cleaned the card by scanning it next to computer
---
I know right!? I spent forever building my dread fort on the edge of a cliff in the ashen heap and now I want to tear it down and build somewhere with some traffic.
---
Even just a "Most Recently Added" sort option would be nice lol
---
Oh yeah, I've definitely noticed missing 90% of vats shots even though it said I had 95% chance to hit with my two shot lever action, only when putting a night vision scope on it did it start hitting anything.
---
Most bluescreen crash happens during trading, moving things in or out of stashbox. That’s my experience. 
---
And here I thought there's no way that's a real thing 
---
Welp, time to go hunting for Vault 63 somewhere in a mysterious cave!
---
No, just one or the other. Bloodied if you play a Bloodied build, Instigating if you don't. Anti-Armor is also solid though.
---
I laughed way to hard at this, for some reason memories on the barrens just came flooding back \*shiver\*
---
I have bought so many Plans or been given some by friends, my head spins when trying to work out what plan unlocked a particular item.  I find it easiest to say where is the table is typically in the game.  If its just in houses then it's Harper's Ferry, Watoga or a Workshop Event.  I am not on my Xbox till later to check any tables I am missing.  But I think it's only the well worn and if it is I would bet it's a workshop defence.
---
Ok so you created an in game saw trap and that’s fucking awesome 
---
cant wait to see your next evil plans!
---
(Starts Slow Clap) Well Played 
---
He passed the test. OP needs to give out cultist robes and masks to anyone that survives the murder church.
---
I crash while crafting, I crash while talking to vendors, I crash just randomly walking around, I crash in nuke zones. I crash and then stuck in bluescreen loops, I've crashed so hard my game deleted itself. It's bad. I've quit playing. I'm really enjoying Warframe right now. 
---
Honestly? I'd say a Instigating Explosive Double Barrel with -15% reload speed. Its damage output is massive despite not being a 2 shot, and on top of that, it doesn't have the accuracy debuff that two shots have. The spread is insanely tight on it. And even without shotgun damage perks. You'll be hitting 500 damage+ a shot with bloody mess anad demolitionist alone.
---
Is Nocturnal and Furious even possible on the same weapon? I think they're both 1st tier properties 🤔
---
A Vault Dweller.  How Novel.
---
No! I'm a grumpy gamer boy with gamer boy principles. I don't like this game, so no one should enjoy it and anything involved with it! Anything to the contrary deserves nothing but my upmost contempt and rage! These values hold my fragile personality together, so I'm not going to use my normal social reasoning skills when anything is related!
---
If you don’t like it go to GameStop and get you $2 if not stop complaining. You’re excessive use of quotations is cringe af lol if you don’t like the game, return it. No one is forcing you to play so get over yourself 
---
If the server isn't overloaded from a nuke drop typically get a few hours before a DC.  Of late also seeing an idicator, mostly stutters, a while before a dc.  At a guess it's dupers winding up and bogging the server.
---
As for dc after cap, I'm typically burning time since a defense event tends to pop a couple minutes after initial cap.
---
Hey op I was wondering if there’s any chance we could get an inside view? As if you’re the one burning up? It wounds me that I don’t have xbox so I’ll never experience this amazing creation
---
 The trade/theft "bug" is the source of their fear. 
---
Then why bother in the first place? The new materials system is such an improvement to crafting that it makes perfect sense for repairing as well.
---
Gotta swap those repair/build cost cards man.

Fix it Good

I would have thought it would be common.  I've only come across a few non-trivial constructs at workshops though.
---
My momma
---
Hurry?  The game's been out 2 months now.  If the only way to get a mod or recipe is server hopping at a vendor I would never otherwise need to go to then I'll do what I must to get it and not rely on a super small chance for it to appear on the rare occasion I do actually go there.  Don't criticize the players, it's just bad design that the only realistic way to get certain rewards is server hopping.
---
Apology accepted.
---
Do CAMP traps deal slap damage? I know that turrets deal so little damage outside of confirmed pvp that the sun would burn out before they kill you
---
You make very good points in terms of perk card swapping for maximum benefit. The only ones I swap are intelligence for crafting or pusing power armour, and charisma for solo/team.
---
A useful idea would be when you enter the green area of your camp, your whole build swaps to a camp build with all crafting cards, less food and hunger, super duper, and so on. Just all the stuff useful for at the camp that I don't need equipped in the actual wilderness.
---
I think this is a server side issue, I have noticed it on PC recently, was fine up until last couple of days, but only happened 2 or 3 times for me.
---
I would love skins for it. They could make some pretty unique one for it to.
---
Based on the size of it they could make like a tank color skin for it or Even a skin color based on the loader from aliens would be cool
---
I saw a rather elaborate C.A.M.P up there once at the copper deposit. Tried to take a picture, but the game crashed. 
---
As a higher leveled player i'm not sure what it is people want when they do the trade emote. I usually ask over area chat if they need anything and get no response and more of the emote. Honestly, I don't think I feel okay allowing someone rummage though my entire inventory. I would rather just give them stuff if they were in a bind. The crouching around can mean a lot of things but is probably curiosity and friendly. 
---
Lol this was funny 😁 
---
It's about sending a message
---
Wait What? I can make them but don’t ever remember picking up the plans.
---
FUCKED UP
---
fk the low elos.  
---
I take the effort on me, to launch a nuke, and all those parasites crawl out of their nub corners, ok.   
---
THEN insisting on slowing down my grind for them?   
---
get the fock out of my nuke zone, monkeys.
---
yeah, maybe so.  we have a couple of team members that dont run with pacifist until group farming situations.  if they forget to turn it on then it could become a problem for everyone on the team.  i think you have it right.
---
Awww, thank you! Any suggestions on a better site to host the photos on? I was gonna start a tumblr for it but that seemed like climbing on a sinking ship.
---
My game froze and disconnected when the Queen was at like 30% for us. It could always be worse 
---
Go for calibrated shocks x2 for the legs, it gives you an 50 extra carry weight per leg and combined with the excavator base boost of 100 gives you +200 and since the excavator doesn't have a Jetpack mod use the emergency protocol 25% extra speed and 50% damage reduction while under 20% health for the torso, it goes well with the adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage perk. But if that is not your style go for the medic pump for auto stimpacks or motion-assist servos for +2 strength. For the arms optimized bracers gives you a reduction of ap on power attacks. Lastly, for the helmet the targeting HUD is useful in prime nuke zones since enemies are hard to see and with this mod they glow red.
---
Sorry, but it's the best rifle out there.  Not "only because it's rare."  Other types of rifles aren't really viable lol
---
I don’t regret it 
---
Absolutely! I'm sure heaps of people would actually find that way more enjoyable. Photos make great trophies! 
---
I like to change things up so nah I kinda have to move my cards around. I got myself a handheld rifle that does more damage with less health, so I’ve swapped some cards to give me more benefits when I’m at low health so it’s more worth it to use 
---
Praise be the Mothman!!!
---
Haha, yep. I did a laugh of astonishment when it went off, and said ‘what? Really?’ 
---
I kind of agree with Op or at least partly.
---
First of all: I didn’t buy 76, I saw the announcement from todd howard and knew this game is gonna be shit for me as I'm a single player who doesn’t have fun with mmos, online modes and coop (unless its offline coop with friends on the same couch).
---
If you would’ve informed yourselves many would have found out that this Game is nothing for them.
---
Why I still think it’s okay or even good to shit on bethesda so much? Because they deserve it!
---
Sorry op but I love the fallout franchise and if bethesda doesn’t learn now, fallout 5 will be even worse than fallout 4 which already was a casual-less rpg experience compared to fo3 or new vegas.
---
And thanks to 76 the next fallout won't be bought on release because bethesda fucked up bad and there have to be consequences.
---
And regarding the whataboutism:
---
Yeah rdr:O is shit too, but I didn’t play it. I only play the single player and that part was great!
---
So while you purchase 76 and get an empty game you get the best open world in rdr2 + a bad online mode.
---
Gta5: sure R* really screwed up with this one, no story dlcs because online makes more money is a dick move but at least (!!) you got a full sp experience.
---
Howard on the other hand advertised 76 in a Manner where he literally lied about this game being a full sp experience, sure you can play it alone... but the quests are designed for more than 1 player, no npcs, boring quests (storywise).
---
The only thing interesting in 76 is the world imo.
---
But without characters to interact with its useless to me.
---
Regarding the hate on the web and you beeing sick of it.. why do you care what a stranger has to say?
---
Don’t you have your very own opinion about the game? Everyone I know hated mass effect andromeda yet I still liked it and had fun with it, doesn’t change the fact that bioware/EA released an unfinished game which got rightfully its own backlash.
---
TL:DR
---
Bethesdas marketing and empty promises justify the hate they are getting, enjoy the game but if others don’t and want to say it so, let them. You can praise it if you want, you don’t have to listen to haters.
---
You set your best ones s a desktop background, or make a slideshow of your personal favorites, it could be really relaxing
---
The cap limit isnt high enough to justify the grind. You need literal hours of grinding to get it. 
---
There's a difference between instant gratification and giving yourself a realistic chance of obtaining something obscenely rare.  You would do well to learn that difference.
---
I also have a quad laser rifle, difference here is that the second effect of it is explosive. This is another problem with laser rifles, it shows only the energy damage on the card, not the damage from the explosive prefix. From testing with a splitter barrel, i can say the damage is fucking high. lol
---
Since this thing is pretty light even fully modded, i keep it around as a pvp weapon. The durability issue renders it pretty much useless in everyday scenarios. It only really shines in pvp, where it has high damage, high precision even with the splitter barrel (it´s pretty much sniper accurate) and amazing range. 
---
The BoS soldier in me wants to use it more, but i can´t because durability. :(
---
&gt;Even No Man's Sky didn't get this much obnoxious noise.
---
Well that's not necessarily true. It did get the same amount of noise on finding out the game was not what people expected. But also, the humdrum ended because it stopped at Hello Games releasing a mediocre game, and then going silent, and them being investigated by the ASA for their misleading steam page. They didn't add to this with a minor data leak, false advertising, strange customer service responses on top of lacking communication.
---
And Guess what? NMS also got placed in everyone's worst games list. And still to this day, they haven't fully recovered from it. People just gave it a pass and couldn't be bothered once it was fully reworked.
---
&gt;I just want to see one video where Bethesda is actually being acknowledged for making changes to the game. ONE.
---
I don't think you were looking hard enough. I saw one the other day.
---
[https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshots](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshots)  
---
I hate how limited the photo mode storage is so I also screenshot everything i take in photo mode :)  We take some pretty group photos but some of my favorite are of the body/armor glitches.  LONG BOI  LOL!
---
I just finished farming that vendor, it's true if the CAMP is too close to the spawn it seems to mess things up.  
---
I figured this out because I would often spawn onto a server where my CAMP could not be placed, and the player CAMP would be near the spawn, usually on the water right next to the spawn point.  When I would go to trigger the random event spawn on those servers, nothing would happen at all.
---
I am guessing it's not a 100% thing, probably just some quirk of the game.
---
I put mine a bit away just on the other side of the boat in the riverbed and that was far enough away to not mess with it, but I think you could be a bit closer than that, I'm just not 100% sure how close it can be before it causes problems.
---
Oh man, I finally (lvl 100) got my first TSE and it's an ultracite laser pistol, was hoping it would at least be useful if modded into a shotgun
---
Guess not! :(
---
Back to farming.
---
Not sure but my axe says increase damage at night and also increase with each consecutive hit. 
---
     Checked at night and damage increases by around a 100 on base. 
---
      Haven't checked it after using it though. 
---
   Could be wrong but almost 100% sure it is nocturnal.
---
You say that a solution is to wait and that it has nothing to do with rushing ... Seems contradictory.
---
I do live in Watoga.
---
As long as there's no turrets they won't mind.
---
Its a rare weapon drop from the event "Breach and Clear". Tho its not a reward for the event, so i assume its a potential drop in one of the containers, tho cant really tell u what the likely hood of the drop is. Also its the only event which gives that particular weapon from what I can see. So not Lode Bearing
---
Definitely, however it is strongly implied in 76 that they at least knew it was going to happen. Since they were preparing so heavily with the vaults, automating everything(mining, government,etc), and the threats to Sam Blackwell/free states.
---
Basically 76 paints the picture that the Enclave triggered the bombs to wipe away the rebelling population and start over to restore their control.
---
I'm on Xbox. Probably get banned for cheating if you try to fix the game. lol
---
I finally had enough and blasted one of those camps yesterday as well.  Orbital strike got me a 240 cap bounty.  Well worth it.  The odd thing is I had to actually ask 3 different people to kill me before one of them finally obliged.  Guess people don't like free caps lol
---
It's the players fault that he can't wait to find it and wants to have it now, immediately. 
---
It's simple. The power at the switch is routed to a pylon along with the door. That pylon loses its "ambient" sphere of energy, and the light goes out. 
---
Build your energy grid with more intent. Pylon attachments radiate power, make those sparse, interconnect them with switches. You can easily rig your CAMP with separate zones of power
---
Brilliant!
---
I don't really know, you could start an album on Imgur or Pinterest? Or make your own site where you can post pics and background stories.
---
Sorry I'm not much help :-)
---
My combat rifle did something similar after swapping weapons repeatedly during the scorchbeast queen fight. Got 600 something in the clip with almost no ammo in the reserves. That's one big magazine. 
---
One reliable spawns at the pleasant valley ski lodge or whatever by top of the world in the fortifications near the flame jets. On or under one of the bunk beds.
---
LEVEL 3 LEGENDARY SUPER MUTANT: After I killed him, he dropped "NOTHING", then disappeared: Pleasant Valley: Wasted tons of .50 Cal bullets (very expensive to make), 5.56, .45 this is to you Bethesda: F U
---
Ahha i want this please tell me do they have bloatfly loaf?.
---
Behold the man who played 17hours a day every single day since release as well as all beta. Woohoo.
---
just a little tip: the baggies despair much faster than world containers (5-15 minutes vs. 1-3 hours for world containers), so if you want a better shot at someone finding it, dumping it in a suitcase/trash can/whatever is a little better :)
---
There is a slight problem with that though, if you want to make the best in game pictures then your rig must also be able to handle that.
---
I'm playing on a potato for example with shadows to the lowest setting. And those low quality shadow are really ugly in this game.
---
There are no boring games, only boring people
---
This is awesome and you should probably see a therapist you sicko jk lol
---
&gt;The final iteration of the design pretty consistently lures players in.
---
I Don't know if it's me being more wary (smarter probably?) but every time i came across a camp with a tons of signs or wrinting to push me to get in it has Always sent a red flag for me. 
---
Why would anything would be trying so hard to get me in if it's not to dick me over?
---
Let alone the old empty room with bait at the end. This alone is a nope from me.
---
Given that it is in Flatwood i assume most of the players you trap are new ones not knowing any better, no ?
---
Anyway it's still fun to watch, good job. It's actually a good way to teach players to not trust anyone or any camp they see.
---
What platform I may have the plan?
---
Also wonder how Mirelurk Cake with Bloodleaf Aioli would even be in real life.
---
Was not easy finding the actual price you turd. I got mine June 20ish 2017 after the  FAITHFUL CARTOGRAPHER update. The price for summer sale was 13.99. [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/06/23/steam-summer-sale-our-giant-recommendations-list/](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/06/23/steam-summer-sale-our-giant-recommendations-list/) ( It would of been impossible to go off steam purchase history, picked it up with 20 other games.) So you was right about the pricing, apologies. But forgot the main story was locked out till release. Meaning a quarter of the content didn't release till Aug. 1, 2017.
---
Wow OK. So, since I stopped playing, they really have only done two parts to the story, revamped those two parts and that's it. Three got pushed back and I think it's suppose to go up to five chapters. Anyway, when I played it, it was well worth 30 bucks.
---
The sheep comment was related to my opinion on people that will go to any length to try an put down this game. It really felt like rock bottom trying to compare indie games and such to a AAA title. Seriously a guy was trying to compare Fallout 76 to a starwars mobile game. LIKE WHO DOES THAT?!
---
🤷 necessary, no, but it seems to be Bethesda's intention since Prime Receivers are their endgame loot. I agree it seems a little silly, but they're the ones who put it (and Scorched Killer, and the Zealot legendary property) in the game to begin with 🤣
---
Plus, I think Prime is the same dmg as Hardened isn't it? Just with a bonus against Scorched on top of that? And not every gun has Hardened anyway (energy guns, heavy guns, crossbows, etc.)
---
I feel like the nuka grenade and the quantum got switched or something. nuka is huge.
---
pc
---
Yeah that's true, all of my games I occasionally play on my computer are horribly downgraded because all I have to play on is a laptop
---
Those of us who are honest players wish they would.
---
Meh so so I wouldn’t pay more than 500 caps for it
---
I randomly found a plasma gattling gun plans Sat the drop zone v9 I think? Near fissure prime/glassed cavern
---
I don’t think it would be possible to delete ‘cheated’ items easily. It would require completely resetting everyone’s items.. as an item would be a simple database entry, there wouldn’t be a way to determine whether the item was cheated, or legitimately found.. as for deleting all the cheated account, I don’t think Bethesda would do that either.. the majority of their player base has used an exploit at some point. They’re not going to ban more than half their player base.
---
Pretty sure if you're on an actual Team, when another Player (not on the team) aggros one of your Teammates, you all aggro against them too for PVP. So ya, you might be able to run Team PVP, if you could find some people 👍
---
Wondrous Treasure, take a step forward.

Y O U  D I E D

Ground the SBQ - they get used quite a bit.
---
This was “annoying” to “read” all the way “through”
---
Do it, OP. Do it for the karma.
---
Id pay 1000-1500 honestly 
---
Ok yeah I'm not help sry
---
Not sure if trolling or not but that's one of the best rolls you can get for melee weapons. People will pay alot for that.
---
I only hop if another player is doing the same quest as me. Call me antisocial if you will.
---
WHeREs THe DEv ROOm
---
Watoga has 4 power armor spawns so a bit of server hopping should help you get those last pieces. 
---
They problem with this is us honest players who have use our hard earned caps and item to trade for better items to lose said items because we did not know they duped... Man, that would cause something of an upset. 
---
If the mod don't have a pa name in front of it it's for excavator armor
---
Just found a bag of lead scraps on the ground (around 20000 Ibs) I bet this is from one of the dupers......Now I understand why the servers keeps crashing.
---
ok, thx this is at least a good way to check the first two perks 
---
This exactly.  A lvl 20 wanted to trade with me last night. I switched to game chat and said send me an xbox message with what you want/need and Ill drop it for you if I have it.  They never messaged me and ran around spamming trade to everyone.
---
I noticed and warned team mates that I noticed a small combat knife in their hand and like another poster mentioned 'beware the trade/theft bug'!!!  I will not Trade with people I dont know.  Drop yes.  Help yes.  Trust to trade no.

DM’ed you my offer :)
---
I agree with you, that would fetch 5k easily, id assume double that tho.
---
Its terrible for the long term potential for the game. If they don't somehow make all duping not matter, the game is fucked.
---
The fact that people are making real money alone is enough to throw out bans. I feel like their eventual response is what will make or break the game.
---
I would pay 2,3k
---
Always nice to see an OP keep defending their arguments..........
---
And how come I can hardly find any bad reviews from after the beta version? Sure, the game is not perfect. But it's way better than most early reviews told.
---
And to me personaly most issues I have are personal game preferences. I didn't come across any real bugs(which I think is sometimes part of the FO fun) and the few server problems I had could as well be a wifi problem(PS4 without internet cable).
---
Fallout 76 is AWESOME!!!
---
Good post. I dont want this game to burn out, thats what I was trying to convey in the first place.
---
Pretty sure it doesn't drop yet. But don't quote me on that. I've seen screenshots of them, but I'm 80% sure its from the people hacking to get into the development room/cell. Every Bethesda game has a room with 1 of everything in it.
---
A lot of power armor paints, masks, and stuff like this are popping up.
---
Definitely hit it up when the event is up, but I wouldn't put a whole lot of heart and soul into it
---
Of course
---
Lol I'm really not. Just got it off a whitesprings glowing one. I know swing is good but didnt know about how much the other 2 are worth 
---
Thanks.  The only thing I usually find in watoga is bugged chassis.  :)  It isnt desperate as I typically run in my X01.  But I really want the T51b so I can paint it with the Nuke paint...well after I find that plan. 
---
I hope someday we can display our PA at our CAMP.  But its weird that we come across armor all the time and those two particular pieces are missing!  
---
The scaly skin serum requires coal to craft and this was the easiest way to get it
---
What is wrong with you guys hahahaha
---
Me again.  I logged on.  I have three plans still locked.  On Xbox the two rows below the ATOM parasol and the kitchen tables four below the parasol.  The immediate below parasol is a coffee, side and cube fairly beat up.  The next is a modern scandi style coffee, sideboard and cube.  As I buy lots these must drop from Workshops events I think.  I do have two different spare Elegant Table plans, the only difference seems to be price.  One in my Notes view is value 350, the other 150.  They must be from Whitesprings vendor at a higher cap price than that obviously, but hopefully this helps your search.
---
I love interactions like that, really positive 
---
Yes, ammo, plans and recipes. Sometimes a mini-nuke since I don't lug around a Fat-man.
---
I don’t know why this is still news to players, it was in one of the trailers
---
Likely diseased legendaries that you just can't see. Disease tag over-rules the Legendary right now, so if you kill a diseased enemy and for some reason it took an extra hit or two to drop him, make sure to check the loot.
---
I have no interest in pvp and therefore could not care less about duped items. 
---
The closest i come to server hopping is disconnects.
---
Same here. I get tons of frame drops / stutter all the time. Playing on Xbox One X with the internal hard drive.
---
This sounds lovely wish you were on xb1
---
Fill it with dog poop, put in on Rose's doorstep, then set fire to it.
---
More seriously, I'd take a few bits and pieces if there was anything good, then drop it.
---
The problems are the flawed loot system and the flawed leveling system. Server hopping is a symptom, not the cause.
---
In Diablo or Borderlands you might need to farm  for a bit until you get the item you want, but the way to farm for an item is fun and the chance for the item drop is quite high. You feel like you work towards your goal through normal gameplay. 90% of ganeplay will lead you where you want to go.
---
But often you dont get what you want, but a strong alternative. In this case bith games easily let you respec your character to accomodate this. A legendary item can open the way for interesting gameplay you havent seen before.
---
Also you see the skill trees from the moment you open the game for the first time. You know what skill you will unlock on level 35. In Fallout 76 you are basically blind without third party sites.
---
In Fallout 76 you are bound to the skills you chose. Respecing is a long and painful process. The wrong item drop is useless to you. And the chance for the correct item is so low and often in really specific circumstances. You dont get the Jetpack from looting enemies. You need luck at vendors.
---
Because you are stuck to a playstyle you chose through perk cards, and because you need luck from very specific unfun activities, players start to force the game to give them what they want. In this case server hopping and item duping. 
---
The problem is not the hopping. The problem is the 100 legendary wood leg pieces and the unflexible skill tree. Nothing I do in normal gameplay feels like working towards my goal.
---
Gut reaction says oblivion.
---
Thanks a lot for the checking and info, I will try my luck with the vendors :)
---
Apparently it's not directly related to FO76 🙄

Then I need to sell the excess loot I have so I equip hard bargain.

Serums grant the Mutation permanently, not just for a limited time, so no, they won't "drop off" after it expires. Instead, if you already have a Mutation and drink a Serum for that mutation it becomes heightened and loses its penalties temporarily.
---
Serums are, far and away, the best plan for getting Mutations. You know what you're getting, you won't have to deal with Mutations you don't want, and you can buy em all cheap on the market subs 👍
---
You don’t need to stay at 15.. you need to stay below 45 in order for the handmade plan to be available at the harper ferry vendor. That’s as far as I learnt now that I’m 75!!! I will need to use my other low level character to get that plan now. 
---
No. Priority 1 is to finally fix the ability to dupe items, to begin with!
---
I heard the next update will include more ways to sell and be a vendor 
---
Bulk it all until the server crashes.
---
That’ll show em.
---
What are we talking about again?
---
Dude. You are sick. This is cool. And disturbing.

Wooo

Me. Gamer tag Galath11 
---
Does Australia count?
---
As long as you take it away from them yup. I spend alot of time hunting dupers snd griefers and ending their shit.
---
Once you take their stuff, break their base and kill them if you can. Then hop servet and drop the bag and keep some of it to hand out.
---
Fuck dupers and i cannot wait for their ban hammer to get them.
---
I see it sometimes on PS4. It can be like a strobe light when it's bad. It seems to depend on how many other players are in the area.
---
Part of me feels like this was necessary. Not to let Bethesda know their release of an unfinished game was unacceptable, but to let all companies out there know it's unacceptable. No more day one/week one patches to save your ass from a game you didn't properly beta test. 
---
I agree completely with the negativity filled with inaccurate or blatantly false information needs to go. If I'm going to keep seeing stories about the game they can at least be somewhat accurate with truthful information and honest opinions.
---
I'm a suitcase guy myself. Players tend to check them more than the cash register. 
---
I had a guy that seemed to just peruse my inventory then give me a thumbs up. Think he just saw me blaze through a herd of enemies and wanted to see what I was wearing. Some people are just creepy curious.
---
I bulk everything out of habit now that I don’t need plastic for ammo.
---
All that weight I’m saving probably is from lead and aluminium now that I think about it (I had over 70 bulk of each before I went and ditched two thirds of each)
---
Bullshit. The game is worse than its hate train.
---
Super small stash limit in a fucking hoarder game (all bethesda games have ever been)
---
Impractical and unintuitive skill system with tedious switcheroos. 
---
Literally no endgame. None at all. 
---
No reason to play in a team except for the "everything is better together" reason.
---
Hilariously broken pvp. 
---
Stupid implementation of explosive weapons. Yeah, they're fun, but hell after you get one everything is oneshot. 
---
Duping ruined economy for ever, even if they add new leveled gear etc. Firstly caps are ruined, secondly even my lvl 25 explosive sg oneshots everything. 
---
No NPCs wtf? Noone listens to holotapes if you talk with a friend via comm. 
---
Legendary farm is the onky thing to do. 
---
Super imbalanced character builds. 
---
Awkward gunplay. 
---
Way too less customization. 
---
INGAME SHOP with hilsrious prices.
---
Nearly no cosmetics except ingame shop. 
---
Positive: the map is nice and they included most ofthe songs of previousfallout titles. 
---
That’s what I keep telling people. The only real solution is to reset everyone back to level one and take all their items and basically restart the whole game, but then a lot of people would just stop playing I *think* that’s unprecedented for any game ever. Idk man I think they should just stop the duping method they still haven’t patched it I see kids duping all the time STILL Even on console 
---
I really like my Tesla. Fantastic light show.

https://www.chaoshour.com/games/fixes/xbox-one-fallout-76-crashing-freezing-fixes-and-solutions/ this one is fairly generic but worth a try because it's obvious something is up.
---
https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/458581-fallout-76-xbox-one-x-overheating-issue this one is about an overheating issue that might be the cause.
---
I don't own a console so I don't pay attention to any console problems. This is just a quick google search.
---
Actually there could be a way to check all the dulicated items. The game could issue an item number for every legitimately creature dropped loot. This number could be in the database but not visible to the player. Duplicated items would have the same item number. I don’t know if it works this way but it is a possibility
---
You're the second post about the voice near Lewisburg. Now I gotta go see...
---
Sorta. If it's Sydney based than the ping is usually 150 to 200. Everywhere else like Melbourne is 250+
---
No it's an amazing game but the problem is that the game takes WAY too much time. If you want to do well in your wipes be prepared to play for at least 3 to 7 hours a day... especially if you play without friends/groups.  
---
I spent 3 hours today and couldn't even get a base down (I actually got 3 bases down), someone would always walk up on me and gun me down when I couldn't even find hemp to make a bag/bow. But it makes me feel good that whoever flame raids those bases won't get jackshit for the lowgrade fuel they have to spend.
---
That’s like asking what would you do if you found a suitcase full of dirty money. 
---
You’re going to take at least some of it. 
---
Fallout is not based on the Good Samaritan. It’s based on survival. It’s a game. 
---
The jet packs add fun to the game.  Lets say you waited 300 organic logins to find it.  By that time you will be burnt out in the game and less inclined to enjoy the mod.  If it was maybe 5 or 6 legit logins or hours played base or pay caps to reset vendor or any other of options used by every other game it wouldnt be an issue.  But this system is stupud having level locks or vendor items with .5% chance to show up.  That is not the players fault.
---
Greetings from East Asia
---
Oh what's her name? I named mine moomoo hha
---
It's a shame some of the mods for Fallout 4 crafting aren't available because you could build some nasty traps with those. It would make an awesome 'travelling' (server hopping) assault course. The difference is that this course assaults you  lol
---
Thanks for the reply, il def make sure I switch to a non explosive if her ground troops are getting a bit close, loving the mutations, and il add those two to the list, thanks again
---
Good roll OP should move fast.
---
Yes I'm getting tired of the boring cubes, wish people were more creative and we had more options 
---
For clarity, they were carrying 434,000,000 pounds of items. You couldn't even choose take all, it only gave me the items I listed and even those were 57,000 pounds worth.
---
8th January...still busted damn it what the fuck.
---
What about ol' Righty? He doesn't seem happy.
---
Lol ok. When I spawn at whitesprings and all the cars around me spawn in at once and explode, the enemies don’t appear for a minute or two after spawning, the building texture is screwed... but I hear someone’s miissile turret camp that’s glitched with 30+ turrets going... yeah. 
---
if  i saw someone dressed like that, i would not follow him lol, solely based on that outfit lol
---
I know I'm inviting fate / karma / bad luck / other (please specify) but I haven't had an ivory grip plan for ages!
---
That's enough, I spent probably a hour or so posting a reply on someone comparing The long Dark to Fallout 76. ~~I'm going to keep this short~~  (sigh, that didn't happen), those titles have been out for a while. You are comparing old games to one that just released two months ago. If you can come up with some idiotic reply defending yourself on this, have a blast.
---
BTW I bought Witcher 3 for full price plus dlc pass 74.99 Mar. 2 2016, which is what I payed for for this game 60 (full price). Played it for 267 hours on steam, this doesn't include dlc because, I was to burnt out on the game to even bother doing those. Nor am I ever going to play Witcher again because, IMO you need to play all three just to get the full story. Which is what I did the first time, played all three back to back.
---
Bottom line, Witcher 3 is a different monster IMO.
---
the fact you have to server hop is just very telling to how broken and boring this game truly is.
---
Vault-Tech Bed is an invalid item like the display cases (even if you learned it, still unlocks nothing)
---
Just wondering OP couldnt they just shoot theyre way out?????
---
This would allow people to cheat by just altering that file and give them insane amounts of items and junk in no time.
---
Killed it twice.  Once by the pumpkins (Pumpkin House), once further East in the woods.  Took a pic of the second time around.
---
I heard the Handmade plans at Harpers Ferry are only available between levels 15 and 19. There was a post yesterday that listed a number of plans and indicated at what level they were no longer available (Guitar Sword was one of them - try searching on that). Not sure how accurate the list is. 
---
At 15 you can start wearing Raider Armour. You can normally get a partial set at The Crosshair.
---
Nice, I love seeing how close you can get to existing areas 
---
So you want to repair weapons with other weapons? It's already in the game. Scrap a weapon, get materials, repair weapon.
---
Making it a same weapon to same weapon to repair seems very frustrating. 
---
Must be in Megaton 
---
Could u show the pic too me? 
---
No kidding. I've always been fascinated by people who feel the need to lie to strangers on the internet with fake bragging. What's the end game?
---
Could you share your build? You seem to have it figured out. And being that VAT's increases the burn rate of Fusion Cores, I could go without it.
---
Gotta try this with my new chainsaw 🤣
---
At this point, I just want to ask people going on about how much the game sucks ... "Show me on the doll where the bad Devs touched you".
---
More now than ever... the Internet seems to be thriving on Negativity. It's like if you don't have a negative view of everything you're a POS. We get it ... you want everyone to think your one of the "Cool Kids". But enough ... have some damn perspective.
---
Thought I’d log in again for another go, kicked out twice, blue screen report a problem. It’s stuff like this that makes it unplayable 
---
The 500% budget guys, sure that’ll do it.  That’s whole other subject.  
---
But how does a base behind the club hit the cars in front of it.
---
And again when I spawn into anywhere near Whitespring even when no one is around my gun can be dismantled or pointing wrong way.  I may be invisible or just a floating head.  The world can be gone, walls can be missing or I’ll just freeze and crash any how, no outsiders needed.
---
Came in here to defend against another 76 hate post. But outside of the no end game bit your othet points do stand up in some form or another.
---
Soooo yeah i guess not sure what to say. I love the game but your points are pretty spot on outside of the end game bit.
---
Sorry should have said the Flatwoods is the Alien.
---
Yeah, I think stop the duping then erase all stacks over 5 of the same legendary, you don't have 5 of the same legendary gun unless you're duping
---
There are double and quad legendary effects but no unlimited like in Fo4
---
How long did it take you to place all those cards wow
---
Oh that’s strange because I’ve killed the flatwoods monster before and I haven’t completed the “kill an alien” challenge. 
---
Does it create a bounty if a trap looks another player?
---
True, but keeping the file encrypted when not in use, and using a hash check to confirm it hasn’t been altered since the user last logged in could limit the amount of effective cheaters. And if it was found to be different than before, the penalties could include losing everything in your stash. 
---
The player will burnout of the game eventually. Rushing to get everything asap will juste bring that moment closer.
---
The percent of chance to get an item may be to low for your patience, that is subjective. 
---
For some, finding the mod after 3000hours of play will feel great and rewarding, for others it will feel as dumb grind. 
---
But the speed at which a player chooses to get an item is that players choice, which was my message. Server hopping I don't care, but people who buy on Reddit/internet are beyond my comprehension. 
---
But that is subjective too.
---
I found the full outfit in Point Pleasant. I haven't gotten it yet on my current character, but on my old character, I had to picklock a door to get into a basement (it is in that mothman shop I think? I am not sure if it is a museum or shop). In the basement there should be a shrine/church looking set up. I found the outfit and mask down there. 
---
What the fuck  xD
---
You forgot my biggest gripe which is no major player hub..... in a mmo.
---
Still too arbitrary, with how many people are out there you could stack a few simple legendaries with ease. Pretty sure it's just not going to happen.
---
Don't worry though. Highly doubt this game was ever meant to have real power tiering from player to player. explosive is tooootally getting nerfed, and two shot won't always be king as it's honestly a total mess with VATS builds.
---
All will be well.
---
One of those elegant tables is the containers version and one is the static version. 
---
Could you share your build? I'm not married to vats/crits. Especially since it would increase the Fusion Core burn rate. Those points could be put into intelligence to equip Gunsmith, which I was going to swap in and out of instead.
---
I love the game overall.   Just get used to random crashes—perhaps one crash per 2 hours gameplay.  
---
I want Junk Walls like we had in FO4 (for those that don't know they were tall walls made of junk that you could use to build large perimeter defences with). They're in the game, often around old Raider camps, but not in the build menu...yet.
---
Also the build budget needs to be larger. I understand the issue is that Bethesda don't want too many people creating a lot of turrets, as these soak up the server's memory (or whatever). A way round this would be to have a limited defence budget (perhaps six cheap turrets or their equivalents) and a larger 'build' budget for static items such as walls, furniture.
---
Good to know, thanks :) 
---
Cafe table is the restaurant style table. What you’re looking for is the end table plan. 
---
For real. I (finally) killed the SBQ last weekend at level 115 and was excited about it. My 5 year old son asked "Did you finally kill that bitch?". Wife was not impressed. 
---
That explains that one. Thanks for your response.
---
I'm feeEEELLLINNNN STABBBYYYYY. 
---
Alright yall good to go.
---
Just a heads up. The airport has three pads.
---
Can't you just shoot the flamer though?
---
It doesn’t have to be. Even TSO has instanced world loot. 
---
Most that I see back there are glitched now. My experience differs. 
---
I wonder how it stacks with Zealot (the anti-Scorched legendary property) 🤔
---
Cool.
---
You are correct
---
People are comparing older games that released dlc and updates to a game that just came out. Other fresh AAA games are going to cost you the same as this one, 60 plus whatever bullcrap there trying to serve with it.
---
From another reply earlier since I still have it up I spent 74.99 on Witcher 3 and its season pass.
---
I cannot wait till I’m an OP badass &amp; get to fuck around with shit like this.   I’m currently level 32 &amp; petrified at the sight of a warlord or scorchbeast. 
---
I am sorry but all those TSE weapons wouldn’t be being sold if there wasn’t duping. 
---
Are you on Xboxm. I kind of want to check the oven out!
---
Hell I've hit her in the air before. Just standing below her trying to get the shortest range increment when I got one shot and last laugh went off.
---
A lot of us really think it's more like lvls 15-20 instead of going up to 44. 
---
"Meet the real fire breathers inside!"
---
What's the point of even having the plan? The endgame content is all about finding legendaries. I spent the last bit of the game with an explosive assault rifle because that's just what I found. 
---
Even the end game isn't that great.  Maybe because it's not the end I hope.  Listening to the Overseer it's like there's a next bit to come.  All the other points are as some find it, so it gets my up vote.
---
So you are saying I should feel the anxiety of wanting an item I cant find for 3000 hours until i finally find it.  Then maybe I can get another 3000 hours of joy because i finally got what I wanted for so long.  Meawhile realistically I will be so burnt out I may get a days worth of play and then give up.  Instead of the better choice of getting something that will improve my joy in the game early on so for the rest of my 3000 hours I can be fully immersed in what im doing without the stress of feeling like im missing out.  There is not justifiable reason to have a game with a full price tag also have items locked behind a stupid mechanic like vendor rarity.  Make it so it can be eventually learned through normal game play.  Make legendaries craftable using other legendaries and high end mats a lot if them.  But first you need to break down a legendary to learn its ability maybe you need to break down 10 of them.  But everything should be achievable via time spent and currently it just isn't.  Some people will never organically find an explosive shotgun or a jetpack.  Meanwhile they will see others daily enjoying both who just got lucky on their second servee hop.
---
Some events require a player to physically be at a location for it to trigger such as the patrol event at the penitentiary. Hopping looking for events is the equivalent of continuously stepping out your front door looking for the ice cream van when really you should just go the grocery store and get some damn ice cream.
---
too long LUL
---
Mainly just to craft and scrap it to unlock better mods. But I suppose you’re right. It could be easier to just look for legendaries instead 
---
Very impressed 
---
But how did you survive the TSE shots of em?
---
&gt;It's just you and few other weirdos
---
Most of this subreddit actually. 
---
Vast majority of GAEMERS think that Diablo: Immortal is an awful game though it hasn't even released. You can't say that smth is ttuth just because many people think so.
---
That is probably the reason for the quest too
---
So all of the other sets’ plans are random drops? 
---
I'm trying to decide if I'm disappointed or relieved it took so long for a 'Deutsche oven' to appear.  
---
Challenges are beoken
---
Bethesda should decrease the amount of robots in whitesprings, the area is unplayable for me. The freeze and errors are killing me on ps4. 
---
Okay.
---
OMG what platform are you on? I want to see and experience this glorious oven!! *All hail the great oven*
---
Related, but you can find an alien blaster in Grafton. :)
---
You've sold me then, might go pick it up today 
---
Omg...I just found a reason to have that card now. Thank you for the laughs
---
Nope! Environmental Hazard I guess lol
---
Honestly don't bother with Gunsmith equipped (just get it for modding). Instead, use Weapon Artisan to double-repair your weapons, gives you the same effect without taking up 5 slots of Int in your combat build. Also maybe check out Luck of the Draw if you're worried about it.
---
I wish I didn't have to do this. I don't want to do this, but if playing legitimately doesn't give you certain gameplay options, well. I want some nice power armor upgrades, I don't need maxed out jetpack and stuff, just some nice reliable and effective things to make my power armor not bare bones. I have turned in at least 30 treasure maps, and have given away more raider/t-45 hydraulic bracer plans than I've gotten power armor mods. It's infuriating to get blocked from playing the game that I desperately want to play because the rng system is so heavily rigged out of the player's favor. The only times I've felt so mercilessly screwed by rng systems was trying to break the SM casino with 2 luck in NV, and when the Mass Effect : Andromeda dev team decided to bloat out the loot system with 40 copies of every weapon in the game, but with fancy colors.
---
It's not fun to struggle against such a rigged system when it is outside your control. Server hopping is despicable, but also the only way to tilt the odds even slightly in your favor.
---
But the event is boring and takes forever. It’s in the starter zone too so the super mutants are all too weak to be a challenge. 
---
The plan goes for like 1,500, which you can get in one day of selling to vendors the weapons and junk you pick up doing fun quests. It’s both faster and more entertaining unless you’re obscenely lucky and get it on your first run. 
---
Actually, the guy with his stealth boy is watching you. 
---
Thanks for the offer bud I'm on PC though!
---
Just discovered it two days ago! Was chasing an airdrop, so I couldn't stop to admire it, but laughed nonetheless.
---
I did the same as you, but I gave up and just farmed some caps and bought it.. I saved boredom and time!
---
Take it and delete it. It's the proper thing to do. Not that temptation is not there.
---
These items are not meant to be in game via how they were created. So keeping in tone with that and not stability or anything, delete them to the best of your ability.
---
&gt;ut my camp in more interesting places, but can't because  I want to keep my industrial purifier running and water sources are scarce. This camp pond you could just place down in any "dirt" and use like
---
Unfortunately camp pumps work differently than workshop pumps.  In workshops they fill in parallel meaning that if you plug them all in at the same time they'll fill up at roughly the same time.  In camps they work in serial meaning that if you plug them all in at the same time they'll fill more or less one after another.
---
I haven't been able to exactly narrow down how or why, but the best way to get water is to drop a bunch of purifiers in a workshop for a little bit.
---
but you can't get the blackbird skin anymore :P
---
And this is why we can't have stashes of more than 600lb. Because there's already people around fucking he servers with thousands of duped items.
---
Ah makes sense, hence price difference.
---
You are aware that, by saying "Subnautica runs out of things to do after a couple of hours", you're saying Fallout 76 only has a couple of hours of gameplay too, right? As much as I enjoy Fallout 76 after getting it to work, it does the same copy-paste content and arguably worse.
---
Thank you. This is thoroughly laid out. My camp is currently just north of white springs. 
---
Awesome! I think this is what's going to make the game fun for me long term (only LVL 54 So far). I crafted a LVL 25 a full suit of excavator armour last night, just because he visited my shack. 
---
For real. When I can hand to hand an assaultron, but I get rekt by a colonel gutsy, something's wrong.
---
What they truly need to do is remove the flashback that allows the duping. Reset all to level 1 and stop the Ability to “tag” a mob and get the exp from it. You would actually have to do significant damage to the mob to get the experience. One of the worst things I have seen in game is the abuse of white springs. 
---
That's awsome ! Good luck with ur work.
---
herbivore and carnivore were only bugged in that they prevented serum mutations from working 
---
And just like that, I will have this song stuck inside my head all day!  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvAYIJSSZY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvAYIJSSZY)
---
That's your opinion and you're entitled to have it.
---
Other people are free to feel differently.
---
This is an adventure/survival game, in which item rarity is fully part of the design. 
---
Having to farm for resources, be it food or weapons, is the whole point of the game. The very proof of that is that people who rushed complained after one week that there was "no endgame". 
---
There are thousands of other game where you'll be able to raid huge beasts, or fight other players, or explore ruins.
---
Currently everything IS achievable through time, your whole argument is that you DON'T want to spend that time, because you're "anxious", you "fear to miss out" and you're envious that "others were lucky".
---
A beautiful fallout story!:P
---
only on pc would that be possible, however. 
---
How about this solution
---
You can't have more than 800 on yourself +your stash.
---
That would likely worsen the server instability issues caused by large numbers of items.
---
I know, but they actually can cause problems still? or they were already patched?
---
Here's a funny story
---
 A few weeks ago my brother was over and I let him try fallout 76. He had watched a metric ton of "fallout 76 bad" type videos and was criticizing everything, it was annoying. He goes up to a toolbox around flatwoods and finds the Quantum grenade plan at level 3
---
They're not going to delete shit and they aren't going to wipe everyone and start from Level 1...
---
As many people as there are bitching about dupes and TSE weapons, there's as many or more that couldn't care less...We're going to just wipe someones game ?  Come on......
---
Personally, I'd be fine if they first fixed the duping process and then secondly delete all characters. Atom purchases should still be there as they are account bound and not player bound.
---
It's be highly controversial for a few reasons. Time, players can not get time back. Money, some players were stupid enough to pay real cash for their TSE weapons off of Ebay and other sites.
---
But this game needs a hard fix and reset in order to fix everything dupers have destroyed. 
---
 you don't  know how i understand you 
---
Why is replacement even an option in this topic? I think we all want more options not the same amount of options.   
---
besides, Most classical music is Public Domain, which means it's significantly cheaper or free compared to buying rights to songs to play for a new radio station.   
---
"What games have you bought for $20 with more content?"
---
- I don't think that it's a "gotcha" for whoever's answering; there are a lot of answers for this question, and many of them will be subjective to taste and judgement despite having more content so I'm pretty sure that people will disregard them even when they do have more content than Fallout 76 hands-down.
---
You totally sound like someone that went through and picked all the points other people have mentioned, and then put them in a list.
---
Probably because you just want to stir the turd. 
---
You clearly aren't playing the game. So shut up. 
---
i bought that red rocket because one of the images is showing it can fly,..
---
(i really thought u could like launch the rocket for some fun cosmetic effect).
---
Bethesda is better at deceiving and screwing their fans than fixing their game obviously....
---
also, about 2 step verification.. 
---
i accidently dropped an explosive western revolver (legendary + favorite item) without me knowing it (probably pressed the R instead of the T when i tried to level up), had to find a new one from someone on reddit, because it dropped on the floor in an event zone (and didnt drop a paper bag cuz of event zone) so it was gone forever 
---
you'd expect a 2 step verify when u drop things like this.
---
My problem on ps4 too is whitesprings, the amount of robots is killing my ps4. Always freezing and errors :(
---
what mods are you talking about if I may ask
---
slocum joes has 3 nodes. one behind the building and 2 around the broken down bus
---
Flatwoods there are seven of them 3 of which between are located north east of the church behind the slightly hidden tinkers work bench. The next 3 are south east of the church between the tents with ghouls, the church and father Delbert caravan. The final one is located in Flatwoods itself, you’ll need to go find it but it usually glitches itself into the other caravan. Then there two dead Brahman you can loot, one by Father Delbert’s caravan and the other behind what I can only describe as a crematorium.  
---
What is he complaining about again? He got his right leg a month ago!
---
Quad double barrell, beat that. Shooting 8 times before a super fast reload, it's insanely good.
---
I have never set one up but I benefited from someone setting one up. They did not have the explosive turrets, just the laser type. Others and myself would draw them out of the resort, making sure we hit them first. I got experience and loot drops and we were not teamed. I don’t see any issues with it. 
---
You can get 10k easily on that
---
My only issue the game is how slow they patch exploits. And they aren't just minor exploits, no reason at all a dupe glitch should exist in the game for now almost a month.
---
By the laws of statistics the lottery is achievable for everyone but realistically you could spend multiple life times waiting for that to happen.  A game is supposed to provide fun and do so in a reasonable amount of time.  Fallout 76 will not be around forever eventually the servers will shut down and there will be people who will never achieve the build they desired its unfortunately how games like this work.  Its acceptable to have legendaries be hard to find it is not acceptable to have basic mods and weapon patterns fall under the same difficulty.  This isnt opinion it's a pretty basic game standard. 
---
I sunk 40 hours in the game, am lvl 80 and have nothing to achieve in the game anymore. So basically i played through the game and made a list of the obvious faults of the game. 
---
Isn't it a shame?  Before I sold my Calibrated Shocks my repair process was as follows
---
Drop 1 ammo to make sure bag appears  
---
Drop mod into bag  
---
Complete repairs  
---
pick up bag contents  
---
Is it maybe being too safe?  Probably...  
---
Should I have to risk losing the contents of that bag due to server disconnect because I'm worried about it randomly being scrapped for repairs?  ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT
---
Will you be doing a book signing? You can just sign my phone, I wanna get your autograph before you get famous making the fallout movie lol, 
---
It’s funny because a few hours after this, I fought another one at that steakhouse on my way to robo tech. Took 20 mins but I killed that fool. 
---
try playing a strike or PVP in Destiny and going to the bath...
---
Yesterday I launched my first solo nuke and was still smiling about that when I reached the blast zone.   
---
As soon as I got there the game froze and it took one minute filled with curses before the game recovered.
---
Y'all must live in some violent AF places if nutty people out number regular folks. 😂😂😂
---
Why blame youtubers?
---
I have a legendary two shot handmade but it’s barebones. It’d be nice to have the plans so I could upgrade it some.
---
Haha awesome. 
---
I have a set of power armor that randomly showed up in my inventory, probably from being dropped from a server by bad connection. It's exactly the same as the set I use normally. There isn't going to be a way to distinguish good or bad dup's. It's going to have to fix duplicates, not banning people. 
---
Borderlands 2 had the same problem. 
---
Durabilit isnt just the case for plasma.
---
Automatic Laser rifles with a hair trigger last like 60 seconds of continuous fire before breaking.
---
You can catapult yourself if you activate the spring traps while you stand on them
---
40 hours and level 80? So you leveled like twice an hour? Oh I know you'll say you can get to level X in only X hours if you know what you are doing.
---
You haven't really played the game. You haven't done all the content. You are just making up stuff now
---
The biggest thing that's clear. You are what I call a lazy gamer. You want the game to do everything for you, so all you do is sit there and push buttons to make things dead. Go away. The gaming world is sick of your kind.
---
No matter what you get in a game, you are going to complain. And then lie about how awesome you are. 
---
For me, its because I can't solo launch a nuke without a black magic boom stick.
---
Yeah I have the 'spold-ey vent mod on X01 and Ultracite. doesn't do anything at the moment which is tragic because goomba stomping stuff with marsupial seemed so much fun.
---
Man I don’t know if I have the balls to do one endurance but to be fair almost all of the endurance perks are quality of life as opposed to actual combat perks
---
Hahaha, like a cat waiting for you to move and then kapow, right in the gaffer!
---
Awesome picture!

He can't run with that much stuff. Got caught in the Blast Zone ...

It depends on how you will feel ... 
---
The witch's outfit and the clean spacesuit are in there as well
---
Post your build mate, maybe we can help.
---
Who cares, i oneshot everything with TSE pump or 1-5hits with my macheeteee.  Its MMORPG you need to min/max if you want to kill.
---
If Beth didn’t want you to place it there, they would have restricted it like allllllllllll the other spots. Always something to bitch about.
---
Actually server hop when it looks like a building has been wiped clean. Still unsure if this is a thing or not, went to Garahan mining area. An the stairs are trapped with mines. First server was cleared and a lot of the shelves and decor looked empty. Second, one side was gone and same thing.
---
This would lead to even more cheating. I think the problem is that they have too many different objects. Why do we need 20 varieties of beer and teddy bear? If the game can't handle all of them, then they should've simplified the materials for crafting, not complicated them further.
---
Haha im on xbox, but im giving you an upvote for the witty title.
---
Curses! Foiled again! 
---
Try checking the market subs, you can usually find Serums for 4-500 caps, if you find someone who crafts them regularly. Pimp yourself out with a full suite of Mutations for a couple thousand Caps and save yourself the time

Are we going to get this post every day?
---
How do you farm him?   
---
Seems like my game crashes more often than not when I do the Charleston Station &gt; Bridge &gt; U-turn spawn thingie
---
Lol bro.
---
I'm a lot, but not a lazy gamer. 
---
I played a ton of games over 2 decades and were until recently competitively playing wow in pvp and pve.
---
Stop bullshitting me. 
---
You can easly level twice an hours. As said, i didnt listen to holotapes. 
---
Also when you hit lvl 50, your killrate goes up a ton and 2 hours in a nuke zone can easily give you 10 levels. 
---
You’re right. That extra item number is something the server would need to track. Maybe this is why server stability is a problem with so many duplicated items. 
---
Yes, a game is supposed to provide fun. But that notion is entirely subjective. Some people play chess, others play croquet, and some play Fallout 76. Amongst those, the fun is, again, subjective.
---
The rest of your argument is again , an opinion, not a fact. Some games are harder than others, maybe this one is too hard for your tastes, maybe the dev will make it easier later, maybe it was intended to be played by server hopping : all that is beyond .
---
The argument was "It's not the player's fault if he wants every item as fast as possible, even if that means he has to server-hop instead of playing, or to buy on reddit forums". My answer was "well, yes, it is. Nobody else makes that decision for the player."
---
And regarding the lottery, I'd like to remember you that millions of people play lottery every week. You know why ? Because aside of the real concrete possibility of becoming rich, there's the pleasure of the hope and dream. 
---
Which is the part rushers miss in this game.
---
Now I won't debate any longer since you apparently only want to explain why it's normal that you rush to get items, when I never say it wasn't. I only said that by doing so, you will, in my opinion, be bored of the game faster than if you had to deserve your items by regular play.
---
But to each his tastes.
---
Maybe play another game? If something is that frustrating or is so unfun, why keep playing?
---
Replay an old game or pick up something new maybe? Take a poop and a nap and chill out a little?
---
There's lots of games I used to play that changed and went down a path I didn't like. Rather than try to stir up the masses I moved on to a new game and stopped financially supporting the games that no longer worked for me. 
---
I think if we're gonna talk about fallout and list if things, it's important to recognize the words of Young Thug:
---
*"No homo we smokin penises!!!!"* - (@youngthug) December 22, 2011

Just some food for thought.
---
You're a fucking god, dude.
---
Also where do I get steel walls
---
Someome is a bethesda ball fondler. Accept that this game is lacking jeez
---
12,000 caps for those letters, which are the only option for communicating with other players other than waving at people or jumping in Morse Code.
---
I just wave and carry on my single-player way.
---
Once they fix the core duping problem it won't be an issue, they'll just release higher tiered gear and ramp up difficulty in encounters. This game is gonna get better but anyone who isn't enjoying it should wait until those improvements are made
---
If you look at the picture, the mask is much different than the cultist mask you find in the church. It’s really cool so I was wondering if anyone knew if it was actually available to find or not.

Somehow this has never happened to me, that I know. And it's not like I have too many mods I can't keep track of.
---
"TL;DR": I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
What system are you on, PC, PS4, XBO? I haven't had that problem but I would suggest waiting a minute for your game to load before running. I noticed sometimes when I load in if I don't wait for my quests to appear on the right hand side and I just start running immediately things will freeze up occasionally and I'll have to wait a minute or two to be able to move again.
---
I still involuntarily say "Get some!" while unloading on every Scorchbeast and Deathclaw I come across, so you're far from alone.
---
I've met him too! [He seems to be doing fine](https://i.imgur.com/fHccHua.png).
---
By hiding behind things forcing them to move out of position to come to me until they resorted to mini nukes. Also range was my friend they were using tse shotty which as long as I stayed way back I could pop their grape with my Gauss or handmade before they could get in range.  With the flamer was hilarious hiding behind a door and burning them as they entered. 
---
Certain locations have better output when searching for particular items...I like sugar grove myself for those 2 but I am only at level 38 so someone else might have a better location 
---
Up, you need to go up.
---
&gt; I'm a lot, but not a lazy gamer.
---
If you played 40 hours, and are level 80, then what did you do in game? Sounds like you grinded for XP, farmed legendaries at Whitesprings, and then fought scorched beasts as soon as you could, then went after the SBQ, and once you killed her, declared you were bored. 
---
So yeah, rushed through everything, played a small amount of the game, and then came and read and complained. 
---
I mean, here you are saying you didn't listen to any holotapes. So you didn't do everything in the game. I bet your map looks like a straight line from Vault 76, to Flatwoods, to Whitesprings to Watoga. 
---
And like you said, 2 hours in nuke zones will easily give you 10 levels. 
---
Yup, Nailed You. Grinder. Looter, probably explointer as well.
---
But still a lazy gamer. Because you didn't actually play the game. You just gamed the system, based off what others have told you is the best way.
---
So shut up. You are playing the wrong game, and applying your likes for other kinds of games to this game. Which isn't the game for you.
---
Stop bullshitting anyone. 
---
Do you really think, Bethesda hasnt thought about that solution? I can answer: They definitly have.  
---
I can also say, that they have reasons not to do it that way.  
---
Do you really think, professional worker at Bethesda, payed for their work are not as smart as you?
---
Your idea is so superficial, jeez.
---
At least with borderlands it was just a coop thing and had no bearing on an in game economy, pvp, servers, or single player. 
---
The drama , the tragedy, WHAT CAN WE DO ?!!!
---
I paid a guy caps to get them for me. Best caps I ever spent, saved me hours of grinding.
---
"A bunch of monkeys found magic mushrooms, and now here we are"
---
You're not the only person I have seen say that though so I'm almost curious if system may have something to play into that? Not sure otherwise.
---
Even without two shot explosive weapons, one can kill things relatively quickly with the right build. Requiring 30 shots means the issue is with your build, I'd say.
---
Frankly, I like the fact that there are enemies that scale while we stop at 50 and weapons stop at 45/50. What you call a "mechanic fault," the majority of other players call "good design."
---
Try shooting different parts of the body, getting better weapons, putting better perk cards on, etc. If we could simply outlevel every enemy like it seems you're calling for, this game would get [more] boring quickly.
---
Come into my idea?
---
The only thing I'd consider server hopping for is tick blood.  I can never get enough of the stuff, and it's so darn rare for ticks to drop.  Ticks should really be affected by butcher's bounty, because you can search their bodies with it, but it never spawns anything on them.
---
If the base is behind the golf course without guns then I say thank you. We can scrap we can make food is actually pretty handy. If I Zone in and I hear your guns killing s*** that I'm supposed to be getting experience from I'm going to destroy your guns.
---
No one plays the lottery because of the hope they might win they play because they legit want to win.  No one plays a video game because they hope one day it will finally deliver the gameplay they want they play because they are trying to achieve that gameplay and current setup of the game says if you play solo without server hopping it may never happen and that is bad game design not the fault of the player.   
---
and close that fuckin backdoor in the Test Room! 
---
Right? Smart enough to come here and type that up but not smart enough to claim the spot themselves so no one else can....
---
I live to solve imaginary problems. 
---
Agreed, and please make it using any standard authenticator TOTP (like Google Authenticator) and not your own shitty app. (I'm looking at YOU SquareEnix)
---
ok im level 65 but i still dont know a better place haha
---
I gather springs by going to the mountain side bed and breakfast. From there you can see a large electricity pylon. Under there you find 2 of the Yao Guai’s. Each tends to drop 6 springs just server hop could get get it done fairly fast. 
---
pick up as many desk fans, clip boards, pens, typewriters, telephones, hand cuffs, flip lighters, globes, toasters, and toy cars/trucks as you can find. I also find many boxes of loose ones in garages/repair shops. Sugar grove has many of these things, an is a common loot raid spot. 
---
I got mine from one of the usual Watoga/Harpers Ferry trio if its any help.
---
Return it to the duper and apologize. Or they will just dupe it again and servers will keep on crashing.
---
My bad just loaded up game and checked its just nocturnal. Damn not that special anymore. Lol  
---
The game is incredibly easy, like embarrassingly easy, I said gunplay sucks because it does suck, doesn't mean that I didn't know how to use it. The fact that it plays like any rockstar game isn't a good thing...I spent more time hunting than the story because it's the only decent part of the game. The rest of the game is doing missions that are ride your horse to this place, deadeye a few people, ride your horse back to this place. Repeat. End chapter. Move camp. Repeat. You keep pretending that I didn't play the game even though I literally did and I'm telling that I did. I'm not the dumb one here. Every part of the game is so half assed. At least your able to recognize the shit horse controls as it is my number 1 issue with the game and is one that I have people constantly defend. If I tell the horse to go right to avoid a tree it should absolutely not just say fuck it and auto target straight into the tree. Good thing half the fucking game isn't riding a horse right? 
---
-just... let... the... hooker... go...-

I like that too but their app resets sometimes when my phone updates because their app team decided to keep the key data in the system cache, which gets wiped sometimes during updates. I've had more issues with SE's keys than I have trying to manage my account on their page lol

"I had a lot of players who would not take the bait, many with microphones said something along the lines of, “Nah man, that’s sketchy as hell”."
---
- I wonder why. rofl. X'D
---
DEATH HAS COME FOR THIS GAME... AND I AM IT'S SHROUD!
---
Lol.
---
It's an online "mmo" game.
---
If they build it wrong and advertized it wrong, it's not my fault. 
---
And to be honest. Nearly all sidequests are boring as hell superficial and not even close to anything fallout 3 offered. 
---
I played the game. Its nice and good that you like fiddling through lifeless and boring houses and think your way is the right way to play. 
---
But sadly, i measure the pleasure this game offers and compare it to what other games of similar devs bring. 
---
And the result is just horrible. 
---
Well, please enlighten me as to why they’ve chosen to not do it this way. If you’ve had this conversation with a game engineer, please share their reason. 
---
As a cyber security engineer, I would love to know their reasoning. 
---
It shows u which mod is going to be scrapped before it does.  
---
Yes it sucks, it shouldn’t be a feature.  But we also need to pay more attention especially if we are low on materials.  
---
Thanks
---
PS4
---
How are you hunting duper’s? I wouldn’t mind finding them too but how am I suppose to tell? I see people mention random players trying to trade etc and noticing thousands of single items. Is that the only way?
---
ok thank you
---
Bethesda are doing something about it, they're monitoring carry weights and rates at which they increase etc.
---
Cross referencing against emails for the accounts and game delivery details etc, takes time for so many naughty kids...
---
 They're almost ready to pounce I believe.
---
Everyone else here is lying, thats a terrible, useless legendary... Let me save you the trouble of throwing it away, ill just take that off your hands. :)
---
Seriously, if that had +40% power swing damage instead of +1 str, that could be a 2 hit queen killer in the right hands
---
I've been doing this too! I'm trying to get images of all the non-aggressive wildlife first (squirrels, beavers, possums, etc). I've found that "Pacify" helps a bit. But they still move around and you have to time it right.
---
I've found some clean skiing outfit that was red and green, and some fisherman's overalls. I've heard the longhorseman outfit is there but haven't seen it in game yet. 
---
U should be helping me out lol 
---
You just can't reason with some people. Others, they'll give you a decent conversations and the rest .. well they just hit a up or down vote button and move on &gt;.&lt;, lol.
---
But I agree. It's no different with tech, food, media. People keep defending multi billion dollar companies that lie, cheat and steal from them.

Some people never learn. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Some plans have the wrong name. I've never seen any greyed out even when I have duplicates. I only know I already learned it by pressing the button to read it and nothing happening.

Some of them really need better names.

I have heard of people having problems like this, but I don't know the solution.
---
What you're saying is fucking stupid. If you got a 3 star every time, you'd get everything you want quicker and then you'd be crying "there's no end game now that I have everything I want".
---
Sugar grove has many fans(steel, screws), clipboards(springs), and some globes. Plus it's all robot enemies so steel/lead/aluminum from them. The place has quite a bit more to grab as well. Just make sure you search thoroughly the first time, or you may not notice how much you can get each time. Gor example, a metal shelf in the largest room has like 10 clipboards on it alone.
---
I have one on the PC - a second account. I now have alts for everything though weirdly I'm slowly levelling a few of them for better perks. ;)
---
I bought the Vault Tec bed and it worked for me, it's a clean undressed bed. I was annoyed because I was hoping for one with bedsheets.
---
Some Items require specific Perks (sometimes higher level), but don't always display the requirement.
---
The Rad Shower may require the Home Defense Perk to be maxed out, &amp; equipped.
---
This will literaly only force people to spray explosive weapons and 1 shotting everything so they can get the exp. I am talking about the tag ability. 
---
The dupe should be priority N1. 
---
"no cosmetics except from the shop" have y'all even seen all the outfits? I'm wearing a cop hat with a slave collar on in just a harness. Most of the outfits for sale in shop are just clean versions of what you can find in game
---
No offense but your character acts like a total weirdo. No wonder some people don't follow. Try it with a clown costume on or something to be less creepy!
---
Anti armor explosive double with reload speed would be up there considering there are no cards for shotgun armor pen. 
---
Hmm yea that's odd. I'm on PS4 as well using a PS4 pro and 150Mbps+/- speeds haven't run into that issue though, even when using remote play to my vita.
---
"NOTHING like the big one" -- ? 
---
check yo eyes
---
&gt; If they build it wrong and advertized it wrong, it's not my fault.
---
You mean, if I picked up a game that isn't the kind of game I like, it's their fault for making a game that isn't what I want. 
---
Which is basically all you are telling us about yourself.
---
How would you know if the side quests are boring? You didn't do them. 
---
You didn't play the game. You rushed through it for only certain parts. 
---
And now your trying to cover your ass because someone saw through your bullshit.
---
Just because you don't like a game, or doesn't pleasure you, doesn't automatically make it a bad game. Just not for you. You're just way to immature to realize something as simple as that. 
---
But please, enlighten us more. (No really don't)
---
I don't agree with that i don't think it should be possible to fight a end game boss and get a 1 star lead pipe or something lame like that., You have better luck just staying at white spring then.
---
Shweeet 
---
true but im no good at the game sadly haha
---
But what if some people don't think they fucked up so bad?
---
?
---
Yep, mostly inside silos or just after nuking the queen.
---
And how does other people defending Bethesda hurt you exactly? Sounds to me like they are enjoying the game. How is that a crime 
---
Really !? I learned the plan and it didn't work.....
---
Yeah, heaven forbid the end game isn't just a mindless grindfest.
---
thank you very much
---
It doesn't look like it at all. It's the same type of machinery but looks nothing like the atom punk styled one in Fallout
---
Not every 3* is a god roll. Most of the 3* drops I get are useless. But when you launch a nuke and kill the queen, a 1* walking cane is kind of a kick in the nuts.
---
Use the tormentor perk in the luck tree. 
---
You're right. But with our stash boxes constantly overflowing and the grind intensifying in endgame adding to the issue, it's really easy to do so. The game does warn me however, that I'm about to discard an item pruchased in the atom shop, despite being able to craft it anytime.
---
I don't see why they wouldn't just kill you and give the caps back. You were doing others a solid by destroying the the CAMP.
---
Hahaha now that’s awesome
---
its a shame to be conned so easily
---
i fell for it too
---
They will never discuss security side with random scrubs like you and me so don't pretend you have special knowledge. ;)
---
If it's client side, it makes it too easy to make client side manipulations such as cap/stash/inventory editing. Just looking at Borderlands for example, with the whole modded weapons portion.
---
Regular Show! Man, that show had the best songs.

I put it more kindly by saying "it's the hope and dreams", but the idea is certainly not "If I buy this ticket, I'm certain to win". People buy tickets because they MIGHT win, and buying is a small effort for that.
---
My vision of a small effort in fallout 76 is to play : I have fun wandering in the wasteland, finding scenes I hadn't seen yet and occasionnaly helping players. 
---
Your small effort is apparently to server hop, because your fun is to have the best gear to feel at your maximum potential.
---
Those are both authorised and legit. Is it hard to understand ?
---
Hopefully only if wearing a stetson or possibly equipping it as a melee weapon.
---
Unless it is off the back of the clubhouse or where the ghouls spawn on the golf course, it shouldn't be a problem.
---
No point in fighting these fucks. They all say the exact same thing. "I read the first and last pages of this book- it sucks!"
---
That's my point!

I’d love to see someone jumping in Morse Code ...imagine what they’d look like to others walking by! Lol 
---
Yea I'll take some screenshots of it tonight and post later. I was using remote play on my Vita so the picture was awful didn't want to take any last night.
---
Thanks I should have assumed that it was like that
---
Don't see how this post is trash not everyone want to get their weapons from trading.
---
tips: 
---
* If you find any treasure maps, save for later levels. Items you find are scaled to your level and it's a great way to get higher level weapons.
---
* If you have one luck point to spare, slot in pharma farma. press SPACE (idk what's on consoles) to specifically search. Meds and Chems for Days.
---
* Marathoner perk does not work in Power Armor, so if you use it, don't waste your points
---
* If you find Optimized Servos Leg mod for your power armor, consider using it (even just one piece). It allows for much longer sprinting and often bugs out allowing long sprints without using AP.
---
* Learn item values, some items you find are really valuable, but weight next to nothing. Especially some outfits like Straight Jacket, Ranger Outfit, Golfers outfit/skirt etc. Weight next to nothing and can be sold to vendors for considerable caps.
---
* If you're playing with higher level enemies, carry a "tag" weapon to get exp/loot from monsters. Preferably something lightweight with plenty and easy ammo, fast single shot fire rate, easy handling and maybe with holo scope. Laser pistol, for example, is perfect. it has good range, no recoil, decent mag and fire rate, tracer round so will see what you hit and if you mod it to do burning damage you'll know (and more imprtantly, others too) that you have tagged your targets. Then higher levels can kill whatever. 
---
* Two Shot is actually not favorable prefix for a shotgun. Don't trust the sheet DPS. Shotgun shoot pellets (combat shotgun 7 of them). two shot will add just a single pellet. So bloodied or furiuos for example will be much better (or even zealots against scorched). Dupers like to brag, but don't fall to their trap.
---
* Learn to food. It's really useful and will and some decent bonuses, like bonus agility, strenght, ap regen, endurance, etc
---
* Weapon Artisan will overepair melee weapons and add pretty substantional amount of damage on top of your weapon (goes back to normal, until it's CND is back to 100%), fast swinging weapons will benefit more, as the bonus is flat amount. Similarly, Fix it Good,f or example, will "overrepair" power amors and add bonus ballistic resistance.
---
Just go on and spend money on the game, but stop disrupting legit discussions
---
True workshops are great for doing that because you don't have to worry about budget issues or the materials.  Just grab one of the not popular workshops and drop a ton of pumps or purifiers there, as a bonus you will get free plans for the defend missions.
---
Diabolical!
---
They defend them because they throughly enjoy the product
---
To be honest I miss multiplayer games where the point wad the journey together or solo. There wasn't an end game to achieve. No rush to hit max level because whether you rushed or took your time it didn't seem to matter. There were so many things to do and you could do them repeatedly, once and done or not at all. No legendary gear, no sets to collect. There was a community to build or destroy. Factions were player created. 
---
So, bugs aside, hearing players complain about the lack of end game content is laughable. It's like you forget how to pretend. How to use your imagination. "If the game doesn't provide it directly, then I don't want to play it." 
---
I'm not going to make excuses for Bethesda. They fucked up. They know they fucked. But how should they fix it, truly? Fight that unwinnable battle trying to constantly provide new content or provide us the tools for us to create our own content? Perhaps both in the end, but I would choose the latter first. Others will want the former. Most  will likely want both at the same time. 
---
If I roll through and someone is one shotting, fuck them I will too.
---
If I roll through and people aren't, I'll equip my SMG and tag 
---
I'd be careful in case Bethesda decides to ban people based on how unrealistic amounts of items they have on them.
---
This is an answer I can respect.
---
From a security standpoint though, keeping that file encrypted when the game isn’t being played, much like the Windows SAM file, and using a hash to validate it hasn’t been altered since last play, are some measures that could be used to prevent that. 
---
That was nice
---
Think of it as a self funded non profit donation service, like the Salvation Army 
---
I have only served hopped for vendor plans. I love being able to craft my weapons as I level. I also love collecting all weapon plans available.
---
The only way to get the plans I wanted was to server hop. There is no organic way to get the plans otherwise. Some are locked behind levels and some are only sold by certain vendors.
---
The vendors having random inventory is an absolutely stupid design. 
---
I'm glad I did what I did. Even now at lvl 80 I still don't have a legendary weapon but my crafted weapons kick ass.
---

---
What's wrong with a lowbie one-shotting if you're going to kill the mobs anyway? It's not like you get diminished XP, is it?
---
Greenking2000 is gay
---
Why is it OK for someone to think they fucked up so horrendously but not OK for someone to think they didn't?  
---
Why should we? If we enjoy the game, our opinions are no longer "legit?" Seems like you don't want a discussion. You just want to vent your anger
---
Other people having different opinions makes me so mad! Only I know how to save the multi-billion dollar gaming industry that despite record profits is in serious peril!!! ONLY MEEEEEeeeeeeee!!

This is accurate. I ordered and then tried to cancel, even before the plastic fiasco and they just ignored me and charged my credit card. Whole story here if you want: [Unboxing Disappointment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8bjJGG_EYw)

Hey man, I think it's really fucking cool that you play with your whole family like that! 
---
See it’s the little things like that that people appreciate at least I do I’ve saw the Guilded Grasshopper and the wedding band (which you can equip) thanks Bethesda
---
I mean yeah the one in the game has got one hell of a touch up but this seems to have very similar schematics and looks to be pure inspiration for the one in game. 
---
I played the game. That's it.
---
But sure, enlighten me how i should play the game your way, how i should do inventory management, whatever. 
---
I dont give a shit. I dont enjoy the game and I'm sad they fucked up this big opportunity so hard. 
---
The good thing is, I still know beth will learn from this and either never do another online game like this again and focus on their core strengths or they will get better people designing the core features. 
---
I lost my first fancy chest piece mashing the deposit button. Oops!
---
nice but anyone with half a brain would see this as a trap and/or just destroy the wall with like two shots with TSE since everyone has em. still nice tho
---
I did the same thing with the shock traps by created a double door way into my house. If anyone tried to follow me into my house or I lured them in they would be shocked to death by about 10 shock traps and die unless they healed. If they did heal I would repair the traps or kill them if they became wanted from breaking out.
---
Whos pretending, Mr Uppety Pants.
---
Just passing on what I saw in an earlier Reddit... smart arse :-)
---
Nice, so that is better than a shotgun with enforcer? What is the best rifle to use it with?
---
Yeah, insult your audience. Great plan to get people on board with your statement. 
---
I've literally searched for the BoS Officer Uni over and over and never found one but had 3 Handmade Plans stacked up before I gave them away to friends. I just kept finding them at vendors so I bought them. Now if only I could get that luck with a jetpack.
---
Totally agree. It shouldn't even be allowed bad rolls either. It's literally the end game boss. Should be a guaranteed 3 star end game drop. Not useless stuff we vendor 
---
Can you imagine willingly doing something for 40+ hours that you hate xD, then coming online and saying "I hated it. it sucked." I played RDR2 for about 40 hours I'd say. The game is great, but lacking in a lot of areas that would make me enjoy it. So when FO76 came out I literally have not played a single minute of RDR2 since. It's not because the game sucks. It's just because I like FO76 better, and get way more enjoyment out of playing it. It's almost like things you enjoy are a matter of opinion instead of fact...
---
Is it really bad parenting skills to show your kids what life after nuclear fallout could be like? Odds are it'll happen in their lifetime; if anything it's training.
---
I won't let my kids have a phones in those conditions until they're closer to being an adults. Games however like R rated movies are on a case by case basis. I was just saying that there are far more serious examples of blatant bad parenting. In this case it's not bad at all. Here the 2 kids play with their parents and uncle.
---
Bro I love kids and I actually have 4 of my own, bullies are the bottom of the barrel for me along with boy touchers. What may seem harmless and fun to you is destructive to others, we have to be considerate of others otherwise the world will not get better
---
Just nuke em. The silo skip glitch makes the launch take about 10 minutes if you have a explosive shotgun or run a good melee build.
---
this would kind of be boring, imo. I don't want to just sit there watching an npc walk around for 2 minutes. I think for low-level characters that would be fine, but for the upper level characters, that would be crazy annoying. 
---
Whitesprings is awesome, man. Quirky personalities, that neat little interaction, unique soda you can't get anywhere else (Besides my nuka machine when player vending comes out...)
---
Why this one? This TYPE of machine exists all over the world and Bethesda probably googled images of machines like that to create their model. I don't see why this specific one would be the inspiration.
---
Alright satan calm down
---
So wait it's OK to rag constantly on the game and whine and complain about everything, but it's not OK for people to dare say they like the game and are having fun to counter them? Who nominated you as the fucking speech police?
---
&gt; "lolol this is what would happen if Bethesda designed this scene/game/world"
---
To be fair, that happened *well* before 76, and applies to many of their games.
---
I agree with this to an extent. 
---
Some people just aren't patient and that has to be accepted. 
---
I am personally level 130 but I just play a lot and utilize exp boosts constantly. 
---
However I have never server hopped for an item. I have server hopped to tweak my mutations, admittedly.
---
I just found my first X01 calibrated shocks mod last night organically though and it felt very nice to not have to spend hours hopping servers to find it. 
---
Agreed, maybe then we’d see more fissure nukes instead of 99% of them at whitesprings. 
---
Why do they put camps there they get no xp and can’t loot?
---
Seriously?? I'm just a heavy weapons guy so idk much about melee. I do have some other 1h stuff that might be decent then too. 
---
3* Chinese officer sword: 40% power attk dmg, +30% ghouls, +1 endurance
---
3* Assaultron Blade: +50% limb dmg, dmg increased each consecutive hit, 15% less dmg while blocking
---
But I know those arent as good as the one I posted.
---
Same run i also got a 3* Raiders left leg: -8% dmg from players, +25 psn resistance, and weapon weights reduced by 20%. Guess today I've done good so far at whitesprings lol
---
When a SB is in the air a rifle is best in my opinion. I like the handmade rifle the most. However I don’t have much experience with shotguns. 
---
Exactly why I said they need to remove the tag ability 
---
Well I mean they do tell you to take a seat.
---
I mean... we’ve got *skulls* on our caps! 
---
If there is a base there while you are farming the golf shop, run around the back and close the back doors then draw all the Zeds ( ghouls) down there and to the lower level and the base can't kill them (as fast or easily).  Learned that yesterday by chance. 
---
Once you finish, you get a key to the safe. In the safe, on every server you spawn, are 8 stimpacks. 
---
Same as every other time. Single server maintenance. Anything major is announced.
---
It's automatic for me, and has been that way since the B.E.T.A. I guess some people turned it off?
---
I have retired the whitesprings nuke. Don't even get excited for it anymore. Between everyone level 45 and above having tse weapons that flatten hoards, and the floating turret houses and the nerfed spawns, it just is t worth the struggle for all the 1 star legendary weapons and gear. I got a 300 cap bounty for throwing about 5 orbital strike beacons at a dudes house the other day. Bring back the old whitesprings. 
---
There is a better way.
---
Walk to the fissure site SE of the golf club. Anger the scorchbeast. Train it to the turret camp. Scorchbeast does the rest.
---
hell no, want to make TSE absolute? fix the dupe glitch, add 4\* and higher enemy level. and nerf explosives so it takes more shots.
---
Dude, they somehow go from "Yay best company ever!" to "they're a bunch of greedy fucks like EA who don't care about their fans" with just this one game
---
It's safe to say people are kinda overreacting *alot* about Bethesda. Yeah, Bethesda is a big company but they don't deserve this much abuse after just this one game. 
---
Haha me too.
---
I'm with you, but the tallest point on the map is Spruce Knob. 
---
I didn't even care about the caps tbh, was just odd it took so long to find someone to take a free bounty lol
---
Alright cool, so go for the highest ROF single-shot handmade. Nice!
---
Don’t let Vox see this
---
I didn't say I hate the game.
---
The 40hours were aside from bugridden stuff pretty fun. But then, when a gamer like me realize that that's it, everything just gets... Boring. 
---
And for a 40h mini coop with a superficial story and bugs etc, this game isn't worth its money. 
---
And a big disappointment. I waited 10 years for a koop/mmo bethesda game. And they fuck it up that hard. 
---
I see! I haven't found that mask then unfortunately...but at least you can get the outfit. :(
---
r/IrishPotatoHead will grind screws and springs for you if you lose the patience for it. Hit him up if you don't want to deal with it.
---
but how else am I supposed to teach my friend to not run into every situation screaming like a idiot......
---
This has been "a feature" of the engine since Skyrim I think. It's the little details that make the world and FO76 is full of little details that most of the players will miss.
---
For me, shotgun. Double barrel shotgun with master shotgunner and enforcer perks maxed.
---
Enforcer stuns enemies, and in the case for scorchbeasts, stunning means they have more difficulty to fly and stay on ground longer where they're more fragile.
---
I farm the same places listed, but what really made a difference for me was getting the perks to double repair condition and reduce weapon/armor damage taken. 
---
I now find I usually have a few hundred of each because I’m not blowing through them as quickly. 
---
How do you delete anything?
---
I have the same issue as you. I did a hard reset on my box and after that I didn't crash the test of the day. Coincidence? I'm not sure but I was able to play after that.
---
deathclaws need love to... but they got to pay..... someone else cause I'm not going there
---
Looks like you didn't really thought that out.
---
Just ignore them man. Your life will be 100 times better once you stop giving them attention. 
---
My theory is that the ghost of Todd slaps you from time to time for not buying Skyrim for the OUYA for like the 50th time, but hey this is a theory. A TODD THEORY! Thanks for wasting like 10 sec to read my memey text. :)
---
Another "I enjoy the game so the criticism is unwarranted thread". You can enjoy it, but it is by no means a great product (I'd even argue a finished product). Hell I could enjoy watching paint dry, but that does mean I should fall in line.
---
Maybe you’re right. 
---
I leave my purifier's open and my settlement is just open with no walls. I have turrets to protect but until someone does something to damage i don't see the issue.
---
An opinion other than yours isn't legitimate? Sounds like reddit
---
Ah, same. I always thought i was never going to have to worry about that, yet here we are.
---
The other day, my in-laws stopped by unannounced just as my friends and I got through biometrics in one of the silos. "Aren't you going to come down and say hello?" "Yeah, just... Give me a minute..." It was our first time going into a silo, so I had no idea how long that what was going to be, but... yeah, it was longer than a minute.
---
I know the plans for brick walls but every once in a while for some reason it shows that I do not know them but it still lets me place them down. Same for other objects at random. 
---
Unknown if the two bugs are related. 
---
These are beautiful, good work 
---
That's an easy question, shotgun, while they on air you cripple their wings and when it lands you shoot the floor between the legs to maximize damage, consumes less ammo than the handmade and helps the melee players around to have a chance to get a hit on it. 
---
Handmade deals an ok damage output, higher than shotgun if you can keep up with the ammo and it's easier to land crits with it. But it does not help anyone around. 
---
Resume: if you have ppl around who know what they are doing go handmade, if you just want to jump into a random queen nuke zone use shotgun
---
I'd take a few handfuls of screws and those late game things that are a pain to collect. Nothing major though, otherwise you might as well be cheating yourself.
---
Shotgun has greater burst output per shot which would mean better dps 
---
Oh god no
---
&gt; Super small stash limit in a fucking hoarder game (all bethesda games have ever been)
---
The stash limit sucks, but not because it's limited. The stash limit sucks because most items are way too heavy. Rifles weigh 17-18 lbs when modded (with no Perks to reduce weight). A handful of Bobby Pins weigh as much as a Missile. If Bethesda really took time to address the individual weights of certain items then the Stash Limit / Inventory Management wouldn't be as much of a chore as it is now.
---
However, I sort-of agree with the Stash Limit because it promotes economy. Why would we *ever* need to Trade with one another if we could all store infinite amounts of components / ammo / aid items? I find myself in constant need of Plastic and routinely trade it for Lead (I have almost 2000 lead but always run low on Gunpowder because Shotgun ammo is a motherfucker to craft).
---
However, I would agree with you in general that the Stash Limit needs to be addressed. It was poorly implemented for this game; a game that has historically promoted hoarding ([I had a similar post about this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6ge27/this_game_has_taught_me_one_truth_bethesda_knows/))
---
&gt; Impractical and unintuitive skill system with tedious switcheroos.
---
I agree. The Perk Card system is not intuitive at all. There are several ways to address it that would positively impact other aspects of the game. I had some ideas in another thread, but I deleted it because of the general toxicity this community has at times:
---
- Weapon Perk Cards should be three-fold bonuses for Damage, Durability, and Weight. For example, each rank of Rifleman should increase damage 10%, make them break 10% slower, and make them weight 10% less.
---
- First Aid, Pharmacist, and Traveling Pharmacy should all be one Perk Card.
---
- Demolition Expert, Fire in the Hole, and Grenadier should all be one Perk Card. It should also be a 3-Rank Perk Card that increases damage, range, and radius by 20 / 40 / 60% (yes it would be a nerf to explosive damage but I think it would be a fair trade-off)
---
- Perk Cards should be organized in 2 groups: Active, and Passive. Cards that simply address carry weight, spoil time, or crafting should be marked as passive. Things that improve combat and character strength are active.
---
- After level 50 you should be able to spend your points to either get a new Perk Card, respec a SPECIAL, or "Specialize" a Perk Card, which would reduce the SPECIAL cost of that Perk Card by 1 point. For example, you could spend 2 levels to make Rifleman go from 3 PER to 1 PER (same for Expert / Master Rifleman). This would allow more complex builds, allowing characters to actually get more powerful past level 50.10
---
&gt; Literally no endgame. None at all.
---
To be fair, this is the case with basically every online game that's come out since WoW in 2004. The problem lies with how these games are developed. Online games need to be developed backwards, as in they focus on the end-game and then work their way back to the starting levels. However, the case is usually the opposite (which is why the first 20-or-so levels of any online game is a blast, but then fizzles out pretty quickly).
---
And also -- No Bethesda game has ever had End-Game Content. I'm not saying it's an excuse, but it wasn't a surprise to me that there weren't "Raids" or "Dungeons" for this game.
---
&gt; No reason to play in a team except for the "everything is better together" reason.
---
I play solo 99% of the time because none of my gaming friends play this game. The lack of shared XP is a huge reason to NOT team-up. The horrible Team interface is another reason. But I imagine it's still quite fun for people who are playing this game with friends.
---
I think Team-play will be addressed as this game evolves -- once Bethesda balances things out a bit, and creates some legitimately difficult content that requires groups.
---
&gt; Hilariously broken pvp.
---
Can't argue there. I keep Passive Mode on because PvP is so wonky and unpredictable. The only time I ever "PvP" is when I accidentally get a Wanted Flag and sacrifice myself to another player to clear the Bounty.
---
&gt; Stupid implementation of explosive weapons. Yeah, they're fun, but hell after you get one everything is oneshot.
---
Agreed, but this ties into balancing. This was the same case with FO4. I purposely avoided Explosive Shotguns / Miniguns in FO4 because they made a laughably easy game even more easy.
---
&gt; Duping ruined economy for ever, even if they add new leveled gear etc. Firstly caps are ruined, secondly even my lvl 25 explosive sg oneshots everything.
---
I'm not sure how old you are, but if you played Diablo 2 this whole Duping thing feels familiar. It got to a point in D2 where hacking was so *di rigueur* that you literally couldn't play the game unless you were hacking. Blizzard addressed it by releasing a mandatory patch that wiped all characters / items, and blocked you from playing the game unless you were running that game version. People didn't like it, but it fixed the game for another few years.
---
So chin-up. I'm confident Bethesda is aware of the duping epidemic, and is also aware of the long-term repercussions of duped items (namely inflation). Let's give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll address it beyond simply "fixing the glitch"
---
&gt; No NPCs wtf? Noone listens to holotapes if you talk with a friend via comm.
---
Meh. I understand why they did what they did. It does get a bit lonely in Appalachia, but it wasn't like we weren't warned in advanced that there'd be no NPCs.
---
&gt; Legendary farm is the onky thing to do.
---
Only if you blitzed to max-level and spent 0 time immersing yourself in the game / world. This really only effects people who are trying to play this game as if it's a Raiding MMO -- it isn't; it's an online survival co-op RPG FPS
---
&gt; Super imbalanced character builds.
---
Agreed, but this ties back into the Perk Card system. Builds are unbalanced because the Perk Cards / Perk Card System was designed to look good on paper, but not properly tested in application.
---
&gt; Awkward gunplay.
---
I think this is more of a result of shitty servers. One of the reasons Melee builds are so popular is because it's easier to control. While the damage bug has largely been fixed, there are definitely still times where I'm unloading headshots on an enemy from 150 yards away and they're not taking any damage. Then the server "catches up" and that enemy is suddenly in my face beating my ass.
---
However, there are some guns that are just fuckin' wonky. Shotguns in particular get pretty wonky as you attach longer barrels to them (even with the Skeet Shooter Perk).
---
And almost all Energy Weapons are unusable for numerous reasons.
---
&gt; Way too less customization.
---
How do you mean? Character customization? CAMP customization? I would disagree; I feel this game has boatloads of customization. Especially now that you can wear outfits over armor for style.
---
&gt; INGAME SHOP with hilsrious prices.
---
Who cares? Nothing in there is worth buying anyway, especially not for the exorbitant prices Bethesda is charging. If we stop buying their stupid shit at their stupid prices, Bethesda will get the hint. Unfortunately, gaming has become a cash-dump system and "microtransactions" have gone from pennies to dollars.
---
&gt; Nearly no cosmetics except ingame shop.
---
Meh. I'm fine with this. If Bethesda keeps their ingame shop items exclusively for cosmetics and not Pay-to-Win shit, this game will stay pure.
---
yeah but lets face it how many of us play 600 hours of fallout/skyrim for the story  
---
reminds me I need to finish the story of fallout 4 and skyrim....
---
I’m the same I personally enjoy the grind and randomness of the game. I played with a friend who from day one did all the glitches and stuff to have the best stats and mutations and to be basically broken and then says the game is boring. I love this game and I know it’s gonna get better I can’t wait for the day it does 
---
I don't even check registers anymore since prewar money is useless, and there is never anything else in them.  Sometimes you'd find caps in them in previous Fallout games, I don't know why there aren't now.
---
That's my problem with the whole handmade plan. I think it's another case of reddit thinking something yet again (see the "trade stealing exploit")
---
Laser weapons and plasma weapons in general are in need of a lot of love. As you said, not only do they barely scratch enemies but they break as if made from sugar glass. I found crafting plans for an Ultracite Gatling Laser and crafted it thinking it would be awesome. It looks pretty cool and slightly different colour scheme to a normal GL but the damage... It does about as much as the 10mm pistol. The only advantage it has over the pistol is the DPS from the rate of fire. The fact that it only does more damage than a pistol because of the RoF is insulting. Even a normal Minigun does more base damage and fires far faster.
---
I built a Gatling Plasma and it didn't even get through two cores before it broke and that was after it had been repaired to 200% durability. I don't like that the "Power User" perk only applies to Fusion Cores either. It let's a Gatling Laser have up to 999 shots per core but the Plasma is limited to 250. It doesn't matter really even with the GP missing at least 50% shots because it still does more damage total than the GL and UGL.
---
I've ranted too much on posts about how there is a complete lack of weapon diversity throughout the game regardless of level. Bethesda have a very big job on their hands to balance them all out and I really hope they don't just nerf the stronger weapons (I don't count explosive in that) because there is no fun in having to use 100s of rounds to kill normal mobs.
---
I'll have to confirm this one. Thanks for your response.
---
I check this reddit to see if people are still blindly following a cash-grab
---
See that I am right
---
Nothing to see here folks, just another person in Bethesda's pocket.
---
honestly I take a day farming schematics by server hoping then split the rest of my week into legit questing and OHH WHATS THAT IN THE DISTANCE wandering about
---
Someone else previously suggested a hard weight limit and I disagreed at the time but now that I think about it maybe we do need that. At least until they fix all the duping methods if that's even possible.
---
Thanks for this PSA!  
---
For those looking.  If you are standing between the Golf Club and Tennis Courts looking back towards Resort direction....Go left of the Tennis court and it will be just past the tennis court on the left.  It looks like this [https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshot/11233460](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshot/11233460) 
---
There is a concrete wall surrounding outside the gazebo....the water fountain is on that wall....on the tennis court side of the gazebo.  It looks like this [https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshot/11233461](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/amber-71-stars/screenshot/11233461) 
---
A level 92 Glowing Deathclaw came by when we visited.  Low levels dont worry though because you can stand inside the gazebo where it cant access you and you can shoot it.  
---
Nope, can slap xbox files on a flash drive and edit them on a computer then put them back on the xbox
---
Thanks for sharing about the simple modern bed plan. I'll have to grab that one.
---
I think shotgun and enforcer are still the better options for the majestic air dark flap flap
---
E... E... E... E... E...
---
Thank you all for this analysis. I needed this information and lack of compilation makes finding info annoying at times.
---
Not sure if a joke or not. But agreed? It's gone now.
---
It really is cool. :) 
---
The name of the plan won't be greyed out. If you look at the button on the bottom of your pip boy (A button for Xbox One console) that button will be greyed out to "learn the plan". Thanks for your response.
---
What a great idea! I love more the murder chiurch but this trap is awesome too.   
---
I hope to find you and your camps on xbox :D  
---
Why post a comment about not understanding why we play F76? The real question is why are you hanging around the forums of a "dead" game you apparently stopped playing. I play it because my son and my brother and I always talked about fallout and now we can play together in that world 4 states away. We love it. Yes, we get disconnected on rare occasions (I know that our experience does not mirror other players but on the Xbox for some reason we just don't get DC'd very often), but we enjoy exploring and having fun together, even with the bugs. We couldn't care less about duping except where it slows down our server.
---
all I see is a weirdly shaped tree (let me have this denial)
---
Easy tiger. Free speech. Just let people talk and enjoy your game.
---
I have the brick wall plans and haven't encountered that same issue but I do believe it has occurred. Thanks for your response.
---
Perhaps it was the Vault Tec bed 2. I think it was the Vault Tec bed. It adds a second really bland metal bed with a mattress. It's almost the same as the one you get from the Overseer's camp, but cleaner.
---
Yes, I have it now. It took 3 attempts. The fancy bed is also a bare mattress.
---
Why would you build a bed and a mattress but not make a simple sheet to put on it?
---
Behold the man who has no grasp on the concept of hyperbole!
---
You see humans do this thing called exaggeration, usually it's done to emphasize a point.

Thank you for the offer mate, but I already have the 1 star one.

They were never the best company ever lol
---
Paging u/LoneVaultWanderer. 
---
Don't forget E.T.
---
Miss and not appreciate ... it is all of these things that makes you want to play and persist.
---
Well not quite, because if it was 100% claimed the Turrets would become yours, since you own the Workshop, wouldn't they? 
---
And what would prevent the user from editing the file while the character is logged in, this bypassing the issue of not being altered since logged in?
---
In regards to the file being encrypted, (no offense to Bethesda's engineers) I wouldn't trust any level of encryption for 100% assurances that a file could not be manipulated. Even if one person was and to access the file, figure out what was in it, and how to edit, the whole solution would be bunked. I can imagine a copied version of the file ending up online with instructions on editing.
---
yea, I scrapped calibrated shocks for my t60 when crafting ammo and fixing a gun. I know they aren't as rare as x01 parts, but still a lot of hopping to get them. 
---
**I noticed that the game will often consume your mods BEFORE breaking down any bulked items like steel... just an FYI.** 
---
Last saturday I was d/c'd twice within an hour time span. I just stopped playing at that point. Was just tired of getting progress resetted. 
---
Fun fact: if you ask Siri where the nearest concentration camp, she will.... have an answer for you.
---
Rifle.  Shotgun does very little or no damage to scorch beasts that are flying. Rifle can kill them within seconds on sight.
---
As for enforcer making them land, I've never had this work. I'd like to see a video of it being  done, since I've never seen it being done by anyone.
---
I didn't know that. I wish they'd show us before we bought it.
---
You still doing this?
---
How did China ever survive against the Col. Gutsy's? Seems like a platoon of them could take an entire Chinese tank division.
---
I was in a queen farming party and was watching one guy take her from 90% - 20% in one hit. he might have had a supersledge now that I think about it, but it had those effects (swapping out the str for power attack).
---
He said he got his damage up to 8000 with temporary buffs...  dont know the rest of his loadout/perk cards, but he said he used psycho, cooked yao guai, mutant hound chops, maybe one or two more chems.
---
"Back off, bruh" xD
---
This is great. I need to play more of this game with people like yourself lmao.
---
Same, but I'm PS4 and stuck at work. Like the title
---
Down the main stairs works just fine, same with inside the front door, or at the back door...all seem to work fine.
---
I did that a couple of times. I think if I go slower it's less likely to crash, but it's hard to tell what's what.
---
Inventory management is such a massive chore as it is.
---
Something about an ivory grip. That's all I heard between cursing.
---
I know, can't tell you how many duplicate plans I have. Very inefficient game mechanic.
---
Ive found Red and Green ski outfit, Purple ski outfit, Clean(?) witches outfit, clean spacesuit, clean spacesuit helmet, clean ranger hat, clean ranger outfit, Longshoreman outfit, grey fishermans overalls, brown fishermans overalls.
---
GTAO was still playable and had content on release. Fallout 76 was literally unplayable with constant crashes every 20 minutes for half the playerbase and once you reach level50 there is LITERALLY no endgame other than grind nukes in whitespring. To top all of that bethesda decided to screw over customers over and over with false advertisement and scams. So yea you cant really compare GTAO to FO76
---
That's really cool - thank you for sharing it.  Love reading about stuff like this.
---
Funny that the first thought is "why didn't they scrap it?"  Then you think about what tearing something like that apart would entail and realize why it's just rotting in a field.
---
Rifle. Shotgun does almost no dmg to flying SB due to a bug.
---
Also I've never seen enforcer make a SB land before. I need video proof of this.
---
A combat shotgun with enforcer rank 3.  You don't take damage perks,range perks or anything else.  A buddy I duo with often rolls heavy, puts in Enforcer when we do SBQ and within a mag or two of blasting away at her close to mid range her wings are crippled and down she comes.  Super easy and just a perk card swap in and out.

I use a Shotgun, a Rifle, and an M79 Launcher (counts as a Shotgun).
---
I eat Scorchbeasts for breakfast. Shoot their wings with a Rifle while they're Sonic-Boom Spamming. When they land, shoot a M79 round into their face, bust out ol' Mr. Boomstick, and cripple the wings / head.
---
I currently have 5 Legendary Combat Shotguns with varying effects, and have traded off a couple of others, I am also a Shotgun/Rifle build character, so here's my 2 caps worth:
---
Best Prefix in order of quality: Instigating, Furious, Anti Armor, Stalker's, Zealot's (for SBs)
---
Best Majors: Exploding, +50% Limb damage (for close combat)
---
Best Minors: 90% Reduced Weight, 15% Faster reload, 250 DR while reloading
---
I do not have any Pump or Double Barrels, I trade them off as quickly as I find them, although I know the Pumps have better range and accuracy, but that's what I have the Rifles for, and I prefer the ammo capacity &amp; fire rate of the combat shotgun,
---
My Stalker's, Explosive, 90% Reduced Weight, will destroy a SB in 7-10 shots (less than 3 seconds) when it's close enough to detect my stealthy character.
---
Same with Xbox. This is why we have been trying to kill the queen outside the fallout zone. This helps the framerate tremendously. So far I have not had one crash while fighting her like this. It's still 50/50 inside the fallout zone.
---
PS4 cam confirm. I think it has to do with the ridiculous amount of robots and ghouls all in one area. Then someone nukes the place and it is Hell on Earth literally.
---
Okay so I sort if agree with you to a point. Is there alot of fallout 76 news yes but this game is on everyone's radar right now. There are several reasons why first every game before 76 that Bethesda made was just awesome( yes even fallout 4) its shocking to see them create a game this bad. Next when is the last time you heard of a game hyped up and as anticipated as fallout 76 being this bad.you bring up no mans sky as an example that game was a disappointment but that's all it was. It was not as bad as fallout 76 is. Like fallout 76 is well its not super man 64 bad but its worse then sim city bad which is saying something. The updates also honestly feel like too little to late and alot more needs to be done but even worse is how fundamentally broken the game is updates wont do much. And even defenders of the game are getting annoyed with how little the game is improving right now. This game feels like an anomaly where it came out at a time where everyone dose need something to focus all the burns they have felt over the past year with gaming or just stuff in general. Yes there is alot of hate for fallout 76 but there are so many factors that go into why this game is being attacked so much.
---
&gt; Plus, while there are some hilarious bugs (who among us Forest players HASN'T been catapulted 30 feet into the air because we tried to interact with a log sled at a weird angle?),
---
But after 3 years of BETA there are still bugs like that in the game?
---
Still very impressive that such a small team could pull that off either way. It looks really interesting and if I had a better PC I'd check it out lol.
---
Alas, you cannot. I went to try it (posted about similar findings to OP recently) and fell straight through as I swung my All Rise at it. The result was me being temporarily trapped under the hatch after I fell in and it closed.
---
I’m not saying this is the best way, this is just what I found to be effective. I use an auto handmade with the 85 round mag on SB fights. Also I use the tank killer and tormentor perks. In addition I use the prime receiver, but the ultracite ammo is a PAIN to make. Once my current supply runs out I will stop using the prime receiver and go for a regular auto receiver. 
---
Sounds like we already have a barrier to pvp then. Want to pvp? Well first you're going to have to go find a stash to stick your junk in otherwise you risk losing it if the person you attack kills you or places a bounty on you.
---
Will try. Mine seemed to stop working after a while. Maybe my own fault, maybe not.
---
I luckily found those small lettering plans inside a toolbox in The Mire
---
From a Microsoft standpoint, on the XBox, that could be easily implemented. Like with the SAM file, once the machine is turned on, even system can’t access the file. But you are correct, once one person figures it out, it’s shot. And there already exists tools to break into the SAM file, but they’re sketchy at best in my experience. 
---
Not to mention the car you just bought goes on sale for a third the price a week later.
---
Two wendigo's eating a clown, one turns to the other and says "Does this taste funny to you?"
---
Fed
---
Are you on PC?  Im level 75 and haven’t launched a nuke yet either. 
---
Can confirm Flatwoods monster is not the only alien in the game. I don’t have proof, but even if I did I wouldn’t share it. Definitely find the truth yourself it’ll be more fun. 
---
wleer72 level 18 ( I think). I might be on later 
---
But there’s a fee
---
Exactly. I don't want to trade to get a gun or armor. I want to earn it. It feels damn good when you finally get it. Instant gratification rears it's ugly head again!
---
Not really the rich lore is still there. Listening and reading all the holo tapes. Everything is there to build the world.
---
Now if you choose not to do any of that. Fine. But it is your choice to make not the game.
---
Those perks work on full auto?!
---
but you do get loot, thats why they do it
---
I know this isn't the popular choice but equip Hard Bargain and pick up bulk set when you vendor. 
---
Equip Weapon Artisan when repairing weapons (200% durability) and equip Gunsmith to reduce wear. Lower your repair time and the junk you do get will stack up.
---
I know! I just like to pull their chain, and get them to start admitting things. Their own words undermine their points better than anything I could say.
---
I did everything in the game! 
---
Except explore the world. 
---
And craft, and listen to any holotapes. 
---
Or do any side quests. 
---
This game sucks, there's nothing to do. 
---
The best part is they want to be taken seriously as if they are experts. But you know this guy here. He went online and read up to level, get gear, and grind. Spent 20 hours getting to level 50, spent 20 hours getting to level 80. Level 40-80 was probably all in Whitesprings and Prime Fissure. Never launched a nuke himself. Always mooching off other nukes. Hanging out while others fought scorched beasts and taking 2-3 pot shots to get credit for kill to loot. 
---
We know his kind. Lazy. 
---
\*badum tsss\*
---
Haha i wasn't one of the ones in the video but you got me with this
---
That was the problem too many people there 
---
Wish everyone would just equip Teslas, pull both floors out the front door, and AoE them down like civilized people lol
---
Yes you can say something is true when the vast majority of people think so AND when theres clear evidence of it. This subreddit? theres like 3k people liking OP's post. Thats fuck all people.
---
So this post is old and they apparently have fixed this.  Using both now has a much higher benefit.  And here is my explanation:
---
Based on this Wiki page ([http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Action\_Points](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Action_Points)) a person with Agility rank 4 (like I currently have) should have 100 agility points (60 + 10\*4) (which is correct based on my stats) and the base regeneration rate is 6 per second.  So base with no mods it should take 16.67 seconds to go from 0 to 100%.  Lone wanderer should make that 30% faster so that means 7.8 AP per second (6 + 30%) or 12.8 total which is a 23% decrease overall in time (which matches the original post).  Action Boy/Action Girl should make it 45% faster so that means 8.7 AP per second (6 + 45%) or 11.49 total which is a 31% decrease overall in time (which also matches the original post exactly).
---
Here's where its looks like they changed something.  If we start with Lone Wanderer then stack AB/AG we get 6 + 30% = 7.8 + 45% = 11.31 AP per second which is 8.84 seconds total to recharge from 0 to 100 AP or a overall 47% decrease.  If we stack it the other way we get 6 + 45% = 8.7 + 30% = 11.31, the exact same number.  So either way both to rank 3 should be giving a 47% decrease in overall time.  
---
But the original post showed about a 34% overall decrease.  As a Rifleman/VATS build this was important to me so I did my own testing:
---
No perks equipped:  18.3 seconds regen
---
Lone Wanderer: 14.3 seconds regen (22% decrease...consistent with what it should be and the OP)
---
Action Boy/ Action Girl: 12.6 seconds regen (31% decrease, still perfectly consistent with math and OP)
---
Both Lone Wanderer and AB/AG: 10.6 seconds regen (42% decrease.  Consistant with math but NOT with OP)
---
So I believe they originally did not stack correctly and sometime in one of the patches/hotfixes in the last month they fixed it.  But it definitely seems correct now.
---
This is no longer true.  I saw that post and did my own experiment and it looks like they fixed that issue.  Using both IS a big gain.
---

I actually got around my horse getting jacked up like running into shit after first few times other than it fucking up jumping over something which happed more than out right running into something remembering back I had horse related problems 15 times in 60 hours so it wasn't an issue for me but I've seen alot of ppl have that's why I call it shit. Gunplay I've never had an issue with besides dead eye it feels like it moves to slow.  but I'm shit in any shooter so that's my skill lvl. It's a pointless argument I had no issues with it alot of ppl did. Some ppl had no issues with fallout I did.
---
That post is old and they apparently have fixed the Lone Wanderer + Action Boy / Action Girl.  I posted in that thread to prove it.
---
Also why would they have nice sleek metal vaulttec bunk beds in game, but when you unlock bunk beds for your camp its a wooden kids bed. wtf
---
I remember some patch notes not too long ago mentioned fixing the M79 Shotgun bug. Did they whiff that fix?
---
I would grab as much as possible out of the bag, server hop, and drop the items in a very hidden place (even inside a bush). It would take forever, but it would be worth it once they disappear forever!
---
Yes? Did you think there was no punishment for being a dick?
---
I always attribute it to me racking my shin on a pothole or something because I'm that uncoordinated in real life.
---
You monster!! And genius
---
That is possible, though given other decisions they've made, I doubt they'll put in a solution that doesn't cover all consoles.
---
People got all bent out of shape because of the recon in fallout 4 (whether it was accidental or intended), "jet can't be prepared, Myron invented it in fo2!!!!" Yeah, the lying little shitbag? It's so out of the realm of possibility that he could have *lied* about it? Like people always get mad when something contradicts the lore from a previous game, but that lore mostly came from word of mouth
---
In one of the bunkers at the Glassed Cavern I found a busted computer with a battered clipboard jammed in the monitor.
---
After removing the clipboard I was greeted by a gnome statue standing inside of the computer holding 2 computer chips and a wrench. It's one of the funniest things I've found so far. 
---
If you are on Xbox, try a hard reboot of the console (hold the Xbox logo on the front for 10 seconds). I probably crashed 5 times Sunday before doing that, 1 crash all day yesterday. 
---
The problem is that since there are so many around, you are basically forced to buy them at this point. And people who don't actually ask real money for them still sell them for over 10K minimum. 
---
Are you still overloaded?  On ps4 I only had inventory related issues when I was toting dozens if weapons.  Something with buffering that many spinning animations just obliterated my console (for example nonperformance hit from repair, only scrap screens).
---
Maybe, but it wouldn't really matter to me. The meat &amp; potatoes of the build is the Rifles and Shotguns. I mainly use the M79 / Grenades for clusters of enemies.
---
If they nerf the M79 then that's one less thing to carry; I'll just stick with Plasma / Nuka-Quantum Grenades.
---
I actually got more legendaries last night farming a non nuked whitesprings.  1 three star a few two stars and a ton of one star.
---
you can for the 360.
---
this game isn't on the 360.
---
its frustrating to fight that 3 star SBQ and find nothing. I get that BGS cant guarantee legendary weapons..its randomized, but at least let us know by putting the correct stars next to it. for example, if the SBC is dropping a 2 star then 2 stars next to it etc...that way ppl dont waste hard earned resources on what they would consider junk.  Other people may benefit from a 1 star take-down. At least we all know what were in for.  I've wasted so many resources on 3 star legendary creatures only to find they are giving me some special Armour.  Maybe you'll still end up with junk, but its clear what you're fighting for.  I think frustration is high in this regard. People work VERY hard to collect resources in the wasteland, and when I spend an hour in a nuke zone, I may get XP, but usually end up with no improvement to my arsenal.
---
But yet you can't even say please....
---
You can on the One too, I did it on diablo 3
---
Yea I'd rather not play than farm whitespring at this point. There's still armour pieces I want, but I'd rather do something that doesn't feel like a chore.
---
Clear evidence of what? That people can't like a game?
---
Well everyone I've talked to and my buddy that's was die hard defending it. Is now saying I'm go back a play skyrim still stuff I haven't done in that nothing left to do in fallout 76.
---
that could be it - the only time I've ever seen significant issues was a three SB barnstorm over by whitespring (just too many actors at one time)
---
Maybe because the game deserves to be bashed to oblivion? Quite literally to. So they wont even dare do something so bad ever again ?
---
As long as the game remains being bad, the hate will not stop flowing as it should.
---
Why raise stash limit, just find a way to send items to our alts so we have infinite space.
---
People already do this with very trusted friends or second account.
---
Perhaps...I've built a base partially in the water, so its doable.
---
you literally did not because you can not.
---
Use caps as collateral, so you put things up for caps then they put their stuff up for the same amount. Winds up being net zero, but much safer
---
Her dmg resist scaling is either lvl based or wep dmg based. 
---
Try to have less people the more in there the harder she is to kill having someone with a shotgun and the enforcer perk is good to make her land so you can unload damage 
---
I didn't server hop, yesterday, and stood on one of the towers at the mine across the street from the service entrance. I watched as my quaint little house was turned into a few radioactive sticks.
---
It was a beautiful site as I sat there laughing the whole time.
---
10/10 would recommend.
---
K.A.M.P.F
---
I'd stay away from that stuff. If Bethesda decides to do something about these people they can just look at who accessed the container.
---
Not registers in general, the registers specifically next to vendors. More specifically the right register at Phoenix in Watoga is where I drop ammo, plans, etc. PS4. 
---
Than you for the suggestion.
---
Yeah. I'm predicting a raider themed set of atom store items in the future. Hair probably included. 
---
Go back to ur moms moldy basement we don’t want u here.
---
Someone put some research time in on another thread stating Myron rediscovered it since it can be found in Vault 95 with the drug stash that was hidden for their experiment. 
---
"You have contracted Ear Worms."
---
hes duping bobbleheads, and exploiting a bug where you stack them, log out with Curator and the timer resets.
---
Last kill, I got 12 round of call.50... that's it...
---
Yeah, allows them to return. Then locks the door behind them again as they enter and gets a 2fer
---
I think there's a middle man service provided by the marketplace?
---
😢
---
yea, the bug is the MAIN reason I don't trade.. I'd hate to have some stuff disappear.. The other reason, is that it takes WAY too long to set prices on stuff. 
---
I don't server hop or really optimize my play style to efficiently grind out levels.  I'm level 36 and have been playing since launch, but only an hour here and an hour there.  Personally, I feel like that when I start grinding and optimizing, then I feel like I'm working, not playing a game.  I get paid to optimize things 8 hours a day.  I'd rather just poke around.  If others want to play another way, cool, no skin off my back.
---
That said, 76 does seem to be setup to reward server hopping/optimizing/grinding through the basic foundation of the game design.  And it sometimes feels like it ping pongs between being indifferent to the playstyle and mechanics they've fostered through their last 5 open world games, to being downright hostile.  Still, whatever.  I'm having fun and am in no hurry to max my character out.  I'll probably still be mid-level when they put out their first content update.
---
Honestly i would die of laughter if i got handed a disconnect from a prize bot
---
Amazing work!
---
That's not true at all, thanks for your input though. Not sure what I had expected from that username
---
Just looked up some builds on YouTube about it and yeah using sneak perks with melee damage perks and lower your hp higher your damage perks I saw one guy who temporarily was doing 11k a swing with the 3x sneak attack 
---
When you crouch your marker is not visible on the map.
---
Just make level 1 leather chest with super duper perk make like 20, and scrap them one by one. You prob unlock every mod.
---
Those small letters are sold for 1000 caps, and drop often enough from defend events that it would not be worth buying them. the 12000 caps plan is a different one.
---
Hah! Totally.
---
The boxes are not all opened when it emerges, run around it and check every box, they are opened one after each other. Some are closed and require a keycard ( not sure which one, but i already had it ). You also need to check the boxes that are high above you.
---
Also, if selling a whole set, of course sell the jetpack part last
---
Yes if your are wanted people can still see you 
---
Ah OK, I'll look into it. Thanks
---
It scales purely on number of players in the area which is why it's hard if there's lowbies there or people with shit weapons
---
In the others fallout games we had a great choice of hairstyles, i really don't know why in 76 there are so few...
---
[Man, if those get you excited, wait until you see this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKSc5AaYVPI) (NSFW!)
---
I explore, just look for something on and map and wander over.  Most locations that have images (not just fast travel points) have a back story if you dig around a bit.  These days I just fire it up and wander to someplace new to unwind for a half hour or so after work.
---
I don't mind limited time items it gives it a sense of like you have to play at a certain time to get stuff so the ogs will have let's say the hot rod paint job 
---
I agree with this request.  However, it does show you what mod you’re about to scrap in order to use the material.  Until they fix this priority, just be careful clicking through the modify or repair dialogues. HTH.
---
I dig it. M79 seems fun. I might try and fool with it.
---
Nobody did 
---
Look up the number of quest around 120 and they are made up of one like listen to Robot tell you a bedtime story or horde defense or just search area. Fallout 4 around 144 not including the repeated settlement quest skyrim over 300 see your getting less content for the same price.
---
Add the tormentor perk in luck tree and she will be kn the ground for 5+ minutes at a time
---
Yep...
---
That and the body just outside 76.... I loaded that sucker to max weight with stuff last night.
---
Deffo not gonna fight it anymore. If someone nukes whitesprings, I'll wait until I see everyone start leaving the zone and then I'll go mosey around. Otherwise it's pointless. Just gonna be 3-5 people there switch explosive shotguns one shotting entire mobs before anyone has a chance to do anything. Wonder if Bethesda knows how bad the duplication glitch ruined the games economy and gameplay......
---
Really? Brilliant! I'm going to take and hold some backwater locations. Thanks!
---
Mid January
---
Well played my friend, never thought about it. I'm a lone wolf player which I how I play all games, this is new territory for me and all suggestions are all good. :)
---
Enforcer isnt suppose to make her land, enforce stuns not cripples. You need to cripple the wings to make her land. Try using tormentor 
---
Take the credit card from her.
---
I'd like to see an operational train or the monorail itself.... Free to ride of course..
---
There are groups on here that hunt dupers, I know I have a couple in game friends that I will send a message to when I land on a dupers server 
---
Not to my experience, but i'd like a source of this theory
---
Psa: this only matters if you for some reason turned the marker for your loot off. It's always automatically on 
---
That isn’t a T-Pose, it’s an A-Pose. The engine Bethesda has created for their games favours A over T for the unanimated state of models. 
---
That is hilarious and amazing. Nice one dude. I will be questioning the kindness of strangers a lot more thoroughly now though lol
---
Yes, both perks apply to rifles, which presumably means semi or auto. From my experience they both appear to work. 
---
No, I think I was overladen once or twice, but mostly it's moving stuff out of my stash so I can fit more junk.
---
The other big failure I've been having recently is workbenches simply not working. Hit the button and get the animation. Then nothing.
---
It's all about the number of people and the damage output of everyone.
---
If you can get a DEAD server with a few good people you'll be fine.
---
Her ARMOR and I believe health scales based on people attending the event.
---
If your PC add me: falloutguy510
---
I've been trying to put together a successful team of people. Right now I have 242, 105, and few other 100's.
---
Pretty much all of us have end game builds and TSE's 
---
then provide proof.
---
I'll wait. 
---
Depends on player count I'd say, myself and about 6 other 100+ took her down in about 3 mins, but all the bitch dropped was 6 cannonballs.....
---
They cause no problems 
---
The pedancy of your post implies you were being bragging more than hyperbolic. 
---
But anyway, keep flying around with your hard-work-owned jetpack, we all envy you &lt;3
---
If it's incorrect, it's a misconception shared by nearly the entire playerbase. Not going to source something that is such common knowledge... I'm sure it's referenced in at least every second page of this sub
---
They weigh 0.25 lb, so be sure to pass them on to somebody or ditch them if you're struggling for storage space.
---
Oh. I wondered why it had a value amount in the pip-boy, but I suppose that's for player to player trade?
---
I only use it because it benefits from Shotgunner and Demo Expert. If they do fix it so that it's only a Demo Weapon then I won't bother with it. The damage it does isn't worth the non-reduced weight of the weapon, nor carrying the extra ammo; I'd just carry more grenades.
---
Glad you asked that.  Ive had the same experience lately. here is my thought on why its happening:
---
\\ ppl. stop shooting after a certain point to save ammo or just get a free drop after  tagging the creature. Ive seen it. they stand around doing nothing...not just one or two...too many! So the SBQ is designed to be difficult...everyone has to empty their mags. into her, and hard melee on the ground.  Im not hearing guns shots...or anything except that screech, and SBQ farts in our face. As recommended, you need 8 people dedicated to killing it...not 1-3 with everyone else watching. 
---
**Stand up and fight people**!  always try to be prepared for a nuke drop if your going to jump in.  don't run around with one stim. and some rad-x. 
---
Were you asking over mic or text or with emotes?
---
I did it for 6 months when it came out on xbox one. Decrypt file -&gt; hex edit base code -&gt; re-encrypt. It required a custom decryption tool
---
Other than the spare tires and windows you seem to be up to speed on the Hyundai my wife bought. The gigantic mega-dealer we bought from scammed Hyundai for a few hundred cars and was forced to close. We lost our service plan (oil changes, inspection, car wash for life) and extended warranty. 
---
No offence bud, but how do you know there aren’t Beth Devs monitoring YOU right now lol
---
I'm not seeing these posts, but I do see your posts where you're being toxic, rude, and implying anyone with complaints is a hater.
---
Naw its 3 strips a week, on monday, wednesday, and friday. It's about all I can keep up with my regular commission work and other projects.
---
I feel like I could do wreaking ball ranked 2 for this
---
i dont know where i found mine but i got a prototype hazmat suit in level 1 and im level 101 atm,. they are indeed very useful, especially for that early farming, believe me, if you can get anyone to launch nukes with a full team sharing bodyguard perk, you will all get some decent armor and energy resistance, combine that with the perk "Ironclad" at max level 5 star it gives you 50 to armor and energy resitance when not in a power armor,.. well that said if you have a very supportive team build at least, because to be able to share atleast level 3 bodyguard perk you MUSt have 9 points into charisma. 
---
So lets say you have 50 armor and enegery resistance from Ironclad perk, and say you have 3 teammates with a level 3 bodyguard perk aswell then that will give you an exctra 30 armor and energy resistance, so you will still have 90/90/1000 D/E/R Resistance which is decent to me, now if you use some psychotats chems or something where you take 15% damage, then you should be good to go for a nuke at low level and not instantly dying everytime you get hit. ^
---
Unfortunate. Can as well be common misconception that it scales based on player count.
---
Just need more village people
---
I cant imagine anything more souldraining than beginning this empty experience all over again at lvl 1. Knowing theres nothing.
---
I'm not OP. 
---
But anyway, keep having poor reading comprehension, we all envy you &lt;3
---
I will accept a trade invite, as long as they are empty handed, and no repeated trade connections.
---
When they request ammo, food, materials, or something like that, I will sell it cheap (often free) if I have extra, but when they immediately start requesting my High end weapons, I just disconnect &amp; walk away.
---
If you seriously want to trade for a weapon that commonly sells for more than 5000 caps, then you should have started with a party invite, or at least area chat.
---
That quest is so "lolol *buuuuuurrrrp*! randumb Morty!"
---
Drat, guess I need to work on my technique 
---
I didn't know, the gun was loaded. I'm so sorry my friend...
---
provide proof. 
---
show us how you're seemingly able to pull saves off of the Xbox one. 
---
Same, I've attempted it in the past or done a 30 days of sketches sort of thing for the Secret World when it was out, and Wild Star when it first started, it usually doesn't get this far with me.
---
Just check the FO4 wiki, pretty much the same as those.
---
I trust you say something in your finest Ahnuld voice through the closed door as they crisp to death.  "Pleased to heat you."  "Nice to bake your acquaintance."  "
---
$15 for a duped tse? Are you joking? You can buy them for like 6000 caps nowadays, or 4000 if you're on xbox. So you're telling me people pay a dollar for 400 caps? I should stop CS:GO trading and just take this game up as a part time job smh
---
It's a bug. Good or bad you decide
---
The barber in the vault didn't know many different hairstyles I guess. Maybe we'll get more in the atom store.
---
Ya dude you can’t wear a hazmat suit in power armor lol even if it says it’s equipped the affects don’t occur 
---
Mic and emotes, but I suspect they didn't have VC on since they either ignored me or ran away.  I'm on PC so no way to message them directly.
---
Why would anyone get upset? I also can't believe that people wouldn't go in because it looks sketchy. That's the exact reason to do it! People act like they can't recover from a video game death. They must be really boring in real life.
---
I'm always the one getting stamped on by her and being blinded by all the explosive 2 shots hitting her, as I hit her with my sledge..  
---
This happens to me turns out I did t have a full suite or my leg was broken was getting rads like a mofo make sure your armor isn’t broke 
---
You've clearly never played the Agarest series.
---
"Played over 1000 hours, easy" isn't hyperbole or exaggeration to prove a point. Its an attempt at braggadocious swagger at the very least. But really its just HIGHLY inflating numbers to make it look like your "expert" opinion has more weight. 
---
You seem tho have missed the bus...and that really cool kid got your favorite window.
---
 That's where inventory wipes come into play. If you have a duper's inventory, it gets wiped. A message should go out ahead of it, so those that hunt down and steal those inventories to disperse amongst other players or destroy in the bottom of the nearest fissure don't get caught in the wave of destruction. 
---
Also in dealing with the now non-rarity of two-shot explosive weapons everyone bought from dupers someone suggested making TSE weapons impossible to have by separating the two and having it so you can have one mod or the other, but not both. I'm not 100% sold on that, but it's an idea I guess.

PS4 - I get dropped every five minutes and it’s not my internet connection. It just started happening this weekend. 
---
What platform are you? I could craft you some stuff.
---
Sweet, hadnt tried that thanks!
---
To get most of the mods. They can increase your damage by quite a bit.
---
Thank you, I'm a lot like you. I think they obviously could have done better. I still enjoy playing the game and absolutely do not understand people playing it and continue to hate it. There are a million other games you could play to make you happy. I have been comparing it to star wars rage. When a trailer for the movies came out, people pulled it apart immediately without even seeing the whole thing yet. Not saying anyone's opinion was right or wrong it was just that, an opinion. When they stated at e3 it was going to be online the hate started there. When it was released it was 100% understandable for the upset. But now, like you said, they have been trying to fix things and listen to the players. I think people would have exploded even if they would have waited to release it. I feel it's a damn if you do/don't situation. If you hate it so much, leave it alone. There have been some great games to be released since then. Play them instead! 
---
I got it down to 8750 with a casual underarmor and full unyielding set (plus hard bargain 3 and grape mentats) on my 3 charisma.

I didn't even notice the lack of illumination--I'm still ticked off by the fact that we only get blue letters!

Wendigo are re-skinned Hags.....
---
If I ever find one of those spots, id like to build the camp where the waterfall is right behind a wall, that way you could collect water to cook with without having to go outside (assuming there is the icon to let you collect from falling water). Of course, I dont cook much anymore, just purified water and canned dogfood
---
They keep spawning after a nuke subsides, without the radiation. Just logged into an older server
---
Not enough???? Not enough.... oh...... Not enough!!! Damnit. Note to self... talk to mom about underwear area... I may have been mislead about a few things.
---
There are also the long underground tunnels in cranberry bog
---
They do indeed!

You don't see the irony in this?

Fucking brilliant! Plus it’s a way to load up on caps!

Rifle while in the air, and mini or auto grenade or heavy melee on the ground.

**why** am i not getting these perk cards you talk about?? its been an issue now for a while. 300 hours in and im getting dups of what i already have. is it a glitch, or is it due to the type of build that ive focused on.  So maybe BGS tailors the perk cards to what you already have.  
---
They might have been doing the angry and thumbs down emotes just to be funny. In that situation I would have. 
---
Most likely a week from today, Tuesdays are usually patch days and next week is "mid january" which they said at some point before
---
Highly unlikely.  If Bethesda was going to that effort the database could have been keyed by said number making it inherently impossible for 2 records to share the same number so they would have had to add massive overhead to item drop processing but overlook adding in the very reason to have said overhead.
---
There is likely no way to identify duped vs non duped that doesn't risk blowing away legit gear.   
---
People blow duped gear existing and thr people who duped it way out of the water in reddits echo box of opinions.  Vast majority of players don't care if other duped, don't dupe themselves and most of all aren't spending money to get in game items.  The kssue just needs fixed and to move on and only the biggest whiners will still be talking about leftover duped gear in a months time.
---
Which guy? And how much that cost ya 
---
Stfu
---
I bought one last week, the recipes were unexpectedly high end and so far have been wonderful. I bought it after discovering that the recipes for the various colas are actually recipes to make their syrups, which was exciting to me. I absolutely love my cook book. Going to be cooking from this for quite a while. 
---
Here's your prize!

With that amount of mental gymnastics, you can have parallels to anything:
---
\-The Scorchbeasts are huge and powerful flying monsters, just like the Nazgul riding their fellbeasts.
---
\- The Scorched are ugly with raspy voices, like Orcs.
---
\-The main factions of the game were unable to defeat the Scorchbeasts and left the problem for someone to fix in the future just like the Alliance of Men and elves thought they killed Sauron (Just like the BoS thought Haggerty stopped the scorchedbeasts but then realized she didn't).
---
\-The Mole miners are xenophobic and reclusive, just like Dwarves.
---
\-The Tallest Mountain is Mount Doom, where the heroes are summoned to go. If you include the lands of the east, it's also roughly at the center of the map.

I'm still struggling with getting stable flux. Just bad luck or something. Almost always the flowers and such spoil into inert flux before I can stabilize it.

"Go into Whitesprings and use the benches"

Tell that to the robots that always seem to get pissed off with me during nuke events there when I'm nowhere near them killing ghouls at the housing/club. 
---
You want....... communication?? How dare you.  (insert some fan boys being satisfied with a few lines posted a week ago and down-voting me)
---
Haha, I tend to stay off the mic because I don't think I can play a very good character!
---
I don't understand what you mean by not getting the park cards. They aren't randomly given to you, you manually choose which card you want every level up. You can select any card in the game if you're past level 50. Tormentor is under luck 
---
Haha, really?? What's your gamer tag? I probably video'd it! Also, sorry :p
---
On xbox, tell me what you need, ill help you out, either plans or crafting you something. Need to get rid of stuff
---
Maybe to some people server hopping is more fun than the alternative enforced slower grind 
---
What if your sign said "To Serve Man." With arrows leading to stimpacks and weapons in the back of the room??

I've hopped around between the two watoga vendors and harpers ferry post-40 and have yet to see the handmade plans.  So I can buy that theory.

Delete their accounts?, yeah that'll solve everything, ban the majority of players on an already struggling game, nice one.

Yeah he’s a lieing little shit. But when we learn to make it ourself in FO4 it’s just snorting cow shit super unlikely no one tried that before him, he probably just tried it himself and realized it’s the same thing as jet or made some slightly different version of it

Rumor has it on the 15th, personally I'm thinking 22nd might be more likely. First week of January is always a total crapshoot, it takes people a while to get over the damage from the holiday season.
---
PS4 as well. it’s not even the crashes that bother me because if I really wanted back on that same server I could join via friend. and or send a nice message to a recently played with asking if they are still on the same server they were 5 minutes ago and ask for an invite, it’s more or so the fact that the servers crash for no apparent reason that is truly frustrating, it’s more frequent than the client-side crashes and twice as infuriating.
---
Clean straight jacket.

wait, was that proven false?

Build your camp on a junk extractor site and/or take the Charleston Landfill workbench (3 junk extractors).  The X per hour seems like slow going, but you will be pleasantly surprised at how fast you pick up raw, rare junk.
---
Had the same issue when the player approached me with this “shooting” emote but luckily later he explained me over the message about the reason. When I was in the same situation I removed all armor in front of the guy in order not to damage it. But we were in my CAMP snd my turrets decided that they deserved some vengeance afterwards. Luckily those were just newly installed heavy ballistic turrets.
---
Yep, legendary drops/three star mobs are so messed up now that it's actually more profitable to loot an un-nuked golf club.  Regular ghouls there can drop legendaries, it's great.  I routinely get 6-7 legendaries just doing one loop through the golf club and up along the bungalows on the other side of the tennis courts, and it's nice and quiet with nobody around.  
---
Yes, PRODUCT. Let them defend that till they are blue in the face.
---
Not the company that the product was produced by. The company NEEDS NO defending. Which is the point.
---
So why are people defending a multi billion dollar company? 
---
You'd think that but pretty much any level seemed willing to go in. Highest was level 199, though I couldn't actually cook him :p

Indeed, also don't do it straight after Monster Mash.  Running around wondering why you're taking rads and then you realise you don't have your helmet on...that explains the "confused" emojis I was getting thrown at me....

---
I found that if you build your camp west of Watoga in the forested areas in the cliffs that the Flatwoods Monster has a chance of spawning and attacking your camp along with Mothman. I have had a Level 50 Mythical Flatwoods Monster &amp; Level 45 Vengeful Mothman attack me. 
---
Mothman holds a grudge on me to this day... why did they make their eggs so delicious!!!?
---
Good for you for not spending any money on GTA Online. How ever that doesn't alter the fact the game is cynically designed to make money off MTX. 
---
What vastly more content was there when GTA ONline and current RDR2 Online offers? RDRD2 all there is to do is hunt, do little missions around map and mess with other players. GTA Online when released had nothing to do but rob stores, grind contract missions/activities and mess with other players.  FO76 offers similar activities. Events and quests are the same as contract missions/activities as well as the local events that take place every 30 minutes or so.  
---
Now over time GTA Online has developed more, as will RDR2 to a lesser degree compared to GTA. But GTA has had 5 years to develop while FO76 has had less then a year. 
---
As for buggy mess there are plenty of bugs still in GTA Online that are equivalent to bugs I've found in FO76 so far.  The main and only really noticeable one is Scorch hold weapons at odd angles. Mean while "burn your bridges" air race I use for a daily objective since November has had a bug that it auto forces me to fly my custom Cuban plane. I can select any other custom plan or even the stock Mallard but it auto forces me into my Cuban plane.  But given how Rockstar bug fixes that problem will most likely be there until mid april.
---
&gt; ppl are post how its killing its self. But even if you want to ignore it both have quality pieces of the game you can play.
---
And yet lobbies are constantly full or nearly full. There are a large group of people who support every action from rockstar and there was a surge of new players after the holidays. 
---
It turned my vision into a kaleidoscope and i had to lie down in the dark for 15 minutes
---
If your on PS4 I have a 100+ of each I’ll gladly give you. 
---
I'm good with doubling the budget and making the circle smaller in all honesty. If that's a trade off.
---
Also booths. why are there no booths? 
---
OP, you probably know this  - posting this for those new to the game and/or Enclave base at Whitesprings. I server hopped for a week, and every single time there was the same plans and mods on the vendor. Huh, no X01 mods ever. I did not know there are multiple vendors (Armory, Production, Science and Medical), and X01 mods are found on the Armory vendor, not the Production wing. 
---
I'm looking for the safe plan, it's not in this list yet sadly.
---
I already have the built in floor one but not the freestanding one.
---
Mid January I think. Bethesda wrote it will be a HUGE patch. I hope not huge as the d1 patch. It took me 13 hours to download 
---
Hi bro thanks for helping i am italian actually and i was not knowing the right word.
---
What do u mean with shelves?
---
Haha funny but harsh. I play as a dick (raider) most of the time. If you play on Xbox one and want to teach me a lesson, I'd be happy to let you try. 
---
Anyone wanting to destroy my base is welcome! Shoot me a message. There's a lot to destroy! See my Combat Zone style camp in my bio. 
---
To be honest, since the first day of beta, I have run into a single douchebag player. And I flat out ignored his pathetic attempts to anger me.
---
Maybe I'm lucky? 
---
As far as the flamers and strips go I think they always do damage, it just doesn't happen to be very much
---
9 crashes? That's nothing. A month a go I had 16 crashes in a 2 hour session. I rage quitted and haven't touched the game ever since. 
---
Go to the market 
---
How do the victims know that? They don't. It just seems like something thrown in on the post to make it seem like it is less jerkish than it is.
---
fair enough. I'll agree that there isnt enough "to do" yet. I expect that to change. But its been a month... Ive played almost every night since release, and I'm starting to feel the grind, but I also know there's a TON of events and locations I haven't explored yet. I just feel like if you really have been waiting for 10 years for this game, why did you rush through it? I'm not a Bethesda or Fallout fanboy at all, but I'm still reading the lore and listening to the holotapes and just progressing through the game without googling how to max everything, because I'm enjoying watching the game unfold at an organic pace.
---
I agree that we do need more quests in general, yes, but damn I can't imagine calling something I put 40 hours into "not worth the money," especially when you know there are years of free content ahead. Even if you paid full price for it, that's 66 cents per hour of gameplay. Seems like a pretty decent price, even if you stopped playing forever right now. You obviously enjoyed it enough to max it out, so it hardly seems like a waste.
---
Hmm... I think I'll do that with the extras I have and don't need...
---
I've been server hopping to get the civil war reenactor encounter.
---
All you net-negatives are welcome to quit.  Ive played this game longer than any other... ever.
---
Im still finding things i want to do. if your so frustrated, then why are you posting about it?
---
move on and play one you like.  
---
did they fuck up? NO 
---
is it buggy? YES, but...
---
its getting better and people are learning the MP component..its getting to be even more fun,
---
I want this. Made my character looking like me but I would love to switch sometimes. If you ever invested the time to make yourself you don't wanna do it again. 
---
There's a wide area in between spoon-feeding and not bothering to write a story. Given that PvP is in the game, but you can opt out, but not really, and if you engage in it accidentally, you get a bounty, and it's shockingly unbalanced, and provides no benefit either player, I'm guessing it's a failure and not a decision that there is no story there. 
---
I kinda like this idea more.
---
You probably had a bounty or shot him by accident
---
As long as you're not the guy with 5 piece assassin/sentinel I may take you up on that sometime ;) My instigating explosive dragon is always hungry
---
Other than work? LOL. 
---
I did say it was CONTROVERSIAL.
---
I'd be fine with it. I've played since beta and have 3 character over level 100 decked out in some nice armor.
---
I'm for FIXING what was destroyed instead of wallowing in the remains.
---
Also TSE weapons are broke as fuck, need to have the perks modifiers removed from it I.E Demo expert and Grenadier and the legendary effects SHOULD NOT stack for those two effects, much like how other effects do not stack together.
---
Are you one of those who spend real life money on a gun in game? If so I am sorry for your poor investment, but it needs to be done one way or another. Keeping things are they are .. you're asking for a mass exodus.
---
Huh! Well, fair enough. Still a bit of an odd coincidence though if you ask me.

I'm old and don't understand. I've been playing since beta and just reached level 30. I'm enjoying the game. What do you mean by "server hop?"
---
 Very...I have played over 150 hours and have dealt with over 2 dozen of them. 
---
Go full balls deep. Marsupial with Strange in Numbers in a party full of muties.
---
I'm sure you would. It is a controversial suggestion. Any other viable suggestions are welcome .. feelings .. ehhhh. 
---
Lol that's why I put "willingly" in there. Stay strong, comrade. :D
---
Well done! 
---
Bless you for comparing using OSRS as an example and not RS3.
---
Has anyone figured out what's going on with this yet?
---
At level 21 you can't even craft most weapons. Just play the game and you will find what you need. Or you will be swimming in caps to get whatever you need
---
In my first successful run the SBQ got reduced to a goop puddle due to someone finishing her off with a Gatling Plasma so I *think* that may have overridden any chance of it disappearing. 
---
That costs money OP likely doesn't have or shouldn't waste when the penitentiary patrol quest can give it to you for free reliably. At that level I'd suggest having some friends help out. Long boring quest for highest level players to do, but at 10-15 it's a little much with the amount of super mutants there. Not impossible, but bring a ton of ammo and stimpacks.

There's really a ton of things waiting to be introduced. I mean, have you tried doing something fancy with lights and power connectors like in FO4?
---
**Spoiler**: You can't!
---
Where are all those nice connector/switches from FO4?    
---
Instead we get only a useless cycling switch.
---
Since everything basically already exists, I guess they are holding all that stuff back to release later on
---
Ahh. Then I guess ‘tallest major location’ on the map for Top of the World as a parallel to Throat of the World works too.
---
This is valid. I only assume it would be possible on other consoles. I could be very wrong though. 
---
I am not sure yet but it seems to me that when your turret kills the creature you didn’t “tag” you won’t get experience, will you? But it looks that you still have a loot from the corpse.
---
Wait, it is? What armor is that in 76?
---
Right because explorers like you know everything get the fuck out of here
---
What platform?  Ps4 on east coast has been pretty decent if server pop isn't crazy.  On average a DC in a couple hours, rare issue with low pop high DC rate in nuke areas with lots of explosions.
---
&gt; Why post a comment about not understanding why we play F76?
---
I saw it on r/all for some reason
---
You and your brother have low standards. And, everything is fun with a friend/sibling. Doesn't make the game any better
---
Wow, calm down there Satan.

I'm already max level.

When I tried farming for the Hunter's Longcoat, the longshoreman outfit was popping up each time. Never had luck on the longcoat.
---
Until Bethesda sells me another xo1 calibrated shock I must server hop. Over 400 server hops in now and boy do I want to barbeque my copy of fo76 lol. Stupid OCD.....
---
Best way is to badger Bethesda until the add a barter system, where you can trade item for item. Games had these for literally decades. To make a loot-based multiplayer game without it, in 2018, is as dumb as dumb gets.
---
In the meantime, you can try to use caps as collateral, but it's not particularly safe. If someone is not willing to trade you their weapon, but you're not willing to sell for caps, then all he has to do is go first. You give him your item and he gives you caps...and then he walks away. Because he never had any intention to give up his item to start with. Similarly, once you give up your item, he can still offer you his...at inflated price.
---
You can use an escrow service, but you're just bringing in a 3rd party to a 2 party exchange, and again there's really no guarantee that the escrow holder will abide. The both of you hand over your items, and the guy turns and walks away. And no, Bethesda is not going to go after them if you report them, they don't even have the tools for it. Also Bethesda will change your username if you ask for it, so even "untrustworthy" lists won't work as a deterrent.
---
Bottom line - we as a community have to keep asking for the basic features multiplayer games had for decades. Barter system being one of them. Until then, it's a total crapshoot. 
---
Just be a cannibal. XD
---
No loot and no xp if only the sentries deal damage. And in this case they usually do. Even if the player gets in a hit, others won't be able to. No matter what you do it's a lose-lose situation and a very shitty thing to do
---
Concentration &gt;C.A.M.P

How are you joining recent people? Whenever I try to do that, on the title screen when I go to ‘recent’ it’s blank, every time.

bethesda won't give us text chat cos it'll ruin imersion.  i doubt anything with beams of light is going to happen.   I don't think i'd like it to either.

i think just making the corpses a little brighter, outlined/glowy is enough.
---
Brings back so many Minecraft memories (:
---
min-maxing builds (perk, drugs, mutations) to fit a weapon can give a ton of damage to one shot pretty much anything in the game.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, but you're absolutely correct. The duper loses maybe 30 minutes of their time and it won't take long until they've doubled what they lost.
---
my corpses stay marked about 25% of the time.
---
I agree highly unlikely, but technicaly possible. During server maintenance time they could run a program that checks the entire item database. Any items with duplicate item numbers would be deleted. This way a player that has a duplicated weapon along with the player that allowed his weapon to be duplicated would lose it. 
---
On PC, my game locks up sometimes if I turn too quickly while moving.  Not had problems with inventory crashes.

---
Would you like that on a silver platter or gold?
---
Not interested in fighting guys with OP explosive weapons. Lol instigating as well! That's just a joke. I like PvP in this game, but only with players that don't use the one-shot super stupid guns. It's so much better when its not a race to get the first hit - a race that's over in less than a second. That bullshit over and over is not worth anything. 
---
I arrange PvP matches for players looking to join hunter vs hunted games, but I always ban these silly one-shot explosive numb nut guns. PvP is great as long as they are not involved. I really hope they remove them from PvP and only allow then in pve going forward 
---
&gt; as a 'low level player', I hate being around high level players... you spawn the worst monsters and nothing takes the fun out of the game like being killed six times in 10 minutes.
---
This right here is a extremely valid point. Though I will say. If you're a low level near flatwoods you should be fine, at least from higher level spawn.
---
Now .. theres a guy with a oven there now {In flatwoods}, tricking people into it. So, theres that.
---
I get that. 
---
I did it with a Double Double Barrel Shotgun, neither two shot or explosive, although 4 double barrel shots to the head with my load out usually did the job pretty quick. I actually wish there was more skill involved in PvP instead of the 1-2 shot shit we have now.
---
Equal and especially higher level peeps had more often recently farmed screws/springs/lead too, and the wild thing is a level 50 can take out a level 200 this way with intention and planning. 
---
Best advice I can give to those who don’t like it is store your junk and get ready before going into the only PvP zones in this game because they *just might* end up PvPing. 
---
 I'm still trying to figure out that little radiate node for the conduit. How does that thing work exactly? I assumed it had a smaller sphere of influence than normal wall mounted pylons and would power normal lights, but not even a light right next to it lights up. Is it actually fallout Bluetooth? Seriously wtf does that node do / how does it work?

Platform? I think I picked one of those up last night. If you're on PS4 on me. I also think it was a 3* with a bonus in vats it something. I can double check in about an hour. 
---
To be fair it could also be one of the dudes who has taken over 1k bobble heads thanks to dupers. Dunno if they can one shot people with slap damage but it seems possible with bobble head stacks.
---
GTAO had about as much content to do as FO76 has.  I've not personally experienced any crashes how ever I am not level 50 yet so if it is level specific I wouldn't have experienced it yet.  What "end game" does GTAO have? There is literally no point to the game beyond grind out missions and business to get money to buy vehicles. There is no end game and no ultimate goal to aim towards. 
---
&gt; To top all of that bethesda decided to screw over customers over and over with false advertisement and scams.
---
Not really relevant to the game but you can look at card shark prices vs prices of content in game. The newest drip fed car costs more then a 20 USD card shark gives you.  In fact I calculated using the 99 USD card shark that gives you 8M in game dollars it would cost around 400-500 USD to buy everything the Smuggler's Run update introduced into the game. Quite literally a single update costs the same as a brand new console or several new AAA games. 
---
Needs a low hanging variant for angled / raised ceilings. 
---
It's Charisma
---
Pretty much this, server stability and fixing the ability to put the server into an unstable state need to be fixed first.  
---
I don't have powered doors yet :-( sad face
---
test room?
---
It doesn't put you in combat so I doubt it
---
Unfortunately there would probably be more complaints than praise if they blacklisted things from pvp, it has become more of a griefing mechanic than an enjoyable and engaging one. Fights are always super one sided, especially if they have the dumb armor which makes you take almost no damage with players, or explosive shotties 
---
That sucks. I've been playing since Black Friday and haven't really ran into anyone I'd call a douche bag. One guy tried to kill me but after I smacked him down a few times he gave up lol
---
Have to teach them valuable wasteland lessons early :p
---
On Ps4. That would be awesome even though I’m not using vats :D 
---
I have 4 mutations. Healing factor, Talons, Chameleon and Carnivore. When I read this post I was in the process of saving to buy a serum, I changed my mind and didn't. However, a friend of mine stumbled upon a plan to make Marsupial. He gave me 1 serum that he made. I originally thought, oh no, I'm going to have to get rid of Carnivore. But I took a chance and just drank it. It worked. I now have 5, and all working as they should. So maybe this bug is not wide spread, or it's just on one system, because it's working fine for me. So I'm going to continue to save and buy a few more from the Enclave.
---
So you grinding out for 50 levels but you regret it because you are not a masochist....you do see the contradiction there right? Why would you effectively max out your level in a game you hate and can't stand?
---
Just..... thank you for pointing that out so I didn’t have to.
---
Math doesn't check out. One additional attribute on a few hundred legit items vs tracking a million duplicated items.
---
Why? Evan. That's why 
---
So I've got a few clown hats... where is the clown suit? 
---
u/Azza-10 Get on this haha
---
Ha!!! You joke, but the goal of my secondary character is to literally build Vault-Mart (I was even going to call it that). Going to pick a workshop (probably the Dirt Track) and use it's higher budget to build a larger building with multiple departments. I'll just blueprint it and slap it down every time I log on. I just think it'll be funny to run around to different counters and such to sell different items from different departments because I'm the only employee. 
---
Come on now, you should know by now that Bethesda runs on Valve Time.
---
My wife likes two things about F76:  the radio station, and how when ghouls kill me with radiation damage when I respawn I have like 1 hp and they can immediately kill me all over again and she can make fun of me for it.
---
Needy much ;)
---
its just spare blueprints man , for mods , structures or whatever spares
---
Voice of Set - .44 from the Order of Mysteries does extra damage to robots. 
---
Even without that - use a piercing magazine for armor penetration. Not every weapon build works for all opponents, some work better for a wider range of things - hardened receiver (most damage but semi-auto) and piercing magazine for the armor penetration go really far but aren't for every build.
---
The Watoga shopping mall store has them occasionally
---
Ah, I remember playing Runescape WAY back in the day.. right after it came out of alpha/beta. I spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours playing. 
---
I had my friend who was level 20 try hopping at Harper's Ferry for it and nada. When I was in the low 40 levels (before 44) I tried hopping at Harper's Ferry and Watoga and couldn't get it to show up.
---
Thank you for this! While I still love the game, if more people had legit criticism like you, it probably wouldn't be as obnoxious as it's gotten to be. 
---
I'd thought about that but I haven't been able to find a tame-able pet yet. I didn't try that hard though.
---
Haha I feel that. I think it's fun to drop stuff to noobs and have started to try and do that with extra junk. Found a party of low level players and ran up to them. They all freaked, circled me with guns aimed. I dropped a bunch of ammo and plans. They scavenged it like hungry stray dogs then waved lol I didn't stick around afterward though, I was questing. 
---
Call me Lucky too cuz I’ve had a total of 3 asshats since BETA
---
I'm worried about the size of the patch. Huge okay, but how much? 
---
I found it easier to get the mods by finding handmades in the world than trying to get the plans.  There's some pretty good spots to look every time you log on and you usually walk away with 1-2 handmades per play session that you can scrap for mods, if not more.
---
Not sure... probably a plan that says switches I think. Or advanced power connectors maybe.
---
So you are saying... that somehow... Tolkien stole from Skyrim?      
---
       
---
Damn you Todd!       
---
/s
---
On the topic of problem enemies.... The power plant near Charleston workshop can get annoying when mole rats show up as your enemy waves to defend. They often go after the scorched up in the ramps of the cooling tower thingies and it can be a pain to try finding them and aggroing all the other scorched and stuff in those areas.
---
Can I make an alternative suggestion? Yes, get rid of "tagging", but by making it unnecessary - make so if you're on a Team, you get XP and loot from any enemies your team mates kill. And if a Legendary enemy shows up? Let anyone who's nearby by able to get loot from it, regardless of whether they even hit it or not - Legendary enemies are rare enough as it is, and with how many possibly legendary items there are, even if items are handed out like candy, it'd still take a while to get lucky and get one you really want. BUT, you'd be able to get items more consistently and with much less frustration, which I'd argue would help make the game more enjoyable, and give people much less reason to bother duping or paying other people to do so.
---
How are you not playing as Chunk and Sloth?
---
So you hear the voices too? I KNEW IT!
---
I've really been trying to convince my husband to do this.  He's being frugal and that's good, especially when you've got two kids, but I feel like we would benefit from this.  What's your setup like?  Do you have two TV's?  
---
I got mine at the amusement park in the southwest. It was in a bus in the parking lot. 
---
*Monday*: "omg badthesda you lied to us!!1!1 u said that you would communicate with us11!!!"
---
*Wednesday*: Bethesda provides news.
---
*Next Monday*: "omg badthesda you lied to us!!1!1 u said that you would communicate with us11!!!"
---
Lol they get the same or more for months but they made a good comeback which i hope bethesda will make (even if i have 0 hope in them)
---
Their coders would have to be idiots to set it up that way, we're not talking even a small chance; it would be so astronomically low of a chance that a complete character reset for every single player is more likely to happen.  To put it in laymans terms it would be like putting the stockers putting the items on the shelf at a grocery store but not having any kind of record of what the barcodes correspond to and having to look up each item by hand at checkout.  
---
seriously? I was killed 3-4 times yesterday while being in pacifist mode all the time! A guy ran around whitesprings and one shotted a lot of people not only me... 
---
Perhaps it's been fixed since I posted this, I haven't really logged in to check since.
---
&gt; with how many people are out there you could stack a few simple legendaries with ease.
---
The likelihood of you looting even two of the exact same 2+ star legendary is infinitesimal. Allowing less than five pretty much guarantees that no legitimate player would be affected.
---
Base item x level x 2-3 stars x prefix x suffix 1 x suffix 2
---
What about people who bought a duped weapon with caps?  That would instantly cause an uproar.  The only way it'll be fixed is by fixing duping and releasing new servers. Meanwhile, new and better weapons could be released on the current servers and everyone will get rid of their old duped weapons.
---
Blame it on the government shutdown.  Modus is stuck in powersaver mode to save money and can't generate the needed files.
---
I did try that initially but there's not enough buildable area in that spot to build 3 wide. Also 3 wide was too suspicious, most so than just 2 wide anyway.
---
My main guys has the puby mohawk. Not really seen anyone else running around with it .. then again .. like me. Most people wear a bag on their face .. or a hat.
---
There has to be some way to uniquely hash each high level weapon so that if it's duplicated BGS can purge the 2nd...nth instance of it.
---
Hmm I never noticed. I guess you were the chosen one who picked all those up.
---
if you are on the box. I have an extra handmade plan I can give you for free. 
---
I hear ya!  I try to learn all new plans ASAP, but still have gone to the workbench to discover...I cant build it!
---
very frustrating.  500, wow! kudos man, ive logged 300+.  
---
and the 3 numbers on the back side please
---
Text chat hasn't ruined the immersion of any of the other games, because it's always optional. You can just close the text window. Every single MMO I played has it, and most multiplayer games going as far back as the original Diablo, more than 22 years ago. There were other, even older examples, just nothing leaps to mind at the moment. Similarly, there's the things like chat bubbles. Which are local, and can be turned on and off at will. For example, Elder Scrolls Online (almost 5 years old) uses both chat bubbles and chat channels, both are optional. The game is incredibly immersive, and this immersion is not harmed by it at all. So that's no excuse.
---
Beams fit The Division very well, with the idea of augmented reality UI, but they can tweak it. Most games mark unlooted corpses in some unique way, to make them easier to see and know which are empty and which are not. Bethesda just needs to get with the times on that one. They already took the first step, quite well, with meatpiles and flies. Just need to extend that to the corpses. 
---
I did that 7 times yesterday getting the three plans. By the last one I was running circles around the higher level players there doing the same thing. They finally just escorted me around while I knocked out the repairs. Neither of them had the password for the terminals. I showed them where to get it. Running around lost in that maze. There is a single staircase that's connected to the generator room, control room, and the core. Also connected to the hallway that leads to both cooling towers. Doorway asy ornery side of the control room from that stairway leads to the offices, which leads to the big doors at the front of the plant to get out. Exiting out at the cooling towers can kill you. 
---
Rofl, wow.
---
So far every single overpriced Atom Crap item I've heard of has been flawed or broken.
---
The jingle tambo made no sounds. Not even default sounds; NO sounds.
---
The musical T-51 paint job was not audible to any other player.
---
Now this five dollar ceiling fan is not even a functional object like the other lights.
---
Just keeps getting better. So far I'm on track to never spend one red cent in that cash grab.
---
Really need a little stash box that is tied to account instead of character.
---
Queue 25 orbital strikes...dodge that bitch :-)
---
I don't hate higher level players, I just don't want to be anywhere near them.
---
The quests seemed to quickly take me to the southeastern edge of the map, I have since moved back up to gentler areas but what I really wish for is when fo76 is choosing a server, it groups leveled people together, so no one is 2x or 3x your experience in your world.
---
To others reading:
---
These duped, overpowered weapons everywhere allow owners to completely dominate pv*E* events by one-shotting everything, denying other players experience and loot. In addition, they allow build and glitch combos that can instantly kill other players who haven’t consented to pvp okay.
---
“But one-shotting would still be possible anyway! But that’s a sign of bad exp/loot design! But that’s not true/slash/how pvp should be anyway!”
---
These responses are all a mix of falsehoods, logical fallacies, or irrelevancies. The house is currently in flames. Put the roaring fire out before there’s nothing left to save.
---
To OP I’ve replied to: carry on in blind apathy. You do you.
---
Thank you. :)
---
I'm with you on that. I'm incredibly tired of farming whitesprings and the monster mash, but that's the only reasonably rewarding thing for time invested. I've pretty much given up on FO76 until a balance patch or some new soloable activities pop up in future DLC. Farming those two spots just to get marginally better at farming those two spots isn't working for me.
---
Should try building a floating structure over the hatch. Floors are indestructible, right?
---
I think your joking. But I would suggest he has that many in case most of the server needed them for that quest
---
Without server hopping, or trading with another player, I promise you that your chances of finding an X01 jetpack are miniscule. Prepare to spend the next few years playing this game every day to find it.
---
The mass exodus would be resetting the entire game when there are other very good solutions like the one [UHadmeAtChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/UHadmeAtChicken) suggested
---
It's the DMV quest in human form.
---
Rule #1 You have to cripple her wings (she lands more often and for longer)
---
Rule #2 Punch her in the fartbox (chance of success 50/50)
---
Thanks!  I will check there tonight. 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I don't use Melee. But thanks for the tip.
---
The Ultra-Luxe. THE ULTRA-LUXE. 
---
I’d be screaming and then laughing if I got in this trap. However I thought us higher level players were supposed to be nice to the lower levels and give them the 100 extra purified water weighing us down. Well I’m glad that people are actually role playing as ass holes. Makes the game slightly more interesting 
---
So if his fav youtubers doing this with fo76 then i bet they did the same with other games as well which was not a problem for OP. This whole rant about hating the haters are more annoying. Then don't watch them and search for others who will say good things in a burning house. (its fine meme).
---
Its 930am est. They just or are probably just getting to work right now. Let them take their morning shits for christs sake. 
---
Enforcer is a life changer for putting a stop sign on just about anything big and nasty. SB, mirelurk queens, max lvl deathclaws, whatever. Leg them and clean up. 
---
After you put the SB on the ground, remember to put some rounds into the head- it'll just sit there and chuff and grunt while you beat it to death. 
---
Pack after pack? You choose a single card every level. It has nothing to do with packs 
---
try harder
---
maybe just go by the content of the post, instead of the fantasies you concoct. Bzzzt, fail, thanks for playing, next!
---
I did patrol duty for mine at level 120ish
---
Dagnabbit, I forgot the ^tm
---
Mods. With the plan you can craft them, break them down, and unlock mods for them.
---
It’s also the heaviest.
---
Well put. I played osrs back when it was just runescape. I’ve been playing a lot again since they released the mobile app. It makes skill grinding easier and more enjoyable. 
---
I to was thinking the same thing last night when I was playing FO76. I was thinking about the stash limit and how osrs can keep track of peoples bank accounts and the endless number of transactions that happen in and out of the GE. I’m in no way savvy when it comes to design and construction of a game but I thought maybe Bethesda could learn something from Jagex. 
---
But then you look at ESO and I’m just like wtf Bethesda, how could you make FO76 so lame.  
---
See, when I was low level, I thought that was fun because it provided unpredictably to exploration.  Every now and then, you'd run across a situation where you simply couldn't deal with the enemies, and having to run away or try to skate through unnoticed was a legitimate mechanic.
---
Now, I will grant that I wasn't focused on quests either, so I didn't have anything forcing to explore areas beyond my own curiosity.  If I couldn't get there, I'd just explore somewhere else.  I think a lot of players, faced with this, choose to server hop instead.
---
I'm not gonna ignore a whole other part of a game that's $60 because one only has multiplayer for $60.
---
The first time I made it to white springs to add a third vendor I had level 100’s training mobs on top of me. I died 5 times lol
---
I literally turned on my ps4, started up 76 and crashed scrolling my inventory all in a matter of 5 minutes. Idk why I'm telling you this. Currently doing what this post says and hoping it'll work. 
---
...And confiding in you, random Reddit user? 
---
Yup irlts getting worse, there was 2 level 100+ people who would stop server hopping to me.
---
Some ass thought they would kill me for some free loot. But failed miserably when they tried to taunt me by destroying my base. The guy ended up getting wanted , my friend came over killed him and took all his loot that hes been I'm guess stealing from people. 
---
The douche comes back raging hard, starts using a explosive shotgun to mow down my walls only to become wanted for more caps.
---
My friend proceed to try to kill him. But the troll had another person come and help him.
---
But nope they still failed miserably, I picked up all the loot and ran back to my camp and used the supplies from the troll to repair my house and he was raging even more.
---
So I logged out and in. Instant healed the house by doing so and they douche proceed to stalk me server to server.
---
Please fix this fucking mess Bethesda.
---
Yup. It was so beautiful in Borderlands 2, Claptrap's Stash. You unlocked it as a quest, which was in itself [absolutely hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZKh8puhzg). And this was  back in '12. The Division did this in '16. To release a multiplayer, loot based game, in 2018, without it, is criminal.
---
I’ve found grenades and mines in general pretty useless for me. AI seems way better about running away from grenades and with mines, by the time it’s done beeping and goes off the enemy has gotten clear of the blast area. 
---
Yep, I need this broken buggy mess to be fixed in a timely manner, but most of all I need the bilion dolla corp with everyone's cash in their pockets to keep their word.
---
Why are you convinced character data is stored in a database? I bet they're just save files on a hard drive somewhere which is why they can't restore items or characters. And also why they haven't purged characters with 50 million junk or a stack of 20,000 of an obviously duped wespon.
---
sorry, i should have specified, that "it'll break imersion" was bethesda's reasoning, not my opinion.
---
i've been a strong supporter of text chat for fo76.
---
I think that a perk that gives you recon markers for un-looted corpses would be the best fix for this, b/c it's inline with the game and white it does "break immersion" as bethesda likes to say, it's a reasonable compromise.
---
cap per on the trading subs most of the time- cheaper if buying a lot of bulks. 
---
But vendor items should not be locked behind RNG. Period. It's not like anything any vendor sells will break the game. Just fill the vendor lists with every single item they sell, mark up the pseudo-rare items if need be but gives us a goal to work towards.
---
Example: the xo1 calibrated shocks are roughly .01-.5% chance to be at the vendor. The .01-.5% chance resets every login making to where one could infinitely server hop never to get what they want. That's not cool for an item that merely allows me to carry 50lbs extra weight.
---
It's 15-20, I made a character just to buy them (successfully).
---
Holy shit, I thought I had it bad.
---
Mine too :( 
---
Then her body bounced like a ball for a while and someone's gatling gun kept firing for the entire time we were in the zone. They were gone the gun sounds were not. 
---
There is a fallen log that stretchs over to the monorail track west of the elevator (pretty far west).  If you walk across the log you can walk across the elevator.  You can actually put your camp down there but, unfortunately you can't place any foundations and it is to far above the ground to be able to place foundations on the ground below it.  (WAY below it).  
---
Please never stop being a psychopath. 
---
Eeek no.
---
They stated "more communication" and "soon!" and a week of silence is neither of those things - but let's be fair, NO ONE runs on Valve Time.
---
So you're going to take the time out of your play session, **every play session* to detour into the enclave bunker, all the way up to the command wing, and check for plans?
---
Every.
---
Single.
---
Time.
---
You play?
---
You have significantly more freetime than most people playing this game.
---
"Two weeks." -- The Money Pit
---
I think some of the stigma comes from online videos (youtube) and posts, making the wasteland seem like a more harsh Lord of the Flies scenario. Everyone is apparently a feral maniac
---
So, basically. No matter what you're saying there is going to be a mass exodus then? Sounds about right.
---
The way things are if kept, what do you expect to happen? A few bug fixes and everything is golden. No.
---
We've not seen that be the case so far. So unless something is done about it and something where they take action, what action that is? No viable suggestion has been given to me aside from what I said. Just feelings, which is fine. Again idiots spent real money on TSE weapons. I also mentioned Time, which I would be willing to reinvest into the game .. once it's not entirely broken I know others that would too. Just at a chance for a non mess of a game. 
---
You, not so much, but thats okay. It was a controversial idea.
---
im looking for any TS....where are ppl getting these and the elusive (at least to me) TSE weapons?
---
I can get behind this cause every SBQ fight I have I get trash legendaries compared to things I’ve gotten just exploring, or the same old ULTRACITE LEFT LEG plan 
---
I wasn't aware. Thanks 
---
They haven't shat all week?
---
Also you are aware it's not Monday?
---
I trained the whole cabin to turrent camp that took all my spawns. I don.t farm winterspring. I clear it out like once and while.  When i see no one there.
---
I saw his camp there and the posts on here and did my duty.
---
When i was done all turrents were destroyed lol
---
I've never come across someone with that many assassin pieces so I've not seen it as an issue yet but its something to think about for the pvp games that I try to arrange for randoms. As soon as you remove the explosive weapons, the game is actually really balanced, so it would be such a leap in the right direction. 
---
The only people that like these weapons are those that have them and are narrow minded enough to enjoy owning people who don't yet have them. Balance and variety is the best way to create a great PvP platform. Insanely repetitive first-hit combat is one of the very worst things you can do to a game like this. 
---
It doesn't take a genius to work out that these things kills the game dead. Look at our example: I would have been happy to take you on if we were both using any other weapon that wasn't an OP explosive dick gun. But because you say that's what you'd use, I turn my back and want to avoid you completely. That's exactly what happens in game. Because they are so OP, nobody wants to fight them and that means even the owners of the weapons miss out. 
---
Anyone willing to fight without touching an OP explosive round weapon is welcome to challenge me, attack my base, and join the PvP matches I put together. Anyone who can only PvP using these god weapons deserves to play the game in complete solitude, lonely and completely ignored 
---
&gt; GTA Online was a free addition to a full price title, designed as an experiment. Rockstar themselves had no idea that the Online-Mode would be such a hit, otherwise, they would have probably put more effort into stability/content. 
---
That they soon found making more money then they expected to. Who have had 5 years to put more effort into stability and content while literally making millions off card shark sales. 
---
&gt; I agree that some of the addition were simply garbage, especially the flying motorcycle with extremely precise targeting rockets. However, earning money in this game is relatively easy in my opinion, especially since the release of import/export. You can make so much cash that you'll drown in it, earning like 1.5m in a few hours is not unrealistic.
---
1.5M in a few hours of heavy grinding in a private public lobby or a lobby your crew has taken over. Or utilized the MTU exploit to force a public lobby. And even then you are handicapped for no reason other then they want you to be. My cargobob can pick up a literal tank but I can't pick up a motorcycle or rumpo van because it has supplies for my business in it.  Or just really stupid over sights like the nigh club deliver vehicles. Lets put this armored Rumpo a ramp to push those cars out of the way during a sale. Oh wait the fully upgraded delivery car can barely push NPC cars out of the way and drives like it is going over a permanent oil slick. 
---
Even when they attempt to modernize the sale vehicles for the new far more weaponized age they still cut corners for no reason other then to leave you vulnerable to another player. And they sure as shit won't be retroactively applying a similar change to older business. Hell there are still MC business sales that can be locked onto with homing rockets. Acceptable when there really was very few homing rocket vehicles but now that they are a dime a dozen that is a serious over sight they haven't bothered to update. 
---
&gt; Even with all the problems GTA:O has/had, it's still one of those games I dumped hours into and had so much fun with, even when playing alone. On the other hand, I would not have played FO76 without friends because it's simply boring and unbearable to play alone.
---
If you are not a fan of survival games no you wouldn't enjoy it that much.  I do enjoy survival games so I enjoy myself with or without people. 
---
Thanks for the tip. I utilize sharing plans heavily. Only held on to the above mentioned as I would like to be able to place them in my camp before I get rid of the plans either trading or tossing.
---
Twooo dollars -- Better Off Dead
---
Alot of people started experiencing those same problems around the times people started saying bethesda didn't fix the dupe tricks, just made them harder to pull off, so I'm pretty sure that the Dupers are causing a good bit of the server stability issues
---
Being intentionally blind to the items being duped doesn’t reduce your guilt. If you are buying two shot explosive shotguns it was duped. 
---
HELLLO THERE
---
...yes and for god's sake don't try to get out of power armor in that little 2 or 3 second window the game will give you when you can start moving before it freezes up again. Bad Juju.
---
I get some heavy slowdown if I do that. God forbid I try to run from some angry enemies and turn around to fire. They usually overtake me and I have to turn around again.
---
Tbh the first was probably me also, I just decided to make a new post about it.
---
 Get super duper to have a chance at double production
---
Attacking bases is a part of the game, you aren't automatically a dick for assaulting another player. Some people want to be raiders. 
---
I feel your pain.  I describe my stepson and his teenage kids that play more FPS’s as twitchy.  I’m to old to be twitchy and react that fast.
---
Because gamers, dude.  And clicks for coin.  And the internet hate machine that turns extremist in the gaming corners of the world. Seriously, just gotta stroll through youtube and the scummy avenues of chan boards and stuff to see how awful it is out there and has been for a long time.  No Man's Sky, anything BioWare does now, EA being turned into the devil of microtransaction and business practices even when there are thousands out there even worse and have been worse for over a decade (look at the mobile arena and before that the fb games), and now any and all things Bethesda too.
---
Constructive criticism and critique seems to be forgotten.  There are things to fix, problems to address, things that were handled poorly/badly, and on and on, but there are lots of things that were done well, and things that should deserve constructive criticism for improvement and not some sort of wholesale burning at the stake. 
---
Most are duped. You get them mostly from events like monster mash and uranium fever :) 
---
TSE is waaaaaaaay too op so I decided to get a different one as it kinda ruins the fun. At least for me. I have a TS though so I could sell it to you if you want. 
---
Server hop Morgantown HS and the cat lady house for all the plastic you need
---
Yes there. Not sure where to get them, but I've seem them in the wild

I think a bigger issue would be that if the person took the weapon or item and modded it, I don’t know if it would have the same ID number anymore.  
---
Do you scrap your junk?  Just curious since it really sounds like just too many unique items.
---
I've had the crafting station thing maybe every 10 hours, or its evil twin the one that pulls you back into crafting after exit animation.  Usually the server is bogging when that happens though.
---
I prefer doing that instead of throwing a tantrum every week. *shrug*
---
Good on ya....the  lower lvl ppl.are terrified of dying, and being hogtied.

i usually try to help ppl at least level 15+ b/c they get the game at that point.

It's not exactly a 'Fallout 76 cookbook' as it's been out a while now

No issues with it here.

Yes, they do, it's actually a vegetarian meat loaf
---
Sure.  At work now, but will be on later.  You just have pay the cost of the jet pack as I don't have the flux.
---
Yeah the quest line is not that great anymore. When they nerfed exp gains it really hurt the over all quest line. Your level no longer tends to match the area and you're under leveled. Unlike in the beta and a bit after where doing the quest kept you on par with the area around you.
---
In all honesty a bigger map with more defined zones would help. Imho the map we play on for a Open world mmo style game is SUPER tiny.

You get 40 atoms also for count them, 313+ days total gameplay. 40 atoms. 313+ days. 40 atoms. Again 313+ days and you get 40 atoms. What costs 40 atoms? Nothing.

Constantly swapping. Not enough perk points to justify keeping three levels of lockpick, hacker and big bargain equipped at all times.

I must be catnip to griefers then. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve had people randomly destroy my base, attack me, or shoot my poor cow! Bessy did nothing to those monsters! And yet, time and time again they shoot her and her pin!! She’s traumatized the poor girl!

Bethesda's reasoning so far has been bullshit. When people called them out on lack of FoV slider, they first said that none of the previous games had it. Which as sad as that is, isn't really a valid reason, which was pointed out to them. So they said it's because animations would break with FoV slider. People again called them out on their bullshit. And after some more kicking and screaming, Bethesda finally added the FoV slider. So most of their "reasoning" is utter rubbish. It's just low-effort path-of-least-resistance approach.

Robots seem to really like cliffs :/ I found a miss nanny wanting to tell me a story on a sheer cliff to the east of the top of the world. It was a good story, mind you, but it was a rather odd location to tell it

Careful with the Tato Soup, it is odd in that each bite seems to get warmer/hotter on the spice scale.  The Buffout (matcha) cookies are also pretty good, and the Spiced Bundt Cake is also pretty nice, but very dense, so when you make it I'd suggest getting a large bundt pan or dividing the batter between two medium pans
---
All the recipes are semi-complicated.  I cook and a lot and have a lot of cookbooks with above average recipes, but I have to admit I was hoping for something simpler with the fallout cookbook.  I categorize my cookbooks into two categories, Fancy and Walmart, this is a fancy cookbook.

Priority 1 has got to be to fix the crashing and server disconnects. Other people duping doesn't stop me from playing.

Crashing to desktops stops me from playing.

If you enjoy peeking into game design, I highly recommend watching the postmortem for Ultima Online. Their first hand MMORPG experience is really interesting and the way they and their players handled the issues along that journey are in parts hilarious.
---
For example, almost like bethesda today they didn't communicate properly with their players in the beginning.

In order to be heard people rushed a castle in the main city, naked, drunk, shouting vulgar things in ALL CAPS and vomiting all over the place. :D

Don't worry, they'll probly post another 3 sentence "Inside the Vault" today.

Edit: my bad it was 4 sentences.

None of the comments here will help you. In fully repaired X-01 Power Armor with Rad-X Diluted and RadShield i have like 700 Rad Resist and i still get between 1.5-2 rad per second. People will act here in the comments like they don't get rads but they do. They just refuse to admit it vecause they are either assholes or know a secret glitch. The only way i know how to not get rads in nuke zones is being with someone in party and having and sharing the lvl 3 Rad Sponge perk between you with a 9 points investment in Charisma and alwsys staying close to that person. If there is a way do not get rads while playing solo people are shurelly very secretive about it because stacking RadShields and other items doesn't do shit. I'm poping RadAways like crazy and it's annoying because they are bugged at 0.25 lbs. I bring about 50 RadAways with me and they don't get affected by weight reducing perks at all. If you try to make them cheaper the diluted version weights exactly the same with half the result. Which makes the whole radiation thing very annoying.
---
That's why I waited till past lv 50 on my second character to do quests.  I received the lv 45 sommerset special and it seems pretty good but what I'm really looking forward for to is the daisycutter and bunker buster.
---
That's your opinion. There's no rule written anywhere saying a vendor SHOULD sell anything specific at all. It's what you would prefer.
---
The goal to work towards should have been the nuke launch, or the level up, but people grinded the level and nuke launch by looking everything up on internet.
---
Have you tried launching a nuke without looking up for the codes on the web? That's fuckin hard. That's a hardcore objective. But people don't do that, they nuke whitespring every two hours to get more legendaries.
---
But well if people just want to have everything in the game after less than two months, it's not my problem.
---
i've only ever seen someone place camps in there twice so far. what really chaps my ass is the dickbags that stand in the doorway with a supersledge n won't let anything out of the door for others to get a hit on. I reeeaaaaallly wish they'd make that doorway, just the doorway itself, an open pvp zone so i could mercilessly slaughter asshats without the nuisance of catching a bounty 
---
I havent been able to fast travel since day 2
---
Wew lad. First it was 'It's the holidays', then 'They're only just back from holidays', then 'They only just got to work'. Wonder what the next excuse will be.
---
i server hopped for 2 hours straight one night looking for handmade plans before i hit lvl 40 and havent done it since. got nothing from it but a bunch of lost caps and time. 
---
been farming mutations lately and instead of hopping i just log in and out at the disposal site and its the first and last thing i do for the session. i could see myself server hopping to farm the legendary spawns in the watoga lap but thats at least rewarding
---
STILL WAITING FOR THOSE TO COME BRING IT
---
You don't need anything you cant actually use yet.  When you can use it, you'll find it.
---
Don't be a hoarder.
---
I think you're not realizing you can hit the bumpers (idk what key for pc) to switch between specials. You can look at str cards, then perception cards and so on. Every level up you manually choose 1 card from a pool of every single card in the game. 
---
I will visit if someone nukes it to farm hardened masses, most of which I get from meatpiles I find littering the place.
---
The best part is starting with "Fucking Shut Up"  in his angry rant about all the Reddit posts, and then finishes with an edit about how everyone is dumb for getting mad about a Reddit post.  Lol.

Sunday I spent 3 hours playing the $200 game I purchased,  took over the ammo workshop,  was halfway through an event.  Got kicked and lost it all,  but I guess I'm just a hater.  Fuck me right? Bethesda tried to use us all as a quick access cashcow and now they are getting what they deserve.  
---
Sounds like a group I'd be game for, 135 with TSE handmade, commando build
---
I feel you on the ultracite left leg. I have three ultracite explosive vent plans on me and I've given copies to every player I routinely play with.
---
I'm a lvl 42 and the three people I always team up with are in the low 20's. I spawn all kinds of tough stuff for them to fight but it's getting them xp. Last nigh a group of sub lvl 20 players ran up to the workshop we had and we were friendly, dropped some stuff for them and ran through a defense of the workshop. We all got some xp and the drop was decent. Right after that the low level guys started trying to fight, shooting us and trying mele on us. We didn't want to pvp these guys at all but they wouldn't quit. Of the three two went down almost right away and the third tried to run. He didn't make it far. All three re-spawned and came back to try to seek vengeance but were all killed quickly. Word of the wise to low levels trying to instigate. All that stuff you were farming especially that balistic fiber should be stored in your stash before you go picking fights, thanks. 
---
i seem to have the opposite experience with robots and cliffs.. like when doing the messenger event and the damn messenger cant even navigate over a small bump in the road let alone a cliff, they always get stuck for me 
---
sugar grove. desk fans and clipboards everywhere
---
Ditto.  I can't stand having the base right out back going Breaking- Bad finale on the clubhouse.  Take off the turrets, no foul.
---
Because they enjoy the product that the COMPANY makes and trust them to fix their mistakes. How does this harm you exactly?
---
Too lazy to run to the RR station?
---
I am at work, but will be off in a few hours, depends on how much you're spoiling for an arse kicking.... ;-)
---
There is no answer from Bethesda
---
Thank you, my id is sale_grosso
---
I have server hopped for one reason only, that damn broken quest they fixed with the overseers boyfriend or w/e.
---
You dont have to.
---
See people, THIS is the type of stuff a real raider would do for entertainment.
---
Put the PA pieces on a frame and it will only weigh 10 pounds. Dont save them separately. 
---
Same lvled to 15 and server hopped for like 5mins and got the plans at the rail station at Watoga. Ez Pz
---
That's a different bot. There's the responders bot who is solo, then the pack of dogs, then the eye not with rat crew, then mole rats, then super mutants and also ghouls. I got him to spawn twice today, once at one bridge near the wood shack and then another time north you go to the other bridge then come back down the rails towards station again. 
---
Hello, Im playing since the Beta and have more than 400h of gameplay.
---
I hate the new PA that was introduced with fo4 so I played the game without using it.
---
Same thing with fo76, I played most of the time without PA and wanted to explore nukezones without PA or hazmad suit.
---
After I finally got a full set of rad res armor I couldnt wait to explore a nuke zone! But I still got like 7-15 rads.( ~400 rad from armor, used rad shield and radx after seeing that I still get a high amount of rads) 
---
Sold most of the armor pieces after seeing that you are forced to use PA in nuke zones :(. Sad because it took me quiet a while to find all these, just to find out they are "useless". 
---
I mean, with rad sponge and enough radaway its possible, but definitely not worth it :/. 
---
This was about 1 month ago, haven't done any research since then. 
---
I got mine in the extreme north east at a place called Freddy fears costume shop. It is east of the large mega red rocket. I got a couple of complete costumes, so I gifted a set to a new player. I hope they live
---
I'd hope so! My Carnivore mutation was a little iffy though. Sometimes I'd get double the benefit, other times normal. All I was worried about was the other mutations and new ones I may get after. As with a lot of things in the game, sometimes it works and other times it doesn't! There do seem to be way too many bugs. This one is a minor one compared to not being about to team up with people on my friends list.
---
nevermind
---
They would have to stop and think, and you can't fast travel while taking HP damage, so they'd have to time it right.
---
Had one last night that gave the thumbs up emote when he entered an area.  I thumbs up back.  Then he killed my buddy and I that both had pacifist on before we could do anything.  Dick move buddy...Dick move.
---
Only ran into maybe 3ish players like that so far.  Not normally a problem. 
---
I lost an X-01 Jetpack to this stupid ass bug.
---
just server hop until you find a server with high levels. since it’s a server wide event the high levels will all come and help you. 
---
Did you know you can place your cow on the second story of your house?  ;)
---
It used to happen to me in other games with other hardware too, not just this game.  It doesn't happen often, but I have learned not to turn too quickly most of the time.  Not good for pvp, but that was never really a thing for me.
---
When they can be fucked
---
Gotcha.  So i can scrap all the legendary armor and weapons.   I was not sure if i would find them again.
---
3-5k from what i've seen on the trade subs. Maybe more from super-motivated peeps. 
---
My boyfriend and I have talked about this and I agree. I played OSRS and would love to implement those aspects. It was nice playing and knowing I wouldn't have to deal with PVP if I didn't want to.
---
Thooouuuggghhhh... The anxiety of not knowing if someone is friendly or not does add to the post apocalyptic idea
---
Does this rag smell funny to you?
---
Proof
---
Real money for in game cheated items is really bad. It enables cheaters to profit off their cheats, compounding the problem as they start to see real world benefits from their behavior. 
---
Punishing them should indeed be a priority but fixing what enables them should be, too. Some have floated the theory that Bethesda designed their game in such a way that they are unable to fix it, but that just sounds like an unsupported flight of fancy to me. Bethesda is traditionally slow to patch, their post release patches so far are an unusually fast development for them.
---
So what am I saying? Candyland wont be forever. Either Bethesda patches fast, or the game is dead. 
---
Just earn the caps again, it’s a game, you can earn around 1400 daily if you visit all the faction vendors and sell to them till their caps are gone
---
Feel free to add me. PM so I can send you discord info.
---
Yeah but I have t45 t50 and x01 pieces and they cant go on the same frame.  They just swap in my inventory.
---
you can sell legendary - you can't scrap
---
They are me and my team where doing queen and it keep crashing us then everytime we went back too a new server it froze
---
Makes sense.
---
And the Flame Trap Plans? Do you remember where you got them?
---
everyone on my server is too p***y to come fight me, im holed up in a fortress
---
Felt bad last night.  Have my base just north of the Whitespring RR terminal, saw a humanoid figure go running in a straight line and stopped - No movement.  "Ahh, rogue scorched" Hit crouched, hit vats, fired, dead level 30 character.  One shot, woops!  Sorry if it was any of you.
---
&gt;Im on PC and im level 21 , Syrdrai (ingame name)
---
 and crafting is not needed  just spare blueprints if possible:)
---
Wut. QoL changes don't make the game easier, just more playable
---
575/600 is weight/weight limit.
---
Dropping scrap from your inventory on the ground does not affect your stash.
---
Find power armor frames and store parts in them. To pick one up if you can't equip the parts yet: Get all parts out, enter frame, leave frame, put parts back in and go ahead with your business. Your frame will be moved to your inventory even if you can't enter it anymore because of high level parts.
---
i met one level 190 and he kept server hopping to find me and he ended up destroying my camp every time he could. not to mention that i had a generator my friend placed down that i didn’t have the plans for and now i can’t place it down again. ;(
---
What system are you playing on?
---
Fucking Scott
---
saw a simliar thing, it seems to spawn a new key for each player that joins the server or something.  so your key will have a quest marker on it.  
---
i'm sure they did this to "fix" the key not being there if someone got to it before you, but now you have to scroll through a million to find the one with the diamond!  
---
I'm camped that far north, on the west of the map.  It's quiet.  I like quiet.
---
I think it's really the Combat Shotgun.  When you have Enforcer, the point isn't really to have the most damaging Shotgun - it's about firing lots of shots quickly in order to get that 30% probability to happen.
---
I ended up crafting a Marksman's Combat Shotgun (a.k.a. a ridiculous "sniper shotgun" from the original Doom) for this purpose.
---
That’s actually what I’ve been doing for the past two weeks, sadly. 
---
I came across a large pile of junk in a Nuke Zone, not duped but enough to make me overencumbered. I was low on caps and wanted to keep parts of it and sell the rest. So almost every day I play only an hour or two and I just run to the big plastic farms, a few vendors, maybe explore a little, then to my base to bulk everything, then I log off. 
---
I had hit a lull in my gameplay but didn’t want to stop playing. I also don’t want to just drop all of it hoping someone will use it, or worse, chase down lower level players and try to convince them they need these things. 
---
Also, it takes less than a minute to get to the Military Wing from the Service Entrance. 
---
find another PA Frame - you can have a mix and match of different parts (t45 helmet, t50 torso, etc)
---
If the other topics in this sub have taught me anything, it's that this is your fault because you rushed through the game. If you just sat back, took it slow, killed a couple supermutants a week, you wouldn't have even acquired that jetpack for another 8 months or more.
---
So if I deleted your account you wouldn't mind because you could just level up again?
---
Guy from 4chan has the patience of an autistic teenager, color me surprised.
---
yep. some people show masks and other things that have not yet been added to the world. I think that the only way to get them in the game is the devs test room.
---
thx, I did not know we already have access to every card in the game (even though i dont).
---
Then what are the packs (every five levels) for? 
---
I thought the packs added new or dup cards to your available inventory of cards.
---
Have em go for a swim then remove the ladder 
---
You can mix and match pieces, you just can't have two helmets on same frame. 
---
That makes no sense.
---
Get your priorities correct. The company that keeps fucking up releases one decent product and is being lauded as the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's silly.
---
You do NOT defend the company. You defend that single product, which is fine. But blindly defending a company with poor business practices because you like a game of theirs, is mindless and only feeds into them getting more of your money for the same poor quality shit outside of that one product.
---
Did I step into the twilight zone or something were we don't know how to differentiate products from company practices?
---
Proper PVP here. Not mindless murder, but preying on the foolish. I would cheer for you if you got me with this.
---
Getting rid of a gun and wiping everyone’s progress are two separate and different things that aren’t even close enough for a comparison. All you did was take an extreme in an attempt to sway my opinion 
---
Yeah my issue is i have almost complete sets.  4 frames needed.
---
Holy cow cakes! I did not! Now I’m trying to re imagine my camp
---
&gt; I just want to see one video where Bethesda is actually being acknowledged for making changes to the game. 
---
One reddit post I replied to said that Bethesda were doing nothing.  I pointed out that before Christmas they were literally making one patch a week.  The person replied "but they were not the patches *I* want).
---
Ok, thx, bye.
---
I've seen electric so far, should make a nice cow prod.
---
This. You can't close Pandora's box again. They'll wreck anybody they can catch selling for cash, but they're secretly kind of thrilled that the game has a thriving cap economy for stuff like this. They aren't thrilled that it's not the economy they designed or expected it to have, and that they have no control over it, but it has dedicated players grinding on a game that the sales figures are not great for. 
---
Perfect!  Thanks for this info :)
---
That map is so helpful, thank you! Now i have more lead than i can possibly need. Bullets for days!
---
Lost 2 x-01 calibrated shocks and a jetpack when I switched from Wood to Steel in my base, no heads up or anything...
---
Good on you sir!  Helping newbs is already great, it lets them know not everybody is out to kill them in one epic TSE burst lol!
---
I need to dump my level 15 raider set I got from Rose onto some newb since I dropped it out of my inventory and it spawned all low level parts.  I've already got a set of lvl 45 raider armor so I'm set on that front!
---
grab all the golf balls, cue balls, pool cues, packs of cigarettes, baseball bats, umbrellas and golf clubs when you go through whitesprings
---
Yea, keep server hopping and grabbing that frame - that's how i did it early on...
---
I'll be online in a few hours, please remain where you are ;-)
---
The stash is limited weight. This weight is unaffected by perks and legendary effects - so it's actually better to hoard stuff on yourself instead of in the stash box, since you can use perks to get your junk to weigh almost nothing while on you but it will still weigh the full amount inside your stash box.
---
Also, don't hoard high level gear. You don't need it, you will find plenty by the time you reach that level. Maybe if you're halfway through level 28 and you find a really nice modded level 30 rifle, you can justify that. But at 26 you should just be scrapping them or leaving them behind. 
---
Sell off most of your legendaries; it might seem counter intuitive at first, and it might be painful to see that cool rifle go for 10 caps at a vendor, but you will never use it and you don't have the capacity to just have it sitting around. Just keep one or two of your favorites for each weapon that you use. If you're going for a very specific build like energy rifles, you can probably justify having a handful of legendaries for the same weapon. But ultimately you will always end up replacing whatever you have for a top tier 2* or 3* gun
---
Oh, and I'm sure there are other things you don't need. Gunpowder is easy to come by and even easier to craft, you should have a few hundred on you at most and it should always be in your stash. Power armor pieces should either be on a frame or not there at all. If the parts are too high level, you can put them on a frame and wait for the frame to be auto-placed into your inventory. Chances are you will just have one suit that you use in the end-game anyway, and maybe a spare excavator set for looting. After almost 200 hours I've never really used any of the fully completed max level sets I have stored in my stash. With chems and ammo, just take what you need. You have to train yourself to leave valuable items behind in this game because there is just too much of it everywhere
---
Yeah, the storage limit is annoying. Really annoying ... but it has its purpose. They've increased it once, so assuming there wasn't negative effects from it on the server, hopefully they'll increase it again at some point thisnyear.
---
That said, its not worth storing weapons that are higher level. Figure out which components you use the most and mark them. Unless an item has a magnifying glass next to when you hover, don't pick it up for the sake of picking it up.
---
To get rid of unneeded components, use the Tinker Bench at the Overseer's camp and craft them into bulk items which you can sell to vendors. 
---
Components that you do use, don't exceed 100/125 pieces. I went overboard with wood and steel and that are up a good chunk of my storage.
---
If you haven't broken your junk down to components yet, go right to a vendor and sell it. Here's a map of the vendors: (https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/Vendors-Fallout-76.asp); vendors of the same factions share caps and each faction has a $200 cap limit. I hope between Charleston Station, Sutton Station, and Whitespring Station.
---
Trade. You have the entirety of the playerbase on your system to make that happen.
---
I just learned this myself. I was kidding around after a new camp
---
Build 2 days ago and placed her upstairs. She was cool with it. 😁👍
---
The 3 western zones, The forest, toxic valley(?) and the heap are supposedly level locked at 15, 25, and 35 respectively. Though I have spawned a 65 Scorchbeast in the heap during an event and some high lvl scorched during a horde event.
---
Everything east of Whitesprings or in the savage divide has an uncapped level.
---
If you hit mobs that are too high for you, swap servers and you'll hopefully get a new lower leveled spawn.
---
Hopefully BGS implements something so that high lvl mobs despawn once the high lvl player goes far enough away from them and respawn again when another player gets close enough. So people dont have to server jump, or harder lvl limits for zones like you find in WoW. Ie: the forest is lvl 1 -15, toxic valley is 15 -25, ash heap is 25- 35, savage divide is 35-45 and cranberry bog and the mire are 50+.
---
As it stands I think mobs stay spawned until they are killed.
---
PA and the lone wanderer perk help a ton as a solo player.
---
I only server hop for events, doing it for items feels like cheating. 
---
They really should add a pure PvP zone likethe wilderness or the Dark Zone in the Division. There should be pve objectives there too just like in the Wildy or DZ to entice players in. 
---
So theres two of you?! The plot thickens
---
I've had people try and snipe me and I promptly ignored them... though my cousin ended up killing them repeatedly until they switched servers. Tends to happen when you troll the wrong people. Now I don't see many griefers. 
---
Sadly being high level means people assume YOU are one of those trolls too. I try to drop some recipes, plans, ammo, chems, and even some rare under armor that I can craft like the BoS Officer Uniform.
---
Yeah, from watching the vids they need to reconnect to the same server to get their duped stuff so crashing the server is not in their best intrests.
---
What  [UHadmeAtChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/UHadmeAtChicken) suggested wouldn't cause a mass exodus.   
---
Your idea is not even controversial, it's just a bad idea. 
---
Are Tesla’s that good? I learned how to make one a long time ago and am wondering if its a better alternative to using laser weaponry?
---
That defeats the purpose of them being wanted and you getting revenge for what they did to your camp. Damaging/killing something like a mirelurk, which is an already near impossible taming mechanic, and practically getting away with it If they're in their camp. That asylum mechanic is protecting griefers. That shouldn't even exist as a feature.
---
People don't know how to tell the difference between what a company does. Versus a product they put out. They think they are one in the same. Those sheeple will never see through the wool covering their eyes cause they "like the game" when its the fucking company being talked about, lol.
---
Ya the packs are just random cards you get every 5 levels. They are usually duplicates. You can just choose a single card that you want by tabbing through them all 
---
Springs: Sugar Grove, Camp McClintock, Enclave pest control missions (Yau gui)
---
Screws: Sugar Grove, West Tek Research Facility, Abandoned Bogtown secret room ( All the way to the top of the scafolding between 2 tall buildings, drop down elevator shaft.) 
---
Lead: Lucky Hole Mine and Excavator Armour
---
Copper: Abandoned Bog Town, copper nodes and Excavator opposite Whitesprings Train Station
---
Acid: Bulk it and then scrap it for 5 extra acid at the cost of 2 plastic
---
Plastic: Any cafeteria
---
Steel:  Super Mutants, Scorched for weapons

&gt; My stash box says 575/600. WTF does that mean?

That's weight, just like your player inventory. The Stash Box has limits, too, which means proper inventory management is a must. A few pointers:  
---
* Always scrap your junk before storing. This will significantly reduce the weight of those items.  
---
* Convert your Copper and Lead Scraps into Bulk stacks before storing them in the Stash Box.  
---
* Put Power Armor pieces onto a Power Armor Chassis; don't hold them separately in your inventory. The Chassis has a base weight of 10 with or without PA pieces equipped.  
---
* Invest in Strength Perk Cards that will help with your carry weight. Pack Rat, Strong Back, Sturdy Frame, etc.  
---
* Don't hold guns and armor that are above your level unless they're unique legendaries. Sell them to a robot vendor for Caps, or scrap them for extra parts.
---
So you're saying the truth is...out there?
---
This is why people have trust issues man
---
Maybe after the patch, but I wouldn't hold my breath for retroactive action. 
---
I really don't understand those people who buy this duped items. The game is all about progression. Buying best in slot items basically means you won't progress anymore, combat-wise at least. Then what, using those godlike powers to farm - what, camp plans? To pwn everyone in PvP? 
---
&gt; We expected a lot more. 
---
From the company that famously releases buggy games?
---
Really?  You expected more?
---
I dont think Bethesda has the Logs to punish these people or remove any duped Items.
---
We will see how they handle this.
---
Thanks. 
---
nice answer, i needed it a month ago!  lol
---
I figured it out eventually, but it was not intuitive to me initially that you had to put the chassis on the station, because that's not how the regular armor station works, and there's no prompt to do that.  The clue was that you find them on the stations like that. 
---
I want weapon and armor displays, they’d have to turn the them static or something so folks couldn’t just wander up and steal ‘em. 
---
Cluttered tables and shelves would be nice too. 
---
Junk walls that clip into the ground so they don’t float on uneven ground. 
---
Anything that makes camps look more natural and lived in is big on my wishlist. 
---
If you buy any item on reddit its duped, I've bought a lot I have no guilt.
---
Is that high survivable with bird bones?  So tempted to run down the rail and jump off the end....  might even do it w/o BB.  XD
---
Its in the red pipe
---
Ultracite
---
It's a bigger fo4 with dialog removed.  If that sounds appealing you will probably see past the bugs and have fun with it.
---
Look around outside. There's probably a door where you might not expect a door.
---
I just wait till I see everyone evacuating bc their inventory is full then go. Your waves of enemies won't spawn till you're there so you'll get the full spawn at club house and all the houses, lower rads as well
---
There’s a terminal
---
I’m the basement on the back wall. It took me a few minutes to find it. Once you hit the basement look for a terminal. On one of the walls. There were some pipes or something of that nature blocking it so you can’t see it until you go around them. 
---
Definitely not the case. He did it a couple times, and I definitely did not have a bounty or hit him by accident (I was using melee, think I would’ve noticed)
---
I looked there's nothing that I see
---
Sounds like the only way to travel to me
---
Its a secret entrance
---
Not that any of that matters. All I get there is one star legendaries. Rarely ever get anything over a star there. 
---
Can craft the T51b torso,think I got it from treasure maps.
---
Weird. I had an issue with the shooting course, because my character wasn't built for shooting speed, all I had was a Hunting Rifle, and working the bolt and reloading was too slow to pass the test. So I always end up crafting a lowest level pipe pistol, and fitting it with the long barrel for accuracy. But I haven't had any trouble with obstacle course.
---
Some suggestions - get yourself Speed Demon mutation, and if you haven't already, exit Power Armor. Power Armor gives you -20% movement speed, Speed Demon gives you a +20%. Or pick up a pistol and get Gun Runner perk, same +20% buff, and doesn't stack with Speed Demon. This alone should put you over the edge.
---
Obviously, make sure you're not overencumbered and can sprint, it's a great help for the parts where you have to run through a water pit, and over the pyramid. There's also consummables that restore AP, so even overencumbered you can hotkey those (at least on PC we can, maybe on controller too?) and sprint anyway.
---
Beyond that, practice, practice and more practice, I guess. 
---
What? Where the hell is the basement? 😂
---
What? No! Why would you think that?
---
All I want is pepperoni rolls in the game.
---
Montani semper liberi
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
I want to believe
---
Yeah, it's pretty asinine how some users - particularly on r/Fallout \- can't just "let go."  They have to leave their snarky imprint on literally every 76 post.
---
Which is ironic, considering how they worship Dead Money.  Apparently the moral of that one didn't actually stick.
---
There’s a wood plank on the outside that goes down towards the pipe, the side of the pipe itself is the door and then you walk down the pipe toward your marker. If you’re above the marker follow the pipe backwards to the corner of the building.
---
Winter Jacket and Jeans is awesome. 
---
I suspect that some folks are equating "content" with "gameplay time." Something like Enter the Gungeon (which is a shit ton of fun and has tons of replay value) does not have the amount of content of 76, it just has a different gameplay style and game design that rewards replayability, which is something 76 currently lacks (giant map is giant, but once you see it, it never changes).
---
Don't get me wrong, every game I've seen mentioned as a reply is solid gold (and I have and enjoy most of them), it's just not technically answering the question you asked.
---
Yeah it's unfortunate. It reminds me of the Legendary weapon grind in Guild Wars 2 back in its first few years.
---
To craft a legendary weapon you needed a specific "precursor" a single specific lesser legendary weapon along with a boatload of other hard to get items. The problem though was finding these precursor weapons in the wild, playing the game normally, was exceedingly rare. Your best chance to get one was to sink months worth of resources into the mystic (toilet) for a random chance at a weapon of the same class, with a miniscule chance the weapon it spits out would be a lesser legendary. If you want a specific precursor sword, prepare to flushing hundreds of thousands of swords(which you'll likely be crafting) into the mystic toilet.
---
The lack of a clear progression was extremely demoralizing to the playerbase and caused Guild Wars 2 to shed a huge number of players until they finally changed it and added clear routes of progression towards the best items. RNG simply doesn't work. Fallout 76 isn't the first to try it, plenty of similar games like Guild Wars 2, Diablo 3, and The Division have all tried it, and they all gave up on it because it's non-viable.
---
Hopefully Bethesda goes the same route and improves things like these other games did.
---
Pacifist mode on, no bounty, can still be killed if you stack bobbleheads. Also damage is no longer a thing. Thank you dupers...
---
More like the outrage died because no one came with proof.
---
The legendary system isn't broken, the map is. There's only one true location and boss for endgame content.
---
Well if you want that anxiety you can always head to the wilderness. They could even call it the glowing sea and have something like that for it. Would be really cool.
---
Ah now, Black Diamond is a bit nice.
---
Yea, this is the only thing that should matter for everyone. The game crashing three times a session is completely unacceptable. I don’t give a shit If people want to spend their money on an item, their decision - stupid or not. That shit happens in all online games. It’s their fault for taking this long to fix duping but it doesn’t impact me in any way. 
---
I know what it meant, lol.
---
If it's bad, then do take the time and suggest something better than arguing with me over a point thats getting us no where.
---
I lost my x-01 jet pack because I had 6/2 steel left  not sure why it was used when I had steel left over but it was.
---
Getting rid of peoples gun is wiping their progress.  I saved up thousands of caps to buy the weapons I currently own, I don't want to wake up a morning with bethesda telling me I have to do it again.  And yes I know I can earn 1400 daily, I've been doing it everyday when saving up and I don't want to have to do it again because of a patch. 
---
When you were typing that a good robot was waiting for me at the entrance. Is dead now. But because of him I found the entrance 🤓
---
Life: get one 
---
Or Camden park( nuka cups with straws), fort defiance top floor kitchen as pool table, and the picnic tables in lewisburg
---
No, you're right, that genie is out of the bottle.
---
Haven't seen any. But I haven't been looking. Many weapon mods can be learnt via scrapping 
---
I'm gnot a gnelf
---
Agreed.
---
though it just seems hes being argumentative in this thread vs adding to anyone elses ideas.
---
I don't understand how you guys play this game, for me this part was huge fun , to find new weapons, to discover new mods for them, to find rare plans, having stuff handed to me would just spoil everything....
---
The only guy who was a dick to me was some griefer in beta. I've been #blessed.
---
I did.  Read my previous comments. I think what   [UHadmeAtChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/UHadmeAtChicken)   said is the way to go, and is probably what they are going to do. " fix the dupe glitch, add 4\* and higher enemy level. and nerf explosives so it takes more shots. "
---
I’ll always do it. MikeGarr16
---
Traps can’t prevent fast travel
---
There is a green alien in the game, but its dead.
---
&gt; "I'm angry because a shit game gets shit"? 
---
No, he's saying that he's angry because the game gets lazy, ill-informed and unhelpful shit.
---
&gt; I don't even understand why you guys keep playing F76.
---
Because, bizarre though it may seem to you on your Olympian heights, it's actually quite fun.
---
&gt; It's dead anyway
---
Sorry?  I expect that when I get home this evening it will work, just like it worked yesterday.  Do you have some inside knowledge?
---
&gt; and probably going F2P in 6 months.
---
Ah, a precog.  Know the winning LOTO numbers for this week?
---
It's not an ideal solution, but just to get you over the hump... You could go gather mutations until you end up with Marsupial, which is the one that lets you jump much higher than usual. Do the course with it, then clean yourself up (if desired) and get on with the game. (Speed Demon will help as well, but Marsupial is the real winner.)
---
To farm mutations:
---
\- Store all of your junk.
---
\- Find someplace with radiation. Could be just any old puddle of water, but a radioactive barrel is much faster.
---
\- Stand in it / next to it until you die.
---
\- Maybe you get a mutation. Maybe you don't. If you don't, resurrect and then limp over to the spot and do it again.
---
\- Eventually you'll get a mutation. It probably won't be the one you want. If it isn't, log out of the server and back in. (Game limits you to one mutation every 30 minutes, I think, but switching servers resets this.)
---
\- Keep going. You'll end up with a bunch of interesting mutations with crippling side effects. But this is only temporary. It will pass.
---
\- DO NOT TAKE RADAWAY. It'll wipe out mutations. Just drag your glowing half-dead corpse around until you get through this nightmare.
---
\- Once you have Marsupial, go run the course.
---
\- Now RadAway your troubles and put this madness behind you.
---
I'm curious what new bugs the patch will bring.
---
Lucky I've only got one legendary in 5 kills.
---
No they deserve it
---
A AAA company released hot garbage and can't fix massive exploits and probably doesn't even care. I lost all interest in the game
---
Until the leader is killed. That usually ends the spawning I've found. Still, tons of them in the club. Probably 50 corpses at the club and another 30 down by the gate (inside the security booth)  that leads to the nearby fissure. 
---
Trust no one.
---
I am around lvl 125 and running a low life 2 handed build. I have almost all the mutations with class freak maxed. Will play in a few hours if you wanna team up. Ign: gagaist. Have 4 nuke cards btw
---
Rimworld thinks your idea is cute
---
Find a group and grind out queen kills, you’ll get a bunch 
---
&gt; you spawn the worst monsters and nothing takes the fun out of the game like being killed six times in 10 minutes.
---
It's not that bad.  I'm currently doing a run where I'm trying to rush the main quest only at whatever level I'm at -- currently at 14 about to do the Wendigo Cave with a brawler build (we'll see how that works -- may need to die a few times so I can get to 15 and put the armor pieces on my frame finally).
---
It's true that sometimes you walk up to a destination and see it populated with level 60+ supermutants or whatever.  But if you server hop a few times you'll eventually see it spawn just for you with level-appropriate content.  This works pretty much everywhere except popular spots like Watoga and Whitespring.  There, you're just stuck with the endgame content.

Fissures
---
I know that, but I figured out the answer to my comment.
---
Apparently Charlie was "correct", but it shouldn't have been. So they were trying to figure it out.
---
Dropped a couple of legendary batons, they're comedy weapons like the bloody rolling pin I keep getting :-)
---
Look in the mods tab on the vendors. Someone in the forest should have one. Might take a hop or 2
---
Did a Queen yesterday got a 2* tire iron.....not as bad as nothing but close.
---
Awesome!
---
thx, what are the specs on your TS, and anybody got the specs on the TSE?
---
ive never seen them.
---
Yes, Bethesda can put a guarantee on the SBQ. They can give her a loot table all her own whenever they want. It's just being lazy.
---
A while back, I ran into a player with the same uniform, looking just like Hitler. I was wondering what happened to that guy. Now I find out he's taking players to FlavorTown. 
---
Speed Demon could work as I'm pretty close on good tries. 
---
Using the aiming button (L2 on PS4) helped with the rope and the beam walking. Falling down costs more time than walking slowly.
---
I play without Power Armor 90% of the time so that isn't a problem (I know some people who lives in their PAs) 
---
serious question, does this not give you a bounty?  I love it, don't get me wrong, but it should give you a bounty.
---
I tried that, but they never showed up. Then again, the game was doing the "let's just have everyone around you spontaneously die" thing, so maybe something bugged out.
---
&gt; Also TSE weapons are broke as fuck, need to have the perks "modifiers removed from it I.E Demo expert and Grenadier and the legendary effects SHOULD NOT stack for those two effects, much like how other effects do not stack together."
---
Which I expanded upon on how to "nerf explosive". Ideas need to be fleshed out, that was also not your suggestion, lol. He could have easily held the conversation with me, since it was HIS idea.
---
But if you think thats how it should be? Why do you think that. What about that idea makes you believe it will fix the issues duping have caused? I am genuinely interest to know. {Seriously not trying to sound like a dick.}
---
*insert Drake meme 👉 OSRS and 👋RS3
---
Yes, it spawns around fissure sites...
---
Jigsaw is that you? Creepy brilliant i must say.
---
Yes. I've had it for almost two weeks now on XB, and have played solo the entire time. I've only had one issue with being disconnected so far, and immediately logged back in on another server.
---
I miss the NPC's, inventory management is an issue until you get used to the new system, and base building is much more frustrating than in FO4, but it's definitely a fallout game.
---
If you love the franchise, then get it.
---
I just left a server where 3 nukes were launched at the white springs area.  I didn’t feel like messing with all that but by the time I made it to white springs I saw the same thing.  This was way after the blast zone was cleared up.  I’m thinking we were just in the same server a lil bit ago.  I was on the PS4. 
---
OOOhhhh yes!! I forgot about Fort Defiance.
---
Also, I'm always at Camden doing those dailies...I'll need to remember those cups and straws
---
That’s how I see it too. It needs to be fixed, however they do it, or they’ll lose their reliable players and then duper’s will lose their market. Game dies. This should have been officially acknowledged and at the top of the list of priorities. I have no wish for a game I enjoy playing to wither on the vine.
---
Try the soup. It's excellent.
---
better at tagging everything so you get your loot when in a mob of people
---
There may be hidden aliens in the game or it may be dlc, but the Flatwoods monster and the Alien are TWO different monsters with two different challenges.
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/a/ae/Fo4_alien.png/revision/latest?cb=20160129222420
---
The alien looks like this.
---
It’s only arguably the best, X0-1 still has the ballistic damage and rad best stats but Ultracite is better against energy. So in general X0-1 is better but Ultracite is better against Scorchbeasts. 
---
I agree with you but, I don't necessarily think it's exhausting personally, just more annoying. Like we get it things went terribly wrong but, it's like beating a dead horse at this point. It's like a funny joke that gets more unfunny after being repeated too much. I'm in a couple of Bethesda and Fallout groups. I can't enjoy many good posts because most of it is repeated opinions and terribly made memes. 
---
I don't have to server hop since the disconnects and CTDs take care of that for me.
---
I hate this "feature."  My workarounds include: 1) dropping everything and installing important mods as soon as I get them, as in immediately, and 2) keeping some trash mods in my stash as a buffer.  Doesn't always work, but at least reduces the odds of an important one getting eaten first.  Barbed walking cane mods even come before most of the important ones in the alphabet so they actually have a use.
---
JEESUS CHRIST.
---
Not my expert opinion. Check the names.
---
Oh man I've been server hopping for the t-60 jetpack, got it last week so happy after many hundred hops, then when just getting my 200 caps from Mr enclave bunker guy yesterday, I got the jetpack x-01 mod. Carefully put it in my stash until I have the build mats, i don't want a bullshit auto junk bug scrapping it.
---
k spoilers bud.
---
I didn't say it was broken so to speak its "working as intended".  For example, lv 80 diseased scorchbeast in glassed cavern could possibly drop gauss rifles every time but has a 10% chance to drop a legendary version. And more team members has a better chance to have more effects.
---
collect at fissures (usually 5-10) and a very high amount in the Glass Cavern (about 40+) , but there will be a lot of enemies. 
---
Bagger 288 is a baby.  Check out Bagger 293.
---
Yes, let's make F76 Escape Rooms. 
---
You know what else is a thing, accounts that have a character on them that can crash the server at will.
---
fissure sites or gliss caverns
---
It’s been awhile since I did the mission but if I remember correctly you go out the back and there’s some big pipes. If you lookin at them one of them had a door that can slide open and you enter through there. 
---
Just don't use it on Chally - Grahm will not like it.  XD
---
That’s valid, but imagine how long your weapons last with both Gunsmith slotted and double repaired? I can confirm all this plus luck of the draw makes a big difference in keeping weapons working. Unfortunately Luck of the Draw does not work on the White Overcondition bar, only after its used up. 
---
But your way is a valid way to save SPECIAL for other things if Int is less desired in a build.
---
Didn't realise there was a fissure up there as well.
---
Hello darkness my old friend, I've come to talk with you again.
---
Oh of course I have plenty of other guns, but if someone is destroying bases and such for no reason, there is no chance that I'm going to try to be fair and impartial.
---
Even without explosive weapons using things like broken unyielding/bloodied builds it's not going to be enjoyable. People will rarely keep anything that isn't as strong as possible, and they always try to win in any way.
---
I fully endorse and enjoy the fight-club style arenas with rules, but it usually doesn't last long before griefers arrive 
---
I can empathize with the part about work.  There are really two kinds of people who play this game.  The ones who play it as scavengers who adapt to whatever the game throws at them, and the ones who insist on having the best of everything as quickly as possible who server hop and grind like mad.
---
Personally, I think the latter camp ruins the game for themselves, but who am I to judge?  I just hope that when Bethesda adds new content, they don't make the assumption that those players are the target demographic like Borderlands 2 did and throw the difficulty curve completely out of whack.
---
Yup found it! Thank you 
---
Duping is a major cause of the server disconnects at the moment though. The resource overhead for the duplication is high, and bogs down the server. Not sure how the instances are provisioned, but if one instance maxes out its resources, it’s going to impact everyone on that instance, whether you’re duping or not.
---
People just shouldn’t buy duped guns, then they wouldn’t have to worry. Everything in my save I earned, never bought a single thing from a player. 
---
That's annecdotal though. What's to say that it isn't just Watoga having 200 more items to sell to someone above lvl 20 than it does someone below? The "trade stealing exploit" had a lot of people that supposedly had it happen to them too.
---
By the Butterfly Icon,In toxic valley, is a Lead and Junk Node you can place yer camp. Having both running in yer camp will fill yer stash box fairly quickly.
---
I only server hop for 3 reasons: 1) searching for events to do if the server is dead, 2) farming thenical data for the BoS (a VERY tedious process..), and 3) to see if anyone has nuked the queen.
---
It doesn't give you a bounty though if it did people would bait you into wanted status with your own C.A.M.P. items which is arguably worse. The traps themselves do very little damage.
---
What barrel attachment do you recommend for that? Should I just use the auto then for just auto crazy tagging or the shotgun for more tagging in one shot type deal
---
FYI, if you have his trade window open, he's still walking around.      
---
I tried this the other day and by the time someone made it to me, he was long gone.  
---
If you want to help others, follow him around, he doesnt sit still like we want, lolz.
---
Np my friend. Remember the terminal is hidden on one of the walls. It’s view is instructed by some pipes. 
---
I think it'd be far better to introduce new servers which would require a new character creation after the dupe problem is confirmed to be resolved.  That way players which are bothered by the TSE weapons enough to start over can and those of us that aren't affected so much can keep our characters.
---
How much you need ? I can just give you some for karma love
---
Inb4 Bethesda permbans OP for being a Nazi like they did to that guy that made anti gay jokes.
---
Then don't buy it if you don't think it is worth it. You have no one to blame but yourself for buying it at full price without knowing what you were getting into.
---
I think it is worth the money I spent on it. course I waiting till black friday with discounts to buy my copy. And when I got my wife a copy a couple days ago It was cheap because of all of the complaining about the game. So we both got a great game we have been enjoying for cheap. 
---
They are not "good" per se, so much as they hit everything in a group with each shot, so if everyone has a tesla and goes to town, everyone hits every target for credit/xp/loot and they all die fairly quick because of all the teslas. 
---
People duping won't cause me to crash to desktop though. That's entirely on Bethesda.
---
How does one buy this cook book
---
i dont use the ultracite armour because its expensive to fix, and overall has lower stats than XO-1.
---
but...XO-1 requies sooo many springs for the legs its insane. I may switch to T60...i hear its much cheaper to repair.
---
Also, ive seen all flavors of PA, and none stand out as epic.
---
I picked up a low level two shot black powder pistol and with my pistol build it lists 300 damage on the screen.  It's a one hit wonder on some things lol.
---
Tamed pet respawn upon reloging. 
---
Think I have one if ya can wait till a little bit after 8pm est don't need 20k either lol
---
* Fix the server stability. My understanding of the most popular duping processes means this will also fix the duping issue.
---
* Fix the grefing. Yes, this is a PvP game, but blowing up unattended CAMPS and killing low-level or passive players is not PvP. There was a thread yesterday about limiting the Wanted players access to PvE items like other CAMPS and traders that was making a lot of sense.
---
* Roll-out a new season with the upcoming expansions. Have the time jump forward 10 years, give everyone a set stash of caps &amp; weapons and a pre-positioned camp. let them keep all of their atom shop items but strip out everything else. This would also make a great time to raise the various level caps to allow the returning players more room for growth once they have exhausted the endgame content.
---
Not necessarily, I've marked those as "not interested" but, still get "fo76 sux" videos to show up 🤷‍♀️
---
First time I found it I got up to the top after figuring out there were elevators and some boards to traverese (Came from watogo direction).
---
Then when I felt I was done I went to the highest point and jumped down in my Power Armor all "superhero landing".
---
Landed right next to a player which I knew was there somewhere on the map but couldn't render for some reason from the top.
---
Sure scared him as he went like "AHHH WHAT THE HELL!!" in his mic \^\_\^
---
But yea would be cool to see it work or at least see a train cart fly out from the top down to the ground :)
---
Hmm I get ya, well I’ll be testing it sometime in the future then. Truth be told I don’t participate in nuke events, I’m a casual player ^ ^ but I may be willing to try it 
---
Where do you go to farm now?
---
Its just tedious to farm lead and other frequently used mats. I hate having to farm ammo every few hours. Hopping server makes it much smoother. 
---
Sweet, message Quiche HD on Xbox if you find that you do have one, and I’ll top off your caps just tell me what you need 
---
Because apparently you have the ability to concert condition bars into readable numbers?
---
That’s likely not a cheat. Sometimes you get a glitch where you don’t see people in their power armor. Same thing happened with my friend, T-Posing with jets coming out of his feet when he said he was in Power Armor.
---
It would be great if you Bethesda could put in right on all the vendors counters, something that is basically a "Take a penny, leave a penny" container.
---
Just like an old pirate movie.  I dig it.
---
Oh man, that's beastly. Imagine if you had two of those to hotkey. 
---
Phenomenal work good sir ! 
---
Kk will do talk soon.
---
It's not a global maintenance, just get back to the main menu and click play. It will direct you to a server that's available.
---
neat photos - enjoyed
---
username - O M G perfection.  LOL :)

I can but I’ll warn you now, it isn’t optimized. I can theory up a version of how I would optimize it, if I have time.

---
Some things that need explanation: I have Better Criticals and the chem perks because I make and use a lot of Overdrive, which gives you a 25% chance to crit. This somewhat makes up for not having a vats build. Second, all the charisma perks are because I play as a team medic to some friends with squishy builds.
---
I’ll post an optimized build once I come up with it in a few minutes.
---
I need it to rain battered clip boards on me, glorious, glorious springs!
---
Scrapping hardened mass will give it too you as well. Farm white springs during a nuke event. 
---
These are great!
---
It gives me an idea, but I'll need to Tame a DeathClaw first :-) 
---
cool...a new service. good on ya mate.
---
is this free?
---
also, I just scrapped a 51b leg..do'h

Find group, farm scorchbeast queen for while and you will be throwing that shit away.

I liked being more creative than that
---
except for the fact that you can get smoked by fall damage
---
Can't they shoot there way out?
---
It is if you know where to sell it. 
---
That happened to me and I accidentally smashed take all, but they're all quest items and stuck in my inventory its great
---
I love Imgur because Imgur :)
---
However if you post anything fallout 76 related they downvote it immediately.  They even find the ones you dont tag.  I dont know how but its comical how much they hate photos from FO76.  So I use it...but if that would hurt your feelings dont bother posting those there.
---
Damn I didn’t know about that this sucks 
---
Yeah and don't get dependent on weight reduction perks. Or you're gonna be overencumbered most of the time if you want to do damage or pvp.
---
Hello,
---
Still holding him down? 
---
I once got nothing from the fight. The Queen's body just disappeared.
---
Yuppers
---
Quick off topic question, is the Mg42 a heavy weapon or an automatic rifle in regards to fallouts category system?
---
That was exactly what inspired me to try that. My character is sort of a piratey bounty hunter type guy. I also use the broadsider and colonial sword.
---
It's just a shame that you can't feasibly do that trick with more than 2.
---
Mass Effect 2 did this so well, 8-9 years ago. You make a face you want, and the game just gives you a long alphanumeric string and a button to copy it to clipboard. You can reuse it, or share it with other players. Just pasting the string into the character creator re-creates that exact same face. 
---
He approached me in a nuke zone fighting 3 scorch beasts this weekend.  LOL.  He has way better damage protection than any player! :)
---
Ultracite is basically fossilised Scorchbeasts, which is why they are so effective against the scorched.
---
Yes they can, though out of a few dozen people, only one did!
---
I'd be the epitome of pistol packin' mama in my nukagirl rocket suit lol.
---
Fix the exploit and leave them be? 5 star legenderies seem like a thing in the future so their shit will lose value then.
---
Yeah, floating meat piles.
---
Nice try though!
---
There is a crapload in glassed cavern.  Really helps that it glows like the sun and all you have to fight through are some scorched and a grounded scorchbeast.
---
The golden rule of those games are never beat them... heck dont even do the story quests if you can.
---
 thats the quickest way to ruin them. 
---
Better yet, waste 500 rounds of ammo and get DC'd when the SBQ is at 3% HP. Submitted a ticket to the useless Bethes-shit customer service and they just say "they do not have the tools to help me". Fucking joke.
---
im fine with this as long as i can get my ultracite explosive vent plan that i get everytime (currently have 6 in my inventory) all jokes aside they need to dial back the frequency of this
---
Saw it, continued sneaking away with wings going whooomp whooomp over my head.
---
Calling /u/LeeroyJenkins
---
I hope I encounter you at some point even if I get caught in a fucked up trap hahaha 
---
If someone else kills I don’t get loot right so I don’t understand 
---
I’ve watched all the murder church vids and the Oven is even better. I hope you get to go on Conan for being such a badass. 
---
Best place is glassed cavern.  Make sure to bring excavator armor to double all your mining points.  Plus some of the dead SB have wing and bone pieces still on a gem sometimes.
---
Were you in a group? If your teammate shoots someone they can shoot you.
---
Do you mean the forest operative underarmor?
---
Lol Valid... Friend who's run at least 30-40 SBQ's got his best drop last night was a Mutation Serum. RNG rolls are just terrible for us. Some people have awesome luck while others struggle to get by. 
---
If Bethesda had unique finger print codes being able to track the original user/quest ect.. then appropriate actions like account wide deletion or permanent ban.
---
This system has been in place in wow to stop gold farmer's only problem is the backlash against them.
---
On that note, can we make all events have a guaranteed legendary spawn at the end (like AWOL, Uranium fever, horde vents when they work and the sons event)? 
---
You know, make them atleast worth the effort. Getting 6 40mm grenades and a normal leather right arm for spending 10 min waiting for a robot to talk... no thanks 
---
No he means what he said I've seen them
---
&gt;  tormentor perk
---
Isnt that rifles only perk though? Enforcer is the Shotgun equivalent and he's already running that. 
---
If someone else kills I still don’t get loot right so no I don’t understand still
---
There's a road to necessitate a map?
---
I just did that on my unarmed build, threw 2 damage resist drugs (med-x and psychosomething) and was able to easily facetank the grounded queen plus adds with the occasional stimpack here and there.
---
Still lacking scaly skin, probably helps a lot too.
---
Hate putting that ugly hazmat on though. Someone on here got around 1000 rad resist without hazmat and was still taking 9 rads/s.
---
Something else is going on with that suit, it's not just 1000 resist.
---
Duping is probably the reason your crashing other than that it would just be your internet 
---
All of us have that hair cut! Only difference is that yours is green
---
Seemingly unless it's Fertile Soil.  I swear...
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
I’ll accept donations, trades, or services. Or straight up payment. 
---
Most of the costs come from the time I have to spend finding stuff. 
---
It must really suck to go through life being emotionally controlled by other people's opinions.
---
Just drop out the server. You keep the stuff you had, and they'll be gone...
---
Uzbekistan?
---
Jokes aside, x to doubt. I have garbage internet and havent had any rubberbanding at all, my partner currently working in an absolute shithole in Asia with internet as reliable as a strung out crackhead has had absolutely no rubberbanding either, friends, none either.
---
Lag, weve all had, rubberbanding, hell naw.
---
Nope got that one too, it’s name is ‚forest camo jumpsuit‘ and it’s really rare like the BOS jumpsuit or the VTU jumpsuit. Basically it’s the mechanics jumpsuits mesh but with a camouflage texture not the standard green one.
---
"Maybe one head voted trump and the other voted hillary and now they bicker constantly but it only adds to the pathos of their zany adventures." -- network exec
---
What build are you using? Struggling fixing a good one to plague walk more casually
---
Um.... because those Scorched loving bastards contribute to breaking the game.
---
It’s not like they were done duping for good. 
---
Probably just this weeks bag. Toss that shit in a Fissure after to take what you want and make those lazy motherfuckers restart.
---
It's different, the content is not thrown in your face. You have quests yes, but you also have terminals, notes, and holotapes to dig for if you choose.
---
If you played fallout 3 or Vegas, it's pretty equal to going through a old vault. Going in, you know something always bad happens, an most of the story is told by long dead or gone folks.
---
I'm on my second play through now, level 39 with my main at 110 and 480 hours total (quarter of it is afk, doing stuff around the house).
---
First play through was figuring stuff out, story, game, dealing with glaring bugs, and hanging out with my bro. Second is fully digging into side stories and figuring out puzzles and such.
---
Here's a few: west of Vault 76 there is Black Mountain Ordnance Works. There are eight Domes/silos I think. As far as I know, two are known so far.
---
In flatwoods, there's a kid you find dead named Colonel. His full name is Colonel Ward, no terminal/note will mention it. You can find a couple notes at the funeral building, a bio on the responder's terminal, and two or three holotapes. His dad committed suicide, his mother was killed by wolves or was kidnapped. They mention a grand daughter of Jeremiah went missing. So it's possible a brother or sister of Colonel exists. At minimum Colonel possibly has a niece some where.
---
Colonel, was raised in the back of the church an made it his life goal to help kids survive, the reason was to be not like his dad.
---
A lot of this is possible to completely miss. Especially if you are not paying to much attention and just following quests/chatting with buddies.
---
It seems I don't know the economy in the games. I always sell weapons at fixed price, lv50 at 500caps, lv40 at 400caps, no matter the legendary effects.
---
I had inventory crashes (lost everything I'd just bought at a vendor) followed by the dreaded "sync data" progress bar on relaunch. Was 99% sure I was gonna wake up in the vault. 
---
I think the game might have gotten a lot of new players at Christmas, the crashing has gotten a lot worse since then.
---
Keep getting kicked from nuked zones, game sound hangs, freezes and either dumps me to desktop or ive to log off windows to close the game.
---
It’s gotten better in terms of bugs and such. The lack of attention to duper’s has completely wrecked the market though. Content is exactly the same, but there is a supposed update this month to bring more content 
---
I like when she just flies away and never return at low health.
---
It's really hard to answer this without knowing when the new vaults will get added to the game. We need a better content roadmap. 
---
I'd be for that, though for a multi player TSE really needs to be reowkred.. It would be easier to implement that quite a few other things without being intrusive as well. 
---
I know Archage always had a thing called "fresh start" servers every time new content came out. People would ditch character with 1000's of real life dollars and hours spent on them in the dust, to do it all over again {Mainly hoping for a even playing field due to balance issues}. 
---
It seems similar to your idea and worked out well enough to spike activity to the servers with people re rolling their characters again. 
---
You get my upvote for this idea!
---
And the VTU Jumpsuit is the same mesh but in a Vault-Tec style and the BOS jumpsuit is grey/blue with the BOS logo on it
---
Yeah, I enjoy it. The fundamental design issues haven’t changed, and it still has bugs and it crashes way too often, but I like it a lot. I’m a solo explorer guy with a build like yours, and I find it a lot of fun. 150 hours so far. 
---
TIL: WV is Skyrim.
---
I guess I've just been unlucky then. Thanks.
---
Don't think so. I did over 50 maps today and got no legendaries 
---
Frames are easy to find - It is set that are hard to find (especially for different levels.
---
Get 4 frames -Deploy (Don't drop) and add the pieces to them and wait 60 seconds and they will auto return (overrides the level restriction for entering). Then dump the 10lb frame into stash until you need it. You will have to deploy them all to find a specific set again but it saves a lot of weight. Also store a full fusion core in each.
---
They should make it to when you start hitting 4-5k in carry weight you become completely immobile (not even turn around) and a flag goes up on the map - you know... To let people know you need some help carrying things (or alternatively - the people who are tired of dupers could blam them in the back of head).  Then there would be more corpses like this. XD
---
What more content? A dozen contract missions that were variations of the same thing? Steal this car, kill these people, collect this item. Public events in FO76 offer the same variation for grind and rewards. Different cars you can customize well in FO 76 you can build a base and customize your camp.
---
thank you for the detailed information
---
Do you happen to play through Steam? If so I did when I first started playing to use the steam controller. I eventually sucked it up and learned to play with KB/M and launched it without the Steam overlay. I have crashed maybe once in the last month.
---
There are so many combinations of armor, weapons, and legendary modifiers that it's already rare to get anything usable. That's not the problem. The problem is that not only is it rare to get anything you would use, but first you need to break the long odds of getting anything above 1 star. By making it so 3 stars drop 3 stars, you don't have the bullshit of "1 star tire iron" for your effort. It's probably a 3 star tire iron, because the game seems to weigh loot drops in a silly manner just like 4 did ("Here, have ANOTHER sub-par melee weapon"), but at least you know whatever you get will be three star, and you might just get something usable, if not by you, than someone else.
---
All this also ignores that if you go anywhere but whitesprings or watoga, the odds of you even finding a legendary creature is ludicrously low.
---
There is something seriously wrong with a system where I drop most of my "legendary" loot on the ground because it's not worth vendoring for others to see, assuming the vendor has the caps for it.
---
They did invest a lot of time into the Online Mode. It's connectivity is so much better now. And you were able to see the improvements quite fast, as soon as they realized people love online GTA. 
---
Meanwhile, Fallout 76 is still crashing when I try to shut it down.
---
No, 1.5M in a public lobby with less than 15 people in it. I never was bothered too much by other players, and when I were, I killed them.  Yes, sometimes I got my ass whooped, but that's part of the game. It's a game about criminals fucking up each other, not a trading simulation. It would be so boring without a little bit of pressure during these missions.
---
I do agree tho that some things don't make sense. When I buy an amphibical vehicle, I should be able to use that. And why can't I bring a tank into the pacific heist? I totally agree that the limitations there are stupid as fuck and I'd love to see them change. 
---
And I'm a huge fan of survival games, it's probably my favorite genre. But the survival aspect in Fallout 76 is laughable. You have to manage food, water and rads, that's it. Throw in a disease cure every now and then which is supereasy to craft. Honestly, they could've just left food and water out and nobody would have said a damn thing. 
---
fingers crossed vault 96 is a experimental desk fan and cat bowl factory 
---
did you get the inspiration from this from another server? my buddy made almost this exact build a couple months ago.
---
It's impossible to trace both duped items and their accounts, tho the account may be easier than finding the items they made if the items were given to others
---
That barrier is same effective as condom made out of net.
---
Regular is best for tagging I think. If you're going for doing real damage, shotgun for sure
---
Err.. Are you visually impaired?
---
Just a weather balloon, please move on, nothing to see here.
---
I haven't had that happen with the queen but i have had that happen 2-3 times elsewhere with scorch beasts in general.  we chased one for 20 minutes one time because oh heck no all those bullets weren't for nothing!  dropped nothing interesting but my lord we were not letting go.  LOL.
---
annoyances are super annoying.  but i play with a really fun group of people and thats what truly keeps me coming back to it!  
---
General Kenobi.
---
Ok thanks
---
This is not exactly valid, it is only true for melee builds.
---
meh, some of the game can be tough for people to get through (steep learning curve)  
---
I gave my buddy a set of deep pocketed trapper armour yesterday.  He said it made him want to keep playing.  
---
He's a bit of a hoarder, so the active inventory management has been tough.  
---
Giving the noobs the tools they need to move along that learning curve is a good way to make sure you have people to play with later in the game.
---
What is there so good About doing maps? 
---
“iT’s NoT gUnNA bE LiKe RuSt!”
---
What did you usually get?
---
Are you in a rush?
---
God you must lead a miserable life if thats on your daily to-do list 😅
---
Hey me too!  Started warframe a few months ago while waiting for F76 and it's a great example of a game that is very grindy but not oppressive about it.  And in the rare occasions there is a server hiccup or network issue it saves all my stuff and even lets me rejoin people...
---
This is a great idea for everyone except those that choose to play solo. How do you justify the best  items only dropping for teams?
---
Seriously I know we all Want to add our own constructive criticisms and ideas, can we please take a moment to actually think about them before running and posting?
---
That I wouldn’t be able to tell ya. Some people said, just like you, that it was literally a connecter node with shorter range. At one point I thought it was where you transmit power by using two of them in close vicinity, but I don’t think that’s right either.
---
This only works for gear, but for other loot it still wouldn't be able to check (e.g. serums).
---
The whole dupe is based off the system reverting your player to the last save which happens to be long enough that you are able to drop your loot then crash. If the save time was faster (i.e. better server performance) then it wouldn't be possible anymore. Realistically though this means that the server save timer needs to be faster than it takes to load a workbench.. so pretty quick.
---
I think that coupled with unique item ID's would be sufficient. It doesn't need to even be "unique", it could just be coded XXX (weapon type) YYY (legendary effect) ZZZZZZZZZ (random ID). Then if you pick up an item with a matching ID it just merges the two. There's a one in a billion chance you will delete a second item of the exact same type IF you were able to find an exact copy anyways.
---
Don't mod your armour, it'll probably get scrapped for cloth....
---
You had that idea too? I'm glad you have fo76 to act on these ideas bud. 
---
Yeah, they would be worth at least 25k caps or more, really would have been interesting to see the economy without those duped items. I imagine they would be really fucking rare.
---
I've never seen anything like it but people have probably tried something similar. The inspiration came from the Murder Church I did and wanting to focus more on using the flamers.
---
Well, you get lots of plans and weapons to scrap.
---
They're not really worth the time it takes imo
---
I did this once, set up a whitesprings farm camp, because I am leveling without doing quests and was seeing if it gave good XP. The thing is, I didn't want to leave the area, not just because of the loot, but because of the whole "it'll kill stuff on people" bit. I ended up pushing my property back a bit, out of trigger range but still within draw distance for me, so I could snipe the ghouls as they spawned, lure a few down for the turret aid.
---
Gave that up too, because ti was boring, but it is possible to do a farm without being such a dickbag that even when you're elsewhere you're pissing someone off by kill stealing.
---
I don't get people who say their stashbox is overflowing because they have 800 Gears that they can't let go of.
---
I'd say it's still quite rare to have shared stash across account.  
---
As for bots i think they kinda painted themselves in a corner due to the theme being 60's style scifi.  The game has a bunch of nicely voiced bots,  they just aren't common.
---
No thanks. I don't do surveys.
---
Just watch out for those brown spots on the first floor overhead 
---
Ya. I didn't realize the full effect of enforcer. Someone a comment down already correct me 
---
That’s awesome. I also like the detail that they kept the name recognition thing from FO4, and the Mr. Handys greet you by name after character creation if they “recognize” your name.
---
Mostly plans, weapons, ammo and chems 
---
Bulking steel does not save much weight, if any.
---
This wasn't a nazi reference, people just started making there own inferences
---
YOU ARE THE WINNER OF THE GREAT APPLACHIA SWEEPSTAKES (determined to distribute your prize while being mauled by mole rats)
---
Ah oke, was really Wondering why people buy all these maps.. thanks for the info!
---
I tried that messenger quest only once. The idiot wandered from Sutton to Flatwoods then stopped at the pool at the motel. Apparently, it couldn't figure out how to navigate around a large rectangular pool. He just stood there for about five minutes then decided "to hell with this" and self-destructed.
---
T-60 is great for repairs! No springs, no gears
---
lol....she was over the junk extractor/fusion generator.  should have put her over the indoor garden. :)
---
I’m gnot a gnoblin 
---
Yeah, i got a lv 40 exterminators shotgun yesterday ffs
---
I named her Sir Reginald Von Bartlesby and she is the prettiest
---
Fixing the exploit is a given, lol.
---
At this point, while the game has 5 stars being the max theres no real content for them. Hell 2 star weapons can make the game beyond broke. 1 TSE weapon and your good to go and kill everything mindlessly by shooting the ground, a wall, the ceiling  everything but the creature, lol. Though still killing it in 1 maybe 2 hits depending which part of the area you hit around them.
---
So lets fix the 2 -3 stars before touching 5 stars and talking about obsolescence, lol. 
---
You can already get 4 {Not many people realize this} with the up/downgrade you get from the fire breathers quest line and any 3 star weapon :D.
---
the server disconnect function itself can be a hard crash (within game), and is likely the immediate cause of your crash to desktop. However, if you had fewer hard server disconnects, you would almost definitely have fewer crashes to desktop. 
---
About 50% of my server disconnects end up crashing all the way to desktop. Some days I’ve had hourly crashes (or more), other times I’ve gone a few days without crashes. 
---
Have max luk on the character I regularly play and find shit, have 3 luk on my first main and have found all the good stuff 
---
Yeah... not really. We all know what duping is like. Intermitten spikes in lag before a large lag wave that boots us all off. Client disconnects are a totally different matter and can be handled during connection and server establishment with pinging to make sure we're connected to optimal server locations.   
---
The game also crashes when I use social to jump to a friend's server if I'm not doing it from main menu. That's not caused by dupers. That's just bad coding. 
---
The deathclaws attacks share the same sounds as the werewolves in Skyrim, most notably the hit sound for werewolf form. Once you hear it and realize it, you can never go back.
---
How do you even get pets? I have the perk to calm them, but even when they are calm the prompt to send them to my CAMP never appears. What am i doing wrong?
---
The game should have been $30 from the start just cause I bought it at full price doesn't make me wrong.
---
AMS HQ in Watoga - you can grab some clearing it out. A table at the top has 3 or 4 just sitting there. There are pieces scattered throughout in labs. 
---
The opponents are all robots - so circuits, steel, lead.
---
I agree with the making of item IDs. Server save time could be fixed a different way. Imagine that you cannot complete putting stuff into a box until the server saves that information. Even if it takes a few seconds. This way once you’ve put stuff into the box it is already saved. Crashing that game would make no difference. 
---
Wetsuit is shielded just like the rest of the underarmors
---
I hate how the perimeter stair snaps to a foundation but you can’t place a wall in front of it for like...a perimeter 
---
Use the enerogenol syringer..definitely wrong spelling but the one that started with an "E". But also....peoe not helping sucks.
---
If god wanted you up there I am sure he would have miracled your ass up there by now private Pyle!
---
This is boot camp.  Just think yourself lucky someone isn't firing over your head as you do it.
---
Another, just for fun:
---
*Gunnery Sgt. Hartman*: Where are you from, anyway?
---
*Pvt. Cowboy*: SIR, TEXAS, SIR!
---
*Gunnery Sgt. Hartman*: TEXAS? Holy dogshit! Only steers and queers come from texas!! And you don't much look like a steer to me so that kind of narrows it down. Do you suck dick?
---
*Pvt. Cowboy*: SIR, NO, SIR!
---
*Gunnery Sgt. Hartman*: I BET YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY WHO'D FUCK A MAN IN THE ASS AND NOT HAVE THE COMMON COURTESY TO GIVE HIM A REACH-AROUND.
---
Cant help you since I'm on PS4 - but as a note to other PS4 players that might see this.  I'm starting to drop extra plans and what-nots on the corpse outside of 76 in hopes it might help a new player out before they disappear
---
Also ultra light or deep pocketed.
---
True. But, something just feels unsporting about that. Like rage quitting. Maybe that's just me.
---
It would be really nice, but I'm not sure it's doable.
---
Take All - &gt; fixed
---
Its raining fertilizer, hallelujah
---
I agree with everything except - and I'm sure you know this but I'm just saying it for Op - that you drop it whenever Junk you're carrying when get killed.  Unless death comes infrequently for you, or you're at a point where potentially losing your Junk isn't a setback, it's not always the best idea to hoard it on your person.
---
Right now that would be the better thing to do. Though people are still purchasing them through websites for cash and this is the biggest issue no one worried about losing their hard earned shit realizes. 
---
It's also hard to tell if a weapon is duped. Which like you. All of my stuff I've found, I refused at this point to trade due to the uncertainty of their legitimacy.
---
Amazon. :)
---
It *feels* like top of the world was supposed to be a place like this.
---
I found that most of my better drops come from events that spawn legendaries. Awol armaments is my favorite. But I usually do a circle around the bog. Hit up watoga medical and watoga highschool, then robco, then the steakhouse, then west tek. And while I'm doing it I keep an eye out for events. Mostly awol armaments, guided meditation, and distant thunder. I do uranium fever as well but only bc it can drop shielded raider lining plans. 
---
As far as I’m concerned Bethesda doesn’t owe me anything I bought the game nobody forced me to buy/play it 
---
Thought the game was ok , finished it
---
 Based on what I’ve played I don’t want to buy their games going forward
---
I’m not gonna complain and rant I just won’t buy their products anymore 
---
I already gave up on walls, I'm not giving up on stairs too
---
Is it “Get Downvoted” Day? Hell’s going on down here
---
Talk to Emil Pagliarulo and his “KISS” approach to writing. Why write a brand new world when you could just recycle the same old concepts? 
---
Now please look right here...
---
Wow any of those games on ps4? Just curious 
---
You win
---
the seond ghostrider movie had one it was the best part https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0tbhinmnik
---
Stop collecting fusion cores? This is definitely not something I would complain about.
---
Nice try FBI
---
I don't have to, the quests are just one part of the game. More so, the quest line was a guide to take you to areas to explore. Or not, it was really up to you how to play the game. Quest, build, do nukes, or read.
---
BTW whoever included dailies with story quests is a idiot. It's like including the bounty quests/board in Skyrim with story.
---
That’s a good dad joke
---
Currently if you log out in your power armor, when you log back in, the charge is at 100. So maybe that has something to do with it? Not sure.
---
Idk but fully nodded marine chest packs in DR compared to the BOS combat armor.
---
Why is stupid stuff like this trending, I question this guy's mental capacity from this screenshot
---
Tesla Rifle + Ghoul Attack = Immediate Crash. Irritating as fuck. Really want to use that damn gun.
---
You shouldn't be able to put your base that close to whit spring anyways. Most places will give a message saying you're too close to important areas. 
---
Pretty much doing a queen run. The bones you get from the queen and all the scorchbeasts killed during the event add up. I get a good 40 ultracite every queen run. Either that or you can run through the glass cavern and pick up like 50 ores
---
Yummy yummy cooked flesh
---
Tato soup was the first recipe I tried. It does have a TON of onions in it, I'm an onion buff though so it was right up my alley. Thank you for the tips, those matcha cookies will probably be the next thing after I try the quantum syrup recipe. 
---
I basically just have her to have a pet. with all the duplicate plants and scrapping to get build budget back i never need fertilizer again!
---
she takes up so much camp budget though.  almost as much as two level 1 turrets.
---
my first time was a few days ago and me and my friend got like 6 levels 
---
I have an explosive ultracite pistol and i can't even use it half the time because it does barely any damage to higher level enemies :(
---
FUCK FUCK FUCK.  DOOR.  GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE DOOR.  FUUUUUUUCK!
---
This is borderline 'No true Scotman' logic.
---
I'm an honest player. I don't dup or buy dup items because I find my enjoyment by earning my own stuff, not because of some perceived morality or honesty with the issue. My motives/reasons are purely selfish.
---
I don't believe this is priority number one by any means. Also, Reddit is just one echo chamber of many. 
---
Does your floor ripple in the rain or is it higher up off the water?
---
Oh I didn't mean like in perk points LOL. Luck in general I guess. I know RNG rolls in game aren't affected by character luck points XD
---
Its only happened to me once, enjoyed every minute of it that I could.  Was nice not having to wear a HMS and it was a nice sunny day.
---
Good Doggy
---
So you can't find any such posts to link us to? 
---
Not telling.  Find it yourself :P 
---
As for tips, saw a pretty good post on that on the front page of this sub earlier I think. I'm on my phone so it's inconvenient for me to say too much anyway lol.  
---
A good point. I wasn't aware of this. I rarely do the event because I rarely see it on the map. I didn't know that it could be triggered. Very cool. 
---
But much weaker as opposed to the others. Definitely level 2 under armor behind the basic stuff. Enclave, brotherhood, and vaultec offer much more than marine.
---
My suggestion is that picking a build based off your play style is important before playing. Very early on you got to pick where you are putting your points into with your SPECIAL and what perk cards to choose. Weight management is very important too. If you are interested, I play as a sneak rifleman. This is a non combat armor build:

---
For a long time I refused out of fear of the inventory stealing glitch which turned out to be fake, now I just don’t do it, plus I’m a melee build anyways
---
Dammit, I wanted the show to be about wholesome family values! 
---
It’s okay though. I don’t mind who my moo moo voted for, I still love her for who she is
---
I do that with the melee when I'm alone. It's not to prevent people from tagging it's to minimize damage taken by not getting surrounded by charred ghouls. However when other people are around I use the auto rifle or try to let them get dmg first.
---
I like the idea
---
Alright I’ll try looking for it
---
I spent more caps there, then I'd care to admit.
---
I find that timers in 76 are either ridiculously long or short.  There is weirdly no in-between.
---
Yup. I saw the outline and built one expecting to be able to fill in wall pieces. No snap action at all, and the perimeter wall is *just* small enough that you *can't* use the concrete barriers to fill in the gaps. Well played, Bethesda.
---
Even if not, PA parts on a frame are weightless so if you want to stash PA parts it's almost always preferable to put them on a frame.
---
Youve got a scroll wheel dont you?
---
Too late now. 
---
That is something they should have considered back in early development. 
---
Also, if every item did have a unique identifying serial number, the strain it would cause on the servers would make the game even morr unstable and unplayable. 
---
Here i am just enjoying the shit out of the game since beta with my friends.  
---
Yes it has issues but the game play/fun makes up for bugs ive encountered.  Yes is it frustrating sometimes but nothing game breaking for me.   
---
The hate these game is getting is way over blown.  People just riding the hate to click bait views.  This is the world we live in now.  Drama for views.  Views = $$.   
---
CONGRATULATIONS!
---
You chould share play and have someone else do it for you if your internet is capable.
---
Yeah fallout 4 also had that type of stuff along with more quest now it just that stuff with less quest and quality quest. Reading lore isn't content like someone said destiny has tons of story if you go somewhere and read it.
---
There are like 4 of them at that civil war museum/graveyard way up north
---
Hey man, I feel you. I bought a used Toyota Camry because I don't think Toyota deserves my money. I just want to be able drive after using my other Toyota car I actually liked.
---
What would be some or your favorite driving destinations?
---
I received a different 1\* Gatling laser the last 3 times I did the SQB, but at least I received the latest issue of the Ultracite Armor Explosive Vent plan each time!
---
I have looted a grand total of one 3\* weapon since beta and it was off a random ghoul in non-nuked Whitesprings.  The only other 3\* item I have is a lever action rifle someone gave me out of kindness/pity.
---
[Have you met my friend, Ed?](https://i.imgur.com/H3X4Edb.jpg)
---
I don't see how anyone could bait anyone, unless you made stuff that can hurt other players without them damaging or picking locks, which would really still be on you.
---
Well vault tec from what I remember is crazy good and yes BoS is great personally run marine myself just for cosmetics sake fashion fallout :)
---
If their voice chat is set to "auto" then it defaults to team chat if they're on a team
---
well yeah if you're alone that's one thing. but when there's 10 people standing outside the door n 1 guy in power armor standing in the doorway, i should be allowed to shoot that guy
---
thanks :D
---
i admit im quite hoarder myself :C
---
Likewise, I did the Messenger quest once.
---
That was enough. 😋
---
Agreed! Killed her for the first time yesterday (thanks to the other players lvl 100+) and all I got was a 1 star vanguard chest. Pretty underwhelming. 
---
yo mee too whats your ingame name
---
Anything that is considered rare and/or useful has been duped a thousand times over already probably, so if you want something to wear that very few other people have your best is some kind of semi-rare outfit that hasn't been duped a billion times.
---
I really struggled with these also, for similar reasons (I was never good at video game reaction times, and I'm old now, so its worse).
---
Do you have any younger or quicker family members who could assist and get you past it?
---
Also it's not very effective when others are around. While you're stuck at the door only able to hit the first mob, everyone else is spraying in bullets and grenades destroying everything before the melee can tag anything and end up with no legendaries.
---
When I needed springs for PA crafting I just server hopped the bear cave at the golf course. He gives you 5-8 every time you kill him and he’s almost always in there. 
---
Chemistry station dilute them there for use thats what I do for stems and all. 
---
As long as you stick to the West side of the map, (No further East than Charleston), and not to far North right away, you shouldn't have any trouble. I'm over level 80, and those areas do not spawn higher level enemies, even when I'm the only one around.
---
The Quest lines are a bit convoluted, and try to send you off to areas you're not yet ready for, so simply turn those off, Explore, Build, Gather, Craft, Learn, &amp; Level, until you're ready to take on those higher level creatures, but if you don't mind dying &amp; losing all your junk now &amp; then, you can level up much faster by pushing the boundaries.
---
I didn’t even know that site existed I’ll check it out. Is the weight management harder or easier or about the same as FO4 survival? Because the weight in that game is pretty brutal
---
I play as a sneak rifleman. Best mods are ultra light so they don't hear you coming. Also if you can get a legendary effect like chameleon on it, you'll be able to fire off several suppressed head shots without even being noticed.
---
It doesn't take glass because you can't wrap glass around a pallet of materials. Imagine real life when you see a bundle of product on a single pallet, "bulked." Its held down with plastic ties or wrapped with a plastic wrap.
---
Lol yea, but the you have 50000000 keys you can't drop in your inventory.
---
That sucks, but its good when random people accept party invites in my opinion. But its only really ok if you work with them, or just use them for a free fast travel then give them something in return and leave the party
---
Your still ignoring the singleplayer like just because one has only has multiplayer the tons of content from the others singleplayer doesn't exist 
---
It was just an example.  The loot system from borderlands works and the more players you have on your team the quantity and quality of items go up because enemies are scaled to the number of players in game.  That's why I included that solo could still get 3* but at a lower rate than playing as a team.
---
I play on Xbox and my friend told me the other day people are buying duped items for real money which is absurd considering there’s people out there giving them away for free as well. 
---
Exactly.....right now brotherhood fatigues seem kinda rare and they match my bos combat armor....so that's all I got for now lol
---
I'll do that ASP Cheers!
---
Yes that gun is formidable don't let anyone tell you different it will take you places and is better then not having a ts gauss :)
---
Thanks for this assessment! I haven’t played many of the games mentioned, but I did check a lot of them out now, so appreciate this note. I’m not super interested in replay-ability due to limited gaming time, so that’s helpful. Still loving all these recs! 
---
It's even more brutal in FO76. Fallout 4 at least had it where you could constantly sell or put your stuff in your own workbench. 76 has it where you only have a few vendors to sell to who max out at 200 caps. Then instead of a workbench, you have a stash box where you can only hold 600 lbs. So to me, weight management is very important.
---
Plus ammo is easy and cheap for it
---
Definitely need to take more rad buffs with me next time!!!  Hell of a lot of fun though isn’t it??!!  Can’t wait to donit again!!!
---
Can confirm, there are other aliens out there.
---
I hate WhiteSprings I've never searched for those items there, probably time I gave it a go :)
---
Only missing the mole miners and some ghouls
---
Evil!  I love it.
---
It happened to me last night. Then I went into the Resort and the game bugged and gave me a black screen. I had to drop servers.
---
you just have to look at a poster or advertisement for it. There are a few scattered around, i believe the charleston fire dept has a poster for it. 
---
And this is one reason why cross platform whould be a bad idea, on PC you can hot key to 1-9, 0 and the - and + keys... so you can role play a Pirate who charges into battle with 12 pistols.
---
Please with lots of cats, I love roasted cat meat :))
---
i have twice had someone show up and kill me in 1-2 hits while on a workbench at a workshop i just won.  i have pacifist on and didnt even return a look let alone engage.  but i believe its the nature of workshops that it allows for PvP.    yeah im usually just there to claim it and get a first round of plans.  then i dont care if someone else has it.  id just give up the damn place if there was a way to "unclaim" it. 
---
I've gotten Rusty Knuckles from all 5 of my queen kills so far.
---
I might fuckin use it just because and spend a fight punching her with them.
---
I've got more Ultracite Vents than I do Single-Action Ivory Grips.
---
its stable enough to put up with, but take this with a grain of salt because i haven’t really experienced the bugs others do other than the occasional game crash
---
I like you
---
I would love to find a client for my software that has the patience of the Bethesdrones because then I could literally do nothing and they would thank me for making one blog post a week.
---
Quite the opposite of an actual apology, I'm wondering what other glitches are happening that you're talking about.
---
Like, specifically, what major glitches are you experiencing?
---
Clearly just swamp gas, quit spreading just crazy talk.
---
You have yet to state why this is causing you such a personal issue...
---
Messaged you
---
Also happens on ps4, I just spent the 1000 atoms on the friggin thing only to have it rotate out of place every time I leave my CAMP, just like the OP said. Complete bullshit for something that cost practically  10 bucks. Im just going back to the blue original workbench. 
---
I'd settle for a guaranteed 3\* as part of the quest reward instead of loot from the body. I've had a couple times where I've gotten no legendaries from the body.
---
There are players, a large numer at that, who dupers traded to, and the player had every reason to think it was legit.
---
You want to delete those too? People who used hard earned caps or earned weapons to just lose the think they traded them up for? Deleting items and banning the dupers, in reality, *the dupers still win*. They broke the game and got in and pretty much did what they did.
---
Deleting items is a GREAT way to piss off your community. And is a terrible suggestion.
---
While I’m sure you are correct, thought I’d point out a huge reason you’re probably disconnecting is people duping or joining server with like a million different items on them. On Xbox if I invite a guy to my server to trade and he duped previously I’ll get a game crash because it can’t load all his items and I’ll have to rejoin. Also if people are duping on a server you’re on I believe it will sometimes kick you as well.
---
I agree, sometimes the slap mode is irritating. Some guy last night had the turrets set up behind the clubhouse and I really wanted to murder him. I knew though I couldn't and could only destroy a few little turrets which he would rebuild and I'd be left with a massive bounty. I'd take the bounty if I could kill him.
---
Brotherhood has a sleek officer suit that's all black. If only xbox I'd be happy to set you up free of charge.
---
Well hello there ! I'm interested if you're still selling the plans. I can spare 400caps, or 300 and the plans for the bear rug+some grognak and tesla magazines \^\^
---
Or whitesprings where all the vendors are
---
I try to do this but people run away.... it’s like they don’t trust a Greaser giving away freebies 
---
Hmm? I didn't think of that, it does make sense, wrapping bails of mats in glass would be a bit difficult. Maybe just those items that could be bottled up and the rest in plastic.
---
Oh well, I'll just have to keep scavenging for polymers. 
---
Go buy one then lol
---
&gt; No, he's saying that he's angry because the game gets lazy, ill-informed and unhelpful shit.
---
It's a Bethesda game. Bethesda has one of the most dedicated fanbases in gaming, just look at the number of people mindlessly defending this awful game - like OP or you. They had all the chances in the world and blew them. Saying people are unjust to F76 is false. 
---
76 gets shit because it's a bad game, with idiotic design choices and gamebreaking bugs - it still crashes regularly for most people several months after release. That's not OK for an AAA title. And I won't even talk about the other controversies. They didn't make this game because of love, but to get on the live services train. It must hurt knowing Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about you.
---
Just because you or few other people think it's fun, doesn't mean it's a good game. If you're into mindless collecting and don't mind the crashes and bugs, I'm sure you can enjoy it. Especially with friends, as everything is fun with more people.
---
And come on. You know what I mean by "dead." The game performed significantly worse than Bethesda expected, and the player count is low. The only way to inject new players is going to be a transition into F2P. That, or adding modding support - and letting fans fix the game, like they've done so many times before.
---
Rumor has it is it's coming. 
---
That said I don't think Bethesda has ever done backpacks before. I think your post should be "Bethesda I miss mods, nudge.... nudge"
---
&gt;I stopped playing 76 when Red Dead came out
---
umm Red Dead Redemption 2 came out 3 weeks before Fallout 76..
---
If this system was implemented it would only be a very short time before people were posting about how the game punishes solo players. 
---
This is the exact point I was making in my first comment. Think about what your suggesting.  Better chance of better loot drops for players in teams.  
---
I under you prefer to play in a team, however the game dies not need to be custom tailored to fit your personal play style. 
---
That’s a great pic, looks like y’all have some fun adventures together!
---
I disagree and would say the delusion is so strong in this sub that rationality is out of reach until the servers are closed next year
---
LOL, what? If you attack someone's base, you are a dick. Raiders, by their very nature, are dicks.
---
I'm looking for it as well so I'll let you know if I find it.
---
For those curious it can be worn by corpses around Harper's Ferry.
---
I agree. The last 3 times I fought her, I got the same plans as always (ultracite explosive vents and one of the legs) and a WOODEN LEG, 1 star.  
---
3 times in a row, a wooden leg, from defeating the end game boss. I was a bit salty. Getting the same plans as a reward over and over is just rubbing salt in the wounds. 
---
I use basic 2 shot weapons more than I use explosives.  Explosives are a lot of overkill for most things.  I can one shot just about everything with a simple 2 shot lever, so I'm sure a 2 shot gauss would do significantly better than that. 
---
Ammo is kinda heavy for the gauss though, but it's a great weapon, but it is really cheap to make.
---
Fix dupes then delete any stack of more then 1000 of anything, any stack of 5 or more bobble heads, maps and searems, make explosive weps not get the extra damage from explosive perk.    Done
---
Yes this might hit some non dupes, but would be worth it.  
---
I'm always down for a queen fight. PM me and i'll send you my username.
---
When I came across this for the quest I figured it was just a bug and paid no mind and grabbed the key. Then I could not figure out why it wasn’t completing the checkpoint for collecting the 5 clues or whatever. I wandered around that little shack practically pixel hunting for what felt like an eternity until I realized that I had to scroll through ALL of those keys to find the one with the quest marker next to it and take it before it would register that I picked the key up. I love this game but sometimes it confuses the hell out of me.
---
It's just how you view the system as either punishing solo or incentivizing team play.
---
Not yet. Give it another month. Hopefully. Bethesda needs to get off their ass and fix more bugs.
---
Todd..
---
&gt;Where do you play Fallout 76? *
---
&gt;Less than 20’’ - 40’’
---
&gt;41’’ - 60’’
---
&gt;61’’ +
---
Say what now? I play Fallout 76 at home. 
---
I'm a gnome
---
And when are you going to rearrange the furniture in the living room like you promised?
---
i agree becauce then i would be able to have a use for my legendary armour becauce my other charector would only use body armour
---
Wow, 4-6 months.  Some of the sweatshop workers making them probably haven't even been born yet.
---
This. Even just two copies of a weapon can easily indicate if someone has been duping.
---
In the Bethesda launcher, there's a little icon to expand the list of games in your library, looks like &gt;&gt;. Have you clicked that? Mine are there. 
---
it doesn't let you pick up keys that don't "belong" to you.
---
See, I heard that, and named my character the name as in FO4.  
---
They never said the name, even though Codsworth knew it.
---
I was thinking if they could add shield or some type of protection when u r in pvp like if you use any legendary the dmg be cut by half or the person who uses legendary gets penalties,  because outside of pvp who honestly cares what type of weapon u use for your game style
---
I tend to sell excess weapons at very reasonable prices as well, even give away most of the lower level ones I find, but at any given time, shortly after a Nuke or other high value event, I may have many Legendary weapons on me, but it's silly to think I would want to sell my best Rare, legendary weapons that I worked so hard to get for a few hundred caps.
---
I won't even set a price, cause o0ne wrong button press &amp; they could buy it for nothing.
---
I was confused on that too
---
tell that to the 20 or so of this exact key permanently in my inventory
---
I've done over 50, no legendaries.  But I have gotten some really rare power armor mod plans.
---
Some QoL changes make the game easier.
---
This is definitely not one of them.
---
Awesome reference! It's actually "are we the baddies?" I only know because my guild named our Imperial guild this after playing Republic "good" side for a year in SWTOR.
---
That's only when it dosen't spam it's head beam over and over
---
It doesn't, it can be built as long as you have the plan learned and materials. 
---
Vendors will now buy junk items even if you dont bulk them. 
---
 I believe there are only 2-3 items that actually reduce weight if you bulk it ... search google as I cant 100% remember which ones.
---
Also when repairing/crafting you will accidentally break down purchased MODS before it will 'unBulk' items.  So, I dont bulk anything anymore.
---
It's not. I just fail to see the logic behind people. Pretty simple. Is there a reason you're trying to sound like a prolific ass by talking down to me? As if it is a personal issue. 
---
Care to explain to me were logic went? Or why you're talking to me if you don't care about what it is i'm saying?
---
I've gotten everything mentioned here but not the coat. The winter coat and jeans is the most authentic.
---
............ What?
---
Lol what? It has 24 upvotes I'd hardly call it trending. Also my screenshots funny, u got some weird hangups over dudes in dresses or something?
---
This and the murder church made me laugh so hard this morning I did a real life spit take with my coffee. This ingenuity gives me hope for humanity to solve any problem.  So amazing clever, I genuinely applaud you.
---
I’ve got some info about where the jumpsuit can spawn (apparently it was beta content and now is DLC content): some guy said it can spawn in the treehouse in the mire, but there are 3 of them. And some other dude told me he had it dropped from an event in Morgantown but he wasn’t sure which one. That’s sadly all the info I found about it, maybe it can help you
---
Great idea
---
if you go around the villages at the top of the world, you can get a ton of good weapons as well as a full suit of raider power armor. Also the leader of the pack event has 3 garunteed legendaries if you do it fast enough
---
i’m trying to hit fissure site prime next but i lost so much junk and ammo in the silo and nuke site so i’ve been prepping since and still am
---
Cat house and Morgantown HS are on my plastic round robin scavenge, also Watoga HS, I just seem to use so much.
---
Having finally started to taking down ScorchBeasts, Enforcer 3\* gets the bastards to land and can me get right up in their faces, I'm using nearly 100 shells per Bat face. I'll have to learn about ammo workshop thingies.
---
IMO Quest shouldn't auto-enroll.  You should have to opt in for these daily/event quests.  So annoying.
---
I didn't understand what "Where I play..." with answer choices of inches meant so I left that one at the default answer but I answered all the other questions. :)
---
sounds like a bug because this doesn't happen to any other quest items as far as I know. 🤔
---
If you are on PC I can craft you a max level one, I only ask for the mats to make it.
---
What did you not understand?
---
&gt;I did get a legendary hand maid
---
Giggity. You'll be enjoying that for quite a while!
---
So, this doesn't flag you are wanted then?
---
I hope trying the  game changes your mind about Bethesda and this game in general,  the reviews and slander other reddit sites, YouTube and other media have said about it don't 100% show the true representation of it.
---
I'm not saying it's flawless, it does have major bugs, crashes etc.. but not blown out of proportion as they have said, the game is very enjoyable to play and explore.
---
Anyway enough of that Lol, most areas of the game are interesting to visit with plenty of background lore for you to uncover. My favourites are whitesprings, anywhere in ash heap, glassed cavern in cranberry bog and Harper's ferry in the mire.
---
Quests : I'd recommend the BoS , enclave and mistress of mystery ( there may be more but I havnt got round to them yet)
---
Not been there yet, I'm restricting myself so as not to burn out the map and keep new places for longer, I'll look into that, thanks.
---
Either they are bugged and never really worked or they have a purpose nobody uses. 
---
Ive only seen the opposite, even in this thread. People who somehow think the game is not total shit rag on others for calling out the problems and disregard their opinions as bli d hatred, which is ridiculous
---
This and ammosmith work wonders.
---
Hop the enclave vendor.  That's where you get it.  While you're there, check the X01 mods vendor for jet packs and calibrated shocks.  Bonus, you'll get all the other meds like Grape Mentats Recipe while you're hopping.
---
Are you posting in some obscure code?
---
Rumor has it those are coming.

---
So the main idea of this is to use the missile launcher and auto grenade launcher at their full potential. Once the bug is fixed and the auto grenade launcher is considered a heavy weapon again, it’ll be even better. So bear in mind that it is indeed broken atm.
---
Shotguns would be used for weaker enemies, and to break the legs of stronger ones so you can dump a grenade or missile on them to finish them. You can use a few shots to break one leg on each of an incoming melee enemy, then zombie kite them till they’re in a group and finish them with one nade. 
---
I highly recommend you learn how to build targeting computers for missile launchers. The plan is sold at Harper’s Ferry at higher levels. I can kill all basic enemies up to level 40ish with a single shot from a Bunker Buster, and basic enemies up to 70 in 1-2 hits. Stabilized takes care of their armor and Targeting computer takes care of hitting. Anything tougher than that outside of scorchbeasts I’ll use my shotgun to slow them, then lock on, then toss a MIRV/plasma grenade directly at them, then hip fire the locked-on missile. Timed to hit all at once. Boom. One note: scorchbeasts get stupid damage resistance while airborne. It is tempting and fun to lock onto them with missiles but don’t do it. It’s a waste of missiles and launcher durability. It’s dumb, but use a shotgun to break their wings and ground them, *then* missile and grenade them.
---
You can carry a Fat Man and reasonably use one with this build btw, but I almost never need it. 
---
I am not going for a front line PA tank with this...the main use of PA is to survive nuke zones and use Stabilized. But not using vats+Full Charge can make fusion cores last ridiculously long. Thanks to the core charging up by logging on while in PA, I have been using the same core for about 4 days now.
---
Yeah that spoked me out too when I first heard about it. 
---
I'm … I'm a commando D:, but to be fair regular weapons still work damn well for me :).
---
This is what I was wondering.
---
they aren't 'sweet' despite the amount of sugar in them, but they seem like they'd go well with a cup of tea or something similar
---
It's just sheer fucking stupidity on Bethesdas part that mods are treated as scrappable junk
---
I believe it caps at 100% for example I'm pretty sure if you have maxed out incisor and a weapon that gives 50% armor pen you're wasting that extra 25% 
---
Acid should definitely use glass...haha
---
You mention only fallout 4 and say, "that stuff." about reading. Yeah, alright I'm done.
---
Killed her for the first time two nights ago. No loot dropped for me. Yes, I tried looking in the transfer menu. Her corpse then gloriously disappeared in what seemed like record time compared to any other monster I've seen. My buddy that was with me said her corpse just dropped through the world for him and was unlootable. 
---
what's the point of a stash then ?
---
Fort Defiance I have been threre didn't think of it as a plastic source, I'll go look again, must have overlooked the plastic stuff. Cheers!
---
Wasn’t there had to get in touch with support who said they would add them to the library. Was weird mine didn’t have them though because I did get mad at support a month ago. 
---
It's not obscure exactly, this is the established format for the trading subreddits which OP avoided for reasons unknown.
---
From what I tested every hour-ish it starts. 
---
I wonder if you have FO76 on console, will those games be available via the launcher?
---
Don't edit after I replied, thats rude :|.
---
I think stuff like the spiked boards would flag pvp is someone walked over one, then they could just blow up your whole camp or kill you without being wanted for being a PK.
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
I dont understand what is the point if other people are stronger then you...... what are you doing with this power.... running around and showing it off .... but for what ?
---
Hmmm I see your point, but depends on location and weapon whether this will occur at White Springs you can kill more enemies faster than most TSE weapons. The TSE Combat Shotgun is the only TSE that I know can do that.
---
Damn too bad I’m really looking fr that two shot
---
Ahh. Then he also posted to the wrong sub.
---
You could throw some radiation traps in there too so that it’s harder for higher level players and even low levels to heal using stimpaks. 
---
I'm old and struggled with the marksman one a lot because all I had was a revolver and the reload time was a killer.  Had to leave and find a 10mm.  The agility/obstacle one didn't seem as bad to me because really it's the waypoint buttons that matter, not the obstacles.  As I recall there were a bunch of ways to just get around or skip past the obstacles and just hit the buttons at the end.   It's not like you need to jump in each tire etc.
---
Good advice and thanks for the heads up about the vendor change.
---
I think I have a T-shirt from that event - they were trying to get everyone to put clothes on!
---
yea i think its a known spot, its the same one I was looking at. However in those pics you'll notice his camp doesnt actually go into the waterfall. So I wonder if that was just by choice or if it doesn't let you do it.
---
Yeah, I'd love some way to transfer items between accounts.  My friends aren't on often, and I feel like a tool asking them to "sit still" long enough for me to do several jumps with my alts.
---
Not guaranteed. Hence the reason I've had 3 tames.
---
Honestly, it'd be nice to have the level of gear drop based on damage. I don't mean top DPS gets the best gear... But I'm saying the lvl 25 hiding in the trailer that took 3 shots at the queen doesn't deserve the same gear as me when I'm face to face with her melee for half the fight......
---
And people wonder why I walk around with 2-3000 units of steel haha.
---
Gauss rifle is the best damage rifle for sniping however it weighs a ton and so does its ammo
---
On my list for next card :)
---
Rarely worth the ammo it takes to kill them... 
---
It may change my mind about the game, but not Bethesda. Bethesda’s actions extend beyond just the technical problems of this game, they’re on my shit list now until they prove otherwise. If Starfield comes out and is an incredible game then maybe they’ll come off the shit list
---
Can I go wherever I want or are there like leveled areas where I clearly shouldn’t go there until higher levels?
---
Its impossible to tell who duped what as the game doesn't save ID's attached to player names. Also, going back and retro purging all two shot explosive gear could involve a risky server wipe and affect all legitimate players. Please keep in mind as well that these weapons are still legitimate weapons, meaning the stats are not exploited. You can still find them by playing the game naturally by grinding whitespring nuke zones or trade caps or other weapons for a good one if your that bent out of shape about it. You can always express in your trade market message that you want legitimate un-hack acquired trades only. I actually did this myself trading a explosive revolver for a explosive handmade and bought a explosive .50 cal from caps from someone as well. I also have found an explosive assault rifle myself and a two shot combat shotgun (and I actually prefer to use my two shot combat shotgun over explosive weapons for the below reasons).   
---
Remember, explosive weapons have a huge splash back that will kill your character if an enemy gets too close. Meaning that explosive weapons are freakin terrible for large groups of enemies. Two shot weapons with other affixes are king for aoe damaging melee enemies safely for this reason. So make sure you hang on to two shot weapons as well and don't trash them just because they don't have an explosive affix.  Explosive weapons are only good for ranged fights. If you really want to piss off a pvp player that is only using two shot explosive weapons literally run up to him, he will blow his self up trying to kill you, then run back and steal all of his junk then leave the server. That is a great retribution against people that you suspect hacked, as long as you can get in melee range soon enough before he kills you (best done after you respawn for revenge so you can sneak up behind him with cloaking gear or something so when he turns around he gets startled and blows his self up by accident).
---
Or the Karma system from Ultima Online - Red Name run away, Blue Name stay and play
---
I hope it will come soon. We have now the second week in the new year and no update at all (despite the hotfix of the nukes). This behavior worries me considering how much stuff is broken and how many systems of the game needs improvement or a complete overhaul.
---
You make one hell of a compelling case.
---
Nothing wrong with that, my back up is a 10mm smg ^ ^
---
It’s max lvl. I think the legendary effects are not displayed in the specs but I could be wrong
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abuz5s/scrappers_compendium_a_guide_to_resource_locations/ a mini guide I made might help since you're new to whitesprings
---
With so many empty jars and bottles around it seems really silly not to use them for some kind of storage.
---
I just use carnivore and kill/eat critters as I go. Saves storing perishable food and avoids the spoiling issues.
---
" When you encounter another player which are you more likely to do? "
---
needs a 3rd option and maybe even a 4th.
---
" Where do you play Fallout 76? \* "
---
what does that even mean? the answers dont add up.
---
" Which audio system do you use "
---
that needs an "other" option if you dont want 3 million different things.
---
" For which reason do you usually collect rare and legendary items. \* "
---
also needs an "other" option
---
Well why are you putting spiked boards in there! Geezus.
---
But yeah the issues you mention are things that should be fixed rather than have players be able to damage other players without repercussion. Like being able to level a wanted player's base is dumb. 
---
Ok, cool - I'll start saving the ammo/crafting it.
---
Now I just need some non-legendaries to scrap for the extra mods. (Any PC players have any I could have?)
---
Does it really matter how they choose to play compared to how you choose to play?
---
If you have multiples of a map i think it could be, just for the chems and plans. Going around hunting dig spots for a single map is a huge time sink though, even with a guide. 
---
If they gave like a 25% chance of finding legendary's, id actually get a little excited about finding maps. 
---
If software is causing a bluescreen there is something else going REALLY wrong with your system. Typically, software by itself doesnt outright cause a bluescreen, unless it is a serious issue.
---
 I generally do a vendor loop every day I play, in which I visit the Enclave bunker, the walk from Whitesprings station to the back entrance of the bunker is longer than getting to the command wing. If you take the back entrance its a 200 ft ish run and 4 turns.
---
At lower levels the daily vendor loop isnt as nessecary, but once 50+ I either have to daily get my 1400 caps or drop stuff to stay under the weight limit. My loop takes less than 20 minutes to complete.
---
Two Shot Gauss is definitely a decent weapon.  I have a Two Shot Explosive Guass as a backup gun on my melee character.  It allows me to kill things that I either can't reach, or don't want to spend the time getting there.  It also allows you to down vertibots (for nuke cards or the events like fly swatter).  Also if a single pesky scorch beast won't land so I can smack it, I can eventually bring it down with the gauss.  I don't invest any perks in rifle though, focused 100% on the melee build on that character.
---
You can craft 2mm Gauss ammo at your tinker bench.  It's heavy ammo and I try to never carry more than 300 rounds of it.
---
I know tick blood makes blood packs and medicine x you can snag from the enclave....eventually....
---
I love you, you are a true inspiration to the budding raider within me
---
&gt; pacifist mode all the time!
---
Remember PM only makes it where you won't hurt people or their buildings accidentally. It does not now nor has it ever made you immune to player damage. Nor should it. 
---
That's assuming each item was designed with a trackable identifier, which Bethesda doesn't seem like they're really on the ball for creating. Most likely,t he only unique ID that is used is the rowID in the DB when the object was added to the db at the time of duping. This feature could be added to future iterations, but to get it into the game now would require a bit of recoding. 
---
A few things that could work could be a column tracking date of item creation that would be populated by the system when it was originally generated by the server (ie: when RND generated it) along with a unique ID code that could only be created at object generation during a legendary fight (as opposed to a workbench or whatever is used to dupe). And then they can do a cross verification to make sure the object is legit.
---
But this kind of verification can either be quick or it can be thorough. Thorough designs will take a lot of processing time, as there are multiple ways that one can build in to track when the  object was created so that you can validate it's the real deal vs a dupe.   
---
I feel your pain, the first time we killed her, I got 23 rounds of 5mm. I was so bummed haha
---
Turns out, they made it even better for me.
---
As of the 2018-12-4 Patch, the M79 is considered both a shotgun and an explosive weapon. That means that the M79 can benefit from both shotgun damage perks and the explosives damage perk cards.
---
Eventually cause they ALWAYS sell the radaway recipe 98% of the time.
---
Inventory and stash have to be server side in a multiplayer game.
---
Wow not only are you rude but you can't keep to the point of the thread.
---
nice edit btw, lol.
---
You're one of those sheeple I mentioned it seems.
---
Ok skyrim has over 300 unique not quest board quest now taking out those type of quest from 76 now it closer to 50 it's even less  content now for the same price (base games) skrim and fallout 4 has all the stuff that fallout 76 you say has and the higher quality of quality quest. Same money less content how can you be ok with that?
---
Sorry to hear that. I remember back when LA Noire killed my PS3 and I needed to get a new one. :(
---
oh yea, this particular one is very strange.
---
most of the other "keys" i've found have been laying around on tables and whatnot, while this one is in a container.  which i think is the cause of the weirdo behaviour.
---
it's not the end of the world, b/c i don't think they have any weight, but it's still a bit silly.
---
I’m pretty sure I did too. Possibly 2.
---
Wait, she's not?
---
I've only done her twice and the first time I got a three star black powder rifle and the second a Three star combat. 
---
I don't think so.  I'm at about 200 treasure maps done right now, zero legendaries.
---
Treasure maps are good for plans and random guns you can scrap.  You get a LOT of tesla, gatling, handmade, etc guns that you don't normally see as enemy loot.  Scrap them and get mods.
---
I think it was the Dec. 4th patch that broke drop rates from legendaries.
---
Lol its great!
---
Me, nervously checking my item's CND bar: Oh wow, still full. Awesome!
---
\*five minutes later\*
---
Spoiled.
---
I was thinking of the double more for range, but putting more lead down field makes more sense, especially if you can mod it to favor range as well.
---
The salt is so palpable. 
---
Okay that makes sense. Thanks. 
---
I love Fallout in general, so the game is great IMO. I play as a stealth sniper, so I have a few tips:
---
* Don't wear power armor, it's too noisy and they hear you coming
---
* Leather armor all the way until you can start using combat armor. BOS and ultra light mod give you nice protection but mobs don't hear you coming. At least one piece with chameleon gives you that stealth boy effect if you are stationary in crouch position.
---
* Level up using hunter rifle modded with hardened, long range scope and suppressed uses 308 ammo. Combat rifle when available for mid to short range. Stay suppressed and hardened receiver, but you can go to a mid to short range scope. This gun fires faster but does less damage. These two guns should be all you need to carry. 
---
* Once you get high enough level you can start switching to lever action (long range) and handmade (mid to short range) rifles. You'll want to wait on these until you've built up enough mods for them.
---
* Here's my build which focuses on being sneak rifleman with great weight management perks.

Yeah, decent TV's are pretty cheap these days, so we have them at either end of the house, each with a ps4. She gets the bigger TV and newer ps4, of course.
---
And then you get invited to the American Girl Doll Store in New York City ... and get the custom doll that resembles your daughter/niece ... because she can't leave till Mommy/Auntie gets it for her!
---
I would love this.
---
I find it really interesting that some things seem just naturally easy to some in this game and while other things feel impossible. I don't game much (I'm on PC) but I had zero trouble with the obstacle course; did it first try just by using always run, but no sprinting. However, the target exercise took me 9 tries. I finally resorted to jumping into the target area and shooting them point blank, which seemed strange that the game let me do. I was level 8 and couldn't get past the legendary in the live fire exercise so I gave up (I'm level 24 now and still haven't gone back).
---
I also can't do mobs, even easy ones. I cannot escort that robot in Morgantown to save my life. I also cannot kill enough fireflies/frogs at the lighthouse event. There are some things that just will never be for me.
---
I'm on PS4. It's software 100%. I program. I hack. Been building PC's since the early 90s. The game is causing the bluescreening. It's bad coding. 
---
T60 is just steel, aluminum, and plastic. It's honestly so good I expect them to change it lol
---
True enough its a beast. It kinda balances out the over powered two-handed melee's in the game 
---
I get what you're saying though, plastic just makes sense realistically. I do wish there was more use for glass 
---
Seriously! There should be at least a couple of empty slots in the presets for player custom characters. 
---
Then a jackass like me comes along and pours Alcohol over them when they're down and asking for a revive.  
---
I'm a monster.
---
Good how fun paying the same for less stuff over time sooner or later you'll get to needing to pay money to start quest on top of the 60 price tag. 
---
Yes on a console that has a lot of other BS than a PC doing it.
---
Every time on PC I had a bluescreen while playing any game ever, the issue wasnt just the game.
---
The only other game to ever blue screen my PS4 was Fallout 4 lol 
---
Well shit, I'll have to be careful and watch out for this one. Thank you for the info
---
Never have crashes on xbox on wifi. I heard from someone else that they switched off of ethernet onto wifi and they stopped having crashes
---
Ok can't find down shelves... where tha fuxk they are?
---
it above the water...like a platform, and in the water, I have a purifier.
---
Wut
---
reduce the damage dealt by explosive weapons
---
&gt; steep learning curve
---
Fallout 76? Are we playing the same game? 
---
And next time the in-laws will learn to call ahead!
---
That's legit overseer levels of insane. Good job, man. 
---
Stash size and duping are not logically connected. Inventory size and the ability to be massively overencumbered is what enables the exploit to work for mass duplication.
---
I know I use a TSE mini gun and a tracking missile launcher for some air-air combat with the queen 
---
You're misunderstanding what I am saying and taking it out of context.
---
I am losing caps by warping to multiple events and when I get there they end abruptly or there isn't even an event really happening.
---
So yeah, I am losing caps 3-20 at a time... but it has happened so many times I've already lost over 300 caps.
---
I was using the caps as an example to quantify how shittily the game performs, and I had received it as a gift and was impressed by the other Fallouts (even at release).
---
I just feel like at this point, there shouldn't be this myriad of issues....so...yeah... I stopped playing.
---
Jokes on you, I’m perpetually encumbered but I carry around a variety of weapons so when I get too much of one type, I shoot using that for awhile. 
---
Might be an abandon idea from the Devs just like the memory lounges in fo4 shame they never did a dlc based around them.
---
I understand that. PC is totally different. If you Blue Screen on PC it's def a hardware software error. If anything I'd expect a crash to desktop if it was software related. But no my PS4 blue screen error codes and then throws me to the how screen. Then I have to reload the game. 
---
There's really only 2 ways.
---
1. Killing scorch beasts.
---
2. Killing enemies in a nuke zone and scrapping the hardened mass.
---
In the context of my comment that they responded to, yes.  If their answer is yes, then I have no argument, if their answer is no, then I do.
---
I suggested he ride a brahmin and start swinging an axe about but I think he took offence because I've not seen him for a while.  *sad face*
---
I still believe people would love him for it.
---
I agree it could be done this way. My original post was only to state that it is technically possible to track duplicated items if database provisions were made. Also this check for duplicates does not need to take place when playing the game. It could be done during server maintenance. At this point its just a few simple database commands to go through all tables in all databases and find duplicate item IDs. 
---
I'm inclined to agree, it's a major part of the game loop. If you started with it all there really won't be much to do. 
---
I was going to say one of my favorite parts of the game is HELPING new people out. I can’t even be mad though this is probably one of the best interactions I’ve ever seen in the game 😂😂😂
---
Very fallout-lore-esque too. I’m surprised something in the game isn’t already like this. It’s a wasteland- every man for himself!
---
On my lvl 27 character Wallace had a Cryolator and Broadsider, so like your edit said it might not be quite as restrictive as your initial testing, but from doing some hops on different level characters the pool of plans is definitely different.
---
on PS4..if you hit R3 while the item is highlighted, you'll see the legendary effects.
---
Omg this is Brilliant, I literally busted out laughing T the poor guy in video #2
---
While I like the idea, the problem is that each food item stacks. So they'd need to separate them. Right now the way it seems to work is if you have 6 of the same food it'll show you the average condition of the set. 
---
Sure they could do the same with the timer, but in reality I think it'd be best to separate any with different times. 
---
Thank you all for the quick responses. 
---
Have the vendor bot responder at charleston station. Would like to rejoin for a chance at hunters coat
---
This needs to stop. I was walking by an auto parts store and saw the plastic jugs and the first thing in my mind? Better grab those, I need more plastic.  I think this just means I need to get motivated and make a fallout short film to get it out of my system. 
---
Another fun fact: if you have the mod for the black powder rifle bayonet, you can attach it to the dragon. 
---
So it’s worth scooping up those mods even if you’re rocking a dragon instead of the normal rifle.
---
I am on xbox and I never have a DC and my internet is dreadful
---
I mean .. you're not wrong, lol.
---
My girlfriend hates that once a day I’ll start signing “lay that pistol down babe, lay that pistol down” 
---
You are truly diabolical and the new leader of the trappers.
---
And I just blew coffee all over the monitor ... at work!
---
The more I think about it, the more I think that the scorchbeasts are not controlling the scorched and the actual fungus is, since it predated the scorchbeasts
---
Yeah, extremely heavy.  
---
nope, make it so you can target their camp, and their camp is locked in place until the nuke goes away
---
You can, you have to use half walls. Place one half wall, then place half wall on top of it.
---
Discovered this over the weekend.
---
If you don't understand farming/crafting/inventory management coming into the game, its a lot.
---
Throw in non-traditional questing and multiple people running around you, I could see it being weird.
---
If I hadn't been playing MMO's for the last 10 years, I'd be a level 30 running around with 7000 steel and wood scraps wondering why I was so slow.
---
Hypocrisy at its finest. You're saying that "Nono, these obviously emotional edits are sarcastic, I'm absolutely chill", yet you accuse people of "getting this mad over a Reddit post" because they told you to get over it. 
---
HAHA!
---
i built my camp overlooking one of the launch tubes completely inadvertently and saw one getting launched last weekend. it was really cool. 
---
Try running with a zerg in cyrodiil (eso). It's a server side issue.
---
It gets a bit easier to manage the more you work with it.
---
Don't keep more than 100 scrap of 90% of the things in the game.  Let your Ballistic Fiber, Screws, Springs, and Ultracite go unlimited.
---
\-----------------------
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
The two shot mit being +100% is weapon dependent. It ignores mods and shoots a shot from a standard reciever instead of whatever you have on the weapon. Obviously a pretty big deal if you mod to prime or something, but irrelevant if the weapon doesn't have a better reciever. 
---
Me too
---
You can pretty much go anywhere you want, whenever you want but certain areas are level capped and i seriously wouldn't recommend going to these places unprepared or expect alot of running, hiding etc lol.
---
The mire and cranberry bog are difficult places to visit at low level, it can be done as I was low level when I visited them. Whitesprings and watoga are another areas that can prove a challenge especially when higher level players are in the vicinity as enemies cap to their level not yours. This is the case for most areas with high level players there but these two places have an absolute crap ton of enemies to face and could spell an early grave for lower levels 
---
You are the type of quality Raider Appalachia needs more of.
---
Priority 2 should be to ban those peoples IP 
---
That's the way it's always been in fallout. On it's original platform. Working as intended. Just plug your controller in your PC if it's such a hassle for you.
---
Yea. Consoles are weird. I hate how they work. Lots of bloat between the game and the console itself causes tremendous problems.
---
I kinda wish there was a building in Charleston that you could go to to claim your prize vouchers, like the 'lifetime supply of cram' or the 'corvega' the first could be like 50-100 cans of cram, the later could just be a ton of scrap or perhaps have it award the racecar bed or something since it's so rare
---
I put my trash in the trash cans.
---
Does speed demon affect melee attack speed? Because if it doesn't, it should
---
Yep and didn't see anything thanks for confirming for me.
---
The nuka cola jackets look pretty good and you can get them in less than an hour so doubt they've been duped that much
---
Just put on the scribe outfit and you’ll get one 
---
Make sure you get the Super Duper Perk (luck category) too.
---
It gives you a 30% chance to craft double of what you're crafting.  Works really well with ammo.
---
I’d say fix the methods. Then go after the ones that publicly admit to it. As for the gear I don’t think they can track what’s what. 
---
Which areas of the map would you recommend going early on?
---
They won't do it. 
---
It will hurt their player base numbers too much, sadly. 
---
Hundred percent agree. I’m sat on 4000+ atoms because I’ll choose exactly what I want (purposefully skipped Blackbird paint, scandalous I know) as it wasn’t quite for me. 
---
Sat patiently waiting for something (*anything!*) to take my fancy. 
---
No ability to lightly turn the lock, but with practice you will be able to stop it just as you "feel" it about to resist, in that regard it is not so different in the end. I do not notice pins breaking too quickly. It may not be how hard you turn it, rather it's the amount of time it is being resisted I think.
---
It does because you bought it at 60 even though you think it should be 30. 
---
What level are you? I see them for sale at vendors, pretty common at the enclave vendor. Most people probably scrap them because they're so heavy, and to unlock mods.
---
I was wondering about that too. I have FO76 on xbox
---
If you want to get banned, as it goes against ToS agreement
---
Ok I'll give you. If you haven't played any RPG or MMO or practically any game in the past 5-10 years. It could then be kind of tricky. 
---
I hear a lot of people whining and complaining that duplicates are wrecking the economy, and I'd love to get a detailed explanation how. At least, based on the microeconomics theory I learned in college, this is far from the truth. 
---
TSE Handmades, one of the most coveted weapons in the game, are valued by Modus at 100c-200c. A few months ago, they were sold on regular market for 4000c to 8000c. Now, the average market on discord sells them for 18000c-25000c. 
---
By the law of supply and demand, an influx of duplicates should force the price of the guns to go down, as there's a ton of people who can and do sell them for far less than 18000c.  And yet, the prices keep going higher and higher. 
---
So no, your economy is doing just fine. There's really no justification for having such a high markup on a weapon other than greed. Pure, adulterated greed.
---
On the flipside, there is a devalue of caps, as it's not a finite resource. And one could argue that duplicating caps/nuka cola/etc could devalue the actual worth of the cap itself. But again, dupers are not really taking cap payments, and a lot of vendors (both legit and no) are switching to trading other items for weapons exchange.
---
What Bethesda CAN do is release new weapons that can be purchased and give the caps some semblence of value. But the market is doing just fine. If you're bitter you can't sell your overpriced weapon, you need to ask yourself why you need to be that greedy to begin with.
---
&gt;Vast majority of players don't care if other cheated
---
that's where you're wrong, its not just here on reddit that the game receives harsh criticism, its on other forums as well
---
and if you think its going to stop in a month, then you're sorely mistaken, when they introduce player vendors the cheaters exploits are going to be felt twice as much as they are right now
---
Sure!  Randomly discovered it over the past week. Not sure when they changed it but man was I happy!       
---
I also unbulk anything I buy from them so I don’t lose mods 😁👍
---
Same here. Charge goes down, I log out and in, bang fully charged again. Unfortunately that's the only good thing with the game for me lately
---
There never has been a trade bug. Just people fumbling with the clumsy interface.
---
I specifically use my axe when rubbing it as to not one shot everything. 
---
Yyea I really think it's a memory issue. The timing of the server could also be a problem. Bethesda rep basically insisted I should open up ports; which I did and that still didn't help. I'm going to install it on my 2nd PS4 and see if that also had the problem and then ask them why both of my machines are blue screening lol 
---
Trapper Torso
---
Yeah, I love how no matter what your issue is, people will find a way to blame everything but the game itself.  
---
It's dupers. It's your internet. It's your system. It's user error.
---
The official guide lists aliens as an individual enemy with four variations. I don’t have a picture atm but could post one later.
---
How much we can trust the guide remains to be seen. But at one point they were intended to be a unique and rare enemy type. 
---
Seems unlikely that no one would have found one by now. Could be future content. Could be a ridiculously condition specific encounter. Until someone finds one we can only speculate 
---
a bluescreen wont be fixed with open ports....
---
Oh, they did, my wife just didn't tell me about it.
---
Or I wasn't paying attention when she told me- I can never tell which.
---
best i got was a dragon rifle 3 star with 3 legendary effects (up to 300dmg/shot), but the reload is like 30 seconds. I sold it for 20 caps to a vendor.
---
Exactly lol
---
Ultracite was discovered before scorchbeasts were created. But the scorched plague was found in the same area and seem to be related
---
That'd cause WAY too much inventory bloat, which is already a pretty bad problem.  Instead it should show the 'soonest to spoil' condition/time that way you know WHEN you'll loose something.
---
Also with weapons/armor condition I'd like to see actual numbers, and the same goes for my HP, like, it seems like this game does the whole 'padded' hp bar thing, where the more the bar is filled the more you loose in a given attack, even if the damage is the same, to make it feel like your in more danger than you actually are, which isn't bad in a single player game, but in a multiplayer game it's kinda....crippling to have inacurate information

They shouldn't delete duped items, it could indirectly affect players that are completely innocent from duping. I think the best approach is to outclass them eventually. Raise the level cap on items and enemies or add more desirable legendary effects. Done correctly you could outclass the existing dupes and provide new content in the process.
---
I would be so sad if I disconnected at the end of farming Uranium Fever for shotguns to break down.
---
They need to seriously re-balance PVP.  One shotting everything is not skill.  PVP should take skill.  My melee character one shots everything.  It's dumb.
---
&gt; They did invest a lot of time into the Online Mode. It's connectivity is so much better now. And you were able to see the improvements quite fast, as soon as they realized people love online GTA. Meanwhile, Fallout 76 is still crashing when I try to shut it down.
---
Yea is that why every 3rd heist I get black screen of death that remains until at least one person forcibly pulls the plug on their PS4 system? Why I have to join story mode first because if I jump into online mode from the start up every other time I get stuck in an infinite loading screen. Why when lobby hopping to find a smaller lobby or preferably a solo public for me and my friends to grind in the game will catch you in an infinite loading screen needing a complete restart of the PS4 to get it to fix it.  If this is 5 years with literally millions of dollars of in come from the game then I am not impressed.
---
I have not had a crash yet on FO76.
---
&gt; No, 1.5M in a public lobby with less than 15 people in it. I never was bothered too much by other players, and when I were, I killed them. Yes, sometimes I got my ass whooped, but that's part of the game. It's a game about criminals fucking up each other, not a trading simulation. It would be so boring without a little bit of pressure during these missions.
---
Yea you say that but I doubt that.  Also what criminals have exact gps coordinates of every other criminal activity at every single moment of every single day? If criminals learned of over 400k dollars worth of meth was being moved they would kill the people moving it and take the meth to sell themselves. They wouldn't come streaking in with military jet strafing explosive rounds in the middle of down town Los Angeles.   They would have to actually find out and track the sale themselves without any assistance otherwise.
---
&gt; I do agree tho that some things don't make sense. When I buy an amphibical vehicle, I should be able to use that. And why can't I bring a tank into the pacific heist? I totally agree that the limitations there are stupid as fuck and I'd love to see them change. It's limiting my freedom as a player way too much and the missions feel so scripted. Which is sad, because I have two million different ideas how to rob a bank.
---
Heists are annoying but they are telling a story and such have limitations because of the story element. How ever free roam offers no such limitations. They are put in place specifically to slow down players. A cargobob could move a vechile from LSIA to the desert twice as fast as driving it. But because it would mean speeding up the supply runs they restrict it. Equally there is no limitation to the number of supply runs in a buissness that can be run at any given time. Least I have never ran into a limitation. But they put cool downs on the them just to slow people down.  It makes sense with VIP and MC work as you can only have 1 running per lobby. 
---
This is particularly irksome with Nightclubs as the money you get from a popular night club isn't very much. But all the missions to increase popularity have you literally traversing half the game map for it to only minor increase in popularity. And even in a private lobby you still have to wait 5 minutes between. Meaning if you let it drop to low it becomes a massive grind to get your popularity back up. 
---
&gt; And I'm a huge fan of survival games, it's probably my favorite genre. But the survival aspect in Fallout 76 is laughable. You have to manage food, water and rads, that's it. Throw in a disease cure every now and then which is supereasy to craft. Honestly, they could've just left food and water out and nobody would have said a damn thing. 
---
Which is just like a lot of survival games. Ark Survival Evolved you have food, water, disease and a few weather elements that are easy to avoid unless you play on a couple of maps that have extreme weather parts like scorched earth or aberration. FO76 strikes a good balance between survival and being enough to not over whelm people who are not big fans of survival games. 
---
RDR2 offers similar set up in their online game mode. Very light on the survival aspect of needing to cook and craft just like this game. 
---
Rust was an indie title that was released as an early access. Fallout 76 is not early access or an indie developer.
---
i cant find u on psn
---
Forums comprise a very, very small portion of the player base.  90%+ of any games playerbase don't ever read patch notes, forums, etc.
---
Forums and reddit and just echo boxes for whiners (no matter what they whine about).   The actuality of it is no matter what game, what issue all it takes it removing the source of the issue and player bases forget about the problem they caused and move on to the next thing to whine about within a fews weeks time tops.
---
Inconceivable! 
---
Yea I’d like to find another means. I can’t stomach server hopping for this. Hoping maybe an event quest would have a chance for them.
---
Nobody can answer this question except yourself.....  But yes, yes you should get it!
---
I'm not ignoring the multi player but I still have to pay nearly full price to buy a new version of the game to get access to GTA Online.  Why are you using single player to validate online's issues?
---
You can switch back and forth between your current and last used weapon with left dpad, but that's about it.
---
I saw the purple eyed one somewhere in the mire already and he wasnt so chill in that situation :c
---
As far as i know there are 4 different mothmans... stalking, normal, wise, and another one which i dont know is called in english.. in german its „rachsüchtiger“ 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I hardly think it's rushing to learn how to make the gun and unlock its modifications in a few days, rather than half a year.
---
Was just going to say something like this. Its super easy to get duplicate weapons legit.
---
So as someone who has like 8 maps he forgot about for the forest, is the loot leveled to you, does the treasure only spawn if you have a map, and is there a cool down if you have duplicate maps. 
---
Op seems like the type of person that burned cats 
---
Why are you rushing to get caps? Going out of your way to hop around to different vendors will burn you out. You should just get caps organically, the way the developers intended. You have years upon years to get caps, but nope, you are rushing and apparently ruining my life or something.
---
To me the FireBreathers Course is worse. IIRC you can do Brotherhood without it
---
&gt; What's to say that it isn't just Watoga having 200 more items to sell to someone above lvl 20 than it does someone below?
---
The level restriction has been datamined.
---
immersive af
---
As unpopular as it is, I really haven't enjoyed any Fallout game. Much to the dismay of my mates, I find them boring at best.
---
Tried to bribe my son with the promise of pizza but he's 101% PC gamer and kept complaining about controller and input lag. So no luck and no pizza for him ;) 
---
I cant say for controller but with mouse and keyboard the wheel is mark with numbers so you can press 1 through 9 and - = to use a weapon or item.
---
On lets plays I have seen I saw a D-pad icon thing so I wouldnt be surprise if there is some sort of D-pad swap as well.
---
can confirm i also meat him.
---
was in lewisburg and entered big bend tunnel.  
---
He appeared at the middle where the locked door is on the right
---
If it's junk you can just jump into a fissure with it. It'll drop automatically when you die and it can't be retrieved. 
---
Most likely you had bone bulked steel and the jetpack. So it scraps the mod first, then the bulk. Now you have 12, and it used 6 of them.
---
Or if you're saying it showed you having 6, it's because it was counting your scraps. 
---
I bought it at 60 cause I figured It'd have as much content as oh all their games since oblivion. Which in reality finished everything in less than 24 hours of questing even after trying not to finish it all.
---
thanks! i will try this.  anyone else confirm?
---
To be honest, it's probably all of the above. Hell, i killed the queen last night and she dropped an upgrade plan for me.
---
lol i didnt even know food had a CND bar
---
Hell thats how they expect you to get mods.
---
Yeah. It'd be nice for her to just drop anything. First/last time I killed the queen there was literally no loot for me.
---
Wear Excavator PA and go around to the Fissure Sites, if you don’t want to do Glassed Cavern again. At Fissure Sites you can find ~5 nodes of decaying ultracite to mine, doubles with full Excavator. Although in Glassed Cavern there’s easily 40+ nodes, non-decaying. Overall, I find Ultracite PA too expensive to repair for its stats, but if you’re set then those are the easiest methods. 
---
I’d suggest T-51b (best dr/er, low rr) for standard combat, X-01 (high dr/er, best rr) for nuke zones. 
---
I swear I have the chat log with them to prove it. Basically told me I'm shit out of luck and to contact sony. Sony told me to factory reset my PS4  from safe mode and download an update file that they emailed me and that still didn't fix it. They said I can send my ps4 in for evaluation for 100 euro since I'm out if warranty. And what will they tell me...they will tell me nothing is wrong with my PS4 and I just wasted 100 euro lol 
---
Because they're big dumb dumbs who just think enemy -&gt; turret
---
what are the damage specs?
---
Can't confirm that, but last night he spawned at Dolly farms workshop after I took it.
---
This is a great idea, thanks for sharing!
---
If you go out and buy five copies of the exact same legendary such that they stack - this means the same exact legendary affixes, condition and modifications - well you'd be shit out of luck.
---
It takes like two seconds and gives me a chuckle seeing so many delusional Bethesda sheep 
---
I purchased the long dark when it was 15 dollars and have gotten more out of it then most full priced games and I'm nowhere near finishing it.
---
Ty
---
I don't have it, nor I have I tried to obtain it.  Some of the things others have said:
---
Fast travel out of the event after you have it.  You will loose it on a log out on this method.  Drop it and  have someone else pick it up, put in stash, etc.   Supposely you can not pick it back up yourself.
---
 If you are in power armor, requip your power armor helmet and leave the building.  
---
Accept a friend request to another world during the event
---
Perhaps if it only happened once and there was clear warning ahead of time. Legitimate players would be able to prepare but dupers would not. I would like a better method, but this is something. 
---
You can only dig it up if you have a map yes.
---
Multiple maps can be used for the same spot in succession. 
---
OH! SO THATS WHAT IT IS! i scrapped that weapon because my game would constantly crash while using one! ouch
---
Just got the one that gives you +8 from census violence. I had the +6 from the same event I think. 
---
I grabbed it on amazon a couple of months ago but haven't made anything from it yet.  I have a very controlled diet during winter, so I'll be cracking this open come spring.
---
Ad victoriam brother
---
It is incredibly disappointing to kill a 3 star enemy and only get a 1 star piece of equipment from it. Makes me not even want to farm for good legendaries. And it's even worse when that one star turns out to be a weightless wood armor piece. I mean really? Is there ANYONE actually running wood armor? Why is that even in the legendary loot pool?
---
I made the mistake of helping defend a workshop and got a bounty. Went back to camp and after about a hour of fighting, dying, revenging and having my camp obliterated by tse weapons I logged. Day or two later another player got a bounty by accident attacking a wolf that spawned in my camp. I asked them if they wanted me to kill  them to clear the bounty because I felt bad (having just gone through it). I said you can just come get your junk bag  after. They were not sure then I asked again (trying to be helpful). They said ok sure go ahead. Not wanting to waste bullets I was just gonna slap them with a melee weapon a few times. Then they whip out their gun and blow my head off. I chuckled and said to myself  War. War never changes... 
---
Because not playing the multiplayer at all it still has more content than 76. Gta rdr2 online are shit but I can ignore them and still play the game.
---
Definitely know the feeling about some things just being much harder for some people. 
---
I suck at aiming in general with the PS4 controller (never had that problem on PC) so anything that involves precision and a timer seems hopeless for me.
---
We're getting a patch the 16th. Just wait ffs. Go outside or something. Call your grandmother. 
---
I found a green alien in the back of one of the red trucks near the north area. 
---
Almost certainly a duper who used a crapload of bobbleheads
---
Dead weight is actually worse than nothing 
---
Is there a way to predetermine where you will Spawn in by placement of the camp?
---
Real talk why do you get that quest every day lmao
---
Like bull diarreah in the ear
---
I carry around an Endangerol Syringer on my rifle pipe weapons character. Reduce the targets armour by 25% for 2 minutes? Yes please! Whats funny is it counts as a pipe weapon and I think a rifle as well. I think it needs access to more/better ammo types. I know we'll never see it again but the dart gun from F3 has a great crippling poison...Honestly this would help bring down scorch beasts and give players a reason to care about the gun. Though it turns into a one trick pony at that point.
---
When player vending comes out you should be able to list those items for caps and just wait for them to sell (provided you don't put insane prices on them that is....lol).
---
If you don't want to wait, go to FO76 Market Reddit and look on the right side of the screen below the video.  You'll see a button that says "Trusted Middlemen".  Once you and whoever have agreed to a trade, contact them.  One will show up and take the trade items from both players, then give the trade items to the appropriate player.  A bit more time consuming, but a pretty guaranteed way to safely do trades.
---
"It just works"
---
A minor tip: Bobbleheads weigh, I think, a pound. Magazines don't weigh anything, if I recall correctly, but still clutter up your inventory. The chances that you'll be in a situation where finding the right magazine or Bobblehead and applying it will make a real difference in your game are vanishingly small. There just aren't that many times when you think "Hey, I'd better run back to CAMP, shuffle through my crap and get that +15% damage to Mirelurks right now". So do yourself a favor and just use these things as soon as you find them. You get a nice little bonus for the next hour and it's one less thing to think about going forward.
---
Similarly, plans and recipes have weight as well. When you read one for the first time you learn the plan or recipe and it vanishes. Note that when you hover over a plan out in the world and it tells you you can "Read" it, it's lying. When you click "Read" it just picks it up and puts it into your inventory. You have to go into the inventory and click it again to actually read/learn it. Extra copies are dead weight. Be a nice guy and give them to another player or drop them in an Overseer's box or something.
---
I'm level 82 and have never played with mutations.  I've finished most of the game content (enclave/raiders/brotherhood quest lines)  I've done all but drop a nuke.  I think I'm gonna farm some mutations now - those look like fun.
---
Inside Glass Caverns can pickup 20+ anytime I want
---
 ***Why the hell is everyone in SUCH A HURRY to get to a three figure level? Or to have jet packs or Legendary Two Shot ultracite bladeeblahs?*** 
---
Because they're people.  They tie their own wroth with having worth in this or any other game.  And they don't care HOW they got it, just that they got it.
---
I'd love these cheeky things if the game wasn't a heaping pile of $..t
---
HA! I have a pic with ED too, need to figure how to get it off the PS4
---
If its worth anything Atlas had a much worse release than FO76, but its not triple A so wasn't as big a deal. If you look at the reviews people litterally say its worse than FO76.
---
I mean by definition if your "au natural" method of getting the mods is going to take half a year (though I disagree with that on the basis of the fact that you can both shoot for the pattern AND break down picked up handmades at the same time, it's not one or the other), and your server hop method is going to cut that down to a few days, that is rushing.  So your answer is yes, which is fine.
---
Yea please. They really make a big difference and I dislike that we can only use tall and half walls now, instead of the medium-sized ones. Metal, wood, the concrete. Bring them all back pls
---
What would they do?
---
Fits the "wasteland/survivor" story line better not having a exact time its going to spoil.  Plus maybe some of that is random on the backside so a time limit can't be determined.  Hell for all we know there is a check every so many minutes and the random chance gets higher and higher until it spoils (i.e. after 30 minutes there is 5% chance to spoil, 45 minutes 20%, 1 hour, 50%, etc).  Same with the gain....maybe its random so they can't put 20%.
---
Personally I like it how it is....makes it feel more real for lack of a better term.
---
Does not really matter when you compare them at release time though
---
Bulking acid makes 15 out of 10 and logging in in your excavator armor gives you an additional extra 100 carry cap.
---
I loved this, so evil and fun xD
---
I think all the horde ones have a guaranteed legendary.
---
Making a play on words idiom for others to laugh at isn't really destructive.  Life is full of judgement and that probably wont ever change.  I dont encourage bullying, but youre being pretty hypersensitive homie.
---
They don't make it a necessity.   You manufacture the necessity with your desire.
---
Make an alt, get into the teens for lvl. Either run or invite people near Harpers Ferry for the easy fast travel option.
---
I ran there from Top of the world, its not horrible, just make sure to stash all your junk. Find the unexplored marked map points as you go,so you have somewhere to spawn if you die. If you see something move run faster, avoid bugs and your set.
---
I got my handmade plans on the second pass through Harpers Ferry, they spawn fairly often but are level locked so only a few can actually buy them.
---
And for bonus points you can get more than 1 plan on your alt and sell them to others for a cap profit.
---
I thought that meme was for bugs and glitches not design choices you don't like.
---
Were you in power armor or a rad suit?  You wouldn't really need rad-x if you were.
---
Where can I find you and do you have pacifist mode on? Asking for a friend
---
Me too. I recently bought a double shot laser rifle but i went from having tons of fusion cells to barely having any because its such a good gun lol. Hunting rifle has been my #1 choice since day 1 though. 
---
Wooden legs? Salty? Are you a pirate!?
---
My own personal solution to the problem, AFTER the duping has been eliminated from the game, would be to get the most commonly duped items (TSE shotguns, Nuka Cola ect...) And make a caron copy of them with a different ID.  
---
The ID they currently use can be changed to something utterly worthless like a bubble gun that weights 10 lb and doesnt do damage is sells for 0 caps.  
---
A lot of people will lose out on a handful of things but its much better than a complete wipe of the servers. Especially as most people who dont cheat wont have more then a handful of any of the most commonly duped items, which is the exact reason theyre duped to start with
---
I recently ran into a a 3 person team at my base when my wife and I returned after a mission.  It turned out to be a nice time, I was happy to share my benches and have a chat.  One of the higher level characters even tuned up my wife's shotgun for her for the cost of a few screws.  I had originally locked my front door, but I'm going to leave it unlocked from now on.  The community, for the most part, has been really nice.  We've struck up conversations with folks all over the map and often get offered resources and base locations.
---
Imagine that, a nice online community...  Pleasantly surprised!
---
I thought that was it, but the picture helps reinforce this.
---
you're the one who used reddit as a metric I just iterated that its more than just reddit, you take offense because you are guilty of the problem. 
---
Nice, thanks..
---
What would also be very useful is what mods that stack on a PA part, i know you can have a new headlamp and another mod on the helmet, but does any other mod stack ? a list would be sooooo nice :)
---
*baddies
---
I think the entire legendary drop system needs to be redone. I'd like to see fewer drops of better quality. If they did that along with guaranteeing better drops off bosses, I think things would improve. I would gladly do more work for a better chance at something useful. (Although I am already overdue for more content. I am bored farming the same areas and doing the same events over and over)  
---
They do, just alot of the times they dont work ( you cannot fast travel to them and they do t start when you go to the location by foot)
---
what were the specs on the rifle you got? dmg/legendary?
---
This is a great idea, thanks for the suggestion!
---
Best is a matter of opinion.  They have made all my favs so to me they are the best. My son on the other hand would say Epic games is. 
---
I do server hop but I call it quick. I don’t need to waste all my game time on bouncing to different servers.
---
Tbh I find RNG to be an annoyingly lazy example of game design these days.
---
If you've got melee players there, try to hit the queens wings as much as you can.  That will cause her to land more often.  Still keep shooting after she lands (headshots are easy).
---
I'm a melee player, and I can't do squat to the queen when she's flying.  But when she's landed I can power attack with my end-game sledge all day for free.
---
Get her to land more often, then the melee damage will stack up.
---
Better than my first kill, two sb meat after searching.
---
your blog sucks
---
And then all the ghouls turn into ash piles which can't be looted.
---
You are a godsend 
---
And you've been gnooooomed!
---
That one was cake for me for some reason. First try was a "cleaning run" to remove all mobs along the course and second was an exercise in sprinting with the only problem was falling off the ramp back into the building. Aiming...
---
This is a stupid way to solve the issue. In the long run people are going to have items that stack. All it takes is repairing items with artisan that are the same type with same rolls, with a high intelligence and they will stack at times once stored. In the long run even once the dupe glitch is fixed people are going to want to farm items. You will want items that are the same to stack. You don’t want to have to scroll through 100 different items because they don’t stack. And excuse me for being so blunt but there are better ways to solve this than to implement something like this. Instead of band aiding the glitch where there are clearly work arounds, fix the reason that is causes the player to disconnect. Or cause anything over 254 of a weapon crafted to auto delete when dropped, traded, etc. Limiting players to have one of each item creates no reason to farm items to sell when vending is implemented. If my item is just going to be wiped that I crafted multiples of to sell, that defeates the purpose of me making that item and modifying it to sell. Just my opinion. 
---
I’m down to join. I’m a boom stick build, explosive shotguns ftw EthanATX on PC

It was much easier in Fallout 3, NV, and 4 where entering VATS slowed time down drastically and allowed you to target your own grenade while it was slowly flying through the air, and time the perfect shot to make the grenade explode right in your enemy's face. In 76 I find it incredibly difficult to reliably hit grenades in mid-air due to a combination of low VATS accuracy (build restrictions) and the limited amount of air time the grenades see, but it is still possible.
---
102 - I really haven't found a good rifle yet (still using a regular old sniper .308 upgraded to .50 plain.)  Mostly I just smash things with an armor-ignoring super sledge.

Before Scorchbeasts were discovered, not created. Scorchbeasts have been arround for ages, but they take decades to reproduce to the point they open the chasms and attack the world above. They have been there for a while. 
---
I have items im sure are duped and tbh I would be fine if they disappeared knowing all other duped items were gone 
---
I would also like to know 
---
Nope, largest excavator and (not self propelled) land vehicle is the Bagger 293
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagger_293
---
And it's predeccessor was the Bagger 288 (more picutres here)

Are you sure? I'm pretty sure the increased explosion radius also affected "Explosive" legendary weapons in Fallout 4.... I know it's not the same game, but it kinda is....
---
:l
---
this is insane and twisted... I love it..
---
Senpai noticed me. &lt;3
---
I’m on pc what do you want for them and what level are they

What are you on?

It never happened? or you just don't realize it did? Probably the second option if you ask me.

Even if stealthed via chameleon they see the large red cap icon over your head.

One word- Marsupial.

The poor mans jetpack, with better bonus's and more versatility.

I just got those as a quest reward for the order of mysteries, i think

I had a friend kill himself over that shit... so yes I am hypersensitive

If I recall, like 93.  All of the mods on is are the basic of basic mods.... and I can't upgrade anything on it (first Gauss I've found).
---
Pretty much the area you start in, the forest, it's a large enough area to explore with plenty of towns and other stuff, lore etc... then probs ash heap or toxic valley 
---
What the hell was this?
---
They are both connected to server stability.
---
The devs said that it would be tricky to increase the stash size, because the amount of items listed would affect the servers.
---
But we already have people with thousands of items, that weigh a million lb - *that* is what is causing the servers to constantly crash and disconnect.
---
If the dupers didn't exist, I bet the stash size could be increased even more.
---
You should go play Eve.
---
I meet him 8 times now (with 2 chars) in different locations and he never had good stuff :(
---
I got a copy from my Reddit Secret Santa, and I love it!

Dang. We really need a Silver Shroud DLC!
---
1) Laser weapons suck  
---
2) Power armor doesn't work with 1 handed melee but works fine with 2 handed melee  
---
3) Melee is overpowered
---
I am sure both vendors have multiple spawn points, I will try Dolly farms, thanks
---
Have you leveled up alot since you build the camp?
---
Lol I usually hate doing melee but I’ll give it a shot, why are laser weapons shit?
---
Union fees for the garden gnomes that moved it for you. You should really have negotiated a set rate before the move, otherwise those little buggers will kneecap you.
---
Then have them broken down on logout.  As long as they aren't in the form of weapons.
---
Please note, I said delete DUPLICATES, you could have a million different guns, it wouldn't do anything to them, it would only break down the duplicates.
---
Maybe you could make it only break down duplicate legendary weapons.  Either way, some sort of solution needs made.
---
Actually it's really good. I'm a fan of all Bethesda games but they can't code for shit. 
---
What entries did you add? I am having the very same problem.
---
600 is fine, but id love to be able to store the power Armour outside of the stash, maybe a weapons rack or chest too. Not been able to store enough setups of weapons is a little annoying 
---
&gt; In the long run people are going to have items that stack
---
Sure, but what are the chances you are going to have stacks of legendary weapons?
---
If you only delete, or as someone else mentioned, break down, duplicates of items in an inventory, it's pretty safe to assume it is only going to hit dupers.  Sure, it might nail someone with 2 identical weapons, but only if they log off overencumbered. 
---
Beta for FO 76 was Oct 23rd and Red Dead 2 came out Oct 26.
---
over an idiom on reddit? Sorry your friend died, that is never funny.  Ill agree with you that losing a friend is the kind of burden I wouldn't wish on anybody.
---
X01 calibrated shocks and Tesla coils.
---
The one enclave vendor tucked away in the back sells x01 PA mods and it's the only way to get them without buying from a duper. Terrible game design.
---
Only the helmet has 2 slots for headlamp and mod.  All other parts don't stack.  For the list of parts and what they do you can refer to this, not sure if the list is perfect but its what I look at...

Luckily I never seem to come across any other players, so I never encounter this.
---
This is pretty fucked up.
---
Thanks for this
---
This is for customization. 
---
This is correct.  I got mine from the Census Violence event.
---
Just a FYI but there are 4 levels to the wetsuit, the first two Treated and Resistant are purchased at the vendors.  The next two Protected and Shielded are Census Violence drops.
---
Warning, it takes a LOT of grinding Census Violence to get it to drop.  It's a very very very small chance.  You might need to learn the Protected plan first, so if you see that, don't sell or store it, learn it.  Then shielded should be available as a drop (not 100% sure on that, but I've seen a lot of people say it).
---
What if it automatically broke everything down for you?  Or, only did it to legendary weapons?
---
you pay it.
---
I built most of the camp when I was around level 17. Now I'm lvl 25.
---
I love the Breaking bad nods in the game, I took a screenshot of the same thing when I found it :)
---
Have you found the Alien face-hugger easter egg?
---
I just go through and bulk everything possible to clean up the crowded junk tab. Even if it all saves me or my stash a few pounds, I'll take it. Either way, the game should NOT use your expensive mods (I lost almost 1000 CAPS) to repair/build, when there is plenty if the item in bulk
---
The price goes up quite a bit the more frequently you move camp.  I was trying to get the perfect spot to build around my junk extractor and still be in range of water, after about 6 moves it was 120 caps to relocate.
---
I got them for free for claiming or defending a workshop.
---
This is why they needed a real beta, could have done this in the first few months then hard reset at release. 
---
I'm probably going to wait a while until I pick the game up again, got to lv12 and got a bit bored playing solo. Seems it was for the best until things are resolved.
---
Just to be sure - blueprint is selecting every piece of your camp, correct?
---
I wish I known that, I've been giving the duplicates away..........somehow I'd convinced myself they were single use. Should really have tested that theory to confirm I suppose.
---
That means my struggle...
---
Thanks for the link, reading now, BlackWater mine Uranium Fever looks interesting.
---
Would love to see this added to the game! I might actually log back in for an update like this.
---
What if I cant break them down on logout because of disconnect, or I had to get off in a hurry and couldn't walk to a bench. What if I don't want to break them down? What if crafted 20 combat shotguns to give to new players and they were duplicates with the same exact durability since I crafted them? What if I liked collecting multiple legendaries? I saw a post of a player yesterday who's kept literally every single legendary hes gotten as a drop in 300 hours of playing. Hes never traded with another real player once and had plenty of duplicates. 
---
You're suggesting to just literally take items away from legitimate players for no reason. If that guy grndined 300 hours because he has a hoarding problem and then the game just took it all away, how do you think he would feel?
---
So once an item is blue, I can start blue printing. Is there any easy way to get everything or will I have to go piece by piece to blueprint?
---
PM so I have a reminder to add. Also if you'd like you can join us in Discord. 
---
I have the pc version of the game, and there were under "all games" in the launcher. I just had to download/install.
---
I don't know what console users need to do.
---
Everytime I've moved my camp, it's stored my entire base as a whole. I can just place it, in one giant piece, at the new location. 
---
Am I not doing it right, or can't you just do this?
---
Make sure you're getting better legendary weapons.  Anti-armor legendaries stack with anti-armor perk cards.  Two shot increases damage output significantly.
---
Don't run in with crafted non-legendary weapons.  Go grind some.....lol
---
While the wheel is up, you can use the dpad on consoles to click around it. So you can reliably muscle memory it and it’s not as fiddly.
---
😅
---
TLDR version: Whiny man children that want everything their way and bandwagon jumpers.  
---
You sound like me when Mass Effect Andromeda launched. Another game that was slammed for far less issues, to the point the whole dang studio closed.  
---
I could see if bethesda didn't give a warning that it was their first online game and to expect some bugs they have to iron through. But they did.  
---
I could see the hate if they weren't fixing the issues.... but they are.  
---
My only conclusion is that we are dealing with a large group of neck beard millennial's. There is no reasoning with them, they are the generation of disagreeing with everything and making everything a controversy. Just look at all of the worst youtube streamers that trash and started the hate trains on both this game and mass effect andromeda and the mass effect 3 ending.   
---
Nearly every one of them is a millennial. If it isn't exactly what they want the game to be then its trash and deserves to be shut down.  If it isn't fortnite, its trash, don't forget... that's the millennial motto. By the way I was born in the mid 80s right around the cut off age of millennial, and I will be the first to tell you that my generation disgusts me for these reasons here. Reality television, selfish kids, and a high rate of children raised without being scolded for their actions has created a generation of instant gratification 20ish year olds and early 30 year olds. Where every piece of media that they don't like has to be a critical lambaste and roasting of the developers to the point of chasing them around and harassing the developers. Where every game has to be picketed around as some kind of a political scandal or tagged with SJW or something just because the game opened with a small message to say that the team that made the game was diverse and respectful of multiple religions and views (AC origins). God forbid they just don't like something that other people do like, you know, preference of genre or media type?  
---
As someone that has half a brain to not act like that and think from both sides of the story I do my best to not act like that. I am branded as weird or strange or shy in the process, for not acting like a complete ass hat like everyone else. I guess I just have to accept that this is the day and age we live in.  
---
Anyway, that's my rant on where the hate comes from... and guess what. A huge chunk of the people writing the reviews for this game and many of your other games are also from this same generation and mindset. Your best bet is to just read the best reviews for a game and the absolute worst one and just tell from your own educated observation of the low rated guy is just nit picking something like game bugs and not the actual game content. Then you can easily tell if its bs.
---
I love this :) Great shots!
---
Definitely on my list of next cards to load up. Thanks
---
I would rather they increase storage ability than have to make mule alts.
---
Not at the moment but it will be back. I’d save my atoms until it does one thing I learned is that when companies say “this will never be back” it’s usually a lie and a year later it’s back 
---
Hell world of tanks said “this 2015 commemorative tank will never be available again” yet they made it winnable as random drops from loot boxes and stuff constantly afterwords 
---
I’ve seen them time and time again say “limited edition” and “only chance” and those were the biggest lies 
---
How do I delete someone else's reddit account
---
Fix duping/cheating, and simultaneously raise the max character and/or weapon level. All level 50 legendaries are now worthless, as you can find a higher level version of it. 
---
Pretty simple fix, to me. 
---
But the game is more less in the same state it was in at launch not a whole lot has been improved.
---
Sorry bro i play Xbox 
---
so the TS makes it 186 dmg?
---
BasslineBonez. Always down for a sbq fight.
---
You don’t even need to blueprint, its automatic, and you can break down the auto blueprints to store items
---
I saw this two in the cranberry bog a few nights ago. I was also kind of curious as to why. Do two queens show? 
---
That's the in the Whitespring bunker, correct?  I'll have to start hitting that up more often.
---
Ok then yeah I don't think your budget would have changed much then. The camp budget goes up as you lvl but at lower lvls I don't think it will make much of a difference. I've always had to deconstruct my whole camp though to get the budget increase 
---
Them "codes" are rough yo
---
They need to get on a PC, install the launcher, and download the games. 
---
HAHA! I hope someone doesn't have a reddit account
---
The server crashing will stop you from playing, too, so when they patch the game to stop giving some people CTD somehow, you can enjoy looking at the main menu
---
It was actually the person before you that was extremely rude that I was talking to and then you sent the idiom which sent me over the edge. Technically you were not the starter it was the other guy that was rude
---
3* Walking Cane... (Got one...)
---
Could you put two switches, so that the flamers activate in two stages, thus keeping a constant burn going on?
---
It will group up your multiple foundation base structures and anything within close proximity, you can manually add any other structure/object to the blueprint though(in the blueprint tab).  If you have several multiple foundation structures that are not in close proximity to each other, they will be individually blueprinted (unless you manually select everything).  Its actually a pretty friendly system once you learn how to add to a blueprint.
---
I figured with the holidays, it made sense doing the last update of 2018 when they did.  It's Jan fucking 8 now, and not a word while servers are crashing, cheaters are duping... where the fuck are you Bethesda?
---
Couldnt they make all current plans untradable and any after the patch can be traded?
---
So just find desired location, pay the cap fee to move and everything will move over? 
---
What?  You make zero sense.  Any forum is an echo box, just because I said reddit and you can't use some common sense to extend that to any forum doesn't make you right (reddit is just the largest forum, any other forum is going to be an even smaller amount of players complaining).  If it wasn't for server stability issues caused by the duping (which is again another example of bad coding by Bethesda) you'd likely see an even smaller portion of the playerbase even aware of duping or real money trading.
---
And no, never once have duped or taken a duped item just literally don't give a shit what others are doing to play the game how they want to play.     The "economy" has never and was never going to exist with the way NPC vendors are set up, your average player is not ever going to buy things off another player as things stand and interacts only with NPCs or friends. 
---
The issue shouldn't have been there to begin with and should have been fixed much faster than it has and it is on Bethesda not the players using the glitch which again, most players aren't even aware of potential punishment for using it.  The vast majority are going to be people that saw a youtube video and don't pay any attention to EULA, forums, or social media responses from Bethesda.  
---
I had 3 frames with a X-01 torso on each one in my stash.
---
When I got my X-01 stealthboy the first thing I did was return to my camp and install it.
---
When I got my X-01 Jet Pack the first thing I did was return to my camp and install it.
---
Just hunting for the Core Assembly now.
---
They really should have thought this through when they went online, as single player duping is a non-issue. But doing the dupe control at dupe creation time would discourage dupers from doing it.. especially if they spent so much time crafting boards only for their creation to be denied. 
---
Alternatively (and the easier way to fix it), Bethesda could run a semaphor check to catch the issue client-side. The current problem is that the server caches requests to execute rather than doing it on-demand one-at-a-time using a send-receive-confirm communication setup. The dupe glitch seems to predicate off overloading the servers and making them process multiple build requests that have queued up, so if you eliminate the queue, the duper wouldn't be able to successfully complete the process of duping. 
---
Tell her in an excited way that you found a two shot explosive weapon and some guy paid you 500 caps for it!  Awesome!
---
Trolling wives is man's best hobby.
---
Sorry but, you are really pulling at straws here.
---
This is so evil
---
I love it.
---
that's what THEY want you to think....
---
He means to make all events have a guaranteed legendary spawn, not just AWOL, Uranium fever, horde events
---
They're just usually a real pain in the ass to get to line up the way you want. I do notice that it's easier on flat surfaces (like the barn walls) rather than textured walls (like brick).
---
And this is why Bethesda didn't add NPCs. Congratulations human, you just created some quality in-game content 👌
---
That meme has a short half-life. Soon it will be the default battle cry for fighting the scorchbeasts queen. I will stick to my retro ways and always use “FOR PONY!”
---
I think they’re funny because if you use them in pvp to finish someone off instead of using precious ammo you. An scream in voice chat or send them a message YOU GOT BONED
---
I mean..they responded to you so they must be alive?
---
Or did I sleep in and miss the Zombie apocalypse?
---
They snap together but don't snap well. Just stand directly in front of the surface you're putting them on, and make them straight 
---
I'm close on the budget, but I can delete the sentry bots if needed to move/blueprint. Those suckers consume the budget.
---
Why are you even here? You said you don't like or play Bethesda games. You provide no constructive criticism and basically you are coming here to rant about us having fun. I'm having a blast playing with my friends and family. You should really put all this energy towards something more constructive instead of sitting on the porch yelling at the kids to stop having fun.
---
Thats how its worked every time I’ve moved my camp. Nothing will be scrapped, but beware of industrial water purifiers and any objects that you havent unlocked
---
I use the controller on PC. Seems much easier for me, except for the mini-wheel favorites. I just don't use the function.
---
Hayzedayze420. Hit me up il help if i can, im tring to do the same
---
Ahaha, so wholesome and cute! I love that the entire family plays together
---
It's a matter of not being bothered by it in the slightest, and don't give me this to each his own crap. The game is universally acclaimed so your opinion is in the vast minority.
---
My friend saw two down there, but they were off center, I have no idea why you do that either.  There was never a lack of things to kill when I was fighting the queen. 
---
when you move your CAMP, you can place it as a whole piece, and modify the parts you need to.. OR there is a VERY high chance that it will NOT place at the new location due to terrain, so you can just hover over your CAMP in the stored tab, hit scrap, and select store.. it'll tell you that the CAMP will be broken down into individual components, and you WILL NOT lose any materials. All of your pieces will go into your stored tab, and you can place them again however you want.
---
whats wrong with them?
---
This is correct.  3-5k sounds right to me and I trade on the trading subs all the time.  He's also right that for certain individuals it might be more.
---
Now if you had those prefixes on a Super Sledge or Gragnak Axe, that would be 20k plus easily.  Some people won't even sell those for caps, just other super end-game items.
---
We need this.. we need real stairs going up to next floor. not that metal stairs.
---
You're not a fan of all Bethesda's games, nobody is.
---
Why bother when you can spam left click through everything, never read anything and complain that this game is barren 😂
---
I'll bet you one kidney that more than half of players who finished main story don't even know what the explosive bait does. 
---
Do you mean delete all duped weapons AND any account that has them? So if you buy a duped weapon your account should also be deleted?
---
My only issues with this are, 1: Is it really possible to find what weapons are legit and what weapons are duped with 100% accuracy? 
---
And 2: What about people who unknowingly have duped weapons? Such as picking them up from another players bag?
---
also, 3: Is players having duped weapons really that big of any issue? I don't find this game breaking but maybe thats just me. if a level 5 is running around having fun, why should he care if that level 150 has a bunch of duped weapons and his friends all have one?
---
I would just use this to dump massive amounts of stuff to an alt.  I would no longer question whether I really need it or not for more than a moment.  I would just fill up the shared storage, log on the alt, and pick it up.  The alt would just sit in 1 spot indefinitely to act solely as unlimited storage.
---
If i wanted to check my storage, I would have to log on the alt, see if i have an item, put it back in shared storage, log back in to my main, and pick up the item.
---
If this is the way they want to handle the situation, so be it. It'd still be a chore and you'd loose any workshops unless they change that too.
---
*insert alien meme here*
---
I’ve seen him multiple times while claiming or defending the workshop at Berkeley Springs. Maybe 3/5 times? It might just be that it’s on his route and since the road passes right through the middle of the workshop I can hear him chattering away to moo-moo wherever I am in the workshop and don’t miss him.
---
Thank you so much. Bookmarked for sure!
---
I was rummaging through a bathroom in some random House and grabbed an alarm clock off of a shelf that was behind a toilet. Behind that alarm clock were two children's wooden blocks that were turned to show PU. I love finding stuff like that. 
---
Ever cheat in some games and just lose the drive to play because the challenge is gone? Some games it's fun, like RDR2, and then others where the goal is progression and it kinda just kills the reason to keep going.
---
Some may enjoy the melting enemies cheaty-ness to it, some may sell it because it kills their fun challenge.
---
Same. Awhile back, before I hit 44, I server hopped A LOT to find those pesky plans. To no avail.
---
Recently leveled a guy to 15 and bam, plans there almost every other server hop in Watoga train station.
---
ha, well fair enough...i suppose not everyone hiding is just there to leech. Dude, i wish i could say i feel for you....i somehow managed to get the shower plan the first time i accidentally stumbled into a queen fight.....i was so unprepared, i ended up burning all my chems/food/water/ammo just to survive and contribute what i could....keep at it, hopefully the RNG gods help you out sooner rather than later
---
Glad to hear its an appreciated idea, it's definitely a great idea and hope to see it.
---
Cannot second this enough. Also a melee here, I always get yelled at for even showing up to the fight because I end up clearing the minions off the heavies and not getting to hit Queenie very much. Of course once she lands, she’s dead in a minute, but that’s not what gets noticed when they see someone running around fighting and not magically flying to her level to smack her in the face at all times. 
---
The first time Mr. Prizebot approached me I was in full combat mode and instantly killed it when it came up behind me, thought I lost out on something huge but nope.
---
Yeah, that hand pump water faucet isn't working so well, haha.
---
Yooooo I'll take a fat man, but I'm short in caps. What do you want for it
---
I didnt know if they needed to connect the accounts somehow or something.
---
Oh, well that is good. Some of us don't know how we are ... and don't take hints telling us.
---
You use the mouse's scroll wheel. You can also use 0-9 on the keyboard.
---
Any point for or against the fix-ability of any game is a flight of fancy. Any bug can be fixed, with enough effort. The question is how much effort it would take to fix it and if it's worth the cost to fix it.
---
Well said, lets see how long it takes for Bethesda....erm i mean the so called Fanboi's to bury it.
---
Mine specifically at the Super Duper Mart in Watoga. Phoenix very rarely has it.
---
How hard is it to just apologize and admit you fucked up? I don't think it's hard at all.
---
The loot is randomised, and simultaneously it is not. I love the fact that if I need combat armor, I'm pretty much guaranteed to obtain some pieces from watoga high school. If I were farming particular piece of combat armor, I would be farming there.
---
I think that this would be nice if followed elsewhere. I'd love if certain regions had increased chance for particular loot, and preferences for given legendary prefix. I.e. you should get the armor piercing from raider areas, zealot from responders, two-shot from free states etc. Obviously these are just an examples, but I really loved if F76 became a game where you are distinctively rewarded for knowing the map and its quirks. Thats the wasteland I'd like to be pathfinder in!
---
I just kill him on sight now, because the scrap he drops is preferable to the useless irredeemable certificate he fills your note tab up with...
---
I always just store everything and when I move I re assemble all my walls and windows and what not into a new creation 
---
You know what I really want?  A ladder.  Then I do t need a massive set of stairs that is a pain to work around and doesn't click into place right ever.
---
I was on a server where a clan I assumed nuked fissure prime and killed the queen, then soon as the queen was down, nuked it again to restart the event. It worked. 2 dead queens in 15 minutes. Then a 3rd, I DC’d right after it dropped tho. But they placed the nuked off center so just the prime fissure was covered and we fought in unradiated area. Which was pretty sweet. 
---
Why? Because they mentioned it once as an example? 
---
Bethesda should fix there shit and treat customers with some respect.
---
You ever seen the stupidity curve where people who know slightly more than average suddenly gains confidence to think he knows everything?
---
This guy is the definition of that curve
---
Go to FO76 Bazzar Reddit and FO76 Market Reddit.  They sell there anywhere from 3,000-5,000 caps for 1 calibrated shock.  Even if you're desperate, don't pay anymore than 6,000.
---
If you need caps, start selling stuff there on those reddits.  I've gotten to the point where I don't even sell things at the vendors anymore.  Too easy to make caps on the reddit.  Made like 5,000 yesterday.
---
Can't wait to find the plans for the missile and laser turrets.
---
I got a lead pipe, some queen meat. And some other bits of ammo. It was... disappointing.
---
Sure kid, I like how you just start presuming stuff and making it up on the spot. I wonder what part made you start nerd raging lol.
---
Ah that sucks it didn’t work 😂 y’all are brilliant tho haha
---
Union uniform has one
---
I found it on a vender, 50+ levels ago, so I don't remember where.
---
Like Bethesda's ability to code apparently ; )
---
While I can understand being upset with the alleged server instability from people duping.  I can also see valid point for people who want to PVP and no cheating allowed types.  But their is a very diverse player population.  Not everyone wants the same thing.  I look at it like this.  A person paid for a product and they want to enjoy said product the way they want.  I don't see how I can try to impose the way I want to play on other people that also paid money for the product.  It seems to just be the nature of being online with other people with other agendas.  If it really bothered me I always have the choice to quit.  But I enjoy the product even with all of its frustrating times.  And if I go to work and I make my money.  Then why shouldn't I be allowed to spend my money on what ever I want.  I buy stuff for real money in game weekly because it's what I want to spend my money on.  I'm helping someone out with some money in their pocket just like when I purchased the game.  At least this is how I look at it.  I know we can never all agree and that's ok.  But when it's not fun you can always just hit the power button right? 
---
Thanks. I'll check it out.
---
I believe its not meant to be obtainable yet but someone got a hold of objects in a hidden dev area.  Something like that.  Don't really know the full details.
---
I've found 3 weapons with explosive perks on them in over 300 hours of gameplay and zero with two-shot and explosive...they are meant to be extremely rare. I have also bought two TSE guns...a pump which I loath and a lever which has become my go-to gun. Because I believe they were meant to be extremely rare and now basically everyone has one I would support the immediate destruction/nerf of any weapon with explosive on it. It would make me sad on one hand because of the ones I feel I earned through a shit-ton of gameplay, but I think it would be beneficial to the game in the long run. OP's post is 100% dead on accurate in my opinion. It really has ruined the challenge and in turn all I do is vendor hop looking for things to sell/trade etc.  
---
So as long as your under your build budget, you should be able to store everything that is currently built?
---
Ye i know lol! but whats the point of slap dmg when people can still 1 shot everyone even with PM on
---
The Race Wars of Atlas are real man, Chinese Zerg Clans hundreds if not a thousand men strong sailing in with as many galleons fully loaded as far as the eye can see late at night and knowing your 30 man group can’t do a damn thing as you get swarmed by meta character designs that are really short and dark skinned that camo into the darkness and bushes like freaking Ewoks.
---
They should have region locked the Chinese. They ruined the NA PVP server 
---
&gt; I'd say it's still quite rare to have shared stash across account. 
---
Really? I'd say it's quite common. I mean, yeah, there's no shared stash in Witcher 3, or No Man's Sky, because it really doesn't make sense with the way those games are set up. But the ones that are set up for unique "classes", and with loot-based gameplay loop, most do have it. 
---
See, I wouldn't be asking for shared stash if the game had an **actual** re-spec system. Where you press a button, all your SPECIALs and perks reset, and you build a character you want. No problem there. But going from a dedicated melee build to a dedicated pistols build is literally 60+ levels, and halfway through that your character becomes borderline unplayable, because it's not strong enough to melee any more, but not good enough to run on pistols either. Meaning, with the current system, it's far preferable, if you get a godroll legendary pistol and want to use it, to make an alt and pass him the weapon. Which is why we need the shared stash.
---
That's really another argument though. The whole re-spec thing. It's unsustainable. Eventually, be that lvl 999 or lvl 9999 or whatever, the game won't let you level up any more. And you won't  be able to respec any more. So the design of the current respec system already has a fatal flaw, it is a ticking time bomb. Not to mention we already broke the UI, which is designed to show 2-digit levels, once you go past lvl 99, the UI doesn't even display your level properly. So these devs couldn't think even that far ahead. Meanwhile we have legitimate players already past lvl 200.
---
The budget for your stored items will be the same at both camps. If you are worried about budget, you may want to go with a no turret build.  Those eat up so much budget and give little in return.  They're not PvP deterrents and random mobs wont spawn unless you or another player are in the area.
---
almost feel like its better without the screams ...you know for the more sensitive folks out there lol!  But yeah man...This is how you roleplay Fallout!
---
I'm not sure you need a plan for them unless maybe it's the artillery plan but not sure. Think u just need the perk cards. Home defense 3 and science 2 I believe 
---
Just a heads up, if you don’t find it the first time, server hopping is always an option.
---
And so it begins... trap houses... can you escape 
---
I dont even want to admit how many times i had to do the damn marksman test.  I was ANGRY.  I did it over several days.  Finally saw a video that explained my problem.
---
Xbox.  The lag was so bad the yellow diamonds stayed on the targets even after I shot them.  Just shoot once and keep moving...trust you hit it.  2 tries.  2 tries once I learned it was LAG and I was waiting on the game delay was making me thing I hadn't hit a target.  Also use a pistol.  I used a 10mm after wasting rifle rounds.
---
The agility course I did a couple times.  Swap between 1st and 3rd person views and see if it helps.  My 3rd person view is not centered properly.  I love 3rd person typically but can not use it with this game or all my movement and aiming is off center.  I mean about a foot off of where I think I will walk or hit or shoot in 3rd person.  In 1st person I ran the course twice and was ok.
---
I play with someone in their 60s.  He was about to give up but grinned this one day while the rest of us were offline.  He finally got it!  It took a pistol and switching views but he got it in about 1-2 hours after learning those tricks.   
---
I agree.  I hate these type 'quests'.  I hate timed quests period.  I put down assassins creed and never picked it up again after one game kept throwing those at me.  LOL
---
&gt; The odds are fairly high in the long run you will get 2x of a 2* legendary with the same rolls. And if you get one worth keeping such as a TSE. If you get a second one and want to hold onto it you’re basically screwed if you’re overweight.
---
between 2 characters you have 1,200 lbs of stash space, plus your carry weight.  I think you can find space for your two copies of the same weapon.
---
It's pretty simple, don't be overencumbered with duplicate legendaries.
---
At the moment, I hear a bunch of naysaying, but not one single, workable solution.
---
i don't know if i still have it, but i got mine from completing the event with the mr farmhands i think. what do you play on, if ur xbox i could check if i still have it and trade it later
---
I don't know about OP, but it did kinda open my eyes to the fact I was watching trend chasers and not real content creators.

But as YourMovieSucks has said in a lot of his videos, that's what great about the internet. You can filter what you see. If you don't like it, don't click it. The internet clearly isn't for everyone. :|
---
Extra Credits may be the greatest Gaming channel on YouTube, though (pluggo pluggo)
---
I hate melee too but I have a small bit of my build going to it. Saves on ammo when you're surrounded by ghouls.  
---
Laser weapons just aren't doing real damage it seems. Not sure why.
---
Because other weapons are better, melee is better still.  Just go with that, you'll soon see.
---
My only other advice is use the cards based on your level at the time and your style of play as it develops in F76 (It's different to the previous games).  Don't get hung up on it, if you rank up a card then later stop using it. You also might think about unlocking more cards than ranking one up fully.  A point in each rather than one to rank 3, kind if thing e.g. I don't need a rank 3 card for farming chems when I can craft all I need or find them out with Med Boxes.  So that card was good and now isn't needed.  Good luck and keep waving.

---
This. OP really doesn't get it. He just wants to take everything away from everyone for no reason. Tons of people have over encumbered mules chock full of legendaries because they enjoy hoarding stuff. 
---
Good lord dude you should have quit playing way before this rant consumed you when you own your own company you can make the bestest game ever 👍
---
The question is how do I claim my prize? I really want my car
---
Ummm would be great for duping and sales of said duped objects. I think its a great idea, but understand this will help dupers.
---
Are you Bob from Bob's Burgers?
---
This is some great feedback, thanks guys! 
---
Ah. I'll check tonight and see! Thanks!
---
Same here, someone data mined outfits and made a spread sheet. I plan on grinding events to get them. If I get any, I'll confirm it. Server hopped the tree house city, in the Mire, so many times but to no avail.

(talk aside, it's "unadulterated," which means about the same as "pure." Unadulterated greed means greed untouched by any other source.)
---
I've seen plenty of TSE Handmades for under 3k caps by dupers. Supply/demand is in full effect. If someone wants five figure prices, they are either greedy as fuck, or it's someone who doesn't know about the dupe economy. In either case, those who buy it at that price must value the item for that price, else they wouldn't buy it.
---
Sadly I’m on pc :( 
---
Yeah, when you dupe your way to 42,000 BASE damage, that "slap damage" hits like a nuke.
---
Tell me again why dupers shouldn't be banned?  Or, that you don't care because it doesn't effect you?
---
Fix this Bethesda. Way more important than PvP or atomic shop prices, canvas bags, plastic bottles or even increased stash limits.
---
I would have to disagree, for right now. Every time I kill the queen, it takes an average of 30sec-1min to do so. Everyone on the server jumps on the queen and kills it very fast. All I have to do is tag her; and other players as well. There needs to be something more challenging about the queen.  
---
Haha, well I don't Beth intended people to do 40,000 damage in one hit! Slap damage should cap out at 10 damage. Easy fix. 
---
silly question from me, but would it not be really difficult to spot a duped item, as you can normally add mods to it? 
---
Someone sells a duped TSE shotgun, someone else buys it, puts a scope, stock and barrel on it, would the game not think its 'different'
---
It takes about 10-15 min to launch a nuke. Why not launch your own? Also idk what system you are on but Xbox has a built in LFG that always has posts up to join a nuked zone. 
---
Are you not enjoying your Drills?
---
On console you are signed into your bethesda account every time you open the game, so as long as you log into that same account on PC everything will already be there. 
---
Yessssss
---
The e-peen
---
... Having walked into a trap base and just fast traveled away. I had a plan and it worked when punched in the mouth. People are just stupid now days.
---
Good point. I'll delete the turrets first and then store everything, pack up and move to the new spot.
---
Thanks. I also need to make sure I have enough caps. I heard it was expensive.
---
If the artillery plan is needed it's not hard to find at the watoga vendors
---
God this is absolutely brilliant. You are a master villain good sir 🦹‍♂️ 
---
Ahhhh, this makes sense.  Not that I would have enough ammo on me to survive two queens.  LOL.  
---
I'm not a victim in this case. Also, I'm a simple guy, I see someone bitching about a game they're not forced to play and comparing it to a game that they appear to enjoy, I give them a nudge in the right direction.
---
Yeah it's good as long as it's scaled to your level.
---
I use instigating weapons to clear mobs.  The first hit is double damage, so I one shot most things.
---
Yeah, you’re terrible haha. 
---
I want to tell everyone that the perfectly preserved pie is made with cream cheese.
---
200 years. Cream cheese.
---
Hmm I guess you're right. If your damage does come from perception or something. But again if you become dependent on weight reduction perks like I am. My stash is almost full, and I can only fast travel with all weight reduction perks and Excavator fully modded with calibrated shocks and motion-assist servos. In PvP I'm screwed. I can't sprint. My AP drains constantly. That is if I want to equip my damage and defensive perks and not be in Excavator arrmor. So now I'm over level 100, I have about 20 points in weight reduction perks, that could have been spent in damage and defense, and I have inventory management problems all the time. So I would advise not getting too dependent on them either way. They will just screw up your build and get  you into bad habits of carrying everything around with you all the time.
---
Everytime I play my game crashes 3-4 times just from opening menus (workbenches, vendors, stash box, etc.) within 30min. This big patch that they're planning needs to come soon cuz it's just getting too frustrating to play. 
---
Thanks man, I think I'll give the middleman a go, it sounds like the best solution at this moment in time.
---
i dont get any anyone builds at whitesprings unless its just a shell base with turrets. everything gets destroyed any time anyone nukes and you end up spending a ton fixing it all
---
Lol. A powered gate would out this over the top.
---
No way to open from the inside without a switch.
---
Yarrrrr!!!!
---
Exactly, and either or not Bethesda will isn’t something that players like us can know. I said that because I want people trying to stop people from asking for it to be fixed to shut the hell up themselves, because their reason is hogwash.
---
I stopped going there because too many people just sitting inside melee one-hitting everything.  I can equip my explosive shotty and one-hit everything, too, but it's just not as much fun.  
---
I enjoyed pulling them outside and letting everyone tag them and then killing them, but apparently that just doesn't happen anymore. 
---
My internet is amazing it’s a 5 year old fiber line.
---
I get right back on as soon as the home screen loads so it’s not the internet. I can also view my stats in my router and it shows my internet hasn’t went down.
---
I also get a few lock ups where the Xbox just restarts it self on its own.
---
Oh that’s actually interesting, thanks for the info, i need to grind some events too I think... me too, Server Hopped at every treehouse several times, didn’t find it. If I found more out, I’ll tell you
---
People play games differently.
---
I think it was an intentional nerf, to combat everyone farming Whitesprings. 
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits, you'll have a lot more luck there.  More TSE weapons are circulating.
---
If you're having issues with too much silver, just sell it to vendors? Not all junk materials need to be put into "bulk" to be saleable, silver is one such material. Most vendors will buy it for 2 caps each.
---
It really would save so much headache for us, and would stop the minor inconvenience imposed on random people/friends just so we can move one or two items between characters.
---
It's not a technical possibility at this point. Bethesda has openly admitted to no having to tools to modify in game content on an individual basis, nor track individual items and their attributes.
---
Aside from a complete wipe (which is possible, but unlikely) duped items are here to stay.
---
Haha I know!!!! I should have just taken the bulk 50 steel and left the rest.
---
Your idea is one of the worst I have ever seen
---
Ok - thanks!
---
They really need to re-balance PVP.  I can one shot just about anything on my melee build.  It's not skill, just click / dead, click / dead.
---
Hopefully they do a LOT of research and take in ALL the variables, then balance PVP so it takes skill to get kills.
---
ALWAYS carry salt with you so you can drop it in people's body bag after you loot it.
---
i have to server hop because im lvl 131 grinded legit my whole way, constantly help lvl 30s or below with quests/giving them stims and ammo. i have put many posts on market looking for T-60 reactive plates to no fruition. and when i did see the reactive plates i was lvl 60ish and didnt have the caps. the problem is lvl locked blueprint and not a wide enough loot pool at venders that forces people to do it. P.S. since sunday i have server hoped 13 hours tottal and still have found them. you find it boreing? dont do it and dont whine
---
One of us ;-)
---
It's rainin' bears!
---
Hey, move, will ya
---
Ahhhheeuggghhhhh
---
You should be able to cycle through using the D-Pad
---
It was used as an example, because it has a lot of items etc. Didn't see them suggest they enjoyed playing it themselves....seems more like an assumption you made tbh.
---
I’ll try moving to WiFi and see if that makes a difference. That sounds pretty backwards but it’s worth a shot.
---
And yet, still worth more than the fuck all you've proposed.
---
Raiders should never feel guilty
---
I apologize to you I thought you were someone else, Hell you didn’t write the Idiom but it was the people who ridiculed him for using it wrong that pissed me off
---
I'm on Xbox. Sometimes I want or NEED to change weapons while running away from enemies, and there is usually a chance that my hot swap glitches out. The wheel completely stops you in your tracks, sometimes selects the wrong thing,  all while you take damage from melee enemies running at you. The quick change button often forgets what I had as a secondary weapon, or switches to some random weapon. If I'm in power armor, I get the error message about switching to a weapon that can't be used while in the armor, even if it's another gun.. When a weapon breaks, the D-pad quick select breaks, and I have to go into the pip-boy to select something else.
---
Id like the D-Pad to be useful with a range weapon, close-up (shotgun), and melee. Even if they implemented a press-and-hold option, so that I can PRESS "up" to switch to whatever I store there, and HOLD "up" to bring up the emote wheel.
---
also your ingame name would be helpful so i dint give it to someone else
---
Nobody would farm White Springs if it was level locked to the forest....which is where it is located.  
---
Put the three stars back on the three stars!
---
I bet he has not played very long 
---
Yer dude looks like Randy Marsh.
---
yeah, thats not cool, but its the game, so go for it. personally, i would maybe take something i really needed and left the rest.
---
I spent quite a few levels on that ledge.  Ah, the blue lunchbox,  the stories you could tell
---
I got randy marsh vibrs
---
Unless its needed for a quest... drop them.
---
Im s3iks. And opening the game
---
I'm not sure this is factual.  If you are running plants, I would check to make sure you're not swelling in storage from crop.  I have a very large camp with a budget that has not been effected by leveling.
---
Indeed. Need my daily dose of fun time 
---
&gt; I get that BGS cant guarantee legendary weapons
---
They could, if they made it that way. And they should for the literal END GAME BOSS.
---
What I'm saying is, if I \*don't\* use the TSE gun, it feels like I may as well be shooting spitballs out of a straw.  But, TSE sucks when a bunch of vermin start running at you and you have to fumble with switching weapons, hope the next one is loaded, and then they're all right on you - sometimes doing more damage than 3 Scorchbeasts attacking you at once.    
---
Ghouls can be a particular pain in the ass, if you can't kill them before they charge, and they get you cornered because you can't afford to look where you are going when you frantically back away...  
---
Sure, if I specialized in Melee, then the whole game would be a cakewalk and so easy that it isn't even fun, that's not what I want, I want to be a Stealth/Sniper based character and I want to use my rifle 95% of the time.
---
The main problem is that rifles (other than legendary ones) are stupidly fucking weak compared to melee, and they have to jack up the armor/HP of the "fodder" type monsters to make them take more than one hit even from LOW level melee characters, they just smash right through and don't even worry.    
---
...this is genius!
---
It’s been my go to farming method, contest an owned shop. Take their loot then move on to the next one. I’ve become a pirate. But what else is there to do past lvl 100? 
---
But this guy in particular got to me. I mean who takes out all their junk to bulk it?
---
The power up X power plant events don't trigger until ... a customer clicks on the box to get power... ;)
---
i went directly to it one day and couldnt get it to start until i clicks the power box at the public workshop next to it
---
I'd just be happy if bodies/loot didn't disappear within seconds...
---
Well now he will know, do all your inventory management from the safety of your CAMP
---
I just wish we could hide them. There was a mod in fallout 4 (I can't remember which) that just stored all keys in a sub folder in the inventory called key ring. It was very clean looking.
---
Sarcasm isn't repeatedly coming back to a post and screeching in caps locks or calling people degenerates, and claiming something is exhausting. You can't cry about other people being too emotional and act like a child yourself.
---
I need to build somthing that  Look Like this!  Ty for the idea!  
---
Don’t forget to swap to power armor when they ask to speak to a manager. 
---
My bad, you're right. 
---
Oh the multiplayer has more now but on release there was about the same amount to do. 
---
Duping is not cheating. If the game allows it then they are able to do it. It's on Bethesda for not testing and fixing before release not on the dupers
---
You did this to be mean and you accomplished your goal. 
---
1. Make room in your stash to get your junk items off you.  Grab weapons, armor, meds, whatever it takes to unload the junk back into your stash.
---
2. Fast travel to Vault 76 (it's free).  See if anyone shows up there to kill you.
---
3. If not just fast travel to different groups of players (2-3 player groups) and ask them to kill you.
---
this is actually the truth though
---
Look another youtuber shill
---
So rather then wait and learn about the game you bought it right away? You are the perfect customer for game companies.
---
My assumption is that you either haven’t been playing long enough to have a mule or you don’t understand the use behind having a mule when you farm every day. I have 3 regular characters and 2 mules. 2 of my main characters are over 100 and stash is bleeding into inventory. One mule has countless legendary items and is completely overweight. One mule for my junk that I keep a bunch of bulk on as well as stable flux (which let me remind you weighs 1lb a piece). Not one single workable solution? Do you even understand how the glitch works? There is a workable solution. Fix the disconnect, or don’t allow over 254 of an individual item to be dropped at a time. How is that not a workable solution? Maybe you should understand the problem before offering a solution. 
---
Without a unique identifier, drop location or asinine code behind the scenes there would be no way, modded or unmodded, to tell apart dupe and non dupe items.  Quantity of an item is the only feasible way to identify dupes and even then isn't 100%, at best legendary weapons with the exact same roll that a player has in excess of 10 coule have extras removed or limit material stack sizes to 9999 since at best 1% of the playerbase might legit have over those quantities.
---
We need content, not the patch.
---
There is nothing keeping anyone in this game once they’ve explored and killed the queen a few times.
---
Hey man, war, war never changes 
---
I've been pushing this idea for months, created several posts about it, including one yesterday. Really hope they do it.
---
I wish I had more than one upvote to give ya. 
---
Just the normal charging barrel, I use the shotgun charging and it's fine, the auto and semi-auto were fine as well.
---
yikes; i thankfully didn't have that... maybe a X01 Bright ... painful still.
---
&gt; I for my part like good games and... yeah, that's why i don't play any Bethesda titles. 
---
Did you read any of this or just jump on the first opportunity to get your opinion out?
---
How to warn new players:  
---
&gt; Try door, then bonfire 
---
Well I did it to farm steel and didn’t want to server hop.  What happened after was a mistake that I feel guilty about 
---
Appreciated!
---
I want to play a character that's heavily focused on stealth/rifle - why does everyone act like that's stupid and lame?  That's what is FUN.  I also like to play TEKKEN or Skyrim, if I want melee. 
---
If I was gonna focus on Melee, I'd be terribly disappointed with Fallout 76 - melee weapons are so stupidly overpowered the game isn't even FUN.  Also, you should be able to actually \*swing\* your sword or such, not just mash a button.  There was a great melee sword fighting game years ago called Die By The Sword - where you actually controlled your sword/arms, etc.  They really "dumb down" melee attacks in games like Skyrim and Fallout(s).
---
Yes, I'll have a cheeseburger, thank you.
---
This defines me and my girlfriend when she finds a new outfit in the game lol
---
Imgur is however just like the trolls/haters in this sub. Over here they seem to have given up on their pointless crusade against people having fun so I gather that Imgur will shortly follow.
---
Yeah from now on that’s what I’m gonna do
---
God damn Mr.Prizebot, I don’t want anymore pre-war money!!
---
I had a chameleon armor in my inventory but not equipped at all. My character died afk. When I came back, my character now turns invisible when sneaking even though I don't have any armor/effect that would make it happen. I had to equip and unequip that armor to have the effect go away.
---
If you're finding an area too tough, go back down to a lower zone and grind a few more levels.
---
Also make sure you're farming Whitesprings Nukes to get some decent legendary weapons.  For guns you're looking for anything that's two shot, explosive, or anti-armor.  For melee weapons you want instigating, bloody, furious, or anti-armor.
---
Crafted weapons are ok, but to get the damage increases you need, you have to start getting better legendaries.
---
Once again, you're complaining about known game mechanics because you don't want to alter your play style. You can easily change weapons, engage the existing marsupial/bird bones method of jump shooting or simply kite. 
---
The game shouldn't change simply because you can't accept realism.
---
Its not really rushing to get caps, with perks im usually up 30-50 purified water, up over a 100 chems and have junk for days, in a couple hours of play. There are certain items like screws/springs/gears that Im always looking for junk that breaks down into it, you also get other junk than just what you want. Im also always picking up aluminum + tin + copper junk/scrap as they sell really well when bulked. I also hit all ore nodes I find in the wild exploring.
---
So its more just an inventory management thing for me, sure I could just drop the items. But honestly my loop costs 42 caps, takes 4 fast travels, takes less than 20 minutes and I rake in 1400 caps and possibly find some mods/plans I dont have. It takes no server hopping and next to no effort.
---
I can also take the option to walk and explore and it takes about 2 hours to do my loop and costs under 20 caps.
---
Also a lot of the weapons that drop off of lvl 60+ mobs go for pretty good coin, especially modded levers and handmades. I got 112 caps for one modded lever yesterday. If Harpers Ferry spawns high lvl super mutants I can almost get enough drop off them to zero all 7 vendors.
---
🎼We’re going on a trip to a place called Auschwitz🎼
---
I almost never run out of steel.. but because I had a surplus of lead, i was able to make a ton of bullets... bad mistake.. but also bad bug :)
---
Implement carry weight damage, that racks up for X amout of weight per Y capacity. People a little over should be fine. People way out of their means 10,000+, bye bye.
---
This is the best thing I have seen in this game so far! Made my day! This is hilarious!
---
I disagree. Someone proposed they just wipe everyone. That was the worst. 
---
Have fun getting robbed by others - the collaboration in this game from a trading perspective is totally geared towards profiteering.  You could easily end up buying duped items if you trade with others.
---
The game was not designed for the long haul - it has bad RNG mechanics in place that's just the carryover vendor system used in previous games.  That's why people server hop (equivalent of the old save scumming people would do in other games from Bethesda).  Some people are so gullible assuming the game is well designed in every aspect.  SMH!
---
The endgame is terrible, there is really no meaningful endgame, and without that, there is no such this as a game designed for the long haul.  Its just an artificial grind that's meaningless and not satisfying for certain things...  but once you do the quest stories and try out the various events, you've essentially completed the game.
---
Fun fact: They copied the announcement from the Nov 21st inside the vault,
---
Mod was sold by vendor. Your point is?
---
Agreed!  You’ll get lots of hate for it here, but 100%.  So disappointing.  Very much hoping other studios capitalize on the vacuum left by Beth, it’s competition that makes decisions in favor of the player that will put the nail in the coffin.
---
Really hoping outer worlds is good, for example
---
The only way to tell is if they have multiples of rare weapons in inventory when they trade (saw a guy doing that). If they have one on hand and the rest in stash or on a mule (seen that too), there is no way to know.
---
10/10, quality entertainment.
---
so if i have 30 explosive shot weapons it is ok ? duper detected
---
I found calibrated shocks in the wild.  I'm terrified to keep playing because of the risk of loosing them. 
---
Are the Assaultrons friendly?
---
I want rifles not to be weaker than melee attacks - that's just fucking stupid and makes me sad.
---
A Two Shot (non-explosive) Anti Armor Double Ammo (3 star?) Legendary Lever Action Rifle is probably about the only weapon that would make me really satisfied with my character beyond how fun it was playing the early/mid levels from level 15 - level 45.  (The rifles "felt right" in that range of my character - not OP and not too weak).
---
No problemo. A little bit of bad news is that the reward rate for an outfit is like 1/35. So we may have a long road ahead of us.

You can’t rent it on PC
---
Overstated really.   
---
My group is over 300 strong, and the Chinese are really really bad at pvp.  
---
That said, they do kill the latency of any zone they enter. There needs to be ping and region locks for performance for sure.  
---
Also they tend to attack small groups, so try merging with a larger company. There's a lot of hatred toward the chinese because of that. 
---
Yeah, I have three characters, two regulars, one mule, I've played for over 200 hours, and do you want to know how many duplicate weapons I've found worth keeping? 
---
0.
---
So, if you want me to pretend that duplicate legendary weapons are a problem for everyone, sorry, but I just don't buy it.  Even if I had found duplicates worth keeping, I sure wouldn't be carrying both on my at the same time.
---
That's all well and good that you are talking about junk, I don't care about duplicated junk, I don't care about duplicated aid, and I don't care about duplicated ammo.  The problem in this game right now is with duplicated weapons, and with characters breaking the carry limit.
---
&gt; Maybe you should understand the problem before offering a solution. 
---
I am terribly sorry that you don't see that you are part of the problem.
---
I might be alone, but I still think tactics has always been under rated. It came with the original special edition bag set. Still have that and the old install disks around somewhere
---
Also let me note. I have no issue with them wiping duplicates of an individual item once to delete all of the duplicates across accounts. But to make this a permanent solution is extremely stupid and would cause a bigger uproar in the community than the current duping situation. 
---
this seriously...leave that shit and bulk it from STASH
---
If someone uses an in-game exploit to create items, it’s not cheating. 
---
It’s exploiting.  Still bad, but not technically cheating.  They aren’t changing code or save files or using a program.  They’re just using the in-game mechanics to their advantage.
---
I say this as a someone who can’t stand dupers and is fully against it.  But cheaters are to blame for their cheats.  Whereas Bethesda is to blame for exploits.  And also, if people are willing to pay real money for something in game, the problem will persist.  
---
Why do you think micro transactions still exists?  Because people buy them.  Just like why grocery stores put candy and chips by the checkout line.  Impulse buying.  The blame is also with the consumer.  If they feel like they NEED an OP weapon to have fun with the game, they should play something else.  
---
Again just stating that this isn’t a CHEAT.  Just an exploit that some more thorough beta testing and play testing could have fixed 
---
Not the only location that you can get it though, possibly the most reliable.  
---
Between Census Violence and Distant Thunder, i think you can get majority of the plans in the game and are most worth the time doing them.
---
No it was not a mistake, your post is perfectly clear. You attached someone, took all his stuff and walked away. And after that you probably dumped all the stuff you didn't need, which was a lot by your own words, and thus stole stuff only to throw it away. That's what bullies do, being mean because they can.
---
If you see this on the Prime Fissure most likely it was a team doing queen grinding.  Drop one nuke, kill the queen, drop another nuke, get another queen.
---
Whitesprings double nukes are just trolls.  Get everyone in there with the first nuke (they come in to farm legendaries) then drop another nuke to kill them all for the grins.  Most of the time people see the second nuke warning and leave, but you'll always have a few noobies that don't understand a second nuke is coming in.
---
I need plastic and steel (as much as possible) shadow combat armor leg and chest plans, tick blood or blood packs. Great service BTW. 
---
Maybe. 😁 we shall see. There is downvoted on the oddest things sometimes. But I enjoy the content and try to not get wrapped up in internet karma bs.  Still like how does someone downvote a puppy?  LOL

I'm sure Bethesda appreciate the blind loyalty though!

...and then I made sure to have a handful of salt on hand for whenever I loot someones body bag
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking but someone said it worked for them I'm on wifi and never have problems

If you could only see how much I look like my character. Haha it’s unreal. However since Christmas, I do have a full beard now.

My wife always says that the iPhone emoji with the bearded man could be my drivers license picture.

But I can totally see Randy Marsh now. That’s great. One more character I look like. 
---
True they are bad but when it’s sheer numbers, it doesn’t matter how bad they are you can kill like 20 of them single handedly sure but they will kill you and run off with your shit since they mostly come at you naked.

Do you have a time frame? PM me please?

The Anti Armor Explosive dream! I'd love to get my hands on a Handmade with that, I see a lot more people making the switch and dropping TSE, to be honest I'm not a big fan of the accuracy drop with 2 shot.
---
It's okay if you played the game and got it. All this whining about dupers does nothing. Bethesda said they can't track it and that's understandable because they're just exploiting bugs NOT CHEATS bugs. 
---
sold
---
Yeah I can only imagine what it's like with a mirv mod
---
Team up with someone (anyone) and share Rad Sponge perk. Eliminates rads.  Game changer.
---
I don't want to set the world on fire. . .
---
Right? When I get over a hundred of something I bulk it and sell it. Unless it's a material I use a lot of, But then I never really get over a hundred of those...because I'm always using them.
---
SBQ should drop something fucking awesome. We (well me and my friends anyway) spend a LOT of time and mats getting ready for a SBQ fight. It's a big deal to some of us. we die a few times , we plug her with a LOT of hard earned lead, she should give us something decent. Seriously right now all I kill her for is her heart and liver
---
I can vouch that the one reoccurring blue screen I got on my PC while playing Fallout was actually due to an update to the Windows Security Network Monitor not agreeing with our of date Wireless drivers. It always triggered when playing Fallout 76, but that's likely because of the increased network utilization. Once I updated my wireless drivers the problem went away.
---
Idk what u got 
---
If that's true that would be so mean! Although you would have to out heal the combined DPS of multiple players.
---
Uranium Fever has 3 legendaries 
---
&gt; get the most commonly duped items
---
&gt; A lot of people will lose out on a handful of things 
---
Pick one.
---
This looks awesome. If they would put interesting cosmetics like this on the atom shop I would buy it.
---
I have been forgoing those Huskies for a while, got a bit fed up with all the point whoring by the owner. But normally I only press upvote buttons for everyone ;-)
---
The thing with events (with the exception of a couple, like patrol duty) they reward a "random plan" according to the  official guide. The loot pool is so huge that you could get just about anything from them. My advice would be that if there is an event nearby do them. Especially if they are Distant Thunder or Census Violence.
---
I mean I just hope he learned a lesson and didn’t rage quit. When I say he had junk I mean bulk stacks of at least 20 of every type of junk. Must have taken weeks to get that much stuff.
---
I tried to message him after and apologize but his privacy settings wouldn’t allow me too.
---
I've seen them on /r/fo76bazaar, and while a couple have asked for those sort of silly prices, I just keep looking. The 5 figure quoters are either stupidly hopeful or grossly out of date with their prices (they were that priced... before the dupers showed up).
---
Personally... I'd rather the stupid high prices and no dupers than super low prices with dupers, but I'm a responsible capitalist, which is about as common as hen's teeth.
---
That's a known hop spot for the plans that can spawn there. Nice find, though.
---
Endangerol doesn't work right now
---
I got it on one of my first scraps
---
Pretty sure I got it in the mire there either doing Enclave quests early, or it was a random event in the mire while I was doing the Enclave quests. I know I was near that tree village when I got it. On PC. 
---
sucks to be him haha
---
feel bad all you want, but you played the game
---
This is why I just let people take over workshops if they want. Not worth this hassle. 
---
TSE already ruins the game by making it too easy - except that I seem to keep fucking up and blowing myself up at the worst times, when I'm far into a quest inside a building, and I have to respawn back at the start.  
---
Two Shot Lever Action Rifle (without Explosive) and Double Ammo capacity (at least 10 shots) would be \*IDEAL\* for making the game fun, now that I'm high level.  The guns that I could craft such as the .308 Sniper Rifle (w/Suppressor and Long Recon Scope)  were almost perfectly balanced when my character was in the range from levels 15 - 45.  As long as I played well, I could use stealth and take out all the enemies from a distance.  Usually one shot kills as long as I got headshots.  That didn't feel OP, because I had to be careful how I approached areas, and find good placement to be able to take them out from a distance.  If I got careless and stumbled into a big group, I'd be dead.
---
They won't get more than a carbine with 10 rounds and fur armor. Oh well. If I am carrying anything valuable while the chinese horde invades, that's kind of on me. We can zerg with torches too if it comes to that, and we would win that fight.
---
Pretty much, if they bring out 4 star legendaries before fixing this. It'll dependently show they don't give a crap.
---
Yup. Unless someone says something really crappy to someone I just ignore and move on if I don’t like something. 🤷‍♀️🧸 
---
I have asked for this before and was met with a small amount of reddit resistance. I still think it is a great idea.
---
All good. That’s the risk you take when you carry around an absurd amount of junk without stashing it first. 
---
Someone has twenty thousand TSE shotguns? Ban away for all I care. Someobody bought one of those, and haven't seen anything obviously sketchy  (like an inventory with twenty thousand TSE weapons) - If you want to remove their account too, then you want Bethesda to kill their own game for the sake of your own feeling of righteousness, and you wouldnt be righteouss at all. Please clarify in your post.
---
.25 a round? Wow.  That's an expensive hobby. 
---
They are weightless
---
^ Fucking this, every bloody time!  lol
---
I didn't like New Vegas. It was an absolute mess filled with bugs and stupid decisions.
---
But I didn't go to their forums to say how much I disliked it and bashing those who enjoyed it (that weren't so many when it first came out).
---
This isn't about hate. It's about being smart enough to learn to move on.
---
I'll check on my apt if I have an extra. Well if your on xbox
---
I just pack the right side of the wheel with melee weapons and frantically grab a new one at random when the current one breaks.  This game forces you to simplify to the point of minimalist theater.
---
I also wish they'd stop with the "it's easy to fix" garbage. If it was easy, they would have done it. No business would pass on an easy fix for a major problem. Nobody there is being *lazy*.
---
I suspect the "support" programmers are few while the "content" programmers are many, because content folks can be redirected elsewhere as needed, but that's just my opinion and not provable.
---
If you're on PC the 12345, etc keys are hotkeys to the wheel items.  I never use the wheel anymore, just mash 1, 2, or 3 to switch melee weapons, 4 to go to my gun, 5 and 6 are food and water, 7890 are meds.
---
I took his stuff because it’s there for the taking. Not giving it back after realizing the amount of stuff he had was a mistake that I clearly feel guilty about.
---
For the record I kept the steel and donated the rest to a random player. Which is why I walked across the map instead of dumping it to fast travel.
---
So you want to know the solution to all this after the duping is finally fixed. You guys ain't going to like this suggestion, but the only way I know how to fix it is to expunge the explosive legendary perk from the game. 
---
2 shot is fine, but if they want to start fresh after they know duping can no longer be done, get rid of the explosive weapons perk. Honestly do we really even need it? I would rather see more weapons like the perfect storm, or a long range cryolator type weapon. Explosive weapons have hurt this game severely.
---
Why do you have a demon for a character
---
Dude. She’d be so pissed.  She definitely talks about those when she’s in the nuked area and how rare they are. 
---
Just got a mini gun....I've been using a primed out quad explosive double barrel.
---
I found some graffiti on some concrete near a river that said ❤❤Darmok + Jilad❤❤
---
In beta? Because I think back then it spawned in the mire but sadly it doesn’t anymore from what I’ve heard
---
I'm sorry, but even if it is supposed to be super tough radioactive mutant giant cricket, it should still go \*SPLAT\* if you shot it with a .50 BMG sniper rifle.  If not just splat, well, at least have a pair of big holes where the bullet went in, then out, with the insides scrambled so the thing is dead, twitching because the legs still move when the body is dead...
---
an in game mail might work, powered by mr handy
---
oh and hopefully well get more feedback from bethesda other than "great idea" idk, im just salty because most of the ideas or things people want can be found in other games already, but bgs decided not to implement anything besides 5 ish main questlines
---
It isn't, you can tell its go up to 5 stars, we are only at three.
---
there are two ways to play in my mind.
---
1) aggressive (with the firepower to back it up), and the game encourages this with perks.
---
2) friendly (within reason as stated above). I prefer this, since making friends/groups is more fun than everyone after you for your evil deeds ;)
---
Less range, more...explosions.

Didn't he say like 10 videos ago he was quitting fallout 76?
---
No it was about 2 weeks ago. But, Its possible I have it confused with the Forest operative under armor too. 
---
I think when you sleep with a 2SE Shotgun you should be fine.
---
The combat armor plans are kinda iffy but the rest is easy. 
---
I honestly just want items deleted tbh. That solution could end up hurting users who had duped items on accident, like me, who accidentally duped another set of uktracite(?) T-51b armour, which I dumped in a scorched beast spawn so no one would be able to use the armour I unfairly got.
---
Your ontology is fuckin weak
---
"Welcome to Flavor Town" - Ghoul Fieri, 2076
---
I see Whitesprings double nuked fairly often but doesn't appear to do anything more.
---
oh, ok. good luck
---
Need a key ring for all keys. Been able to pick the same key multiple times is annoying...
---
Canned and boxed goods don’t have that
---
There *should* be an update from Bethesda today detailing some idea of what to expect coming up soon.
---
Also, consider farming until scorchbeast are easy too. Makes running near fissures a lot less frustrating.
---
Spouses are the best! My Husband built me a "Lady Lair" in our house where I have my comfy recliner chair and my XBox. He plays COD in the living room and I play 76 in my Lair!
---
Numerically, yeah. But with how the damage reduction works the difference is almost unnoticed.
---
Hell, my 600+ heavy metal armor feels about the same as my 400s marine armor and sure as hell I can tell you which one looks cooler!
---
But you'd have to pay &gt;5k pre war money for the scrap since the voucher clearly states that you pay for any storage fees and you'd probably be 25 years overdue for picking it up
---
You keep failing to realize your getting less content for the same price with each game the company releases. And like other fallout games you have unique vaults to explore when the game came out now they adding them later and say the atom store is paying for them which means you being charged more to add something they included with the $60 game originally. 
---
LOL YESSSS... More of these videos XD. Keep up the good work \*Evil work and share future deeds of chaos! Rose definitely approves this!
---
It's not ridiculous when they sell them and crash the entire economy
---
No to all of that... lol what?
---
I agree maxed out obsoletes radaway and rad x
---
Dupers are not players. They are just a bunch of pityful losers who can't even make money without hurting other people. They are only here for the money, and once the dupe bug is foxed they will flee to any other bugged game to continue their dirty little business. They are simply illegal dealers. They are not gamers. They don't play this game. You can't possibly hurt the playerbase by removing people who are not playing the game. So please stop telling this "hurting the playerbase" nonsense.
---
You have a 300 man clan from what you said. You’d be able to Zerg pretty effectively and stave off the great Chinese invasions.
---
The clan I was with were among the first to get off the starter islands and into the world but we dissolved weeks later due to people insiding the base and killing our ships before they were constructed and of course the Zerg clans. We had a holdout island because and English speaking Zerg clan had ALL the islands around us and tolerated our existence to one little island 
---
While you're waiting on an official fix, there are [unofficial solutions to some of the issues you face.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144) It's not the same, but it does help, especially after a big fight where there's been time for bodies to convert to loot piles.
---
It's a one in a million shot...
---
"So you're saying there's a chance!?"
---
Isn’t that how you get HyperAIDS though?
---
I have 5 Penitentiary Keys I can't drop =\
---
The right way to deal with current meta weapons being in terrible shape is not to remove items. On the contrary, what you should do in such situation is, obviously first stabilise the situation (fix the damned duping), and then add new weapons.
---
TSE weapons too common and too strong? Add common armor perk that negates a lot of explosive damage, and add new type of "explosive" (i.e. acidic). Now TSE, while still acceptably useful, is not meta anymore, and the demand decreases.
---
And you know what? Bethesda knows that, and you can clearly see it by the fact that 5th legendary slot is something without any practical use as of now. My bet is we will see duping removed sooner or later, but we won't see the 5th star until that happens. 
---
I was hearing that a shotgun vats build is great for crippling scorch beasts. Not 100% sure the best way to build a character around that though
---
Yeah I still like to play aggressive, yesterday I contested the ammo yard and it turned into a friendly 3v1 pvp match for about an hour.
---
In the end we laughed, gave each other’s loot back and traded some plans. It was a great experience.
---
But yeah moving forward it’s just lead, steel and springs I’ll be taking... unless you cuss me out over the mic ...then I might take it all 😜
---
What? Where is this?? That’s awesome 
---
Yes,but you need to wear a cowboy hat, and answer to the name Slim Pickens. 
---
true, i get the difference you try to make. 
---
i someon further down suggested to raise max weapon level after fixing the exploit, seems pretty solid logic
---
Every enemy in the game is an npc
---
10mins
---
Yesterday and the day before was like this constantly on Xbox. I've really gotten into the end game now and it's a ton of fun, but that shit pulled me out of it fast. No idea if it was duping or nukes
---
So there is hope for you yet...
---
Fine, I'll call the nukes back!
---
(From my viewpoint your original post does not at all make it sound like you feel guilty, more like a I'm such a bad boy harhar post)
---
PC purists give me shit for it but I play the fallout and elder scrolls games with a controller.
---
Yeah I don't like the look of marine....not a fan of the heavy combat tbh...but the light looks great with brotherhood fatigues and marine tactical helm
---
You can sort by spoil time. A timer would still be a great QOL change though.
---
It’s weird, I would think its energy weapons 
---
Ah that explains it, thanks. Wish it would say the right price tho :/
---
Another good think is if you log out and in with Excavator you get a bonus 100 carry weight. Sometimes bugs are good.
---
So... let’s say I find a guy with three, two shot explosive shotguns...
---
He may have duped he may have not duped them.
---
I say let him keep those.
---
Than I find another guy with a 100, two shot explosive shotguns.. think about the odds of someone finding 100 of those SPECIFIC attributes....
---
Wipe out that mans duped items.
---
I would love to see someone try to argue with me that it’s possible to find 50+ of the same legendary item.
---
In the time I have played I found one two shot explosive minigun and traded it for a two shot explosive Gatling gun.
---
[Pssst.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144)
---
It's really not a hassle. It's just really new to me with only 3 hours on PC. I just wasn't sure if I missed something and was doing it wrong.
---
Are you on console?  If so, there have been some patches but unfortunately each patch seems to create as many issues as it fixes.  Server stability also remains in the toilet.  It's fun as long as you don't mind an app crash every hour and having to redo the last 10 minutes of whatever you were doing but minus all the ammo and stimpacks you had to start with.
---
For me, it's easier to hit once it lands.
---
The ones that are super gamebreaking like TSE weapons and syrums and nuka colas since they are a huge source of caps for the dupers
---
The game 'works' for the most part now. Still alot of random disconnects and occasional crashes but the worst of them seem to be gone. There is no end game. Hit level 50 and all there is to do is daily quests and hope for enough server cooperation to kill the Queen. Otherwise, you're just a senior citizen in Vegas pulling that slot handle hoping for a better doubleshot gun. 
---
Personally, I'm entertained still but just keeping myself busy until Anthem.
---
You don't think shitting on people for enjoying something they paid for is worth at least a raised eyebrow?
---
He popped out of player's house at one point, screaming "I'VE FINALLY FOUND YOU!" to my friend. 
---
I swear to god, he's determined.
---
I mean, same here. Make my own ammo, bulk all of my excess to sell, scrap the weapons I can’t sell that day for steel...I honestly don’t have too many problems. The only thing I keep in my stash that I rarely use is a missile launcher, and the ammo for it. I could sell it and save space, but it’s fun to use every now and then.  
---
i agree something similar to how borderlands did it, a locker in a common area 
---
I've been in three Queen fights and none of them have given me a legendary... except once when I technically did and got a Mutant Slayer's Lead Pipe. But still.
---
Beam focuser? Is this one of those mods that you have to get lucky on finding?
---
Borderlands 2 did this and I think it was marvelous.   Yes please.   
---
Okay - I don't know the salt thing. What's up with that?
---
And in what universe would that not be lore breaking?
---
Don’t forget bird bones and a JP then you won’t need to bring it down in the first place 
---
I think your experience is atypical. Seems the more people there to fight, the harder she is. I’ve fought her four times and lost once with a gang of people. The other times were no guarantee and CERTAINLY not completed in 1 minute. 
---
Reading my post again, I realised I sound angry and condescending. Sorry for that. Not the intention. 
---
Oh, hmm I can see that. 
---
I am mostly just worried he quit the game for good. He didn’t deserve it though it is a gameplay mechanic and a risk you take being in a public workshop with ALL of your loot on you. I think it was mostly that he quietly accepted his defeat and logged off that really hit home for me. I did try and send a message to him prior to donating but his privacy settings didn’t allow for it.
---
So they're cicadas? 
---
I've not had a BSOD on PC at all, although I've had numerous crashes.
---
Software can and does cause BSODs. If it's not universally experienced then it can come down to the software being incompatible with certain drivers/hardware.
---
I have regular instigating gauss I think. 
---
I'm already discarding most of my loot: countless gear, legendaries and meds.  When it comes to scrap, I find it hard to determine what items are using up capacity and which resource I might need for future builds or repairs.
---
It may just be me, but the seems to boil down to killing mobs and discarding their loot. 
---
(1) - (+/=) on your keyboard quick swaps? Does anyone actually mouse around on that wheel to pick items? 
---
I think anyone should he able to loot any body whether or not they attacked it, but maybe only get XP if you are within 10 metres of the kill if you didnt attack it
---
It's really not a hassle. Just different. Only having 3 hours in on PC. I wasn't sure if I had missed something or was doing it wrong.
---
Right, but: When I have ten mutfruits in inventory, they all have different conditions, but I only see one CND bar.  The CND bar that I see might not be the one that's closest to spoiling.   
---
I also have a sneaking suspicion that when one of those mutfruits spoils, all ten of them do at the same time.  But I don't have any evidence to support this.
---
&gt;  He just wants to take everything away from everyone for no reason
---
I literally only want to delete duplicate legendary weapons from overencumbered characters.
---
You're definition of "everything" is flippant, at best.
---
Level 45 ?
---
Max level 
---
it capped at 100% and multiplicative. multiflicative but not reducing efficiency. 
---
I've adapted but it doesn't mean I find the "has anyone found a crafting bench" and "let's break for 20 minutes to manage our inventories" fun gaming loops.
---
Also it would definitely remove some of the fun of the game. Inventory management is part of the game you hoarder.
---
So Ana from overwatch? 
---
Over 200 hours, multiple characters.  Guess you lost that bet?
---
Nothing crazy was added. Some bug fixes and camp improvements was pretty much it.
---
I once used the float thing to fly up above the nuke at Whitesprings. I also lead the SBQ around while smacking it in the face, it was highly confused how I was melee it in the face while it flew around and kept backing up.
---
Depending on the price i might be interested ^^
---
I've only had 1 out of 20 or so queen fights where she didn't die. I think you should check the map and make sure most players are very high level before dropping a nuke. Anyone over lvl 70 will be there because they have nothing left to do.
---
This [guy &amp; friends did over 500 maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abwh1x/psa_treasure_maps_arent_that_great_treasure_map/), and no evidence of legendaries:
---
&gt; Here are our results:
---
&gt; * Loot primarily consists of weapons, armor, ammunition, and junk items. None of the weapons or armor had unique characteristics or legendary affects so their only real benefit would be to scrap to learn components.
---
&gt; * Mods are also a possible drop, although they do seem to be rarer and only consisted of weapon mods during our testing. Most mods are of no notable value with barbed walking canes and other cheap mods being very common, although we did receive a few powerfirst heated coils and deathclaw gauntlet additional claws.
---
&gt; * Power armor plans for upgrades and individual parts do drop. We received x1 T-45 torso, x- T-45 right leg, and x1 T-60 left arm plans. Plans for upgrades dropped for raider, T-45. T-51b, and t-60 power armor variants although hydraulic braces and rusty knuckles were the most common.
---
&gt; * C.A.M.P plans are very common as well. By the end of it we had well over 100 to distribute although they mostly seem to be common ones such as wooden stools although some "rarer" ones such as barn building set did drop.
---
&gt; * Weapon and armor plans seem to be the most common plans to drop. We did not received individual armor part plans, but we did receive individual weapon plans and components for both.
---
I only server hop for bugged quests where I'm sent to kill a creature that's already dead, to find a server where it's still alive, or when the server I'm on becomes unstable.
---
I feel like 1.5 is fair 
---
I used to do that, but it crashed my game when I hit too many too often. 
---
I server-hop when I stumble upon new location, only to find it already cleared-out from mobs and loot or filled with low-level mobs just because a low-level player just went nearby or some player is already present.
---
Simply, I want to explore a location for the first time untouched by other players. And I prefer to read all the notes/terminal undisturbed by power armors stomping around.
---
On PS4, you can favorite them and sort them in the quick selection wheel. “Up” button. They will have to be different damages or conditions tho. 
---
Underrated gun

I’m not part of the problem. Idiots offering stupid solutions who have no clue how the dupe works is the issue. Then offering solutions that penalize the community as a whole is even dumber. If you haven’t found anything worthwhile keeping 2 of you haven’t ran near enough to even have this be an issue for you. I run nukes daily farming queen and whitesprings. Well over hundreds of hours of gameplay between 2 characters that are over 100 and another gaining traction to being over 100 by the end of the week. Have you done any community trading? Do you run with other players? I run with a group of 9+ people at a time. We have plenty of duplicates between us. Whether is be from one of us buying the other items or stashing items for another players alt. Why care if your character is overweight if you know you aren’t playing that character currently? And that when you log back onto that character nothing will disappear? If you play solo, cool. If you run in larger groups like we do this is a stupid idea. I’m terribly sorry you clearly have no clue how the duplication glitch works and that you’ve offered a quiet honestly stupid solution which is clearly displayed by everyone’s reaction. But before you try to offer a solution you should do more research and you would clearly see other ways this could be fixed. I’m sure they are going to wipe dupe characters. Which us in the community who have no duping characters will be fine with. But if I have to remember to empty my shit every time I log in and out? That is dumb. What happens if you dc right after getting something you wanted and god forbid it be something you already have in your weapons inventory? Or ultimately get the blue screen after picking it up? This does effect me because I’m constantly trade for my guys and constantly helping my friends progress by getting them what they want even if I have it. If I have to worry about losing something because I’m buying from the guy who has the same thing I do that my friend wants, that is incredibly dumb. 
---
You don't need junk on you to repair. Repairs look into your stash box if you don't have the mats on you.
---
I guess he should have made a stash box. But yea, I personally wouldn't have taken anything but it reminds of a quote. 
---
&gt;But did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?  
---
*Ned Flanders*
---
You killed him (ok), took the workshop (that's cool), then you took his stuff (salting the earth). 
---
God like
---
Could you hold it for like 2 hours while i finish this movie? 
---
Can I play gta rdr2 without multiplayer issues yes can I play 76 without multiplayer issues no.
---
I won’t be on today but I’ll be on Tom^^
---
You flew ABOVE the nuke?!!! Jesus how far could you see?
---
I won’t be on till later tonight anyway. I am at work till 5 ET
---
Thanks, but i seem to remember if you had the plan and had crafted a mod you could switch between them in an armor station, without the need to re craft them ? do i remember wong ? (Fallout 4)
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/208
---
I also did my first nuke zone the other day and still def needed rad-x/rad away even after being in excavator PA
---
I thought they fixed this
---
Ah sounds good then, pm your tag and ill message you 
---
You mean the make believe economy in the make believe game right?  This is a fucking game!
---
25 years doesn't really count as ages, and you're not about to convince me SBs are prewar
---
Yeah, perfect quote for this scenario. I do enjoy pvp and contesting workshops. I usually only take what I need and move on. This was the first time I took it all. Clearly that’s not a gameplay style for me.
---
Vendors have completely different stuff for sale based on your character. another player thats the same level as me has different plans and different mods they can buy. some times i have them look for stuff i need. 
---
nope, I'm good,, resting weight is like 190lbs and I dont have any reduce weight stuff yet.  
---
Stash sits at 480 and if I go over 500 I start pulling out the low end stuff to sell or drop for noobs.
---
This looks like a PA build and you marathoner which does not work in PA atm (whether a bug or not it is not stated)
---
also armor penetration is diminishing effect.  It doesn't have to be too much. 
---
It's the LACK of realism that's making me upset, the rifles are stupidly weak.  Particularly the .50 BMG sniper rifle - that gun should oneshot headshot kill basically anything other than a scorchbeast queen, or big boss enemies without heads.
---
Nah I don't buy most games on release just Bethesda and rockstar games cause even with bugs they was great.
---
Not in 76 - if you craft/attach a mod you can't remove it, you can only replace it with something else.
---
You're calling a little explosive bullet that kills someone in a full suit of power armor, from five feet away "realism" - are you kidding?
---
\*FACEPALM\*
---
Why don't people put the mods on rather than keep them separated? I'm genuinely curious.
---
And if you have 200hours of gameplay and 2 characters I’m more curious if you have found anything worth keeping in general or if you’re jumping on this band wagon because you’re one of the people pissed you haven’t gotten anything valuable? And what lvl are your 2 characters? 
---
not always, i lost a couple of mods the other day and I was actively looking at the scrap list.
---
I would make a new character and re play the quests if they did this
---
If they want that to hold any power, they should start actually banning  who have entire stores online then, huh
---
So Bethesda encourage bullying?
---
You can find a power armor station Southeast of Watoga Station without having to go to the train yard.
---
Unlock all the perk cards
---
Try a different build.  
---
Try to find all the crafting recipes.
---
I got mine for free.... Not all plans have to be bought.. SBQ gave me mine, I know others who just found them laying around.
---
It's weapons for me, not to mention I have a couple armor sets I switch out. But sniper rifle, handmades,and assault rifles are heavy as heck.
---
Analogy?
---
Here's a more simple one for you
---
Your telling someone to get a life, and yet you have nothing better to do than drop shit comments and grief players of a game you may or may not play.
---
So does that either make you a clueless no life loser, or a jack ass who's only joy is attempting to bring other down to your level because your too lazy/clueless to register your own problems and do something about it?
---
The irony is your accusing someone else of something you totally are... grow up or get bent.
---
I have seen that it's near Tangara Town. At least the one I found was. 
---
Are you me from one month ago? As I posted this a few times in a few of my posts last month lol. The only time I pvp up and fight off people in pvp is after getting flagged for it after destroying one of these exploit bases lol. Everyone comes after me when I'm wanted though because I'm in the 180 level range... meaning my cap bounty is 180 caps when I'm wanted. It's actually a kind of fun when you get high level like that. Since I'm aware I'm wanted I am always looking for players trying to kill me, my favorite was during white springs nuke zone when I took out like 11 players in a row trying to kill me lol. Good times.
---
Your choices which have no affect on me are having a negative affect on me. Slow down and stop rushing to 25k caps. 
---
He probably thought you were an absolute shitbag and blocked you.  Sounds like you know you were and justify by saying it's a game mechanic.   So you had to drag your loot slow pace across the map sounds like a mechanic to stop greedy gorging on loot.
---
:((( My FAVOURITE GAME IS NOT POPULAR FUCK OFFFEEEHHH 
---
What type of men are these
---
Guy was in a PVP zone, doubt he cares that much you came along and PVP'd him. 
---
If they didn't want to loose there stuff they should have been more mindful.
---
I mean, yes, it would be great to know the exact amount of time.  But I have to say, the maybe, maybe not condition bar makes more sense to me.  I don't know exactly when my real food will go bad.  I'd rather see some preservation options added like the freezer idea, canning or being able to salt meat or something.  Maybe (does this exist) garbage mouth, where you can get some perks from eating spoiled food.  Right now, fertilizer really doesn't mean a lot to me until I need to repair a plant and I've done that exactly once.  
---
I thought that the loot you get from the queen depends on the damage you output onto her, I could be wrong its something i read somewhere - personally ive always gotten a couple prime plans 2 legendaries ultracite pa plans and some scorchbeast food. Every time i show up to a queen fight i unload rounds into her non stop with high damage legendary heavy weapons when shes on the ground.
---
The only time i havent been rewarded with that was when the server glitched and i got nothing because it shows the refresh icon until the queens body despawns.
---
If im right i like the system in place you get rewarded for your contribution, showing up and tagging her with a couple bullets from a pistol isnt enough. Its not cheap burning through thousands of .50 cal and 5mm rounds 
---
&gt; It’s gotten better in terms of bugs and such
---
lol no it hasn't.  The sparse handful of December fixes have barely dipped a toe in the ocean of the bugs.  I say this as someone who plays daily, and wouldn't want to misrepresent the current status of the game.
---
It's the damn npc in riften from eso all over again.
---
I can use broken melee weapons sometimes 
---
Unfortunately duper’s are still players and even if you do think they are losers for using a glitch in a game if Bethesda was to ban these players then fallout 76 would lose 50% of its player base. It’s a glitch almost everyone I have come across has almost always used so unless you want a dead game with no players. 
---
Why not let all characters share the same stash instead?
---
I did my first last weekend, went from 36 to 44! didnt really get any good loot, just a bunch of low level 1 stars that wasn't part of my build. Still a fun time and i have been hoarding radx, radaway and radiation shields for the next one. 
---
I was amazed how cool everyone was. i didnt team up with anyone but did tag along with different people and almost everyone gave me an opportunity to tag the ghouls. I ended up leaving and coming back and pulling the entire golf course spawn through the back door and was desperately flailing away with my supersledge and popping stims like they were tictacs when someone came and gave me an assist. When i was done looting the same guy kited over 2 legendaries for me to tag before he wiped them out. 10/10 would do again. 
---
It sucks b/c a lot of times people are overencumbered and it's a slowish walk back. 
---
A true fix would be to fix the glitch, wipe everyone with countless down to 1 and roll on. 
---
and i think you can get 40% armor penetrations by mods. i don't know about power fis. but most rifles can get 40% armor penetration by modding piercing magazine.
---
It's a storyline where the Whitespring robots killed all the humans and stored their bodies in those unlockable rooms
---
You know that all night long means that you suffer less from the negative effects that come from being hungry and thirsty, not that it makes it take longer to get hungry/thirsty right? A lot of people seem to have confused what the card actually does.
---
Separating different items is the worst possible idea, no offence, I just have 200 marine tactical helmets on my alt and scrolling through these is pain.
---
I have another idea that encourages reasonable food management, throwing out soon to be spoiled food, and has any basis in physics. Imagine that you place 20 sandwiches on a plate in the morning, and you dont eat em until evening. Not best, but acceptable food. Now imagine you place 19 fresh sandwiches, and one thats completely molded, so that they all touch a little. Would you eat any of those in the evening? Probably not without lead belly perk in your build.
---
So, in other words, make the CND bar show the sum of all the CND, divided by amount of items in a stack. This way if you have one old steak and one bloody fresh, you end up with stack of two around half CND, and if you add one fresh to stack of twenty rotten-in-30-sec this fresh one could either be the only left out (more tracking for server, not recommended, easier for players) or rot away with the rest of the stack (less tracking for the server, molding more reasonably represented in a simulation, and more survivalish vibe). The optimal playstyle in the second scenario would be to verify if we don't have anything that will spoil soon if we want to add new pieces to the stack.
---
Hard to tell, i never sleep with Shotguns, but always with a Fatman and a Missile Launcher with Triple Barrel and Targeting Computer, seems safe.
---
I just have two Artillery, throw a blue smoke grenade either on top of the room or near the door where everyone is fighting.
---
Fires 7-9 Mini Nukes every 4-5 seconds, the range reaches any of the hotspot with my camp at the little pond
---
Oh boy 76 subreddit is yet again crying over people not liking the game. Do i have to remind you what happen when some genius from this sub did that last time? The whole 76 sub has became pretty much a laughing stock. Do yourself, and the whole internet a favor and don't repeat mistakes people did in not (even that far) past. If you like the game then so be it, you have right to like it. But just as you have right to like and praise it others have right to be upset about it and criticism it. Accept it. That's all you can do at this point.
---
There's a very good reason for Bethesda to not have officially acknowledged the duping in the first place. It's rapidly becoming moot because just about everyone knows about it now, but if Bethesda ever publicly acknowledged it it would've spread far faster than it did.
---
They were probably hoping they could announce that they'd patched it out before it became too widespread. 
---
I like to put on my chrimmy T51 and drop random stuff for player's camps I find
---
For me, I didn't have the object(in my case, a T-60 helmet) , but had the mod beforehand. 
---
AGREE
---
But, if the limitation is backend code and server stability, mule accounts would at least be a fairly quick fix until they figure out a better alternative.
---
Of course, a cross character stash sounds like way more than a "quick fix".
---
Shameless self-promotion:  I had my domesticated Assaultron cook up some BlamCo Mac-n-Cheese.  It was delicious!

It's in the hospital by the Charleston junkyard. It was my first in game photo!
---
Hey was this one of the two I joined last night where SBQ never dropped below 70% health?
---
Would you mind sharing where those spots are? So far I've only found them very rarely on high level 'big' enemies like scorchbeasts and deathclaws.
---
Well, a laser \*rifle\* is still a rifle, as is a pipe rifle and gauss rifle, and yet...
---
Shooting an explosive anything at point blank range will hurt or kill you. Hell, people lose fingers and hands just lighting firecrackers. 
---
I thought this was weird too, many of the low tier armor mods are worth 2 steel but if you try scrapping them it only gives you 1 steel
---
Perk for Chem weight reduction not in use?
---
Still look for Blackpowder in you inventory it takes a lot of space, Grenades take a lot of space if perk for explosivs reduction is not in use. And also look into your junk at stash. I prefer to make bulks out of everything except plastic. After that throw all not bulked scrap away. Except Black titanium, Cristal, Atomic Waste and all the things how can not to be a bulk.
---
I hope it was helpful and sorry for my not so good English :)
---
Good luck to manage you Inventory.

PsYchO over and out!

Easier said then done.

I have been conditioned to pick up just about every one I see.

I have 73 of them bad boys. 
---
I think loot should be for all, but XP should still require hitting the target. otherwise you end up with 23 players idling in a house in whitesprings...
---
Wonderful. But you can’t open the repair interface if you don’t have the mats. So I don’t know what I need!
---
I assume they'll address every duping method then just make a new tier of item (level 55/60) to make all duped weapons obsolete.
---
Same, Swinging my hammer of death! One, smack, two, smack, three smack...Mr Prizebot? Smack....
---
Good points.   I kinda liked the farming that I could do here though, because without it being a nuke blast zone, you can farm enemies that are close to your level, if you walk in the spawn area first.  If you only have 20 minutes or so to play, log on, farm the golf building and surrounding bungalows and get some good drops for your level.
---
And to make a comment on this, based on this thread. More of the “community” (us) disagrees with how 1 person feels about this (you). 
---
Oh they hype to see a legandary, just to get a garbage melee weapon or wood armor.
---
Doesn't surprise me. Every time I log in I discovered new bugs and I'm over 100 hours in.
---
I'm gonna change that then
---
I see your rant is beginning. They have fixed some of the glitches. Damage glitch, phantom weight, etc... also they have fixed build budget glitch, and losing your whole base when someone is in your base location. Ignore that guy. Are there still glitches yes. Are they fixing some of the glitches yes. Therefor the bugs and glitches are getting better. Which is exactly what I said

So I looked through but couldn't find a thread on this, tho there prob is one somewhere, don't have a lot of time to search so I apologize, but I have the plans for the metal bed, and have read them, and still it is locked in my C.A.M.P. build mode. Ideas?? I really want the better looking bed! Lol
---
Cause they may be salty.
---
&gt; I’m not part of the problem
---
Nah, you just have a mule character well over the weight limit.  Yes, you are part of the problem.
---
&gt; Idiots offering stupid solutions who have no clue how the dupe works is the issue.
---
If you want to resort to name calling, so be it, but don't bark up that fucking tree pal, this is meant to be a conversation.
---
&gt; Then offering solutions that penalize the community as a whole is even dumber.
---
it doesn't penalise the community as a whole, it penalises the very small portion of the venn diagram of those that are overencumbered and those with duplicate legendary weapons.  Try to stay away from hyperbole, especially if you are gonna preface this by calling someone an idiot.
---
&gt; I’m terribly sorry you clearly have no clue how the duplication glitch works and that you’ve offered a quiet honestly stupid solution which is clearly displayed by everyone’s reaction
---
I know full well how it works, you are being intentionally obtuse, making absurb assumption, and being an overall fucking prick.  Also, you don't speak for the community as a whole, so what gives you the right to speak for "everyone".  Especially when others, in this very thread, have agreed with me.  You'd think being on that high horse of yours, you'd be able to see that, but I guess with ones head so firmly entrenched in their own asshole, it impedes your perception.
---
&gt; What happens if you dc right after getting something you wanted and god forbid it be something you already have in your weapons inventory? Or ultimately get the blue screen after picking it up? 
---
Sour grapes, that's what happens.  You'll get over it.
---
&gt; If I have to worry about losing something because I’m buying from the guy who has the same thing I do that my friend wants, that is incredibly dumb.
---
What is incredibly dumb is thinking this is more important than the duping issue.  You sound like a duper, which must be what has gotten your panties in such a twist over my suggestion.  Fear that your good thing is gonna come to an end.
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't, just movement and reload speed. But that would make sense if it did.
---
is this solidsnake?
---
I feel like most of this feedback is so obvious it seems Bethesda never put much thought into it nor actually play tested anything. 
---
Pretty much the whole map, in this video I made it above the main cloud but not out of the nuke effect before the game crashed to desktop. I did another one later on but the stream was so choppy that I didn't save it from Mixer. [https://youtu.be/19Zg5ZUy6ow](https://youtu.be/19Zg5ZUy6ow)
---
Stop buying the bargain ditch weed, I think its having a much more negative on your life than I or Fallout 76 ever could.
---
I mean being a blubbering idiot has some short terms benefits, like people think your funny for a bit, but than they figure out you have no clue where/what reality is and move on.
---
Yes it is clash, how are you.
---
Maybe the loot should scale to her difficult then. The more people there the harder she's supposed to be, so the better the loot. 
---
I have one of those little keyboard attached to my controller. Wish I could just assign a hotkey to a melee weapon for super-quick weapon changes. It is annoying when you have to be precise to get the weapon you want.
---
Typically I switch to my preferred plinking gun, meleee weapon &amp; then "back" to the gun. Then 99% of the time it's set so I can swap back &amp; forth. 
---
it just works. - todd howard.
---
Nice! Couple tips.. Although it dosent work the greatest the brightness/contrast/saturation sliders are your friend. Use them.&amp; The letterbox frame is only 100 atoms and makes for some great pictures.. Would recommend. 
---
with enough time and radioactive fallout... anything is possible. 
---
&gt;My gear and meds weigh 150
---
I've only got 1 strength so that's near max haha
---
I dont have a problem with carry weight either, it's just another aspect to the game. Makes you think about how your going to go about looting. 
---
Bro I would love that. Even if you just go to the card menu and switch between load outs that would be perfect
---
Calm down.  I just disagree with how you phrased your response.
---
I GOT YOU WITH 100000 caps
---
Do eeet!

Already knew about that one :/ expected sth better for All Corpses not just meatpiles. Most of the time I'm looking for corpses that aren't meatpiles.
---
agreed
---
Do a player courier type thing. You put a package of goods in a mail dropbox say at a pre-war post office or something. A pre-war AI offers up an event quest to random players in the area to deliver the package because not even having all postal personnel wiped out will stop the mail.
---
Event is as follows: You are now a PvP target and must deliver the item to a mailbox built at the receiving player's mailbox before time runs out, or someone else kills you to deliver it themselves in pure fallout calamity. If time runs out, a haywire delivery Mr. Gutsy one-shots the current carrier with a hitscan weapon and takes the package to the recipient themselves to prevent withholding from the recipient. Reward could be a special stamp allowing your next ordered mail to arrive via cargobot.
---
My wife is playing with me. It's her first Fallout game. She keeps apologizing for taking too long crafting, or working on her camp, or reading the terminal, or listening to her holotapes, or finding the next quest marker... how the hell do I convince her that dicking around is fairly normal in the game? I have no objection to waiting for her, but she dosn't believe me.
---
yeah, I'm not the only one that feels this way, nice try.
---
Oh yeah Your on xbox right lol i saw you camped in flat woods

There is no actual data to support the idea that inventory causes lag.  It all stemmed from a sloppy comment Todd made during beta trying to recall why the team limited stash to 400 lbs.  No follow up, no data, no indication of any testing, no results changed when stash was increased to 600.
---
Dupers have sadly proven that they can walk around with millions of pounds.

---
I love the Gutsys that just sit there &amp; take damage, having zero aggresion. 
---
That's for helping you walk back to Watoga when you're crippled and over encumbered. 
---
How can you tell if a certain weapon has been duped or not?
---
I am finding the random nature of loot drops to be among the most fun draining aspects of the game. It isn't fun to have a tough fight against the Queen and get wooden armor or something. 
---
Selective reading, I said give them time; Fallout New Vegas was never fixed by Bethesda or Obsidian and still has bugs in it. This will eventually be fixed more than any previous Fallout Game.
---
Shit, I fucked up haha, don’t want to change it now. Oh wells
---
I used them in Fo4 and they would spin. To the point where if you didn't put them up properly in one of the pre-fabbed houses, it would knock repeatedly.
---
This.
---
I destroyed a few things that I wish I hadn't because it didn't default to using the BULK items first.  I don't waste shit making them so that it can destroy other things I actually want first.  I'm not collecting bulk steel for shits &amp; giggles.
---
Thankfully I noticed fast and have been proactive at breaking down bulk items when I actually need them.
---
Lol thats great I’ll have to try that 
---
what do you mean by easy mode?
---
I have not seen this option...
---
Oh yea I know. I was just adding other top tier examples. Not necessarily all of them on one item.
---
I've found a few things worth keeping, but have plenty of inventory space, so its not really a problem.  That said, I don't base my enjoyment on whether or not I have TSE weapons.  Things like a healthy game mean a lot more than a shiny weapon.
---
Found the alien blaster but have yet to find any ammo for it
---
You’re spending a lot of points here on weight reduction while also spreading some perks around to cover the negatives of your mutations. Seems like it takes away from a lot of the perks of being a heavy gunner. 
---
I use heavy guns with a more power armor focused build and have gotten excellent results. You’re missing the accuracy buff from PA, the crazy damage resistance without hurting your action points with a Mutation, and the awesome synergy of using a Gatling laser and power armor with reduced weight and increased duration of fusion cores. You’re also missing any perks that help support wearing armor of any kind, keeping repair costs low and durability high is essential if you’re gonna tank. I’m partial to using the Gatling gun and it’s basically a sniper rifle with the power armor accuracy. 
---
If you’re going no PA, perhaps consider working in white knight? Glow sight in perception over getting more meat from kills seems like a no brainer. running only one ammo weight reduction perk according to your ammo type would be ideal, but let’s be real it takes 1,000 50 cal/5mm to weigh a pound and you can likely just carry it. Odds are your gun will be broken after 1000-1500 rounds anyway. Marsupial doesn’t have great synergy with heavy guns because you usually want to fire from stationary, and speed demon is likely not worth it if you’re cutting down your action points like crazy from scaly skin. Working in something like blocker/the one where you have damage resistance while firing heavies seems more worthwhile because heavy guns suck up close and if/when you pick up an explosive gun you’ll want to avoid shooting up close.
---
It's a pretty simple thing to only punish obvious dupers. The people carrying 10k of every bobblehead and 40,000,000 lbs of junk. 
---
Because I keep ample amounts of material in my stash box before I repair anything.
---
They are right outside the silo they launch from, right outside as in the general area around them
---
If you don't make your own bullets or use gunpowder don't even pick it up. If you do then pick it up when your getting low on bullets. Sell your junk, some of it sells pretty good to vendors and once you have every faction unlocked you have 1400 caps worth of stuff to sell a day. Don't bulk junk unless your going to sell except for aluminum, lead and acid. Aluminum and lead weigh less bulked, acid takes 10 to bulk but returns 15. everything else weighs more to bulk so don't bother until your going to sell. Some of the stuff you can't bulk can still be sold to vendors like gold and silver. 
---
I’m in no hurry and if you need wholesale prices on other mats just let me know. I’m flush with everything except steel and plastic.
---
Wow, really? That's actually really cool. I love the attention to detail in this game. 
---
Ah, but can you do it almost entirely vertically on a horse?
---
Hold my tongue why?
---
Just saying man, when you say you are so poor that you can only buy ONE full price game a year and you can't be arsed to even research about the products you are buying with money being tight, maybe you should use your brain more or just not waste the little money you have on garbage, just use a little more critical thinking next time and save yourself some cash if you are hurting so much.
---
&gt;You have to be pretty shitty in order to copy old code, right?
---
See this? \^ Yeah, they know *nothing* about programming. Any programmer that's not a complete idiot reuses code regularly, because if you've written it once and know it already works, why bother writing it again from scratch (potentially screwing things up - very easy when a single typo can break everything) when you could just reuse what you already have?
---
Plus, hell, a lot of places will deliberately recommend that your code and functions be modular, for the express purpose of being easier to reuse.
---
I carry only 3/4 weapons and ammo for each type. Stimpaks, some food and water and med-x.   
---
I have a perk that reduces the weight of armor (25% less) and I'm 130/180. Yes, I'm only level 29 but at the moment I don't need other things.   
---
I've noticed for me the bar never updates unless I drop the item.
---
You actually let him finish the first sentence he utters?  
---
I admire and envy your patience.
---
If you aren't, store the armor on spare power armor chassis's.  Makes a full set weigh 10, rather than the full weight of each piece.  If you are already doing this, good on your mate.
---
I had 5 copies of that key before I realized only one was mine and marked for the quest.

I was sniping from atop the cliffs by the Red Rocket Mega Stop. He spawned about fifteen feet out in front of me - in midair. Essentially, this was the only thing he said before exploding into a heap of junk at the bottom of the cliff.

You will only be wanted if you killed a person with your own hand or weapon + they didn’t fight back.
---
No, I'll do that when I go by the enclave, which is indeed quite often since I go to whitespring quite each time :) 
---
But I have probably less freetime than the people level 3** claiming 500hours...
---
That last point I whole heartedly agree with. They need to make more areas viable for nuke bosses. Nuking the water park should spawn a boss sized, 3 star Snalleygaster or Gulper or something. Nuke the ash heap and you get a godzilla sized Deathclaw King. It gets boring seeing nuke only pop up on one of 2 spots. Especially when I completely understand why they do it. 
---
What about once a month?  What about putting a limit on the amount of characters a player can have at one time to prevent unlimited mules?
---
For all the people shitting on this idea, they seem to not realise that by having brainstorming sessions, you end up coming up with solutions.
---
No worries I didn't take it as such
---
Just discovered this with my new camp placement yesterday. Got a level 45 Vengeful Mothman fresh out the box.
---
Most of mine are weapon mods (like the sacrificial blade) im holding onto until i get a Legendary worth using.
---
I have the purifier issue as well good to hear its being fixed
---
I’ll have to check my stash by I can do 1k steel easy. Not sure on plastic reserves 
---
O B J E C T I V E L Y
---
No worries, PSA lol, may be able to squeeze that point in elsewhere!
---
Not again...
---
Whenever, no hurry I am always in need of steel and plastic.
---
I just wanted a field hospital setup with a bunch of large tents but items keep appearing on top of my tent for no reason so that's a bust. Also, I keep having "the object is floating" or "there's some shit in the way I promise" glitches so I've abandoned my dreams. 
---
That it's important for bethesda to fix these problems, not for players to alter their playstyle so that they're not stockpiling mods.
---
&gt; A true fix would be to fix the glitch
---
I don't think they know how, that's why I, and others, are making suggestions to jumper the solution.
---
I'm not sure they sell med-X. From what I understand no recipe for med-x has been found. 
---
i didn't have the appropriate items yet. Like i found a t51 bright mod, but not the actual head armor for it. Or like a chainsaw mod, but no chainsaw. Sometimes I save it for another character and haven't found the time to get a friend to do some transferring with me.

No one is forcing you to do a power armor build.  Your basic argument is stupid.  It's like saying "weapons are overpowered in this game.  Using your fists isn't feasible, the game forces you to use weapons."
---
The solution to that is of course to... use weapons. 
---
With the last couple of fights ending in a crash (a couple weeks ago), I'm putting off 76 until server stability improves. 
---
There's nothing fun about wasting most of your ammo and breaking all your weapons and armor only to be rewarded with nothing. What's even better, your next login spawns you near FSP with no ammo and broken guns, so you just have to haul ass till you can fast travel back to your camp.
---
It's much faster to load in from the menu than the desktop, is it not for you?
---
What ticked me off last night was a Level 68 robot walked/patrolled right past a SuperMutant looking for me, and they didn't throw down. 
---
Delete TSE weapons from the game file would be a start. They don't belong in the game and would reduce duping.
---
Only reason to defend is to get free Recipes/Plans that it awards, but if not, yea it's easier to retake. 
---
Last three times I’ve tried to kill SBQ  we barely get her to half health and then times up
---
I was just pointing out that those two things help out immensely.  
---
Bad Idea, they just need to ban the dupers and fix the duping issue. Plain and simple. Stuff like this just punishes everyone when the answer is to just fix it. 
---
I'd be fine if it was really small, like 10 items total, no stacking. That'd reduce muling, but still allow excess plans/recipes and or a full set of equipment to be transferred.
---
Ahh yeah gotcha, I put the stream on mute for a bit must have missed it. In that case I agree, ad victoriam brother 
---
His fault for bulking in a pvp zone. You just taught him something he should have already known. 
---
Would be great to setup a store on your CAMP to place things like this to sell.
---
I don't understand what you're getting at. You can use the PA station and hit the repair button. It'll show you what materials are required and quantity. You won't be able to repair it if you're lacking sufficient quantity of a specific item.
---
Definitely doing that, but I was actually talking more about non PA armor. Sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
She’s my main in Overwatch. ;)
---
Thanks bro
---
Weight doesnt cause crashes, tonnes of items do
---
There’s pool balls on the pool table, and the kitchen has all place settings with plastic plates/forks/knives and there’s a stack of plates on the counter. Probably good for 20 pieces at least. Good luck, ad victoriam 
---
No, it’s greyed out. 
---
I guess I haven't noticed...
---
Lucky, I WISH I could get my wife to play 76 with me. But she got a couple levels in and now she's one of those that hates the game. So I got her Rdr2 instead. 
---
yep lots of shotguns and 3 legendaries (whenever you hear "terminated management personnel detected" means there's a legendary mole miner spawned
---
Ultracite Calibrated Shocks:
---

---
17 aluminum

6 fibreglass

5 violet flux

9 ultracite

That’s where the PA comes in 
---
i heard that bobblehead and magazine bonuses stack so dupers are running around with thousands of each and using them all, getting crazy, godlike buffs. That could've been what happened to you. 
---
Ok I’ll be on tonight around 8-9pm est GT Total Chaos xxx.
---
Low setting should help if your frames are low. Other times you'll get disconnected due to server instability
---
Your best bet if you're over-encumbered is to UN-EQUIP your weapon (hold down the R key on PC), you'll move faster (also run faster when not over-encumbered).
---
1. If you're close to a whitesprings entrance, get inside the main building
---
2. If you're not, you're probably close to the edge of the circle, get out of the circle.
---
Either 1 or 2 is true.  Gotta make a judgement call and go :)
---
Upgrade your Under Armor when you are able to! Your 76 Jumpsuit can be modded to give extra SPECIAL Stats which can be huge when deciding what Mutations if any you want. Ex: Marsupial is -4 Int - modded 76 jumpsuit +2 Int.
---
yep, to be honest the only reason why i have this perk was to not help my team, it was to make it to where i dont need to use rad away.
---
but in order to do that i was forced to help out my team in the process.
---
Also, the Pip-Boy 2000 MKVI Construction Kit is one of the most detailed game replica I’ve ever seen.
---
heathen!!! Putting mothman in your flair does not make you thyne savior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I never said anything stopped me from playing the game normally, I played the game the way I wanted to. I only gave a suggestion that could prevent players from that kind of power leveling. On top of that they should also scale enemy damage better, when a high level enemy hits a low level player it should do more damage than the set amount going through their defence stats.
---
If they'd scale them up to similar stats / durability as ballistic weapons.........done deal, all fixed.
---
if you wake up to someone standing over you, that seems like a very bad weapon to pull out and shoot at point blank range.
---
FFS monokoi: start paying attention to the confirmation windows.
---
Im pretty sure I got mine from doing the enclave questline (like the first mission (might not be the right one, and might be random) so try that if u havent. If I was on PC i would give u mine cuz I don't use it)
---
It stemmed from ppl doing a trade with a duper and waiting 30 seconds for their inventory to load.
---
Or simply dc'ing when trying ri trade with them
---
Or dc'ing viewing your stash after the first dupe bug was fixed as your stash is completely overfilled
---
Or crashing all the time running around with the weight exploitm
---
I was on a server a week ago where someone nuked Morgantown. It was fun finding glowing ones in a city. 
---
I'd like to see places other than Whitesprings and Prime nuked personally. I figure once I level up some I'll try and launch a nuke.
---
I am fond of the holiday break they got
---
Oh right
---
Even then there is still order to be kept to make the game actually enjoyable people take game seriously  and if others don't and purposely make the game unenjoyable to others than their an asshole.
---
ive never understood bulking stuff... it doesnt decrease the weight, and it uses plastic.
---
No joke... when a level 45 you group up with all of a sudden has explosive this and explosive that all while telling me they got them legitimately.  Sure buddy, sure.
---
I truly never realized just how subjective that statement truly.
---
I'd trade my explosive one for one with faster fire rate. TSE is overrated
---
1. Screws
---
2. Screws
---
3. Screws
---
4. Springs

5. Plastic

6. Adhesive

7. Gears (but not really)

Everything else i always have too much off, but Screws.. you can never have enough screws. Screws could be its own currency. 
---
Then all 24 players per server will just hop to the mobs in a constant farm train. No one will do anything but farm bosses in spawn rotations. Then you come along and want a crack at the boss, Oh well, we just killed it 5 mins ago, hop on the train, it will respawn in 25 mins. Shit Idea. Just refer to the Guild Wars 2 Boss farming train. That's what this Idea will become withing hours. 
---
Because the sprinting animation is still active when you open the pipboy. Just wait 1-2 seconds after stopping to open it.

---
Sweet, thank you! Already have a mod installed that prevents favourite gear from dropping, being sold or scrapped - but missed this one.
---
Its kinda glitched, because multiple times i go from my super sledge to my handmade, but instead of going back to my super sledge it pulls out my shotgun.
---
Scorched probably for the last one
---
Except that workshops are intended to be contested areas. Making workshops invulnerable once taken doesn’t sound like fun either.
---
If you choose to take workshops you are choosing to open yourself to PvP. If you don’t want to PvP then don’t go into the *only* openly PvP zones in the entire game.
---
That said, the reason this whole thing sucks is that the PvP system sucks. If there was a fair and balanced PvP system that actually encouraged, you know, *learning* how to PvP this wouldn’t be so bad. Instead we have an endless, duped supply of the strongest weapons in the game that happen to be upwards of 5 times stronger than the 2nd strongest.
---
This is Bethesda’s mess IMO.
---
I heard it was not benefiting from the Heavy Weapon perks, maybe it is a rifle?
---
I'm with you. It's annoying and exhausting. 
---
I find they end when i kill the legendary. I would have thought if its a horde killing one goul shouldnt end it
---
Do duped weapons stack?
---
While i think this is a bad idea it could be made to specifically target duped weapons by only triggering on legendaries that are stacked 5+. Would minimize legit items being deleted as you shouldn't have anyone getting the exact same legendary, with the exact same weapon mods on it, with the exact same durability (all things needed for something to stack in your inventory) so it would only apply to something duped.
---
If you are having blue screen errors you need to use a blue screen viewer app (just do a Google search for one) and put in the error code it gives you.
---
This will tell you what piece of hardware is failing and you can narrow diagnosing the cause. 
---
I had blue screens for awhile. Turns out when I make a hardware change my bios reverts to a overclocked value do to default settings.
---
Did it last night.  Body disappeared.  So I'm thinking maybe quest reward.  4 diluted stimpacks 3 purified water and canned dog food....that's it....for upwards of 2000 
---
50 cal.  Cool thanks bethesda....
---
I agree. TSE is too powerful, but it's here in the endgame and it gets boring sinking bullets into sponges or one hitting it with a TSE. Either way endgame gets boring. I'll probably run quad crossbow against stuff to challenge myself.
---
That one is interesting. All the items lost to dissapearing bags, could have been there the whole time 
---
It also doesn't recharge when looking at a map.
---
Because this game is a buggy, unfinished mess
---
1. You still need a switch (put it inside your place), the terminal can turn all switches on or off as long as it is connected to the same network.
---
2. The trick I used is to use pressure plates on either side, door opens when on the plate and closes shortly after 
---
3. Bethesda

 WTT Plans For TSE Only . WTS Mutation Serums . WTS Paint Jobs Have All Paints In game   [https://imgur.com/a/TL6KbLq](https://imgur.com/a/TL6KbLq) 
---
Every location on the map should have a legendary creature with a chance of being 3\*.
---
I think this happened to me at White Springs after I died, but I never found the bag despite the map saying I was literally right on top of it. 
---
K
---
Actually you can gladly look through my inventory. If I’m overweight like your assumption I wouldn’t be able to stash all of my dupes items? I’ve grinded
---
For hours for what I have. Am I saying I’m worried about this solution? No I’m not. I’m saying this is a stupid solution. If you know how it works, you understand it’s based on dropping 300 of an individually crafted item to force yourself to disconnect? How would your solution be better than fixing the issue itself and the server stability? There are clearly other uses behind having multiple items at a time other than duping. Why do you keep avoiding making a comment on my fix in comparison to yours? Because it makes more sense? Or is it that you can’t admit your idea is dumb compared to an actual solution? I shouldn’t be forced to manage my inventory at the fear of losing any weapon I have 2 of or that it may be broken down. That is stupid. Do you seriously think this would fix the issue? What prevents a duper from doing what they’re already doing and storing it in the box for the next individual to grab it? What had gotten my “panties in a twist” is that someone who claims to have over 200 hours of gameplay has never seen a use in having multiple items or leaving a mule overweight for storage purposes. Not only that, they offer such a terrible idea as a fix. What is obvious is the fact you don’t understand that it’s simple to have 1 of each individual item across multiple characters or to dupe and keep that second one long enough to pass it off with your solution. You aren’t solving anything with what you offered. You’re just causing legit players more issues by offering to have their shit wiped every time they log off overweight while the duper will still be duping and selling because this Is NOT a duping fix. Fixing the fact you can drop 300 is a fix, fixing whatever error occurs and causes the player to disconnect is a fix, telling players “ah well you’re fucked, don’t carry 2 of any weapons or armor, you’ll either have it broken down or deleted” is terrible for an already broken community. I’m not being “intentionally obtuse?”. I’m stating facts that impede your arguement and it’s pissing you off because I’m right. Especially in the current state when you can blue screen just for crafting an item or looking at your inventory. As I said. You can look through all of my characters. Hell you can even go through my mule. Do I currently think the game is broken? Yes. Do I think the dupe needs to be FIXED? Yes. Do I think your idea for “fixing” it is stupid as well? Yes. 
---
What I can’t understand how incredibly silent Bethesda has been on this issue. I guess I am spoiled after playing Destiny. If there is a problem with the game Bungie is right on it. They will level down a weapon etc. They always let players know they are aware of a issue and usually have it fixed.
---
This begs the question of what causes Ultracite to rust. 
---
Everytime I load into whitesprings, I usually sit there from 10 to 20 seconds because the frame rate is so very bad. EVERY. DAMN. TIME. This is on a one X.
---
Nah bro my 30 IQ translater said vengeful 
---
Cool, now I'm going to build a CAMP just like that and literally camp nearby in stealth with a dragon so I can one shot the tools who touch my base.
---
I run a 1050ti and have never had any problem like this. Are you sure your 1070ti is not bottle necked or heat throttling?
---
Or better yet since the body is squirrelly make it the quest rewards.  Queen drops and the quest reward on the same loot table.  Last night feed the people gave better rewards than a SBQ. including the quest.  
---
Raiders unite!
---
I don't think is bethesda fault due to the fact it's told..   
---
It once appear in the confirm repair menu to me (just noticed once as I tend to ignore confirmation menus) what item would be consumed in order to have the material required.. I'm not on pc.. but later today I can take a screenshot and post it here.  
---
You might need to rank up that Perception stat
---
Hold on, seems you are right. Ultracite is not originated from the Scorchbeasts, but Scorchbeasts are using it symbiotically within their body, so you can extract ultracite from their hides and bones. My bad. 
---
I'm level 54 and also don't know what to do besides run around and get killed insessantly by scorchbeasts, behemoths, and any number of high level creatures
---
Sorry I thought you were making it up to be a big hassle to check the bunker.
---
I really dont care if people server hop or not, its your game you can pretty much do what you want as your not actively trying to harm others.
---
Yeah it is...
---
Apparently I didn't proof read my own post and it sounds like I typed it when I was FUCKED UP haha
---
Naw my buddy does enough to see some gray tick away then he covers my ass while I solo her the rest of the way, Takes a couple of minutes but the loot is the same for us both normally sometimes  I have gotten common shit plans and had him get a serum a ultracite vats plan and the last was a common but they same can be said for me sometimes I get serums and other rarer plans he doesn't and almost always  I get 1-2 star rarely 3s from her.    
---
I have done this with a few people now and it is what it is.   
---
Also when it is the two of us at the queen it takes 750-900 .50 cal prime rounds to kill her with my TSE 15% faster reload.Oh I would love it if it was damage based or contribution based but it is not.   
---
Oh the trick to get people to not show up is nuke whitesprings first and follow up with a prime nuke. If I see a bunch of well equipped high level I nuke Prime then whitesprings then prime again. I almost never have people show up for the queen if I do it like this which makes her so easy. 
---
More like locusts
---
Tfw I only have one of these keys but two of warehouse basement keycards and three of the hornwhight bunker aphla and beta keycards
---
What’s most interesting about duper’s and the people who buy from them is it SEEMS they’re very interested in the idea of P2W micro transactions. They’re throwing their full support at those kind of systems! 
---
In a world where 20 bobby pins weight about 1 kg, where power armor on a frame stashed in the inventory is weightless, and other mass and space defying happenings, I don't think it's that big of a problem honestly :P
---
A notification letting you know that your radstag steaks are five minutes away from spoiling would be nice. 
---
SONOFABITCH! 😫 🤦🏼‍♀️
---
it's easily to assume lazy; however given the sheer amount of errors in the game; it's safe to assume that it's actually incompetence. They likely outsourced or rushed this through development and then laughed all the way to the bank.
---
Sure thing, I'll add you the next time I'm online.
---
I didn’t have much issue with the agility run, 1:51 on second try. Marksman, however....  after run 11 and only hitting half the targets I tried something different. Found a 10mm easily enough, crafted some rounds, and went back in. I noticed there was no barrier on the left side of the shack (as you’re looking at the targets). So wth, let’s try getting closer. Worst that happened is a fail and start over. It’s works!! Go into the range from the left side as the start counter goes down. On round 3 I was able to double tap each target with less than 1 second left. Woohoo. Who needs marksmanship when you run in guns blazing?!?!
---
It does suck man for sure but ammo is really kinda cheap to make esp with ammosmith and super duper perks equipped
---
She got that one around the same time as this and for her it’s too boring and too guided I think. I personally love games like that though. I’m a big Uncharted and The Last of Us fan. 
---
I was thinking about playing rdr2 as well. We play fallout a few times a week together. She’s solo the rest of the time. Does your wife like rdr2? 
---
Thats sort of my point.  If they have the resources to devote to cross character stashes (which would add DB load at least as much as similar amounts of same character storage, since it would need to be accessable in game), then I would like them to devote those resources to increasing current storage.  Too many flashbacks to stupid mule tricks in games like diablo where they purposefully kept storage space super limited.
---
I feel like the 600 we have now is just barely enough to basic usage, but I would like just a bit of wiggle room to keep a few extra interesting weapons, or alternate armors around without breaking the limits.
---
This shouldn't need to be said tbh.
---
But who are we kidding, many ppl have no clue how to troubleshoot their pc.
---
Naw in my 4 man we kill her before it can say completed Death From Above.  It does take a few minutes to duo her though. 
---
Just like your mom. 
---
ASK YOURSELF DID YOU THROW ALL THE GERNADES YOU COULD?
---
i think it is too late for that, even if it were possible, as legitimate players may have worked hard to get things/caps to trade for duped items. there is no way to tell if an item is duped and the game is designed to encourage trading
---
i think the reasonable agenda is to fix duping and then powercreep all of the current available gear until it is not in high demand anymore
---
Apparently they mentioned some kind of PvP only mode that's gonna come in an update soon, hopefully that means they'll do a PvP always off mode as well.
---
I know a lot of people have been having issues with the different electronic doors, and some found workarounds to have an inside and outside working switch. I found a way to mount the doors backwards, but haven't tried it in a while, so it could have been patched out. 
---
Here's how I mounted the electric doors inside out, but again, I can't guarantee it still works:
---
start by placing your normal foundation down, but add an extra foundation piece IN FRONT of where you want to place the door wall. Hover the door wall where you want it to be, and since that extra foundation piece is there, it will let you actually rotate the door piece, instead of it just clicking into one direction. Place the door wall, remove the extra foundation piece, and build the rest of your structure. Extra tip, if you start building your walls from another foundation piece, they will face the right way, but if you click new walls onto the door wall first, they may be inside out as well.
---
Loot drops in every Bethesda game are based off of leveled lists in the creature/character's inventory.  They'd just have to put a legendary weapon leveled list in her inventory.
---
I don’t only use TSE? I’ve stated in my build questions I run melee as well. I’ve also stated that even without a TSE it is easy to break 1-2k damage with the proper build. I will also note why isn’t anyone complaining about the bobble heads stacking? Everyone is worried about the duping glitch but not the fact you can spam use bobble heads and they stack? Not to mention if you relog at the proper time it is an infinite damage boost? 
---
Oh, Monster Mash. The sounds of all those children screaming in horrific agony...
---
When I first started the game, this happened with hunting rifles.
---
Needless to say I was a hunting rifle main from that moment on
---
Are you sure that you’re not confusing the jumpsuit with the forest operative underarmor?
---
I dont have the arch but i collect more radaway then i could possibly use. 
---
no no no this one is the right one to stuck in your head [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaQ0aFW8YSI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaQ0aFW8YSI)
---
 So this is why no one wants to tour my base lately....
---
 Also my inspiration for my third mega base lol
---
Whatever level you are is the amount of caps you'll pay by dying to these people, be careful in your decision making as your losses can be staggering if you seek revenge.
---
waiting for a protectron to say "I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee"
---
You want power armor? Got some ultra and cores. Or what you thinking
---
Well it is a game mechanic to instantly start pvp when a workshop is contested, it’s also a game mechanic to drop your loot when you die. If it wasn’t meant to be taken by another player then the bag would be locked to the owner.
---
Wasn’t being greedy, I gave the loot away. Took just the steel. Doesn’t stop me from feeling bad.
---
Thank you! I found it once, showed my wife, and then was never able to find it again.
---
I think 3 is more along the lines of it intending to be for like a storage room in your base. IE like brotherhood armaments room. Would be great if we had containers we could leave things in, as then we could put that in a locked room and a teammate/friend with the code could get things from our base. Until duping is fixed, that's likely out, but probably working as intended. So yea, basically Bethesda, it just works, broken as intended.
---
Then there's a scorched version as well.i read about it when trying to figure out what quest I needed to do to see mothman. 
---
Yes, yes I guess you could.
---
Wait..
---
*rereads*
---
“A conectration C.A.M.P”?
---
Auto spellcheck on phones, the post is so short.
---
The joke WAS the word. 
---
How did that happen? Sorry man, I mean this in a more funny way than being a dick. Lol
---
Also a second bit of advice. If you still need the achievement to be killed at ground zero and it's whitesprings, just stay in the hotel till right after the blast then exit. I got my achievement as soon as I loaded in outside and didn't even have to die.
---
You bulk it to sell it to vendors
---
Duping aside, there is still something to say about a game where the strongest weapons are more than 5 times stronger than the 2nd strongest weapons. That doesn’t tend happen in other online games - damage is usually linear. To do even 2x the damage of any other player because of one piece of gear is pretty rare.
---
The combination of these two effects multiplies the damage to a pretty crazy point, especially because the explosive effect is amplified by perks. It doesn’t feel like it was intended by Beth to make a type of gun that is so powerful that player-base developed a damn acronym for this specific combination.
---
I guess we’ll see what they intended in time.
---
This is my favorite part of the game!  Organic game experiences had with fellow wastelanders.  
---
They’ve proven they understand how with this last hot fix. The issue was that they didn’t fix dropping it to the ground to force the stack. If they added a check for the size when the second set is dropped and made it delete anything over 254 in ANY individual bag, not just your inventory and the bags throughout the world. It would permanently fix this method. 
---
Or they could just fix them... because they suck.
---
Yup it starts a bar on the opposite side (like the white build capacity bar) but this one is grey and it's stored capacity
---
I'd love to see a hacking dart for the syringer that can stop a robot from shooting at you for a short while depending on the hacker perk. Could stop them for a few seconds without the perk but with the perk at max it could be a minute or something.
---
Slowly getting better but still buggy. The duplication glitch is making servers very laggy atm. 
---
It’s still kinda wank if I’m being honest, give it another 3 months and you should be good to go 
---
It's improved. There is still clipping and graphical issues when loading a new area up. Servers are way more stable, but you'll still get the random disconnect every now and then. 
---
The queen should be a 5* drop. Make it stand out from other 3* enemies. 
---
I can curl my tongue tho
---
It's not much better than it was to start with, they've yet to address the major issues. 
---
I gave up on Patrol Duty for a while and then tried it when I saw it pop up and got that plan...and then another
---
It's a lot more stable than before, however, it still needs patching. Many bugs were fixed, but there are many more to hammer out. The game is very playable, and I'm having  a blast with over 100 hours, but some people are more bothered by the glitches than others
---
I think its laziness, example, they already have a model animation of a dragon coming out of the ground, so they made big winged scorchbeasts  that come out of the fissures
---
This happened to me and I was unable to tab out or use task manager. Had to hard reset.
---
Any weapon that has the same affixes, type, and lvl stack if their durability is the same
---
I said, as far as I know. 
---
But I keep so few mods on hand I'm fairly certain I would've noticed if one got scrapped. So most likely the former.
---
Priceless
---
My pirate character was using 6+ it was so much fun, but reloading them after a fight was a pain
---
this is so awesome and i love your art style!
---
I built my base at the top of seneca rock (get the marsupial traint if you wanna scale it) an i found an jangles the moon monkey an panda staring at eachother like wtf does this mean??
---
I've killed numerous glowing legends during WS nukes and they didn't even have a legendary on them. Makes it frustrating and I just want to stop playing when that happens. I have yet to kill the queen, every time I go there its 20 people in the zone and only 3 actually fighting the queen. The rest are hiding in the shack hoping they dont get killed.
---
This has happened to me before, I went back and searched the places again and found the horde.  The game is stupid sometimes lol.  You're right.
---
Update next weekish , sometime this month
---
Xbox!
---
I'd wait for the next update. From what I can tell they are fixing a bunch and adding a new game type? Something about the vaults I think.
---
r/fo76bazaar stop posting this stuff here
---
I have a prime auto hand made, I average 600 damage per shot fired and I still can’t kill the fucking thing because every time I launch a nuke 20 level 30’s show up and it’s all just diminishing returns. 
---
And record it!
---
Only seen the world spawn gun and ammo but two different places.
---
They actually might.
---
I could see them offering seasonal ladders (Like Diablo 3) once they fix duping for realsies, which would give players a fresh economy to work in.
---
Haha that's it ;) for example : Glass scrap has no value. If you making some bulks of it you can trade it for caps to vendors. So Moreno inventory space and caps. Win Win.
---
plastic is np. morgentown highschool at the gym you will find ca. 80 plastic scrap :) 
---
Please &amp; Thank you
---
May want to invest in the Batteries Included perk for Intelligence. Gauss ammo can get heavy (Also helps for fusion cores and other energy ammo)
---
I love how you just slowly walk around. It's so creepy.
---
I like how the cookbook is actually "vault tec standard issue" with regular meals but then the owner has crossed out shit they have to replace and renamed some of the meals because of it
---
What if all weapons, armor, and aid items were the only things wiped? Maybe even ammo? You get to keep your characters, perks, plans, mutations, and all other items as well as progress with quest and stuff. If they could do that, that's probably the better option. 
---
Black Mountain Ordinance in Dome 2.  You can also find a mod for it there.

Yeah, this is a standard feature in basically every online game ever and I didn't even know until this week that it wasn't included. I just assumed. Combine that with the difficulty of getting certain plans - the Handmade Rifle only spawns for five levels at a handful of vendors - and you're doing silly workarounds that shouldn't be necessary in the first place. 
---
How about we nerf explosive weapons? Why just delete them from some? I don't think you are seeing the big picture here. 
---
I got that one early and it keeps popping up
---
I am glad you have learned something (and sad that others here have not).
---
Anyone who claims “mechanics make everything fair” has not lived very long in the real world.  Yes, this is a game, but players are not npcs, they are other people all here hoping to have fun.  Imagining one’s own idea of fun to be the only legitimate one is immature and unrealistic.  Once you lose your empathy for other people playing the game, you have written a death sentence for the game’s survival.
---
And just for me personally, please remember your decision here when you politely request the traffic cop to let you off with a warning.  Mechanics says he should not.
---
In the least it would remove fun from the game. Tell me how it wouldn't feel cheaty and way too easy to have a second character just as a mobile stash box? "Oh my inventory's full? No bother, I'll just click here and here and I'm clear" - No difficulty and extremely cheaty. To me it would be like duping a bunch of items - I now have a bunch of items but where's the fun I felt back when I had to explore and adventure to get them?
---
5 mothmans.. maybe even more holy shit
---
You wanna launch a nuke soon?
---
I broke my addiction to picking them all up a week ago..
---
...now I'm short on fusion cores D:
---
Stay addicted, my friends
---
Do that and make items/gear shareable with your main/OG character?
---
I can get on-board with that....
---
Yeah maybe, just figure if your within 10m of an enemy killed youre probably its target
---
As someone who's been advocating fir the anti armor and explosive effect to be traded for each other (makes explosive a slot one legendary and anti armor a slot 2), I'd actually like this. TSE weapons are highly overrated and I'd love to replace them for other legendaries 
---
r/fo76bazaar jesus christ stop trading on the sub
---
That is some terrible ass luck. I have 4 characters my lowest I stopped playing as he had shit luck when it came to drops. My main sees 3 star weapons like mad my lvl 100 alt see a ton of 2-3 star armor. And my newest well I don't know yet as all I do is workshops on him. But I have been rewarded a legendary every single time I do powering up poseidon so maybe he has decent luck.   
---
But then I ask myself does correlation = causation here. I think it does as my 198 gets a ton and I mean a ton of shielded BoS, BoS officer, Knight bombers and so on when turning tech data but never once have I gotten a paint, but my level 100 has now gotten the paint 12 times and has never seen any other plan from it.    
---
Which leads me to wonder does each character have a hidden luck number? If not why would it be so different between just those two, and my lowbie shit character when I turned it in 10 different times got field scribe and the typical ammo water or stim. 
---
You should be able to remove his fusion core and push him over.
---
I’ve got five of those! And I dropped a stack of them a couple weeks ago!
---
Something about radio synchronization. Two radios placed next to each other would become out of sync after a while. Not a big issue to me, I wish they’d bring it back
---
Which is ideally what you want in a game like this.  What is special about the best weapons if everyone has one?  That is part of the fun in a game like this.  Working really hard to get an item that very few people have.
---
I wonder why behemoths aren't more common. You have the code for giants! I want to raid behemoth camps, damn it!
---
Absolutely. I really want to start over, but don't want to lose any of my loot.
---
Lol thatd be awesome
---
But it still tells you how much you need 
---
&gt; How would your solution be better than fixing the issue itself and the server stability?
---
Because unlike this, I think my solution is actually possible.  Were it as easy as what you said, don't you think they would have done that already?  I'm making the assumption that this is more complex than most are led to believe.
---
&gt; What prevents a duper from doing what they’re already doing and storing it in the box for the next individual to grab it?
---
At this time, nothing, but you are acting like that's all there is to it.  Change the way boxes work.  Use your brain, instead of resorting to cynicism and naysaying.
---
&gt; What is obvious is the fact you don’t understand that it’s simple to have 1 of each individual item across multiple characters
---
What is obvious is that I proposed limiting the amount of characters someone can have.
---
&gt; You aren’t solving anything with what you offered
---
Nah son, I'm deleting duplicate items, you just don't like the method.  Don't act like it won't accomplish the goal.
---
&gt; I’m not being “intentionally obtuse?”.
---
Okay, you are being obtuse by accident.
---
&gt; I’m stating facts that impede your arguement and it’s pissing you off because I’m right.
---
*argument, btw, and you proposals aren't impeding anything. They are tantamount to you crying about losing items that may or may not be duped, which are easily replaceable. 
---
While I agree with you in part, I am probably in a silent hated minority that would like to see legendaries reworked in it's entirely along with the duper fix, eliminating both the continuation of the problem and the problem itself. Here me out, the idea of legendaries are very cool, coming across some interesting, unique, and strong piece of kit is exciting and possibly build making. However, 2 shot explosive weapons (as an example) will forever keep pvp from being a legit part of the game, even in future content. None of my Max level characters will ever compete against a shotgunner with that legendary as he will always one shot me while I will never one shot him and until time to kill is raised to at least several seconds, I don't see a pvp revelent DLC ever having any success.
---
Fixing duping and legendaries at the same time will smash that issue you mentioned hopefully and lead towards some very healthy future content and lifespan for this game IMO.
---
Personally, I think Todd needs to go sit down With Arenanet. Bethesda is mirroring much of the mistakes Anet made with the GW2 launch. I think Mo could help them out and give them some advice on what to avoid and how to approach the issues and get them straight. GW2 had a terrible launch and a terrible reputation for years, now consistently ranks among the top 5 in MMO's and #1 on many best free to play lists. 
---
Its such a parallel it's uncanny. Yeah, the games are different, but the events, rewards, bosses, and quests are handled very similarly. Bethesda so far patch after patch, and promise after promise is doing the same crap anet did in the begining. 
---
I get disconnected so much, server hopping is inevitable, I never do it on purpose tho
---
Is it actually worth doing these? I’m not found of fast traveling four times for bad rewards :/
---
Did you kill the "leader".  This is a repeat one had for feral ghoul and super mutants.  Both times was penitentiary and leader was past the flame trap for me.
---
for sure this nuke zone is  so laggy, do you have a mic and/or discord?
---
I think it's the same guy that wrote the descriptions on the plans. 
---
You don't need to server hop. Just wait five minutes and the server will crash anyway.
---
That's amazing.
---
Huh. My experience when I see a nuke launch is I have to stop what I’m doing, get my kit, and travel to Delta or she’ll be dead before I can get there. I’ve never seen the fight last for more than 4-5 minutes. 
---
Oh I agree completely. 
---
Well...this is my sunday gaming session experience: 7 bluescreens (total crash of game), 3 freeze frames (need to restart game), 3 „Server disconnected“ errors (back to main menu) and 3 „controls temporarily disabled“ messages (have to go back to main menu, probably due to dupers). So yeah, it’s still kind of buggy atm. I’m playing anyways cause I love the game, hope it gets better soon....
---
But there is Ladders in fallout 76 on a few buildings.
---
Man thats nostalgic, did any of the Mindcrack dudes quit? I know Bdouble0 is still around, ive seen him in my recommendations 
---
Bag disappeared in a nuke zone yest.   Not sure what happened, but never saw it.  Couple min later running around looking for it i saw it floating im the sky.  
---
So look up sometimes too.  
---
I thought they already had a limit? I’ve only made 4 characters. I figured it would cap at 5. I do agree the brainstorming is what solves the solution but my issue came in with them having a seriously simple solution they have already proven that it works. They fixed being able to create 300 at a time and transfer anything over 254. They forgot to fix the dropping and allowing those items to stack as well as trading them and allowing a stack that way. Another preventative would be to change that when crafting the items don’t end up with the same durability no matter how high your intelligence is. That it would be completely random like it is prior to having lvl 10 intelligence. The key issue is that as long as the dupe itself exists then players will continue to abuse it and find ways around it. They have to fix it at the source to shut it down completely. 
---
Thank you for noticing and considering it. Sincerely.
---
ya i need to eat
---
no but i found this [https://imgur.com/RjQe47e](https://imgur.com/RjQe47e)
---
Agree to all of this, plus paying for shortcuts sadly is the norm now, why grind for a reward when daddies credit card can get it me now.
---
&gt; Everyone is worried about the duping glitch but not the fact you can spam use bobble heads and they stack?
---
because making something not stack is an incredibly easy thing to fix.  Rad-X doesn't stack, apply that code to bobbleheads.
---
Isn't that the nuka world alien aka fake?
---
Then we can hop to a new server. Normally I would have the voicechat in but currently at my aunt's place and dont wanna make any noise. But you can talk and ill follow
---
I run a 1070 and have no issues. I mean there are times where I get a bit of stuttering but that usually happens when 8 people are firing TSE weapons.
---
I don't think it'll increase any bonuses the foot gives you - just the amount it fills your hunger bar.  It's not bugged any more.
---
There’s no way this could be done retroactively though
---
You're behind my friend.
---
Close to a month ago ppl got the same notifucation.
---
Oh probably. 
---
I'm guessing that since fo76 didn't die in the first month, and actually doing pretty good, he's trying to swing things around.
---
So in a couple months, he'll be all, this is the game it should have been at launch. 
---
He's a shill. 
---
Or, get a handful of them and put them in different positions on your action picker bar. Its like 12 different shots that can be fired before a reload. 
---
When player vending is added, I was planning on selling rare mods... not anymore! RIP calibrated shocks.
---
The way Path of Exile works is that when a ladder ends, your character is moved to your non-ladder character pool. They wouldn't be able to share until then. But yeah.
---
https://twitter.com/fallout/status/1082696193803718657?s=21
---
I run a very very similar build but no Carnivore or healing factor. 
---
Exact same on STR and INT cards. For 1 Perception I run either glow sight, or the bigger explosives radius card.  END: maxed All night long card and, 2* life giver, and 1* good doggy.  
---
I highly recommend trying out a max rank Adrenaline card instead of marothoner and action boy, its OP!  Seen my TSE prime Gatling at 1924 dmg a shot lol.  
---
Where was the Avalon one located?
---
ok awesome
---
X-files baby
---
Kudos, that is hilarious
---
hold tight. whambulance is coming.
---
Yeah I can't tell if he likes the game or is mocking it at this point it's like he is  bipolar for the game
---
What lvl are you?
---
He has a theoretical degree in technical writing. 
---
Yes, that has happened to me when I die mid-jump.  Doubt that is what is going on here, because it clearly shows the items when I am focusing on the ground.  With floating bags I had to find and focus on the bag in the air.
---
r/fo76bazaar, nobody cares that you want everyone to see your post. This breaks the sub’s rules
---
&gt; I thought they already had a limit?
---
It's entirely possible they do, I only have the 3, so I haven't seen the prompt saying too many, nor have I looked into a cap.
---
I'm reluctant to see that they understand the nature of the problem until I see them put a working solution into place.  Until that time, I'm going to assume they know as little about how to fix this as we do.
---
I find the opposite more of a pain. The super high level muties everywhere when I have to go through an are for a story mission, that is the pain. Low levels are just irritating, dealing with hordes of 68s when your 20 is nearly impossible.   
---
I would like it if they added armor coatings that among them added resist to explosions.
---
Go to r/fo76vazaar to trade please
---
This is so funny to me because I was like “That bed is off the ground, why is she lying to this man?” And then I read your edit.
---
I haven’t had the chance to do that event yet. I’ve heard ppl have mixed success trying to get the plan that way.
---
&gt; *\~ Mmh whatcha say*  
---
*Mmh that you only meant well? Well of course you did \~* 
---
I'm dying XD
---
For real
---
I didn’t know why I was collecting
---
Teddies and stuffed toys but then I started gifting them with supplies to some of my
---
New fallout friends and it created joy, the souvenir sloth was the most recent gift with 200 lead and 100 ballistic
---
Well maybe if Bethesda wasn't consistently trying to fuck over its fanbase, we wouldn't be so pissed. It wasn't the canvas bags, or the bugs, or the overpriced atomic shop, or the probable pay to win store, or the nuka dark rum, it's all of it, and it's still coming. Over and over again, they keep trying to fuck us.
---
May be helpful tips, but consider the Contractor perk (reduces costs in workshop and camp mats, intelligence) and Home Defense (this will unlock more turrets and traps, Agility). 
---
After setting up a few turrets, I make a box house with a locked door and whatever crafting benches I need inside so a potential pvper can't get me without making a lot of racket.
---
You can always fast travel away if ya see someone coming that outclasses you (if you sneak, they won't be able to track you down). Thus the workshop is there for their taking if you don't want to put up a fight. 
---
Consider a gamma gun for defense in PvP. Stimpaks are auto hotkeyed, but you have to manually hotkey radaway and some players overlook it. Radiation dmg negates stimpak use (evil laugh)
---
Often spawns a 3star legendary as horde boss, so often a small chance of good rolls.
---
Why do they have a trade flair then? And why did you link the less populated one? Why not r/market76
---
gimme that juicy text and some ideas to read/discuss
---
I'm expecting something this week, since last week was still the tail end of the holidays and there were likely still people out of the office. Now things kick back into full gear, hopefully we'll get a substantial communication before the week is over. In fact, it looks like we'll get some info tomorrow.
---
There is just no incentive to fight Scorchbeasts or Scorchbeast Queens, just no worth the bullets...
---
Everytime I'm getting attacked I just change servers.
---
Yup notice the strobe light effect. ‘Twas horrid
---
That's me, except I'm level 83. I got an All Rise super sledge and its great, but i just want some decent guns. 
---
Lol... i dont care about apologies. I belive in people making it different or better. Thats what changes things, not meaningless apologies.
---
If people are that butthurt due to a game that they need apologies they..... well, i dont know what to say.
---
Sounds like they did not quite make it to the bank with the poor sales and constant hate train
---
i feel like I am, but i also feel like im not. I remember the forest part, but once I got it I put it in my stache never to be seen again. So IDK, ur probably right tho
---
They never said they would get rid of the stash limit. They said they would raise it (which they did), then evaluate raising it again once they can see how stable the servers remain.
---
At the moment things are quiet so this sub isn't bad with what I described in my comment, but its still hilariously rampart in the main fallout and gamin subs. But I promise, in the next month or two BGS will drop news, an update, or even just tweet something that irks TrOo FaLlOuT FaNs and they will repeat the outrage cycle which starts on the previously mentioned subs, gain momentum as a reason to be pissy at the game and BGS and they will flood to this sub and do exactly what I mentioned in my initial comment. 
---
Yeah it’s a very good idea. Ofc I think we all agree that they must fix any of those duping glitches before adding a shared stash. 
---
The main reason player data isn't stored client side is just.. if your HDD crashes, you buy a new computer, you play on a different computer.. etc.. you loose all your loot/progress.
---
No, they've said they plan to increase it, I doubt they will remove it since the servers have to track each person's stash.
---
Lol. Im one. Thanks.  Stopped using the card cause it seemed like it did nothing to slow down hunger/thurst.  Lol.  Now i know. 
---
Priority#10 actually do something and do it fast
---
I think they've already taken too long to properly address/fix the economy issues. Raising weapon caps would be a fair thing to do, but they're going to have to nerf guns that honest players worked to get.
---
In the documentary about FO76s development they said a lot of things will be planned for but can only really be done once it's released. Fixing duping should've been done within a few days of release. Its far too late to do anything meaningful about it without punishing a large amount of the playerbase who never used exploits.
---
that'd be a hell of a one-two punch for a melee character. Finally give me a chance to punch a Sentry Boy without getting a missile shot at point-blank range. 
---
It never updated to tell me I found the leader, I found no ghouls at any location.
---
Sometimes the mission has an extra step of finding the horde.
---
Oh man that’s actually bad news, let’s just pray to RNGesus he’s the only one who could help us rn :(
---
100%, i love to play with alts, but it should be way easier and more user friendly to transfer items between own characters.
---
I can’t activate the crafting station for repairs at all. Maybe the shitty ui is trying to tell me something different then. Maybe I’ll just put my mouse cursor over it and read the tooltip... oh, wait. 
---
Sometimes Bethesda ui problems are seriously frustrating. 
---
Yeah, i see the gauss and gatling plasma all the time there. 
---
They could just add in the mailboxes that existed in New Vegas and instead of going from location to location they would be account only and accessible by all characters on the account.  Put one at each of the train station vendors.  Boom done.
---
Ah. Beg pardon
---
Those exist. The misc mod dense 
---
Guys they got your money already.
---
I'm honestly hyped about tomorrow's article, I hope not to be disappointed!
---
I'll give you a thumbs up for this one, this is way more better typed out.
---
Truthfully maybe, this is just a sequel to fallout 4 ( More so a single line origin story). A "co-op" game or whatever you wanna call it. 
---
Content wise for say fallout 3 to fallout 4, I don't know about that. I'd say they made some piss poor changes giving a voice protagonist and a dialog wheel equal to the crap mass effect "I'm good guy or I'm a bad guy." The RPG elements for sure have gone down hill.
---
An oh yeah, its a company that has a online game with no sub. they are trying to make money anyway they can. Plus the stocks for game companies went to shit, check out pretty much any vid from this guy.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/user/YongYea/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/YongYea/videos)
---
I already payed 60 during preorder, I think they were advertising that I would get a copy of Fallout 1 &amp; 2 if I preordered at that time. But then they gave it away to everyone that had played before Jan. or something like that. Haven't seen anyone mention it but thought it was pretty funny. Content updates were already mentioned to be free. Atom store crap you can get doing weeklies and dailies if you wanna go free, the whole system isn't as bad as say SWTOR. Price wise and content, its pretty sad atm. Like to see if they actually bring out the loot boxes rofl, it'll be another shit storm if they do.
---
Right now tho, I'm enjoying the lore, I think it was Oxhorn that said its more like your a detective trying to solve mysteries. After I  get done with that ill probably just go back to Divine Divinity. It's the first one before Divinity original sin if you ever played those games.
---
Over all I'm pretty sure I got my 60 bucks with of this game an more. I don't buy bull crap off shops and they already said the updates were going to be free. If they go back on there word I'm out, easy as that. I got Pathfinder: kingmaker, Divine Divinity, Fallout 1 &amp; 2 (maybe, already watched oxhorn play one), Cyberpunk 77 is coming, The Outer Worlds is coming, &amp; Realms Beyond is coming. Hoping this will be a good year, well see.
---
Has it been confirmed anywhere that you won't get banned for using external QOL mods like this or the perk loadouts mod?
---
I didn't hear of anyone being banned for mods like this so far, but as far as i know they didn't ban people using Cheat Engine until a couple of weeks later, so i would rather have an official confirmation that i won't get banned for this
---
Obi-Wan’s going to kill me!
---
Later in jan
---
haha Man I played all winter break already get maybe 150 hours?
---
Thanks for your response! I’m thinking of doing a 3 part post, glad to know the wall of text isn’t overkill 
---
"Happy wife, etcetera!"
---
Unless you're prepared for it, soloing a queen is annoying and not worth the ammo.
---
Yeah, it's a note called the G.A.S. Certificate or something.
---
Go on...
---
Farming an area to get items is common in MMOs, farming one area from level 1 or 2 to max is not so common.
---
Yeah the duping exploit can be fixed, it's just nothing is being done to players that abuse it. Maybe Bethesda is keeping them around since they know these players will find a new duping exploit so they can fix it, and once they can't find no more methods of duping that's probably when the ban hammer will hit.
---
I wouldn't say never, there is one game I know of that relaunched and was successful after it, Final Fantasy XIV, although they basically redid the whole game.
---
&gt; until I need to repair a plant and I've done that exactly once.
---
Don't, juat scrap it and rebuild it; it's free that way.
---
Holy crap, OP's post history.  Does very little other than pissing on things.  Plus MLP or something.
---
So you're saying that people criticize the game every time bethesda screws up but that is somehow a bad thing?  Maybe if they actually did something good regarding the franchise it would be perceived better, but 76 on the whole was a low effort cash grab that only succeeded in ruining their reputation as a premium game company
---
And if you haven’t noticed they have slowly started curing the dupe glitch. What it comes down to is single player duping is done using a bag with infinite storage. Set a storage limit on all world bags. It truly is that simple and I assume when the next huge patch is released it will be fixed. I assume they haven’t fixed it yet because they’re either getting everything prepared for a mass ban or a mass wipe before they release the fix that they implement. It would be a waste of time for them to wipe when the glitch is still there or fix the glitch with the dupe mules running around. It’s not that I’m crying about it. I’ve stated I agree with one mass wipe. But I also understand that they have to fix the source before implementing any of their fixes. They keep putting a bandaid on it in hopes it will slow the duper’s down. But as long as they can dupe, they will continue to sell items for real money as well as flood the market with the latest best items. 
---
Just follow the main quest and eventually you will get steered towards the enclave.  
---
Did you tag along with friends to launch the nuke? 
---
I can’t imagine putting in all of the effort to clear a silo and drop a nuke just to *maybe* kill the 3 people that didn’t simply fast travel out of the way, especially in a game with virtually zero penalty for death.   
---
This will make duping and mule characters worse rhought...
---
You need go be out of your power armor, place it on a station, then go to the repair/modify menu. Go to the broken piece(s) and click repair. A menu will pop up showing you how many you have out of how many you need 
---
The hazmat suit does a lot. Just not while wearing PA. I have a prototype version I use that has 1000 rad resist. I sit back with my Tesla at white springs and tag enemies while my friends hammer them down in PA. That way they don't collect a lot of rads and I'm good as well.
---
Morgantown and watoga highschool are my gotos for plastic.
---
I usually come out with 60+ from each.
---
Cigarette packs too.
---
Oh yea, i know.  Just saying to check the sky for some people.  
---
I died under the scorch queen on the ground but my baggie spawned in the sky.  
---
Bind on pick up shoulda been a thing. Or bind on equip. 
---
Worked in other games.. to a point
---
Not for power armor.
---
Yes that possible and I think you have since someone told me in the data of 76 you can read that „DLC01“ actually is attached to it, but if you would mind looking into your stash? Got a TSE single action revolver as a reward if you want that
---
I’ll take the powder pistol, what do you want for it?
---
👍
---
It does not go away until killed. There is this hack that if you join a public event, then you can lose it.
---
I refuse to server hop as well but sometimes mother server has different plans to me and I must abide by them.
---
&gt; Cranberry Bog - T60 (+CS)
---
This isn't right.  BoS and Watoga Train vendor sell T51b mods, they're part of the normal farm path for them.
---
I had 3 blue screens yesterday and 2 freezes
---
What I meant was on reddit
---
He wasn't alone there was a 150+ guy with him and they were in the event before I joined it. I launched the nuke and went to my camp for weapons and ammos then only I joined. 😔 But I understand. 
---
Thanks for the response :)
---
I'm pretty good, just browsing through the subreddit, saw this post and remembered you talking about Horrigan yesterday then checked the name and put two and two together
---
&gt; I’ve stated I agree with one mass wipe
---
Would you support weekly wipes, on top of what you have already proposed?
---
Developers needs breaks too, they aren't machines 
---
The nuke zone is just basically a rad storm that spawns some high level enemies depending on where you choose the launch target, the fissure site prime will spawn a guaranteed scorchbeast queen 3* that drops some great stuff and the white springs resort if chosen, will spawn nothing but waves of bloated glowing ones, there you can easily level up 5-10 times and get some rare legendary weapons 
---
Would you like to provide some background info on your survey?  Is this for school, or something else?  Will you be sharing the results?
---
Hmm yes That definitely possible hahah but if you don’t mind, I would appreciate it if you look into your stash to see if it’s really the forest camo
---
Jumpsuit.
---
I guarantee that version will NEVER get stuck in my head! LOL
---
Contrary to popular belief, this engine can do ladders. It's still Gamebryo under the hood. One of the Divinity games used this engine, and it had real, climbing ladders.
---
The problem is Bethesda not the software. But it's still time for a modern engine.
---
 Idk what you’re on about 15-19 because when I was lvl 82 I managed to get 3 handmade blueprints and sold 2 of them from the patrol event from the prison 
---
You got any automatic legendarys? 
---
What you mean by that? Heard f76 bazaar is full of duper’s and scammers... may I find there what I’m looking for?
---
Hearing those turrets constantly going off is also really irritating. 
---
You have to place the Power Armor Frame (with or without parts on it) near the station for the craft and the repair/modify to show as white so you can use it.
---
I thought the game was more fun than Red Dead Online when I started playing a few days ago.
---
Except for the constant server connection issues.
---
But now my game freezes 3 seconds after I load in so I can't play any more.  So I'm a bit disappointed with the $40 I spent on it, because it was starting to be a bit fun.
---
Nah, that would be ridiculous. I could get behind major locations having a legendary boss but every radio tower, power station, and filtration site having one would be really dumb.
---
So enemies aren't directly affected but instead new different enemies can spawn? At least in Whitesprings.
---
That power armor was most likely a mission reward
---
I spent a long time molding my character's face and must have done a good job with it with how my buddies drool over her. (It's kind of creepy) would be great to be able to save it
---
Just look for the meat pile.  We had that happen a few days ago and after a fair bit of searching (and getting hardened/glowing/high-radiation things) we found her meat pile in a small ditch...  I agree with other folks, they need something better than a meat pile with buzzing flies (though that DOES help to find them in a nuke zone...).  Something that sticks out in a nuke zone like make them glowing meat piles...
---
Like I posted on the exact same thread made for the exact same topic those turrets from other people’s camp helped me level up so I’ll help defend those camps.
---
Figured
---
There's a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) that allows you to do that, actually. Ever since Bethesda confirmed folks weren't being banned for interface-only mods, I've been using it and it's fantastic.
---
Do you have the building plan for the Power Armor Workstation?
---
🤔
---
Yes Aliens exist in the Fallout universe. In 4 you have to kill three of them and you get an alien blaster. You have to have the 'wacky wasteland' (wierd maybe?) Perk
---
Especially when Bethesda told us last time that their communication should be better. So what do they do, they communicate even less. :)
---
And potentially offensive creature types, too. There's a reason for myths that make cannibalism taboo. And it's not because everything is great and no one is desperate enough to potentially resort to it...
---
I’m on Xbox what’s your fat man going for, I can trade you some flux cuz I’ve only got 1k caps
---
This is an online MP with PVP.  It is part of the game mechanic.  He is no bully.   He didnt keep picking on the guy or chasing him around the map.  
---
He contested a claimed workshop and won.  Took materials he rightfully won.  
---
He has every right to do what ever he wants with it.  
---
yes. but it capped 90%
---
I only just got it
---
yeah I didn't believe there was an issue because a I read  comment's and rumor's its because of  empirical evidence from playing not only fallout 76 but the other fallout games. Other non Bethesda as well. I'm not sure how it works but it must have something to do with accessing a database of items. Each line item appears to increase the response time. 
---
Yeah its happening alot for everyone besides the ppl that try to say nothing wrong with the game. I can't do alot of stuff I was able to do a week ago crash, infinite loadscreen etc. Crazy thing I hardly get kicked from the server but crash twice ever hour or 2.
---
the mule already has stacks of everything, you can just drop it on the ground and have the second person pick it up, dont need to trade it, wouldnt work, would only make life harder for everyone
---
That would work, but it's easy and lazy to push this on the user. From a professional point of view it's bad design. Speak to anyone who works in design or developes UIs.

---
The charred ghouls become into glowing bloated ones and some death claws have spawned there before, but rarely.
---
But mostly glowing ones
---
Yes! Yes! Yes! From what I hear it’s much cheaper than the original $60 price anyway.
---
It’s buggy ( name one MMO that isn’t) and needs and will get a lot of TLC, but not even close to being broken like the hate train spews.
---
It is different, in a vary lonely way playing by yourself at first, seems odd and I didn’t like it. At first I hated the lack of “human npcs” ( figured I’d clarify since some idiots would undoubtedly comment “but they do have npcs)
---
I also hated all the inventory management and we still don’t have enough stash space ( thanks dupers).
---
Once you get used to the mechanics and get some good QOL perks inventory management becomes much less of a hassle.
---
But with that being said I fell in LOVE with this game, is it my all time favorite, not at all. Is it still a great fallout game with some of the most emotionally moving stories, I’m my opinion hell yes.
---
I’ve been playing since day 1 and am lvl 94.
---
My tips for enjoying it are to:
---
  Don’t expect Fallout 5 (it’s not it and wasn’t meant to be, and never will be)
---
Take you time and enjoy the environment, try not to rush through to fast, listen to the holos and read the notes. ( I’m guilty of running through to fast at first and missing good story pieces, pretty much anytime I grouped up really)
---
DO NOT start out hoarding every damn thing like me and everyone else or you’ll be aggravated 2 hours in when your stash is already full. Once you get used to using grenades, food, chems, ammo, etc as you pick it up it’ll make your life a lot easier, actually feels liberating to just ignore most junk now.
---
If you need help or get lonely just send some invites some will decline, some will accept. Personally I don’t play with volume or a mic because I only play while my baby sleeps, but when low levels send me an invite because I jump in when they bight off more than they can chew. I accept, thumbs up emote, drops some chems and ammo, and then have them follow me to the cranberry bog so they can shit themselves as we fight off strong ass enemies. 
---
In other games from BGS i collected items and decorated my in game home.
---
In Fallout 76, i think its just that hope that we can use them as decoration some day.
---
....stays in the nuke zone. 
---
Probably didn’t download the drivers
---
Ok, and? If there's a movie you want to see, but you aren't able to rent it, do you just buy it? And, if so, should Target or Walmart refund your money because you knew exactly what the movie was about, but decided you didn't like it afterward?
---
You can't rent food at a restaurant, do you get a refund when you claim you didn't like it? Nope.
---
You're wrong here. Do better research and exercise a little common sense with your next purchase. You people are the reason normal people have to deal with angry customer service reps. 
---
Yup
---
he nearliy got me killed once i was doing a daily quest in the mire and all the sudden he comes out of no where and starts talking to me and the wendigoes that where near by came and  killed me
---
They really need to fix the servers, I get disconnected at least 3 times a day. And its fucked up you can't return to the same server. How am I supposed to make friends!?
---
It's a bug since BETA. I don't think any "important" person has reported it tho so it's gone unnoticed.
---
yeah, it's a bummer cause it's the only good barrel
---
I don't really nees flux, you got any legendary weapons ? 
---
Hey man I got pretty good at using the weapon wheel to switch between six of the black powder pistols. Captain Longshanks wouldn’t have it any other way. 
---
It’s been awhile since I’ve done it because I usually just take the loss now, but what I used to do is manually go onto people’s profiles through PSN. I cannot remember the exact layout off by heart, but either I would remember a certain easy name in the lobby, or I would go to friends and there should be a recently played with tab that you can choose and that’s how I did it.
---
 the whole in-game recent players is either bugged or misleading, I’m starting to think it’s in fact not recent but a log of the current players you are playing with as it lists everyone on the server, and greys out the people who leave, or their name disappears, this may have been corrected in a patch tho.. 
---
but it still doesn’t work as intended because when you leave the server that list wipes, so that’s kinda why I begun to think it was actually just a list of who you are playing with but I don’t actually know. 
---
Sort by spoil?
---
duplication is problem.
---
I have got a suppressors 40%power attack +1 strength board tho if you want that
---
Wonder what his wanted level is after awhile. I wouldn’t mind having those bounty caps. 
---
I'd love it. The thing I liked about elder scrolls online was the shared storage. Got my warrior character and then my crafter. That would be dope in this game. Shit, let me trade out characters that share a camp and box.
---
Nobody is getting banned, just relax. People are selling TSE guns and caps on Ebay and Reddit for real money. If they're not getting banned, you're not getting banned. Based on what their tech support says, they don't have the *capacity* to track down people based on what they do in game, short of those people doing something stupid on video, with their account name clearly visible. And sometimes not even then.
---
OK, so, we're talking high explosives vs gunpowder (firecrackers), so the bullet has more power - but, it's still a *bullet sized* explosive.  
---
Losing fingers is when you are HOLDING the firecracker - tightly before a small "regular" firecracker will damage you, or resting on skin (but still basically right on your hand) for a larger firecracker.
---
But, read this article - a woman lit a quarter stick of dynamite (thinking it was a candle) and she "may lose a finger" and suffered injuries to her face.  She's not some super tough warrior dude, and she's NOT WEARING ARMOR.

---
cant be that boring since you posted here then came back 4 hours later to post again
---
No , just that sub is primarily for trading... so you’re more likely to find someone there
---
Sounds like you’re upset 
---
Yeah, would have been much better, i myself found an explosive the dragon which would probably be worth a lot if not for the duped items.
---
I agree with the OP, we need better indication on remaining time.  For the love of God though, give me a sort that shoots all my crafted food *To The Top Of The List!*
---
Dupers will have an endless supply of resources going forward. They will be able to buy everything on the market before others. How can someone who didn't dupe compete with a duper who can literally offer anything duped at zero cost.
---
Think of it like dupers printing money, they are the Venezuela and they destroyed the economy. Endless caps/items, and unless you too printed money you can't buy shit comparably because you have to spend time to get yours going forward compared to them not spending anything.
---
They have endless caps from duped nuka colas, can offer everything for anything they want. See the problem now?
---
Yeah that's a huge problem too I'm just voicing my opinion about this right now. I despise dupers the most
---
There is no endgame. To call that and white spring endgame is so depressing. They better figure out the new dlc and a new, real endgame quick. Also, then NEED to ban dupers with a million items in their inventory before player vendors. 
---
Posting as a top level comment what I mentioned elsewhere: I really suspect they store character data in save files on a hard disk and not in a database, just like all other Fallout and TES games do. Reason being their total lack of in game support for things like lost items, and the fact that they can't locate dupers by the thousands upon thousands of weapons, ammo, junk, aid, etc. Instead of writing some simple database queries they'd have to load up the save file somehow and check. So I wouldn't hold my breath on this. Their best bet is probably to remove the explosive affix and replace it with something balanced like additional energy damage. And then increase level cap to 100 so the existing ones slowly become irrelevant.
---
For junk, I'd take a radical approach of a 1 month period warning you to use all your junk on stuff you need. Then just create new item IDs for each junk item to replace the old ones. Stockpiles of the old item IDs become useless trash and the playerbase has ample time to use what they have.  Everyone suffers a little bit of lost junk, basically what you couldn't manage to use beforehand, but it's a cleansing fire. Drink a little poison today so you don't overdose tomorrow.
---
Yeah, it should.
---
How do you report hackers to Bethesda??
---
I just find it disdainful when people want to make a game ridiculously easy
---
 There never was not is a forced trade glitch. So many run in fear over a rumour or someone that didn't understand what really happened to them. It's a flaw in the menu system. I'm tired of hearing about the forced trade. You were selling them something. As you set the price they requested your weapon or any item. Causing the menu to switch to that. they bought that item for what price you set it at without noticing it changed. That's it.
---
Exactly downvote the comment because you know you wont win this argument, fucking tard 
---
They are crazy amazing. I thought the one in the game was nuts. That's one thing about Fallout - I learn stuff about our real world that is stranger than fiction. Like the Nuka Quantum is based off a real world drink that had radium in it.
---
I think (and could very well be wrong) that you can check this at the tinker's workbench. If you can make the ultracite ammo for it I believe that means you can make the correlating receiver. 
---
Much weaker? There is barely any difference in the resistances of underarmors. The real difference is their stat buffs. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/
---
Yes, exactly… so u/dastig's comment that u/mutad0r's remarks "can be said about nearly every Fallout or for most Bethesda games" is untrue. Fallout 76 in lieu of being an online game has some different mechanics in play that may seem similar from an in-front-of-the-screen perspective but are very different in terms of in-game "lore".
---
Yeah, but I'd need another legendary two shot to pair with my current for swashbuckling fun!  Pillage!
---
From what I understand. No wanted. People pick HIS locks at HIS camp. That makes those people wanted. He’s doing the lords work by dispatching them
---
The level 50 cap isn't even that problematic, after all its just a number.
---
The problem is the game was never balance tested, and given level 99+ doesn't even visually show properly I think they released this with no understanding of what level players would reach so soon after launch.
---
Although there is resource grind in the game, let's be honest, it's trivial to acquire anything you need with minimal work. I have probably only died a handful of times during all of my time playing (excluding messing around at Whitesprings with PVP as a joke). There's just no challenge to much of the game (including finding food/water or building a workshop).
---
So "no balance" isn't just "TSE's are OP" its seeing people who have just started playing in full on power armor farming at Whitesprings. That should never have happened.
---
Damn a TSE 50 cal sounds op af your lucky lmao 
---
Oh, I'm not recommending carrying everything around with you by any stretch of the imagination. I use Thru-Hiker for food and water. Traveling Pharmacy for Stims/Chems and the 1 pt into the Junk Perk and 2 pts into the Armor one. 
---
Best advice I guess I could give is - you hardly need more than 50 of most pieces of junk. Certainly less than 100 and up to 200 of a few. 
---
I also don't save weapons or armor unless I know I will use it.
---
But I can understand people holding more because it is cool ... but is it cool if you don't use it?
---
This 100%. F those guys
---
&gt; Deleting items is a GREAT way to piss off your community. And is a terrible suggestion.
---
Agree.  People who are suggesting to do that, or delete the explosive affix, are just ignorant beyond belief.
---
Don't listen to him hes full of shit, trying to be a modderator that doesnt even know its own subreddit rules.
---
Bucket wheel excavators and large machinery in general are not only cool to look at but engineering marvels.
---
Why would people spend money on items wtf 
---
Yup!  There is a mod for this on PC, banning beware though.
---
I play a lot and I have never seen a base shooting into the golf club.  Is this really an issue or something that rarely happens but people complain anyway?
---
An update about an update...Bethesda lowering the bar yet again :/
---
one man army
---
Nice, I've never been there, I'll have to check it out since I'll be 45 soon and am going to recreate my level 25 excavator armor.  Doing a set at 35 is just a waste of resources for the incremental increase.
---
Boobleheads - 1lb
---
Magazine - 0.2 lbs (Sadly, I have a few in my stash because I want one of each! haha)
---
Where is that?
---
Ah, I’ve got a ton of screws I’ve been farming, but I’m Xbox 
---
Like others said it changes animals but It also changes the plants. Look in the whitesprings bunker armory for single papers lying around. They have a list of what gives you what
---
Incredibly buggy. Unbelievably buggy. I honestly cannot recall a AAA priced title in recent times that was THIS buggy.
---
Also, we haven't had a meaningful patch in almost a month, aside from a couple of hotfixes. It's because of the holidays, but essentially we had a month of patches, and then a month of pretty much nothing. So the game is improving, but unbelievably slowly, given that you can't swing a dead robot and not hit a bug in this game. 
---
Avoid for now. Best guess, give it 3-6 months, and it should be clear where it's going. It's either going to be Mass Effect Andromeda (dead), or No Man's Sky (redemption story). 
---
I've got 1 left right now. 2k if you're interested
---
Unfortunately not but I'll come build one for you on your camp?
---
People want to min/max and brag about what they have. I just hate listening to some douche talk about all their shit when I join a team. I have yet to play in a group in this game where somebody is talking about some cool story related thing or place they have found. That’s not a good sign. 
---
itll be a glorious day when sentry bots are accidentally spawning like crazy
---
That is what I wanted, I'll go find that tonight.
---
Yeah, I just had never seen the rebuild on it before.  I'd never actually had a plant damaged before.  Stupid gulpers. 
---
I agree that they aren't really players. I think most of them have basically skipped the whole game and will leave and lose interest before the legitimate players do. As once you have all this stuff what is there to do? 
---
I've been playing since launch and am closing in on lvl 200 all without any glitches dupes cheats. But it really takes the wind out of my sails when all they do is nerf MY chance of getting better items from playing the game properly..............the dupers are still duping candy etc.
---
&gt;regularly scheduled
---
Literally on random days whenever it suits them.
---
Pretty sure the Git Gud perk is in the game.
---
He probably knows that.. but thing is, to those people that want so badly to see the game succeed because they love the franchise, sometimes taking a hit in order to get very important improvements fast is the most viable thing in long term.
---
Though games are not meant to have a huge life expectancy.. plus there is a high probability that the problems that the game has can be dealt with whitout taking that hit.
---
Whitesprings seems to be the best place for multiple chances of an awesome drop.
---
You can hang around there for an hour and still find legendaries.  Of course I still haven't got my TS or TSE, but some interesting exotics which I ended up selling for dirt.
---
I never have crashes on xbox 
---
I think that's related to what you said earlier in your comment. If your topmost item isn't the one with the lowest CND, then they all appear to spoil at the same time,
---
I have this problem too. I generally just avoid whitesprings unless I have to sell stuff, but when I do it slows down to a slideshow. 
---
You’re lucky, in 161 levels I’ve never seen a TSE weapon drop. On top of that I’ve only seen a TS weapon drop once. 
---
I agree ots should be similar to borderlands 2, where you can put like 5 items in there, so you cant really transfer a whole character but you can keep your fav items
---
I'm not even a melee character but those things annihilate me even in my XO-1.
---
I'd remove the whole CND from food items, as there are enough foods that don't rot, so I never bother with any that do.  
---
My favorite is CTD on fast travel. God damn I hate this game, but I just can't quit it.
---
They’re*
---
Nope, all these are drastic changes that have a negative impact towards the regular player.
---
haha that’s what I was thinking. I’d love to see a video of someone returning and how that plays out 
---
I've had it rapidly drain my ap just looking over certain aid items in my pip boy.
---
Those duper’s better be gone on the second patch if not the first
---
After I help low levels and drop chems, they give me the heart emote..... and then I shoot them in the face and leave. Not to kill them, I just think it’s a good way to say bye in the wastland. Haha
---
excavator did it for me. all of a sudden i could take on more than one mob at a time without dying. 
---
Eve was so badass. Is pretty dead now.
---
Thanks fellas
---
Ban them all!
---
Everyone in this thread is destined to be down voted. 
---
If you say the game hasn't improved a great deal, you'll get down voted for saying the game is bad.
---
If you say the game has improved a lot, you'll get down voted for lying.
---
The fact is, they've made some improvements, created extra bugs, hotfixed a few things and haven't addressed the crashing, server disconnect issues and the item dupe exploit, which are the most impactful on the experience. 
---
Play the game and decide for yourself, most reliable way to tell if the things they've fixed make up for the things they haven't. For some people, the game is in a perfectly acceptable state. If you stopped playing because it was buggy, don't come back expecting much just yet.
---
I thought about this, I am operating under the assumption the duplication exploit is gone. So these are just items people have. 
---
You are right, people can just drop shit and have their friends pick them up, but only to a point... you can only have so many alts, and a level 1 alt isn’t gonna have the best carry weight, so sure you can spend hours filling the inventories of all your alts with all this duplicated shit, but if you can’t pick up anymore items after you reach a point of over encumbrance, unless you have 100 friends all willing to make alts to be your bank, you are gonna just have to drop most of that shit. A stack of 100 handmades is like 1700-2500 pounds. You would need 4 or 5 alts to be fully maxed and unable to pick any more up to just hold those... 
---
I’m not saying it’s perfect. But from a logistics stand point, your average player is not gonna do the math and coordination to keep there duped shit, especially when it isn’t the best items in the game anymore. It doesn’t punish people, it discourages people from holding onto stuff. Which was of course the original intention of having a stash limit in the first place 
---
The CND bar has always behaved the same way. What may seem obvious to you may not be to someone else. Regardless, it's rather pointless to dwell on this and it isn't really meaningful or constructive.
---
I'm fine with his movement speed. I'm not fine with how he gets turned around or just stops for a 5 minute break before continuing onwards. His pathing needs some tweaks.
---
What I would propose is that if they narrowed down the glitching at least, I would support a wipe on Monday’s when the nukes reset. Everyone prepares for the nuke reset anyways if they play consistently. It would just be an addition and allow a week to sort out your items as well as work with the people you play with. I would actually propose one mass dupe ban to begin with for players with 5+ of any TSE to wipe the guys who are duping huge amounts to sell. The ban would put a huge hit into the duping community. Or implement a limit on crafting that when say you pick up 300 of the item used for duping your account is instantly banned or the character you’re using is banned. 
---
She loves it, she's already finished her first playthrough and is going through again to do the side stuff. I played the first bit, but it's a little boring to me. Lol
---
I'm guessing Bethesda didn't think to add "serial numbers" to items from the start.  Asheron's call took forever to add duped-item detection, and that only kicked in when two of the same item were seen online at the same time. 
---
I am on PC but my primary pistols are a 10mm and a .44.  I only whip out the black powder for rare occasions.  Plus I carry a hunting rifle and a combat shotgun for situational use.  Nothing like 50lbs of guns lol!  
---
Thank you for the offer though!
---
They can’t do anything about it now, too late. 
---
People will always find a way around restrictions and fixes, like it or not it’s a human trait.
---
All Bethesda can do is reactively pursue these issues as and when they arise, but unfortunately for us, Bethesda are not the choice company to do such a thing. In fact their half assed attitude to everything is just a “can’t be bothered working today” mentality that any number of working Joes experience every day. It’s just not everyone has a job where millions of people are looking to them for updates, fixes, and help
---
Cool feature! will patch in the future, thanks! 
---
I have three industrial purifiers, and I just sell excess water because it’s like 4 caps each, and it’s just constant cap generation for nothing
---
Honestly the Explosive prefix shouldn't be able to spawn on some weapons. The way it works on shotguns (normally it just adds a flat 15 aoe damage to your shots) is that it adds the damage to each pellet instead of distributing the damage between each pellet. So in reality, for example, instead of doing 80 damage spread between 8 pellets, making 10 damage per pellet, you're realistically doing 200 damage per shot, with 25 damage per pellet. It's been busted for shotguns since it was introduced in Fallout 4. 
---
It can also make automatics super threatening, since your small 20-25 damage per shot auto rifle is now doing upwards of 40 per shot.
---
wow is that loss
---
if you buy the nuka cola machine you should be able to store colas. 
---
It should be easy if you take the time to legit find one. Think of how rewarding it would be to be farming till lvl300 and you finally got a tse
---
X01 Jetpack - I had picked it up my 2nd trip to the Armory Vendor (EVER at level 79ish) and had not finished making my suit of X01. 
---
Headed back to my camp to make it and at some point I had used it making bullets or some inane something or other. 
---
I'll find it again, it wasn't heart breaking or game ending. Just sad that it happened.
---
i agree basically, but this comparison doesn't fly. its software, and thus a piece of it this big and multiplayer is almost impossible to test without the real load of players. also even in cars software is broken all the time. software is different to other real world stuff. a combustion engine is nothing as complex as a huge computer game. the problem there is that cars cant be copied.
---
that said, they would needed to do a real beta or even early access. (sure it would've generated a similar amount of hate)
---
in comparison of the hate PUBG and MHW received for their super flawed games on release, the amount 76 received is completely over the top. its not really about the game and never was. the game is real fun with more than average bugs. but hey even praised red dead redemption failed to deliver promised features (multiplayer) on release and then it was also buggy.
---
Not really. I expect server/profile wipes from indie games on Steam (like Rust or DayZ). This shit is from a major studio and I expect them to have hired people who know what they're doing and also allow the resources necessary to issue immediate patches all through the first few weeks of launch.
---
This didn't happen. Bethesda dropped the ball after release and has paid no attention to this game. They've promised better communication but I've not seen any.
---
I had a bit of luck by minimizing the game (I just hit the windows key). It tends to unclog itself.
---
I do wonder though, what **in the actual FUCK** is it loading?! I mean, loads often take 45-60 seconds for me, on SSD. That is insane. FO4 loaded in 10 seconds, 15 tops. Witcher 3 about the same. Many other games, including recent AC games, which are *vastly* visually superior both in polygon count, texture resolution, etc., etc., all load significantly faster. With this game's textures, it should be loading lickety split. 
---
Anybody else think certain foods shouldn't spoil? I understand there are definitely some good dishes that boost stats, but most of the time it doesn't seem worth it to craft more complicated foods that need like 4 or 6 ingredients because they'll just end up going back in an hour.  Better to just hold onto water most of the time.
---
I actually used the correct grammar. "There" can be used as a exclamation to point towards a object or a point you want to make
---
Oh F*** yes, I need to go there anyway for the brotherhood quest line.  Time for some looting and basic training!
---
"And he's standing right behind me, isn't he?
---
thats looks like a screenshot from fallout 4 but the same aliens are in the files and the prima guide
---
If they made it easier to sell loot to vendors for in-game caps, the black market wouldn't be so huge.  200 caps per day, per vendor faction?  No room to let inflation/deflation happen with in-game currency.
---
Or the Assaultrons with 50 laser beams.
---
I think it does count for the same person, my boyfriend and I prettymuch only play together and I have it
---
**What you might have meant to say...** Will players that have cheated by accident get banned? I ended up with multiples of CAMP items, but it was by accident. It only happened once a long time ago, but never again afterwards. If players used duped mutation serums, will they lose the effects, or keep them active? Also, what will happen to duplicated guns that were given out?
---
**OK to answer your questions:**
---
There is still a lot of guesswork when people talk about bans. Bethesda has only banned a small amount of people so far, but for different offenses, and there is currently NO clear answer as to if/when exploiters will get banned. 
---
A lot of CAMP items were duped, and that is mostly due to a patch that was rolled out by Bethesda. Every once in a while, my entire CAMP still gets duplicated, and I end up with extra parts that have to be broken down. There were videos online that showed HOW to force duplications, but they most likely will not have a way to detect who forced the dupe, and who was affected by their glitch. 
---
As for weapons and mutations, no one knows if, how, or when they may punish people. The game is flooded with duped/glitched guns/mutations/items, but again, everyone is unsure how this will be handled by Bethesda.
---
yeah that is a much better option if it is available in your area for sure, not everyone has that option though. The only reason I mention it is because Bethesda themselves offered refunds for PC players then retracted it, meaning even they knew how many issues they had to address.
---
Also a lot of games are going digital so rentals are probably becoming less and less.
---
That's another thing... I've tried that, and nope... it sorts... but there will be non-spoilables in the middle of spoiled items... and once you use something. Sorting by spoil should be all spoiling items up at the top... but doesn't do that. it's just some weird random order.
---
Kings are the worst for me - it seems like my burst damage on sneak attacks is way bugged on them.  Even if I hit them in the head with a covert boosted BPR it still only takes off just 1/5th of the health bar.
---
It isn't nonsense. You can twist and turn it any way you like, but Bethesda won't be gaining new players by banning existing ones, no matter if guilty of duping or not. Judging by the amount of witch hunty posts about the duping on this sub, like this one, and the next one that'll be on this sub's front page next week, and so forth and so forth, there's quite a few dupers or people with duped items. So that's quite a chunk of their playerbase they'd be cutting out. ''Good riddance'', you'd say, of course.
---
&gt; They are simply illegal dealers.
---
Not all dupers or dupe item users are selling their shit to begin with, assuming all of them do is such a stupid generalization to begin with. At this point you're just demonizing dupers the best you can.
---
&gt; They are not gamers. They don't play this game.
---
If they don't, then why is there a post about them on the front of this sub every week.
---
Some people just don't care for grinding legendary enemies and getting fuckall (you know, an ongoing bug that's been present since release and well documented everywhere), so they turn to people who have an easy way out. Understandably so. Your interpretation of what those kind of players are or aren't doesn't change a thing about the fact that they are players of this game, and Bethesda really doesn't seem to be in a position where they should start cutting a chunk of their playerbase out considering the fucking avalanche of bad press they've already rightfully called upon themselves with this game's astronomically botched release. Best for them to just fix the dupe bug now and accept that they fucked up, because there is no way they can track down every duper or duped item if they can't even fix the most basic of problems with their own game.
---
I have strength for both heavy weapons and melee. When I need to save ammo, I have to go in and switch back and forth. That's 3 cards at least, making an interaction with 6 cards total. Not fun. 
---
Ayy, another Ana main.
---
Are you on PC? I will gladly pay the caps for those!
---
Thats what I meant....the stat bonus. Vault tech is mvp for sure. 
---
You can't scrap them, I always sell or give away
---
what console do you play on?
---
DAMMIT TODD HOWARD YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN
---
Nope, it was a set another player left out in the world somewhere. XO1 with mods and paint. Pretty wild. 
---
Point one - true
---
Point two - true
---
Point three - true
---
Point four- oh yep you were, stumbling off pockets bulging.  Then you gave most away to gain favour.  Using your I'll gotten gain for more bullets.
---
Point five - sure you feel guilty, but your going to do it again, aren't you.  Wonder if next one will have a TSE shorty.  Or maybe the guy is contacting a Duper for a gun about now.
---
Anyway good thread keep on posting.
---
Yeah, ban the sort modders... let the server crashing dupers go free!
---
Yeah you could do that with any legendary you want but what than after that? Then the rest of the game is a breeze and no effort to kill massive swaths of enemies that would usually be a issue
---
&gt; On the contrary, what you should do in such situation is, obviously first stabilise the situation (fix the damned duping), and then add new weapons.
---
While I agree that the first step is to fix duping, I don't see how adding new weapons is going to make the old weapons obsolete. If anything it'll just give the meta a lot of power creep as Bethesda rushes to put out more and more powerful weapons, instead of bringing up some older weapons to a similar level of power, or by reducing the power on some currently-existing overpowered guns.
---
they said the schedule is now every Wednesday. 
---
Which I get is a totally made up fake day. Wednesday! Have you ever heard such a thing!
---
I managed to find a 2shot dragon and an explosive dragon. pitty they weren't on the same rifle, though each one can one shot a 80ish scorchbeast if it lands and i can sneak shot in its ear cavity
---
Maybe your name is more common in New England area so that is why Codsworth knew but uncommon in WV so its not recognized.
---
Have you looked at the prize voucher lol?  With the amount it says you owe the sweepstakes company he would need good damage resistance hahaha.
---
He reminds me of the Annoying Fan from Oblivion.  At least with that guy you could take him to a cliff and order him to leave you alone and if he was standing between you and the cliff he would run straight off to his death because he was programmed to run directly away from you lol.
---
Prizebot ranks up right under the DMV quest lol.
---
I’m fairly sure it works doing it for the same character. My boyfriend and I pretty much exclusively play together or alone and I have it
---
The only official statement I could find is, that mods are not supported. A bit vague.

It just amps the enemies up for the most part.  So whatever enemies are normally there you get stronger versions.  Whitesprings already has ghouls, they all become lvl 60 bloated glowing versions.  
---
To see what sort of flux is in going to appear you can go to the armory room in whitesprings, there are notes laying around that explain what plants turn into what flux.  So whitesprings for example iirc it has a bunch of fluorescent, prime fissure is a lot of crimson, but all areas have most types of flux the only question is how much.  
---
Pro tip: use green thumb to get 2 flux per plant and make sure to collect glowing and hardened masses and high radiation fluids as you need 1 of each plus 10 raw flux  to make stable flux.    
---
Also it should be noted the rads are way stronger than a normal rad storm.  Use PA + chems, a hazmat suit, and/or group up and use the rad healing perk to mitigate it.
---
Yup it’s pretty bad, I even have an external and I don’t think it does a thing for it. Shouldn’t really have to though.
---
As long as they're allowing infinite overburdening, why zap someone with 50 million junk?  I paid for two copies of FO76, and use one (when my son's not playing) to hold a server open so I can mule mats to a second character for later use/sale.
---
as always, 42 is the answer
---
Drop one, kill queen, drop another, kill queen?
---
What then? you beat the game. By then you got your money's worth im sure. I don't play any game indefinitely.
---
Now this is discourse.
---
Between the two of us, it sounds like we've come up with a pretty good solution, or at least, workaround until a more permanent solution is found.
---
Now, don't you think all the name calling and whatnot was unnecessary?  
---
one of the mirelurk recipes is bacon wrapped scallops I think
---
Yes - the extreme high damage combinations with tweaking your character with the optimal Perk combos and weapons results in insanely bullshit OP damage - they need to scale back the multiplying and limit the higher damage ranges, like using an inverse log clamp to scale down the higher damage ranges...
---
On the other hand a level 100 character shouldn't have trouble killing rad rats and crickets with rifle.
---
I honestly think that an account-stash would probably just be loaded with purified water and duplicate blueprints for me.
---
I mean... you can get even the worst weapons in the game to be 1 shot kills on most enemies with the right perks, armors, and mutations. Fo76 is just an easy game period with or without TSE weapons. 
---
Could that be the number indicating the quantity of plans he has available. 
---
so thats what that was i found one the other day but idk where it was. it was a flat disk on a cliffside that said how high from sea level i was.
---
Fix the exploit and delete all characters.
---
Um, it puts things that degrade at the bottom of the list. Not saying your wrong cuz you could be bugged but whenever i have cooked food and drinks and i sort by spoil they are always at the bottom.
---
At this point though i only eat and drink canned dog food and purified water so i know where my foof and drink are without sorting.
---
Maybe they forgot. 
---
That would explain a lot actually.

Since I forgot to put it in the post, the picture above was taken at Wendigo cave

I've seen someone mention this before, but i'll parrot it nontheless; 
---
If you have a nuka cola machine and a power source nearby, any nuka cola you put inside should get the 'ice-cold' or 'chilled' prefix after a certain amount of time passes, making their effects stronger or longer-lasting.
---
A sub full of people shouting into the void, and waiting for a response. They modified their single player game to be multiplayer. It was a pretty poor modification too. There is no way they built in tools to track items, or events like this. Heck they haven't bothered to fix bugs that have been solved by mods for years. There is zero chance they can, or will build in the tools need to accomplish this task. 
---
Either deal with it or stop playing. The cheating is here to stay, and there is little Bethesda can do to stop it. If you expect complex technical solutions to problems from Bethesda you clearly haven't been paying attention. They do open world games, and mod tools well enough that their fans can fix their game. Don't expect technical miracles from Bethesda. Expect more patches to address serious issues, and a decent content patch every 1-3 months, and expect more bugs, and glitches. 
---
the more mods you put on a gun the more weight it has. The higher the weight the more action points it uses in vats and maybe more negative side effects, not sure if it affects reload speed?
---
How about a full no friendly fire perk card?
---
It is indeed. :)

Alot of people seem to want violet flux lately  time to get farmin!

Is this the gamer equivalent of getting coal in your stocking? Lol
---
Day 1 on this subreddit were 500 ideas on how to make the game better. They touted this game as long term yet the platinum trophy falls into your lap within 76 hours.
---
Brotherhood is 10/8/4 DR/ER/RR +2 Strength and +2 Endurance. Enclave is 9/13/5 +3 Strength +2 Perception. Vault Tec is 5/5/5 +1 Strength +2 Endurance +2 Intelligence +2 Luck.....not sure what link was to I just went off my inventory.
---
agreed, especially with the level thing, it’s as if they forgot that people love to Dump thousands of hours into their games.... a lot of people are saying it’s too late to fix the game due to the problems you are outlying, and I agree with them and you, there are serious balance issues. So I guess my one theme is make the game harder for those people. Make whitesprings farming, something a low level would do, in order to be able to do accomplish harder events. Not the only thing to do.... I’d be happy to never go to that golf club again. 
---
Finally, on the point of the weapon cap, I agree it’s just a number, and if the game was perfect, it wouldn’t matter at all. but it isn’t, and I think it’s a viable
---
Response to the literal hundreds of thousands of duplicated end game weapons floating around. The only way to attempt to correct it without directly punishing players is to make what’s out there, old news... 
---
I'd bet that a mining helmet is not a mining hat.
---
that stuff is hilarious 
---
Is there anyway we could get some blueprints on how to build this? Would love to make one in the Mire
---
Hahahahhahaha
---
That little pool area by the clubhouse spawned 2 legendarios for me yesterday. One was a TSE Black powder rifle. 
---
Maybe it’s just like their attitude since release with communication, in-game stuff, server issues, fixes.... they just can’t be bothered 
---
Ha!  I didnt play Oblivion long enough to meet that character.  Thank goodness!  And how have I not read the voucher?  I mean I thought I won something.  He always shows up at the worst time though so I probably just went "yeah yeah" and put it with the rest of the junk in my inventory and forgot about it.  LOL.    Oh man that DMV quest...worse circle jerk than the actual DMV!  
---
Legolas...elves...i wish we could be elves or there were elves...i always miss elves in games without them!

I play on pc it's in my post
---
I only know the hump day. Is it the same?
---
Think I have seen at least 4 hats that I would try, but it sounds one I'll skip.  Two without lights but different names.  One with a modern light and one old time style.  I'll follow your thread to see if you have success👍
---
oh fuck i don’t have my glasses. my bad 😂
---
No I don't think so, pretty sure that is listed in brackets behind the plan (2) for example. I think they just variations of lights .. I have seen them for other items as well.
---
Dude, you obviously like the game, which is fine. But it is incredibly obvious in your comments that you are grasping at straws and making desperate arguments because at heart you just like the game and want to defend it. Half the "fixes" you mentioned weren't even fixes, they were attempts, and AFAIK Bethesda hasn't even aknowledged the duping issues to this day, so even your mention of them "attempting" to fix it is desperate and with lack of any evidence. You said they "improved, but didn't totally fix" camp placement. *Camp placement*.
---
And this last response of yours is just desperate straw man bullshit. I never said any of those things. I am not an "armchair programmer" because I am criticizing objective faults with the game, a game I paid $60 for. I am completely entitled to complain about a game that was essentially released in an alpha state for $60. You could make the same tired "armchair developer" argument for any game, but it is *objectively true* that the game has countless bugs, glitches, optimization issues, and crashes, and yes, I get to complain about them because Bethesda released it knowing it was shit to get my $60 instead of taking another 6 months to a year to fix basic shit. This is not an isolated incident with Bethesda, and your desperate fanboy defense is just further giving them license to release a reskinned game full of bugs and glitches for $60 every year or two.
---
And no, I am not a game developer, but clearly the guy who literally worked for Blizzard was, and he is telling you you're wrong. 
---
I had the same problem. Sometimes the game is very unclear. I was nearly level 30 before I realized you had to click on a bobblehead to 'eat it' (or use it I guess).
---
I really want to try this, but it sounds suspiciously like the kind of thing some people call cheating (gaming?) the system. 
---
Raises the question.
---
Yes, thank you for the reply. I got help with both already, though it was a pain in the butt to get me killed with birdbone and healing factor mutation lol
---
Well shit....I thought I did have it....I don't.
---
its kinda stupid, since my regular instigating combat shotgun does mostly fine.  One shots the fat ghouls in whitespring (not the green ones), but only if I actually aim centermass.
---
does respectable damage to bigger things too, just have to aim for the head.
---
One additional attribute that would need to be probably a 256-bit? value.  It would have to be able to handle a unique value for EVERY single item ever spawned (at least any that has a 1 cap value or more). Then, every item on every character on every account would have to be compared to every other characters' loot - most likely every time a player logs into a server/world.
---
Not an insignificant amount of processor to deal with just doing this comparison.
---
are you saing that one method that was in fortnite is in this game to
---
where you switch from 1 shotgun to the other and you can just quickliy fire off alot of shotgun blast
---
It was, in comparison to what people are expecting for Fallout 76, miniscule, allowing you to only store 4 items at a time.
---
I'm sure I don't understand your vulgar slang, sir. 
---
Lighting in general is fantastic in 76 for sure. Nice shot.
---
If you're in ps4 i can help ya kill 'er later tonight.
---
I'm still playing skyrim but point still stands. By that time you will already 1 shot enemies but the game will still have difficulty even if it is minimal there is still a threat of dying. With tse weapons the only way you will die is either by sbq or yourself

The only armour I have received from her is wooden. It is like a troll item. 
---
depends on if the bots are doing an auto draw still or not, which seems to be the case
---
Lucky, yeah last night they nuked it, I put my gear on and was there for touchdown, about another 8 players showed up. And by the 15 minute mark we barely had her down to 2/3 of health. Not to mention no one was taking care of ads besides me and a level 34. 
---
What’s the healing factor mutation? I’m still figuring out what each of them do
---
I went into the settings for random protection and added fallout76 to its list of exceptions and it seems to work!
---
Sigh. 
---
I don’t have to drop my guns on the ground before repairing them. Fucking Bethesda. 
---
Ok, thanks for the info. I’ll get myself all fixed up. 
---
I agree with you. I’ve literally never server hopped for any reason other than feeling like my current server was lagging. 
---
Probably still on holiday
---
Unfortunate, hope it gets better man!
---
What’s the healing factor mutation do? I’m still figuring out all the mutations
---
I would only need 3: scorchbeast flying, scorchbeast grounded, no PA.
---
Yeah but you still have challenges but with tse weapons there is no longer a challenge you can kill glowing bloated ghouls by the dozens with no difficulty
---
Two different hats.
---
I was thinking oh the game engine couldn't handle that but I remembered nuka world had a ton of working rollercoasters
---
No lie.  "Oh shit, a pebble!  I'm stuck here for 5 minutes!"
---
Counterintuitively, it does put already spoiled items alphabetically with the non-spoiling items, since it doesn't have a condition bar anymore. It might be nice if they moved it to be either at the top or bottom of the segment of spoilable items.
---
Yeah but you will still be hit by enemies and can still die by them with a tse weapon you can kill everything with no problem and you can only be killed by yourself or the sbq
---
I wont say I have something similar.. but a group of us all have artillery placements in our bases, and the 4th guy makes an open roofed "safe haven" in the center of essentially a triangle. Idiot goes in the haven. Shells rain down and we split the rewards. 
---
not really :(  pretty messy atm.
---
the picture has expired? 😅 
---
You are a bold one!

Who the fuck said the game is well designed in every aspect?  Seriously, need a link. 
---
I like marsupial for the jump PA explosive attacks, extra carrying capacity, and extra jetpack jump height.
---
Bandolier, won't drop since I use multiple types of ammo and an ammo hoarder by nature. Also I repair my weapons with Weapon Artisan. 
---
Marathoner I will be swapping out and putting Action Boy up a point while putting the remaining two points into Perception for a bigger blast radius.
---
I don't use slow metabolism, carnivore keeps me fed just fine.
---
Mutations are key for me, less worrying about chems... and speed demon's reload on heavy weapons is great.
---
I wanted it too, and I also have a screenshot of that dead body in my gallery
---
Regeneration 300% but chem effects minus 13% with rank three class freak, so not sure how much without it, maybe 50%
---
thats coming, as a time limited atom shop item.
---
You also aren't standing inside your guns while you're repairing them
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion! Of course I disagree but I’d like to hear your thoughts on why you think that with more detail. 
---
I don’t see how adding end game content punishes regular players, it gives them something to do. I’m a regular player, I want more. 
---
I understand how #3 could be negative toward players, but in my humble opinion, I think it’s a more effective way to establish the intention of the developers in the first place: to create a survival game, where you can’t carry everything, and have to choose with care.... while also correcting the fact that the game is broken as fuck and any regular player could be given the most powerful weapon in the game by some
---
Random person with 200 of them. That is negatively impacting the game more than anything else right now. 
---
I've gotten them at random from containers (specifically locked ones like safes or tool boxes since the last patch), and have also randomly seen them at the two Watoga vendors. Possibly the rare spawned vendor at Charleston station but not 100% sure on that.
---
Right, got it on switch a few months ago and I believe the last season just ended
---
I could be down with that... Fresh start every few months, new gear and shit... Then my OG character can have it all on those OG servers or offline... Whatever 
---
yeah, i'm saying tse shotguns are overkill, when not tse shotguns are still stronk
---
This

For me I played Skyrim till I got  Daedric gear, then it became boring. Mods bring repeatability to that game though. 
---
Anything will help.   The friends Ive made so far haven't been online a lot and I can't transfer anything to other characters at the moment.   
---
I am but I don't think I'll be playing tonight, I work tomorrow and I don't have any ammo left, I'll try this week-end I think, depending of my work hours. 
---
Ive spent too much time ranking up Git Sloppy to go back now!
---
I’m interested.
---
You admit to buying their items? I hope you want your account banned too.
---
That 300% is nice though. You could fix the Stimpak effect loss with one of the perks at 
---
Least
---
Not really, you're using two different weapons and switching between them. It's not a glitch or even an exploit. He only had to damage one, because he had two identical ones or crafted them. If you had found them, they wouldn't be identical and wouldn't stack in the first place. If anything, the bug is that they do stack, preventing you from doing this.
---
very nice, well played!!
---
&gt; I did say it was CONTROVERSIAL.
---
No it's dumb as fuck: that'd be how you'd get your "mass exodus".
---
This is the most beautiful diabolical thing I’ve seen 
---
Next time shoot a mini nuke at the large nuke as it comes out and see how realistic this game really is 
---
I dont know if I would call it fantastic since I keep seeing sunshine rays come through mountains/rocks and building walls 
---
"One Violent Night" also has a weapon that can drop called "Nailer". It's a cultist blade as well, not sure what the buffs are.
---
Even if it were a percentage or reduced amount, similar to what one gets when a team leader completes a quest I think that would still be good.
---
after you get mutations and excavator armor, carry weight is much less an issue.
---
the real issue is the damn vendor cap cap.
---
I wish it was a persistent regen instead of having a dwell time before it kicks in.. if you open vats or sprint it stops the regen and you have to wait again :/ It really cuts into being mobile and taking pecks.
---
Level 45 Suppressor’s Hand Made Rifle ... kind of a meh weapon and I missed the chance to get plans for a hand made rifle

No. I think it's a bad idea and unfair to other players and doesn't match the lore.

Maybe they made a design choice to dissuade you from obsessively farming a single event over and over again?
---
I too would rather see guaranteed 3star drop from her... or at least the event reward.
---
But, I know she drops specific plans...  Personally though, all the times I've killed her, all I ever get are ultracite left/right arm and ultracite explosive vents.  Those are the only 3 plans I've EVER pulled from her.  I know she drops others, but man, I'd kill for something different.  I don't want/need any of those.

I never used daedric the same with power armor it became too easy even on legendary it's just becomes a slapping match till one of you get tired. I always used dawnguard or blackguard
---
I wanted to do the same
---
In before Reeee'ing
---
#2 would be no different then an expansion for WoW coming out. The expansion invalidates all of the raid level armor the day it comes out. Yes, the armor is usable to get started in the next level of raids but it is not able to sustain or support those raids.
---
By 'expanding the game' and raising the cap on looted items (which raises base damage for dropped items) a level 100 Assault Rifle unmodded now outperforms the level 50 surely but it doesn't mean the TSE Uber Gun is completely invalidated ... only that a better Legendary can drop.
---
#3 Anyone significantly overweight should just be deleted (insert arbitrary value)
---
Valid players would drop weight and dupers would just go away.
---
And if the proper tracking tools were implemented they could watch any transfer occurring and take action. (which had this been in place to begin with ... if wishes were fishes and all)
---
Interested in follow on posts.
---
This is why I carry two escavator suits on me, 1 for backup when 1 breaks. Main item is black titanium, plus a bunch of other stuff, springs, screws steel etc. Make sure you have the power armour perk to reduce mat requirements. You can build the 2nd set at your camp. Does the Ultracite have the same carry weight ? I didn't think it did.
---
Probably gave up on server hoping looking for mods.

Jesus. You want daddy to paint you a pretty picture, too? You can't just look a term like that up on Google. You obviously don't know shit about philosophy or critical theory. But why would you? Ontology is ALSO the study of how something exists, as in opposite to epistemology. YOUR ontology is how YOU categorize how things live or be. A position that requires reflexive awareness, which you also seem to lack. Stick to what you know, it makes you seem less stupid. Good luck with that. Btw fo76 blows.

[Issue] During what seemed like light gameplay, game crashed and froze. Not a blue-screen CE but a fully fledged crash/freeze in which I had to power off my console manually due to none of the console OS working. 
---
[Details] Level ~90 character playing with a melee weapon and no weight related bugs and small inventory. Melee’d a scorched outside of Vault 96 in VATS and the game froze and sound stopped playing. I’m only reporting this because I’m pissy that this freeze caused a full system OS data corruption. 
---
*I HAD TO COMPLETELY RESTORE AND DELETE ALL DATA ON MY PS4 TO RESUME FUNCTIONALITY OF MY CONSOLE DUE TO THIS HARD CRASH*
---
Under normal circumstances I’m more along the lines of “eh the game crashed again, guess I’ll restart application”. This has been a day long endeavor of re-downloading what data wasn’t lost from this corruption. Long time fallout fan, since 02. Love this game for what it is, but damn this hurt right in the gut and I can’t really turn a blind eye to losing all of my save data and having the chance of losing my console. Thank god I’m an emergency scenario freak and have all passwords/accounts and cloud data backed up and saved. If I were the average joe I would be livid.

Please fix this games stability, love playing your game with my wife.

Armor seems to work fine against other peoples explosions, Ive had people hit me with grenades, explosive weapons, whatever. My own exposions dont seem to take into account my armor at all.
---
I have no idea how to answer this question. Just posting since I'm hopeful someone can answer this question XD. 
---
I really like TSE.  Fun mechanic.  The game would be far less attractive to me without.
---
I don't disagree about the mail, I just couldnt think of anything recent on console that had crafting and a shared stash other then PoE and it's part of the microtrans model for that one.  Maybe destiny depending on how you count it?
---
Think it would have helped a lot if they just capped level and left in random perk packs.  Making stash and plans common would have reduced the annoyance level of multiple chars at that point.
---
yea minus 13% isn't alot so I kept it, although the regen only outside of battle I believe. 
---
Yeah, but lobbies just for cheaters isn't a bad idea.
---
You said, “than their an asshole”. 
---
How about you do me a favor and become the wind...
---
So you can blow me...
---
I find it more annoying that the inside of my base is so bright that I have to remove all my lights and ceiling fans.
---
Pfft.
---
Work.
---
Ugh.
---
Well if you need help with anything you can send me a friend request and ask. 
---
why waste server space on them? just ban them.
---
Tempting, but I’ll need the 650 caps to get replacements :p
---
We need a better tiered system. Wood and crap melee needs to be weak monsters only. They need a few medium class and super high class for queen.
---
I have a berserker's explosive dragon.
---
Even the worst legendary effect in the game can't make the weapon anything less than insane. 
---
I agree all that, except that it’s too late... of course I want this game to succeed in the long term, so I have wishful thinking. I just would love to see this game balanced to the point where a year from
---
Today I can log in and see mostly high levels grinding for something, or struggling through a dungeon, rather than nuking whitesprings for their 10,000th time. 
---
Sounds like something a duper would say...
---
My wife doesn't like fallout... because of fallout 3... on xbox 360.... Shes been talking about getting rdr2.... :(
---
Relax man, the technology just isn’t there yet. Wait for next gen before demanding extravagant features 
---
I believe the system already does the average condition. I could be mistaken, but I believe so. 
---
And trust me, I get it, breaking it out causes some issues; but with the current lack-luster inventory management system there is no perfect solution. I, personally, would rather be able to see each one's condition. That's a subjective thing though; and it's possible I am in the minority. 
---
It would be really useful. That way I could use a character as a bank to hold spare weapons that either have sentimental value or you want to sell but don't have a buyer for at the moment. 
---
Without killing massive hordes of enemies in a few shots the game wouldn't be fun?
---
Not a legitimate concern, stop spreading rumors
---
They either need to do what you’ve suggested or just take the Syringer out of the game. It’s awful. 
---
If they did I'd be out of a job!
---
having done Patrol Duty about 40 times to get those damn handmade plans, I agree with this fucking statement.
---
Just have the bot go to the nearest point on his current path, not all the way back to where he first got aggroed goddamnit.
---
No, I am saying the brigading comes in waves when salty fans feel like they have a new thing to bitch about. In between you still get the occasional "SEEE GUYS! ITS A CASH GRAB!/ASSET FLIP/OBJECTIVELY BAD!" along with *plenty* of other parroted complaints I am sure you are familiar with. It basically boils down to: You like a thing me and other redditors are in an outrage about?! Even though we have lots of things that we feel justify our outrage?! You are a shill/sheep/etc. etc. 
---
There is a huge difference between criticizing and critiquing a game or company and just finding new ways to bash it, then using those things a justification to be an asshole to people who *aren't* outraged. If you hate the game and developers so much that is fine- its kinda absurd that you would spend so much time following if you feel that way- but hey your opinion is yours. But its pretty shitty to act like people are in the wrong for having the same opinion and its even more shitty to push your negative pissy attitude on people who are interested in the game and want to see it improve and potentially get to a state that is solid. This entire sub was created because you couldn't even ask a question about 76 without getting flooded with parroted responses and downvotes.
---
That's like saying that the person who robbed your home while you were at work should not be punished.  Because it's no their fault they took advantage of you being gone.
---
My entire build is all about doing this. Over half my favorites wheel is black powder rifles, pistols, and dragons. I feel like a Revolutionary Patriot. 
---
Thank you. This is as close to an authority deciding the argument as we will get, lol.
---
If you are wearing full PA you are basically invincible anyway. You could run around with just a switchblade and never die. I did it for a about a week.
---
The level limit raise is obviously going to happen, but they have to make a ton of weapons to prepare for a patch like that. It's not that easy to just boom make everything level 100 and not have other content to go with it. Everyone wants to ban and kill dupers, but last I checked Bethesda let duping happen when they could have patched properly before the holidays. Give us proper content and finally get rid of the dupe glitch. No need to change weight limits on alternate characters. 
---
Meat piles.
---
Fuck em'. Ban them all.
---
Just do away with the timer entirely.  Is the possibility that somebody piles up 80 molerat chunks really worth having the server keeping track of the condition of every piece of food in the game?  It seems like such an incredible waste of resources, right up there with having rotational 3D models for everything including vegetarian hams -- which are nothing but a box that says "vegetarian ham" on it.  Like why.
---
How about a step further? One guaranteed armor, melee, AND weapon 3 Star. Would make her actually worth it
---
If you leave your house or car unlocked?  It's still the thief's fault, but I mean come on.....
---
Make games harder to play, are you mad ?
---
What we ACTUALLY need is a Fallout bot, like a synth, that plays the game for us (that is just duplicating and one shotting shit) so we can get on with the actual entertainment of watching 76 hate videos and bitching on reddit.
---
Fallout 76 bitch bot coming to an atom store near you ....
---
You my man are amazing
---
The one that overlooks the bog is directly east of the "south mountain lookout" in the bottom middle of the map, its a small disk embedded in the ground on a cliff.
---
Pretty sure shotgun/enforcer is best, because each pellet had a chance to proc that cripple, so the number of shots needed, on average, is lower.
---
It's so bad for me that if I get disconnected during a nuke, I have plenty of time to get to the ledge, open my menu and equip my power armor helmet which always gets uneqipped on a relog, check my perks/reshare and STILL have to wait 10-20 seconds for the game to completely catch up. 
---
Sorry I wasn’t clear enough. Added clarification. But I’m definitely no duper at all. I’m actually level 75 and was recently googling what TSE meant
---
Ive had the bug before as well, mostly when switching from something like a gatling with 400rds or w/e it is to a handmade, all of the sudden my handmade would have a 400 round clip. Another thing that needs fixing D:
---
I'd actually like to create a small guest cabin and label it with signage. I always plant more food than I harvest so people can come by and grab a few to plant themselves or eat.
---
I said I think it's a good idea. People on here are witch hunters from Salem and anyone who doesn't scream "Ban Dupers" loud enough gets flamed. That's all I'm saying  
---
I really wonder what items you own that are duped that you love.
---
Where's the bot at to forward this to Bethesda at?! We need this!
---
Sugar Grove.  
---
Go back to the stairs that you came down from the upper level. Hang a right. 2nd left.  
---
Walk in the door straight to back of the room last terminal on the right..  It has the holotape you need.
---
Yesterday I wanted to move my camp within my camp and it wanted to charge me 40 caps, so I decided to change servers a few times hoping to find someone who was in my spot so it was for free, then I noticed it went down to 5 caps.
---
But yeah keep and eye on the caps, it's a known issue/bug where it takes more than it should.
---
Ooo yes ok im remembering that now. I have like 60 blank holotape but I'll go try that siphon.
---
The anti-fun attitude of the availability of CAMP pieces is disheartening. I don't mind some of that shit being in the Atoms Store but there should be more stuff to pick from without going there.
---
It just works
---
Is it still the case that bulking is only weight effective for aluminum and lead (and acid because it bulks into 15 but only costs 10 to bulk)? 
---
any update on future plans to keep bumping up storage weight?
---
I stopped reading after you said you've beaten the queen more than three times. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU BEAT HER. It's impossible. It's literally the last trophy I need and I have no fucking idea how to beat her. It's incredibly infuriating.
---
Yes indeed it was. The nuka-cola machine that you could get in your house actually worked and turned any nuka-cola you put in it (normal and quantum) into ice-cold versions that had better benefits.
---
Jackoffripper, you sparked my interest with your  build. Are you able to share the make up of your guerrilla character? 
---
except that duping doesn't make you lose anything when getting robbed does. I do agree that they are making the choice to do it but I think lobbies just for cheaters kind of like gta5 isn't a bad idea.
---
Diabolical.
---
I could never get the darn event to trigger and the rare times I did, I got pump action plans. Haha
---
You get those plans? I ended up leveling a 15 guy and handmade plans show up every other server hop on Watoga. 
---
Yeah no, I get it -- the bloat is annoying -- but I personally would value the having more information then a less bloated inventory. But as I mentioned to the other person -- that's just my opinion and I may very well be in the minority. 
---
In reality the whole inventory needs either redone or over-hauled greatly. Right now we're just talking about putting band-aids on a broken arm...
---
Which tent for the brotherhood fatigues
---
I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or not. I've been on the internet too long that's why people usually leave a /s at the end to say they are sarcastic
---
In no way did he say any of that...he just linked a very active subreddit that specalizes in this kinda thing.  Had he not I wouldnt of found it a week ago
---
Awesome! I'm going to try this out!.
---
I wondered about that - now I see references to lists from other regions in the files.  It seems like the probability of the item lists from other regions being used is much lower, thus why you still see mostly T60 in Watoga and might get the occasional other item.
---
Each region's list has a possibility of using some other region's list, but the probability is lower.  Not all regions references all other regions.  To keep it simple, I'd say the original list is still good, but its possible you'll see items occasionally pop up not in the region's own list due to this being coded in.
---
A friend has had his CAMP at the little house for more than a month now. The vendor still spawns. It's random, just because it doesn't spawn a couple of times in a row when you go there, doesn't mean the camp has any effect whatsoever.
---
My CAMP is near Pleasant Valley Grahm spawn. He also still spawns there regularly.
---
Was thinking about this last night actually. Yes please.
---
But at the moment is also extremely broken. People are 1 shorting the queen because of this. Although I didn’t discover it until today after watching a video discussing the key glitches currently in 76. This is ridiculously crazy. 
---
Fuck no. That would make it a lot easier for dupers to run their mules.
---
I server hop to find basic plans like metal armor.  There is no reason a level 20 something should only have leather armor plans.  Basic plans are way too rare.  Worse so now that people will be able to open up shops and sell plans instead of just leaving them there.
---
isn't that the point though? that you can't hold on to everything forever and ultimately must prioritize what items you save and what items you don't save.
---
i mean, you could describe any activity in that mundane way ('it seems to boil down to...'), even really fun things.
---
&gt;future builds or repairs 
---
this is your problem. stashes are character-bound, and characters should be based on their SPECIALs, which means your builds are going to be limited per character anyway. there simply isn't the space needed to "save stuff for future builds or repairs". get rid of everything you're not using, period.
---
yes, this means you can't save cool weapons or outfits, and yeah it sucks somewhat, but it's also totally expected of a game like this. though it'd be sweet with another 400\~ or so carry weight points for stash.
---
I agree about fixing the exploit and deleting the items but deleting accounts seems a little harsh.  I suppose I would support if someone was flagrantly exploiting alot but what about people who duped by accident (it is a bug after all), or just bought a duped item?  I'm not even sure how you could know.
---
I also think they should nerf TSE, frankly these weapoms are way too powerful.
---
Provided this doesn't take away from making the servers stabile (for those still having issues), stopping the duping, and other fixes or planned items. 
---
I could do without this if the plan is a stash of 800. Half of the fun for me at least is getting that weapon of uberness so that each character has their own story and their own background. 
---
I guess if all you care about is the uberness then so be it.
---
Oopps sorry updated /s
---
Honestly, what I do is send them to my wife via PSN on my PS4.
---
Using the messaging app on my phone, I open that conversation and download the picture from my phone.  There, upload to imgur or whatever and share the link
---
Check his comment history, its litterd with him saying it's against the rules. 
---
Fuck no. It would make it a lot easier for dupers to run their mules, which is actually why they are suggesting it.
---
As soon as they make the choice to actively dupe items, it is their fault. 
---
They're not blameless victims of the system.
---
So now you are saying don't use anything powerful because it makes the game easy... that's a bit rich dude.
---
Fair enough. It begs someone to raise the question. 
---
The top of the world marker is north of the "top of the world", I fast traveled on top of it.  The fenced in area with the two binoculars, the trash can, and the benches.
---
Thank you I'm gonna go check it out rn I'll see if that works! 
---
I’ve had a fake facebook account set up for years to associate with my PS4, I upload to there using Share mode. I believe you can use Twitter aswell if u have it
---
Go to Photo gallery, choose your photo, click “hide UI” then press the Share button on controller and choose the relevant option
---
After you upload, just download it from whatever platform you uploaded to
---
I can confirm this happened to me at the Whitespring golf club but I luckily did find the patch of grass that was my loot bag. 
---
Ayyy
---
1.  Use a USB stick and put the photo on it. (Hit options on the picture and select move to us)
---
2.  Upload image to a site like 
---
https://m.imgur.com
---
3.  Select link on picture and paste on Reddit.
---
Or, you can upload the pictures on Facebook and link it here.
---
In short yes. Watch streams if your having a hard time deciding.
---
I take it we aren't getting an update this week then. Frustrating.
---
I too have seen a dramatically large increase in the number of people with explosive weapons, some are probably pretty good judging by the one shots i see around me i'm largely incapable of.
---
I believe the duping and instabilities are all related, and this problem being solved could save the game.
---
Lvl 118, **nothing** explosive, not one thing, 402 hours of gameplay.
---
i have a two shot gatling, and a two shot lever action both 1 star, my BEST item, is a 3 star bloodied cultist dagger with 40% swing speed, +1 agility and of course the bloodied more dmg the lower your health. thats it. everyting else i've found is largely genuinely RNG crap.
---
I fear though that we need a wipe or reset. .. something to reset the balance, only the people wanting to cheat/dupe would scream, mathematically a small group.. If this was a real mmo, with more persistence (like ARK or ...), it'd be fucked without reset. The only thing keeping it alive is that the game sortof runss off "new game instances" and respawning microservices. which means its probably pretty good modern code on the server side. just untested.
---
hindsight i wish the beta was better, longer, more powerful, it lacked, i could have helped find and fix and avoid so many of these problems.
---
Sometimes, my AP fills up while running. I don't get it.
---
you missed something pretty recently...
---
Literally the only things to ever bulk are aluminum and lead, everything else should only ever be bulked to sell, It keeps your chest cleaner to not have nebulous misc stacks and bulk of the same type. All you achieve is the pointless destruction of your plastic, and if you don't want plastic just bulk and sell, or throw it out.
---
Jesus give them some time, holiday ended last week. 
---
I'm not sure anymore, but I think it was listed as 'powered door' or something similar. At least I'm sure the name isn't obscure. Might've been at 1100 caps.
---
I do know that the seperate switches and such come with 'advanced power connectors'. I do recall buying the first at Grahm (only seen it once) and Advanced power connectors in either the Whitespring bunker / Watoga. I think it was 220 caps?
---
At a cost mind, don’t half-walls use the same budget as a full wall? So two half walls equals two full walls. 
---
Hope you have the cannibal perk
---
I personally prefer a challenge. but I know people don't like to be challenged in a game and that's okay
---
What was that?
---
This is the best way. Share it or send it through any sort of social network you have connected to your psn. Whether its Facebook, Twitter, or another account. Then open up whatever app and download it  
---
&gt; new game type 
---
i had a horrible thought: Fallout battle royale
---
I think everyone who is first to buy a product should understand that prices will more than likely change in the future. Look at consoles. Those prices always drop after initial release. 
---
LOL He edited his post once i called him out on it.
---
This really needs to happen and soon.  They need to ban the players who are exploiting the game for tons of items and pursue those who are selling items for real money on sites like eBay.  Until BGS drops the hammer, I foresee a dark future for Fallout 76.
---
I was also considering on buying 5000 Atoms but I probably should not.  It seems like BGS does not give a damn about the game so why should I support them?  Maybe I will reconsider if they start improving the game, adding new content, and dealing with the cheaters who are selling items.
---
I'm "glad" others have the bag not appearing issue. Wife and I have dropped plans for each other and the fucking bag is nowhere to be found. Plans gone, forever.
---
We play infrequently and the first crash is our queue to call it a day. I really wanted this game to be enjoyable but it's a shitshow.
---
Thats where I got all that flux and yellow cake, then. I tend to harvest anything that can be collected. Had a bunch of those in the stash and could not remember where I got them.
---
It happens. I dont really care much about paying full price. I preordered it back in june lol
---
Duping is counterfeiting, no one loses anything if you "duplicate" money?
---
Yeah, but it really shouldn't ever auto scrap anything but junk. Hell, it ought to not even scrap junk (like a fan). It ought to just require you to select to scrap all junk or specific junk before it counts as having the materials to make something. 
---
Spent £80 for the digital tricentennial pre-order which I could now get for £35 if I had waited for a couple of weeks after launch. I still love the game, but it would have been nice for people who bought it early to get a little bonus. Even if it is just a few atoms. 
---
Even the ones who unknowingly own duped weapons. Ban them too.
---
I've run into him at least 6 times.  Usually he just gives me prewar money but one time I was out of water and he gave me 2 purified waters and a gold watch.  He might be an angel.
---
SMALL stash betwen characters. Dupers cant put 99999 guns in the stash, relax.
---
Yeah, most of the mods I've gotten for weapons have been worse than the ones I've been able to make, so I hadn't considered that. 
---
Update coming out tomorrow they said
---
I don't think it appears in some windows. Specifically not in camp building menus. 
---
roadmap tommorrow
---
Having same problem on Xberx. It's a weird place to freeze up.
---
They have a website. Feel free to check it.
---
You're completely ignoring the fact that people are duping currency. Currency as an indicator of economy health completely goes out the window when it is so easily duped (counterfeited). 
---
When the base gets the kill nobody wins. Nobody gets XP, nobody gets loot. It ruins the fun for other people and no one benefits from it. Owner could be elsewhere or even AFK. There's literally no upside, not even for the owner.
---
Does the condition of your food stack go up when you get "new" items in that stack?
---
I'll check when I can
---
i think it's well past the point of no return. what are they going to do to stabilize the market? Wipe the entire player base? since yeah you can no longer tell who owns legitimate or duped items who is duping and who is not, the only way to be sure would be to nuke from orbit. anything other than this means cheaters get away with it, legit players get stuck in a world with a severely inflated market and everyone and their mom is running around with two shot explosive miniguns
---
Them saying that tomorrow they'll go into detail on the next 2 updates
---
I agree with the general idea, but less so on the severity of your ideas. 
---
For #2, I'd set the new weapon level cap at 70-75, and for #3, I'd set the limit at 4 or 5 times carry weight.
---
Semi-related to dupping, the explosive legendary effect should be nerfed.
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
I'd like to do that but without a ton of work it's difficult to know what I already know m
---
Sounds interesting man :)
---
Can you maybe post a pic of this shotgun and those effects? Or tell me which effect is second? 
---
I paid full price but now it’s cheaper more people play, buy atoms and fund future dlc so it’s cool 
---
I found I could get on the wall by the pool, and stopped dying. I will remember the bus for the future. Thanks!
---
I would love for the game to he challenging but I'm not gonna get naked and run around bare handed with no perks equipped to achieve that... which it really does seem like the only way this game could be challenging 
---
The spruce knob is on the cliff looking down to the campsite from the workshop, past the acid node by the trash can and the binoculars.
---
The light, it's blinding!
---
That place was scary. 
---
Still is scary and dank, dark, monsters around every corner ... and it feels so real. I still hate the place!
---
Or your PC is just janky, my dude..
---
I rarely buy into the preorder hype. I did on this title. 
---
Three copies of the [Tricentennial Edition](https://imgur.com/a/pYFc1oO) for me, my wife, and my son. 
---
$240. 
---
...in trouble?
---
There actually is a way to change flair on the mobile app.
---
Something as little as an out of date sound driver can cause a BSOD. 
---
I mainly get them due to cooling issues, dust in my fins. A trip to the basement air compressor usually clears things up.
---
Imagining swarms of melee lowbies, reflexively spamming block while a single player kills the thing with a TSE autogun with passive mode on. Endless flocks circling whitespring.
---
Meanwhile, I plink things from max draw distance. No XP.
---
I want stairs to snap to floors on either side not just the middle.
---
That's not how that works. You are just saying some th ing you heard someone else say or that you read sonewhere.
---
Thanks so much ! This was driving me a bit bonkers. Great advice and instructions. 
---
Since when I get bored at work I tend to take apart old electronics... I've got a drawer full of old wires, circuit boards, projector lenses, camera parts, my junk drawer is full =P
---
Sorry sick at home today, I only have garbage weapons rn lol. I have caps though
---
Lore isn't story. Listening to tapes is the laziest excuse for a plot I've ever heard.
---
As a said there isn't anything meaningful in the story of this game because it is about a person listening to things happen.
---
Dear Bethesda: this game is too easy.  Everyone is running around with god tier equipment except me.  I want god tier equipment too.  Please make it easier to get, then I will have it and everyone else won't.
---
That logic doesn't work.  The game really is too easy.  They need more end game content for sure, but what they shouldn't do is start handing out loot like candy.
---
Nah, FO76 is why I choose to set my task manager to always be on top because of stupid crap like this.
---
I would not delete cheated items. How many players out there unknowingly spent thousands of caps on duplicated items? I, personally, spent over 6K thus far on several mutation and TSE weapons; and until recently I had no clue that dupping was even a thing. Not everyone check-up w/ the internet to know that there are issues like this going on. It would potentially run-off even more players if they were to suddenly lose their best stuff. 
---
If there is a way to 100% confirm duppers or online sellers, I'm all for banning accounts. 
---
To fix PVP, I would make legendary effects and mutation ineffective in PVP scenarios. 
---
To, hopefully, fix dupping I would set a limit to how many items you can craft at a time. Most all dupping vids I've seen require you to craft 250-300 boards or something like that. If you could only craft 10 of the same items an hour, except for ammo or chems per say, then maybe that would severely limit dupping. Just a thought.... don't jump on me if you can think of a workaround lol. 
---
Yeah if you unknowingly trade for a duped item, you should be banned for owning that duped item. Your IP, account, everything.
---
That’s funny because I actually said that when we started playing. Because if we have to eat and drink then why do we not have to sleep or go to the bathroom.
---
All I got was an eye roll. 
---
Agreed. At the moment the game needs to be fixed fast. For alot of ppl is still unplayable with the amount of issues. For me bugs are getting worse. Then they need to start pumping out content fast and I'll be happy or hurry and get private servers so modders do it for them mods have made fallout 4 way better.
---
Yeah I usually die 2-3 times to point blank missiles trying to melee those things, and then you finally kill it -- and it randomly explodes for one last fu.
---
Ok I get your point now: so say a trade happens and the duper just drops ONE item to be picked up by the recipient.... that doesn’t fix anything, I get your point. I just can’t think of a way to fix the mule, without directly punishing someone for having said mule... good point thanks for sharing 
---
Is SWTOR still alive? I used to love playing that game.
---
Or the game was released unfinished
---
Just ran around for twenty minutes trying to find the first description, the above information here has ruined me, and I just feel so stupid.
---
Wrong.  It's hoarders' *purgatory*.
---
Where you go to learn your lesson.
---
It's the tent with all the bunk beds, it should be on the ground next to a lidless Footlocker. The Footlocker also commonly spawns a field scribe hat.
---
The dupe and server stabililty seem related to each other. Exploiters are overflowing values in storage containers causing inproper values in the calculations that cause crashes and seems to effect the server too. I'm pretty sure i caught some guys duping the other day after opening a few containers around these guys i came across huddling.  I'm sure you can tell too when it suddenly feels laggy and the controls freeze things comes up then it gets weird and crashes. this isn't happening when people 3 nuke the SBQ anymore...
---
Mongrel meat #petstore 
---
Doesn't count as a semi-auto rifle with my build. No damage change with rifleman. Dunno if the auto version counts as an auto-rifle.
---
Talking of the obvious one, does who has x10000 Energy Bobbleheads etc...  
---
Those who did by accident, if they continued to do it after, they are guilty. If it was a oopsie and didnt do it again. Thats fine.
---
Gonna try this when I get home later.
---
Even hoarding you probably dont get above 1-2k, hopefully 3k at the most.  I pick up almost everything not nailed down and the most I've been overweight was around 1500.
---
If Bethesda created Skynet, we would have nothing to worry about :)
---
I don't mind spending caps for good looking equipment. 
---
Hence, the Blackbird T-60. Some people buy beer and smokes. I buy pixels!
---
Or maybe you should not be allowed access to consumer electronic devices
---
Did you get it from an event? Mind sharing which?

dude... economics 101... you print money you create inflation: so by duping 200000000 nuka colas their artificially print 200000000 bottlecaps. then ofc prices on everything goes up because you just introduced so much money that you have devalued the entire currency. it's not greed, it's inflation. Same thing happened in WoW and Diablo 3 with bots farming Gold (well until Blizzard put a stop to it by aggressive banning)
---
I agree. What you describe is the real PITA. I've just forgotten it, since I've played the game slowly and methodically and most of the time visited the locations when higher level than other players.
---
Thinking about it, the worst was lvl 90 Deathclaw at Whitesprings while I was like 40-50. Luckily I managed to lure it to the robots. Other than that, it's some lvl 80 Scorchbeasts that are higher level than me. And I found out that killing a lvl 80 SB is not that harder than lvl 50 SB.
---
Let’s say I don’t kill the horde boss but all his adds will they keep respawning?
---
That’s the funny thing. I set it that way myself. After it crashing countless times I finally activated it. I’ve used it twice already. That’s the first time it wouldn’t let me do anything
---
This may be by design, given the push towards working with other players only. It's the risk you run with an MMO, trusting others or not.
---
However, I would certainly benefit from this as I now have two 50+ level characters. There was a ton of steel and lead I could have used from my first character on my second, as I went with different builds but still collect everything.
---
I paid full price and I don't feel ripped off.
---
If you do, fine. 
---
But don't try and make an issue out of something that isn't that big a deal. Honestly it isn't.
---
It's a video game. Disposable income. If you respond saying some people have to be careful about where they spend their money. Then they should really wait to buy anything, to see how it pans out. ESPECIALLY entertainment.   
---
So sick and tired of people doing shit like this. 
---
I'll buy! 
---
I tried Patrol Duty over a dozen times and finally gave up weeks ago.  Today I got it randomly from the Uranium Fever event!
---
I want a set of plans, but I won't be home until about 4:00 Eastern time. Want just CAPS, and how many?
---
No i said if you do damage still get XP, but if you dont do damage then only give XP within 10 metres
---
Yeah, honestly certain foods shouldn't spoil (like fried food or the jerky type foods) and it would be much more interesting if we could get different 'cooking stations' to make different 'food types' like needing to find a dehydrator and use that to make or place a dehydrator in your camp to make 'fruit lether' or 'insta-tea' or 'meat jerky' or 'fish jerky' depending on the type of meat used, etc.  Cooking currently just feels like 'spam boiled water and wood and your good' in most instances which is frustrating, I like all the ingredient options, but personally don't like how 95% of it is just 'cooked' item x, instead of being interesting like say the Ground Mole Rat or Appalachili, where it's interesting and isn't so.....bland I guess?
---
But yeah, really more than my complaints with the cooking side of things, the current inventory management system, while good for a single player game is garbage for an online one without the option to pause.
---
It's more 50/50 anyway, no way 80%....
---
Devs never wipe exploits or dupes. I can't think of when its happened. I'm someone knows of some examples, but every game I've played where dupes get out, all the money made from the dupe is basically just a part of the economy from that point on. 
---
I've even seen devs say they will manually remove gold/cheats/dupes instead of a server-wide rollback but thats never convincing. I hate that devs are more afraid of offending players with a rollback than appeasing people who don't want to play on a cheated and glitched game/server. I would much rather lose progress and know the rollback is universal than have to trust the word of some devs that they really were able to identify and correct all the exploiting. 
---
What’s your gt? And are you on now?
---
So... the problem there is that Dragons, Draugr, ancient destroyed civilizations and tall mountains are hardly unique to Skyrim.  Fantasy tropes are tropes, news at 11.
---
I do like the Mole Miner analogy though.  That one is creative.
---
It would be crashing all the time 😂
---
They only need to sell one at a time.
---
or I should not be reading posts on Reddit...
---
Indeed, I feel any nuke dropped should have some sort of big tough boss. Can't be that hard to make a "Nuked Deathclaw" using the same stat boost system the SBQ gets. Can you imagine a deathclaw that can't just be melee nuked? A Snallygaster with acid spit akin to the pre-patch Mirelurk Queen? Lightning fast Quantum Sloth?
---
Why not both?
---
Honestly the idea has merit, it's not hard at all to make an alt and being able to set up a trader account would be pretty cool.
---
Also I suspect there are some stability/code/technical reason they can't just guve everyone say 10k storage space.
---
I'm with your wife. RDR2 is... kind of boring? I just... don't want to kill people or beat them up for no reason? I do have some really sweet horses though. (I also spoiled the ending for myself and I got a sad...) One day I'll finish it. But I'll finish FO76 first. ;)
---
(I also loved Uncharted and The Last of Us! Literally got a PS4 because of The Last of Us! I play FO on Xbox.)
---
On PC, can confirm (Ryzen 2600, 16 GB 2933 MHz, RX 580 8 GB).
---
Have you tried checking windowless vans owned by surely men offering free candy?
---
I believe if it’s your camp traps doesn’t count unless, you are there and hit enemy at the minimum 1 damage 
---
I wasn’t on lastnight. went to my nieces hockey game. Probably tonight.
---
If they can't play the game by the rules then they don't need to be playing the game.  I ban them, they won't be missed.
---
hmm nessy seems abit fuzzy
---
You are not alone, brother!
---
Yeah, it's quite a spectacle to see somebody shoot a two shot explosive dragon 8 times by constantly swapping out to different ones
---
Aluminum, Circuits, Gears, Cloth, Plastic, Rubber, Steel, Glass, Ceramic, Wood, Fiberglass, Plastic, Plastic, Pastic, Plastic, Plastic, Plastic, Plastic, Plastic, Plastic...
---
Man I tried introducing my wife to WoW and by level 20 and 50+ deaths later by panicking and running into the mob spawns and camps and getting mad at me...... and/or watching me die because she was thinking I was her and she was standing in the fire ....she was going to laugh at me..... and then she burned.... and got mad at me....
---
We decided it was best for our Marriage that we do something else together.... 
---
like therapy.....
---
Agreed, if they get the duping crap sorted out I will start playing again for sure. 
---
Until they want to post something on Thursday instead.
---
I found em ^^ what of the Officer suit 
---
They took a break, like *EVERYONE* else did over the holidays. They said when they would be back. 
---
There's going to be one tomorrow.
---
Sheesh. 
---
That happens in The Long Dark. If you don't sleep you eventually collapse. Too bad most of the game takes place outside in the Canadian north during winter...
---
I lost my first SBQ attemot last night. She was 3* level 95 and as soon as we got her to half health, she regenerated lol. We got massacred and there was me (level 93), 5 level 20-80s, a 137,  a 159, and a 236....and we got murdered. Took the full time. I wasted, literally, thousands of bullets. I have mo ammo left for most of my guns...so just be prepared
---
Thanks for sharing! I wish it didn’t need to be so severe, but I think there are drastic problems that need drastic solutions! 
---
#2 is sort of a Double entendre. It is both a fix for the weapons floating about, and end game
---
Content. The cap can’t be raised without adding content to make the old weapons underpowered. Therefore I don’t think there should be a limit! I think it should be more level based than anything! 
---
#3: I think there is a better way for sure, I would love to hear others ideas on that. 
---
In terms of explosives, I think the obvious fix is to make demolition expert not apply to explosive rounds. It’s an indirect nerf that will definitely help 
---
Or your PC is still janky because sounds like a personal problem. If I ever got an infinite load loop, my shit would actually close properly.. sooooo....
---
Complaint #31,872 about the Scorchbeast. Welcome to the party, we're glad to have you.
---
This is hands down the funniest thing I've ever seen in reddit
---
Would love a spiral stair case that could add to its self to just keep going up several stories.   And be a bit more compact. 
---
And when they post on Wednesday, will you come back and say wow, they kept their word? 
---
I feel like the wendigo would be very entertained at the ultra luxe.
---
I like the name Tuxedotrons. Have an upvote.
---
That is 100% not how it works.
---
Ill be on later , my gt is DeathclawAlpha8 
---
There is a couple on a rooftop in a dying embrace and formal gear.  A pink teddy sits watching with "hubba hubba" written in blocks.  Fast forward to another day, I find a toilet with "hubba hubba" written in chalk and a gold bar in the dunny can.  
---
I thought it was worth sixty and I was wrong :'(
---
Don't get me wrong I really enjoy playing the game but I still think it would be very nice of Bethesda to reward the players who trusted them the most and have been sticking through the whole time. 
---
FFS herrryy: Stop being an apologist for shitty design.
---
Theres little navigation diamonds i had to reach to pass it. 
---
Seattle Snorlax is my gt, on right now if you're free
---
I dunno, because your attention is focused on the computer and not on absorbing information about your surrounding to make better decisions in combat?   AP are an abstraction.  This doesn't seem so weird.  It's hardly a gamebreaking bug.
---
I can pick locks like a champ with keyboard and mouse. Timing is everything, you have to cycle the mouse from left to right while tapping whatever key your using, until you see the lock move, then you know where your "range" is.
---
An interesting fact is that if you use a bobby pin and you successfully pick a lock without breaking that bobby pin, you will actually use the same bobby pin on the next lock, a bobby pin that has been slightly damaged from picking the previous lock.
---
lol 
---
The game tells you what it's gonna scrap
---
you confirmed it
---
slow down
---
Oh okay, that makes sense because it requires using a container in the world. Thanks for the clarification! 
---
For the sake of getting a better understanding of it, at what point do they crash servers? When they attempt too many items, or too many times?
---
Junk already HAS a feature that prevents auto scrap, too! So it's ridiculous that this is a problem. 
---
Everquest had this like 17 years ago.  It's called a Stash Bank slot.  
---
Because that's how Bethesda is forcing you to prioritize perks. It's dumb and fiddly, but that's the way it is. It's akin to the problem with Dromedary / Slow Metabolism / Hacking / Picklocks, i.e. Put on a perk you need for 7 seconds, then flip it back to what you actually play.
---
Sounds like your wife has better taste than you. You can probably learn a thing or two from her.
---
Soon:  
---
* horse - 4000 atoms
---
* Scorched horse - 6000 atoms
---
* BOS horse armour - 700 atoms
---
I do love seeing more players on every day. I like the fact that the game is cheaper but still feel that full price paying individuals could use a little gift or two &lt;3
---
Also just stop picking stuff up, people need to stop being such dam pack rats. 
---
I believe the whole point of being able to swap cards it to experiment with new cards, not to switch to an entire new deck every time you come by a locked door or a crafting bench.
---
Swapping cards outside of a camp could even cost caps, so that people understand. 
---
It's interesting for me to see people tired of changing perk cards, because I just stopped doing that. It's ok to skip hacking sessions and to have starched genes equipped all the time.
---
Misremebered, sorry. But still, it's not hard to get a hit on something to get credit.
---
Lol, this so reminds me of my bulldog. He's only got one head but is convinced he's a people.
---
The waterboy/girl perk will hwlp with that, but you still may catch parasites unless you're wearing a sealed helmet. 
---
I'm in my truck.  About the only thing scrappable in here is a couple of coke bottles - so I have 2 pieces of plastic.  Oh - and the hubcaps, so I've got screws!  Score!  XD
---
This would be cool.
---
I've always been protected from scorchbeast sonic attacks when taking cover. 
---
Mind you, if there's an open door, or lots of windows, that doesn't give you much protection. A pile of crap won't give you enough protection. 
---
You didn't have good cover or protection so that's why you still took damage.
---
I've literally sat in buildings, have run from one, and not take any damage while it spammed it's sonic attack at the building. 
---
But also, it's not just it's sonic attack. it has a acid attack that it cropdusts with. And that will beat the crap out of your armor. Especially if you're just sitting in the middle of what of their acid farts. Which sounds like you were. 
---
Yes, no problem. Only solutions i could think of would be to slightly nerf all items currently in game and add more end game loot, four/five star legendaries with new effects which would render already duped items obsolete. Every enemy and item would have to be rescaled and would be just an enormous pain to balance it properly. Can imagine one giant REEE from everyone that bought/grinded for their own gear  for much longer than it took to dupe it tho, so normal players pay the price again. And Bethesda can only fix it this way once, if there happens to be another method they didnt fix or if the method comes with later patches that inevitably brings new bugs, they are boned and so are we as well.
---
When an app can hang your entire system your drivers are usually to blame.
---
82% of all creative genesis are in fact totally insane..... nice job 
---
It seems to me it would be impossible for them to determine exactly which items were duped, locate them and remove them.  The way I understand it, there was no code in-place to keep track of this sort of thing.
---
See stuff like this is why the rush job drives me nuts. 
---
The Zeni stockholders don't GAF if all the dev's hard work is overshadowed by bullshit. Just imagine if the game was released when it was ready: maybe not totally polished, but not so stupidly broken either. 
---
Then maybe instead of a media shit parade of hate bandwagoneers, we'd have gaming media and youtuber stories about THIS sort of thing instead.
---
Well, you know. Less of them anyway. *hates gonna hate*
---
I like your ideas. You want to filter out the dupers without unduly punishing the people who have played fair.
---
Would they work in combination with something like this?
---
\- Fix the duping exploit, obviously
---
\- Set up new 'clean' servers
---
\- Let people choose to 'cleanse' their character. Only clean characters will be placed on clean servers when they log in.
---
\- When you 'cleanse' your character you're restricted to some arbitrary limit on possessions and caps. Maybe it's 10 weapons, 10 armor pieces, two sets of power armor, 400 pounds of other stuff. Not worth arguing about the specifics right now. Just set a limit that's somewhere north of what a reasonable person might have and somewhere well south of what a duper's carrying around.
---
\- As you suggest, keep publishing higher level interesting content
---
\- (Controversial) New content will only appear on clean servers
---
So basically you're not taking away anything from anyone. But if they want to move forward, they need to put their life of crime behind them and sin no more. (Well, hopefully you fix the code so that they \_can't\_ sin any more, but still.)
---
Overseer's Caches. I tend to drop spare ammo and plans in the one in flatwoods church.
---
I used to leave my house unlocked and I still leave my water unlocked. I had a message pop up a couple of days ago that said I was being attacked, thinking it was just a few mole rats or something I brushed it off. Logged off for the night and the next day I logged in to all my workbenches destroyed fusion generator destroyed they even destroyed my bands stage.. so now I lock it because a few destroyed it for the whole..
---
You will have to move the entire camp for caps a little farther into land. My old base at Twin Lakes did this but it was a 50/50 chance if I was in the water or not. Honestly we just need fast travel mats.
---
Yeah, I've had the same. I don't know any aspect of this game that's bug free.
---
I already provided a solution on another post, which is to limit the amount you can carry on your character to around 2000. With stash, this means people with astronomical weights have to let go of almost everything they have. Regular players won't be affected much by this as 2600 is more than enough for everything (the cap can be discussed). One thing to keep in mind are "mule characters". Some legit players use alt accounts to store all their junk and will resist this solution. Using alt accounts to store things for your main account is not how the game is intended to be played (aka exploit) and Bethesda should comment on this. If mule characters are an exploit, they should not be catered for. I truly think that this is the best way to solve this problem as they definitely can't detect which items are duped and which are not, at the game's current state. If anyone has a better solution, I'd love to hear it.
---
Is there a water source there?
---
Haven't had an issue with BSOD and FO76. Played since BETA.
---
They're not unheard of, though rare. I recently got them from playing Ark, and it's quite consistent, so I'm pretty sure it was the game, since otherwise I hadn't had a BSOD since like 2016.
---
Last time he appeared, he just exploded right in front of me for no reason after shooting his sentence... *SCARRY* !
---
&gt;Because they played 60 Dollars for a broken piece of shit.
---
that doesn't mean they're allowed to freely break the TOS.
---
I am not trying to make a big issue all I want is Bethesda to take notice of how some players like me feel, and maybe we can get some compensation? Maybe like some special skins or stuff like that? 
---
This is not fallout 4. Please don't expect it to be the same game. 
---
I'm just salty I could of waited like a week and a half and payed like 33% less :'( 
---
Yea birdbones slows fall speed and damage, I want marsupial as well. Whats strange in numbers? 
---
Don't worry, I almost shit myself when I first saw this perk icon too
---
Well it's not even letting me try regardless; and I'd like to.
---
Last night I was at fissure Prime trying to grab hardened mass from corpses.  two scorchbeasts spawn, one obligingly lands so I liberally apply buckshot to it's face.
---
The other one nonstop sonic spam.  In fact, he did it so often that I guess I was missing it with my handmade, and he actually got bored, deaggroed, and flew off.
---
I laughed.
---
I pre ordered at full price and I love the game and play it almost every day with my friends 
---
I would love anything tbh. Even atoms, but boy do those atom prices need to drop...
---
And how the fuck does that apply to you calling someone a no life? They are here enjoying his life, and your here shitting on people that like something different than you. Why? Because you have f all else to do and you feel the need to dump on others, so exactly who has more of a life?
---
You think your such a great critical thinking philosopher and you dont even understand how to treat people? I mean a big part of philosphy is learning and recognizing peoples motivations, urges and desires.
---
The ontolgy of their life is, they do what they enjoy, your ontolgy is to shit on people and try to bring them down to your level because your too lazy or too clueless to fix your own life.
---
You obviously have the tools and intellect to improve your life, so again I say, little boy either grow up or get bent.
---
Oh
---
Same. 122 hours in I’m level 52 and have only been in a nuke zone once, just to see what it’s like. Never seen a SBQ. I’m more interested in exploring the map. I’ll get there eventually.
---
get  [Awareness](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Awareness)  perk.
---
They cost me 650 caps, so that’s what they would cost xD I’m basically just being a middle-man while I’m the right level for it as apparently they’re a nightmare to get ahold of. 
---
This has been known since launch by almost all people.
---
It will take me a while to trust Bethesda again :'(
---
Yesterday I scrolles through but couldn't find the one that was marked as mine for either the keycard or password. Still grabbed a couple of each accidently. With the quest still at search for clues (3/5) I went to Robco and was able to complete the quest. It updated after I entered his office or used the scanner, forget which.
---
Tl;dr - you don't need to grab "your" copy to complete the quest.
---
username checks out
---
uggh, this is not an option as it is built into the structure of a bridge
---
It's not 100% effective but I've gotten cover behind trees and in the bog trenches at times. And then totally fried inside a concrete building. Go figure.
---
Oh mate. That's fucking heartbreaking. 
---
GG Beth!
---
It doesn't completely protect you, no, but it does take a huge edge off the damage and allow you to stimpak or pop a Cola. Sound travels through walls so it makes sense to me.
---
and now I'm starting to realize why my mods keep disappearing.../facepalm
---
Oh for sure, but some people feed off the junk.  It's weird.
---
I sit at about 700/900.  200/300 on person, 500/600 in stash.
---
I tried this but didn't solve the problem
---
Honestly, I just dislike the restrictions in place.
---
- Can't delete because part of the base will be inaccessible; I've had a stair going to nowhere that I couldn't delete because of this restriction and had to move my base to get rid of these floating and stuck items
---
- Can't place, item is floating
---
- Can't place, item needs support
---
I'm sure there are more, but I haven't played for a couple weeks. Building was a fun part of FO4 and by putting in these restrictions have taken a couple of steps backwards. Of course, there are also the issues with stairs not snapping or only snapping to the center of a large floor. With such small build budgets, I'd rather have the stair right  up against the wall and leave the other half of the floor open for use. 
---
Half-height stairs were also a great thing in FO4 that I would love to see return...as long as they take away these other restrictions. 
---
You are right. I am happy I do not have to pay so much extra for the DLC that will be coming out. So excited for that :). I can't wait to see some ALIENS 
---
Farmhandy sounds sexual though 
---
Not that I mind ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
I thought the scorchedbeast's sonic had a kind of splash damage on whatever it, so if you sit back from whatever is your cover you dont take damage. At least thats been my experience :/
---
My base is hardly ever attacked by players.  There's really not much incentive to do so, maybe stealing water/plants?  But you get wanted debuff and it's pretty easy to kill someone attacking you on home turf.
---
I see players visiting each other's camp all the time, can be nice to have crafting tables.
---
I think you are right
---
Stop trying to ram your opinions down other people's throats.
---
Cool find!
---
The devaluation of currency or goods is exactly the same principle, regardless of govt. regulation. Flooding the "market" (makes no difference that it's virtual) with counterfeit goods devalues everything.
---
If that’s not how it works then those people who constantly disconnect are liars and have a bad connection or  just liars.
---
do I look fat in the excavator power armor? NO NOT at ALL 
---
The way I see it, everyone on r/fo76 has my username. The amount of idiocy going on here over dupers is mind boggling. 
---
I would like to only be able to pick up one of such items as well. 
---
Especially keys! I love having them but I have to check when going back through an area before I pick up that key ... again for the third time.
---
Get her some excavator PA with the Calibrated shocks and she'll have 200lbs more carry weight. Carry all the things!
---
What are you sending in? Is it "Hey, my character's is stuck and I can't fast-travel," or is it "Bethesda fix duping #111049"? To be honest, there doesn't seem much they can or will do on an individual level, so not sure what sort of ticket you're sending that needs a personal reply.
---
Gahdammit. It IS Skyrim!!!
---
How do you feel about that decision now? I'm assuming in the moment you were very excited. 
---
Also I hope your family is enjoying the game. I bet playing as a family must be so fun :)
---
Got 2 plans and I'll probably get more need the shielded mod for it.
---
&gt; Microtransactions
---
When you bought the game you payed for it's development.
---
If you want regular new free DLC that will have to be payed for, as well as bandwidth, servers etc... and that stuff isn't cheap.
---
In short the Microtransactions are a way to amortize the games further development and fixes further in an optional and entirely cosmetic manner.
---
As far as I know you need to find the plans for those so you can make them. I've never seen them as a spawn in the world.
---
on Xbox too and holy crap I think i crashed 3 times yesterday from swapping things to and from my inventory. Didn't even play, just wanted to lighten my load. but, nooooooooo.
---
This is hilarious. 
---
Portal 2 caused more arguments and controller tossing than is necessary in any lifetime. She’s a born problem solver. I am...not. Terrible idea. 
---
Playing this with her is my olive branch. We have a lot of fun. She keeps me safe hahaha. Gets me all the best weapons and a frame to wear. God knows I won’t think to upgrade that stuff but my favorite part is the super nice camp she built. I hang out there a lot. 
---
The latter most likely. I'm assuming people take silence to mean they're sitting in Austin twiddling their thumbs.
---
When I posted this I got a ton of downvotes and nasty comments.  Glad to see the tide is turning and people are embracing a shared stash now.
---
You sound salty that people enjoy an objectively better game than  Fo76. Those two games aren’t even comparable yet FO fanboys always try to point to Rockstar games and say dumb shit like “you can’t even play it like an RPG”, because it isn’t an RPG. 
---
I have a spare
---
Well, if you still have the plans when I get home, I'd definitely want them! 
---
"Jan 1st: full patch notes will follow soon. One week later: not a peep"
---
if only there was something that could have told you what the point of the post was so you didn't miss it completely and make a useless comment that contributes nothing!
---
Then send them an email. WHen you make a post on reddit, you are basically making and open, public statement. 
---
NO you can not have any compensation. There's no reason why you should get any compensation. If they raised the price, would you cough up the difference? No you wouldn't.
---
Man, some people are just moochy needy, any reason to get more. 
---
New Vegas, and 3 has these hidden gems everywhere also 
---
Oh, I didn’t know that. Thank you!
---
*Seppuku.*
---
Which ones? As far as I’m aware my 1080 is up to date
---
r/prequelmemes
---
I've got a lvl 50 instigating one. It's one of my favorites. Sneak up, one shot, dead enemy. 
---
It’s a perk that enhances the effect of mutations when in a group (perhaps a group with others possessing mutations but not sure on the fine details)
---
It's insanely easy to break into a house or car. The only deterrent is that you will be caught and arrested. In reality this only prevents people who are already afraid to break the law, it's not as much a hurdle as a speed bump for anybody who has their mind set
---
Pay to win? There’s nothing to win, lol. I guess if you’re really into pvp and people are ganking you it could suck. I have had no problems with people or duped items. I just got 3 2 shot weapons yesterday in white springs, it was glorious. 
---
Do you remember where you found the wedding band? 
---
Get the vendor perk maxed it goes way down then just change the perk back to whatever you want 
---
Same issue here. I believe if I unequip it, server hop, then reequip it, it works. Typically. Haven’t tried in a few weeks tho. I gave up. 
---
I actually felt like Warframe was too grindy, mostly because of how complicated it is after all the expansions. That's not a complaint or comparison to 76's RNJesus system, just commenting on my reaction to it.
---
I think the biggest thing Bethesda could do today to restore faith is to admit they are in over their head, and call in Zenimax, obsidian, or any dev with experience in the online game sphere, to give them some oversight. I also happily admit I don’t know what the fuck im talking about from the perspective of actually addressing these issues. I’m just a guy dreaming.... 
---
I have done queen 3 times and 2 times she had a blank inventory and one it had the load symbol for a good 5-10 minutes til the body disappeared all on the same server. 3 times no loot.
---
duper will not be banned because bethesda just can't do that.
---
Want to be able to rock my marine armor and back pack like I did in fo4 :)
---
Yeah see that's just it - there's NO perception that anyone's driving this bus, but of course there's a plan. 
---
They've already claimed to have learned the lesson that more communication is better, but I guess after all the holiday parties they've forgotten ;P
---
This is one of those Fallout 4 features that I'd wish would carry over. Welcome mats are part of the game, but should work in Fallout 76 camps. You log in or fast travel to your camp, and you are standing on the welcome mat.
---
Yea...at least I solo-ed everything, that's something 
---
The effects still work, you just don't gain food or health
---
Seriously. Rip my calibrated shocks 
---
Just sold the extra I had but world hopping to try and get another
---
It's on a radroach on a toilet wearing a top hat. He's in a house just north of Camden Park. He's a reference to Monster Factory. 
---
Yeah in best fanboy tradition I had built up this rationalization about how sound attacks could still penetrate buildings (and might even be worse in enclosed spaces) and this would explain how the scorched overran even hardened military compounds and then I had a scorchbeast kill me through an entire building while flying away and shooting out of its keister.  Now I just server hop if one spawns on me.
---
I would say it's probably when there's too many different items. Have 100 or 100000 flux isn't asking the server to do more, but having 10 weapons with different magazine capacities, condition values, mods, etc vs having 100 is probably asking the server to remember a lot more values. 
---
I understand dupers aren't helping the server stability problem, but it's not like servers were incredibly stable before the exploits were leaked. I think we're giving dupers too much credit in how they can affect server stability. Especially when mules that increase server load (the ones actually carrying 10000 of each thing) are only online for a few minutes at a time.
---
IF they used the same database from Fallout 4 and previous releases and there are many reasons to suspect they did. It was seen numerous times by many people that exceeding a numerical value of items would result in a crash. People will argue against that here and down vote this I am sure. 
---
But it has been happening in Bethesda games for awhile now.  Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 all become sluggish and buggy with huge inventories. 
---
Every gun, armor piece ... anything that has a unique identifier associated with it requires more resources. 
---
Lol I just want Bethesda to be held accountable for not giving us something worth $60. I do not think that is pathetic but just a consumer trying to fight back against a company going down the greedy path of profit over all. 
---
But you can’t use them. 
---
Hey guys, thanks for commenting about this issue. I can confirm that this is going to be fixed in a future update.
---
I love it when people use other games. In GTA, In this, in that.
---
It's no wonder so many games seem like the same game, with just a veneer layering on top to make it fantasy, or sci fi, or whatever. 
---
I hope this game grows in directions that other games don't. 
---
Lmao no I got ya I figured thats what you thought :) nah no way I'd droo that kinda scratch on a gane for a bag. And helmet that I could 3D print.
---
I'm still sitting in white springs to get my haircut
---
What kind of damage is the sonic attack anyway?  Ballistic,  energy?  Surely not radiation. 
---
Subnautica is great.  I actually don't have an issue with FO76.  Yeah, it has issues and it definitely needs to be improved, but I am satisfied that I got my moneys worth.   For every Subnautica there are dozens of other games that I have not gotten as much of a time/$ investment as I have FO76.  
---
The main reason I wanted to comment though is a shout out to another game that is Amazing.   Rimworld.   The graphics are pretty poor, but the game is amazing.  I have played off and on through beta, and the full release is well done.   Again, the graphics may turn a lot of people off, but if you can get past that, it is an amazing survival game.  Very detailed.
---
Lol - so true.  Now whenever I hear burrowing I walk backwards and wait for them to pop up
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I think the crashes are due to the speed of dupers crafting. This of course in addition to server instability. If Beth can get the duping fixed then we *should* have increased stash. 
---
I can't say the game is balanced now, so a rebalance would probably not be rejected so much as it is really really needed, especially when it brings positives such as more star legendaries. 
---
Rank 3 Good with Salt 
---
The bugs/exploits weren't an intentional part of the game design.
---
Yup this happens to me as well
---
I don't use Farcebook or Twatter and the USB thing is a pain in the ass so I just take a pic of the tv with my phone. 
---
if i spend caps to go some place just pick something up (like the led weights in the gyms) and there gone I will bail on that server.
---
that ... is clever, hmmm.
---
That damn prize bot! I get slaughtered by a group of level 64 glowing ghouls, and guess who comes up to CONGRATULATE ME right after I exhale my final breath!! My team mates were DYING laughing!
---
Because of this glitch, I have over a thousand copies of “Free Watoga!,” which I give to anyone randomly. You never know when you’ll be inspired  to save Watoga from its plight. 
---
That's kinda what I already do. How do I change my faction tag to "glowing ones"?
---
I don't find continuous inventory management fun when it is constantly required vs optional.
---
lmfao
---
My poor graphics card wasn't plugged in all the way. :&lt;
---
Chipset or Audio.
---
I feel like I’ve only seen that in the savage divide. Are there other places too? 
---
The problem is that TSE weapons allready 1shot players wearing the best power armor in the game. Raising the loot cap would only solve half the problem. We would still need nerfs.
---
these vids almost made me piss myself
---
Exactly. Had some kind of deja vu.
---
I love challenging games and I love all Bethesda games so much but I always play on the highest difficulty so it is probably my fault for liking to be challenged. And I'm not really talking about semi auto rifles as much as shotguns and automatic rifles I've seen them used and used them myself.
---
True! 
---
We appreciate all the feedback on the building systems, thanks for taking your time to create this post! I will pass this feedback along.
---
Try Overcooked couch co op haha.  It's a real test.
---
Damn that sounds good! But I don't know anyone to play with so thats not happening lol :x
---
If I can get on tonight I’m heading there with a miners helmet. Makes EVERYTHING 5x spookier.
---
Next would be then to replace the whole camp an try an position it somewhere else or like others said get the perk. I had this happen at one of my builds but not only spawning under water but inside the foundations unable to move.
---
You had the option to use a gamma gun and heal the enemies, or use a flame thrower and heal the players.
---
You chose your side.
---
I had someone watching me. Guy came to my camp and snuck in wearing the ritual mask/outfit and a chameleon armor piece. Left a bag with a note titled "his birth" about some crazy stuff. Then waited watching me in a corner, invisible. I noticed him when he came in and thought he'd left at first. But I caught him moving in the corner of my screen. He followed me around doing this for a while. It was funny and creepy. 
---
It would be nice if I if this said stairs would also snap to the left and right of a foundation
---
If you go into the Toxic Dried Lakebed by Clarksburg, there's an old diner. Go in the diner, and there is a teddy bear cooking another teddy bear behind the counter. 
---
Yeah the host type person says to do this when you walk in.
---
I’ve thought about super remote, edge of map camps but, my god, the fast travel prices must be brutal. Maybe when I’m level 100-something and have loads of excess caps laying around. 
---
I'm always over encumbered when out of pa so I never mod pockets. I only run 3 str. Stealth, rifle, VATS crit build. Ultralight has aP benefit as well. With 15 agi base and mutations I don't really need extra stealth as well. 
---
I'm sorry, you'd have to be a **heck** of a hoarder for it to be continuous. The only times I get to the limit is when I've been stupid and dumped in a bunch of stuff without scrapping or been hoarding weapons for mods and later forgetting about them.
---
TSE, healing factor, and power armor just take all the fun out of the game. One-shotting, never needing to heal, and being invincible are considered cheating in most games. Here they are presented as features.
---
Ahh gotcha! THanks
---
No problem for me either
---
Has happened to me and it only stopped for me once I logged back in.
---
Not being able to remove objects because of this restriction was one of the worst decisions concerning building. If we, for whatever reason, lose access to part of the base, we can rebuild to regain access. There is absolutely NO need whatsoever to not allow players to delete an object due to accessibility. If the player wants access to that part of the base, they'll build it.
---
They need to remove this restriction, along with objects needing support, mysterious floating objects when they're not floating, and intersecting objects. Per OP, stairs need better snapping and so do floor types. Why can't a "second story" floor attach to a foundation, or a half wall attach to the underside of a roof without a wall below it? They're called soffits and they are something that gets built in the real world.
---
Nothing it more maddening than wanting to make an interesting building and stymied by an over-restricted system. I work in construction design and use Autodesk tools every day. There are a few tools that are too restricting in these programs as well which cause more grief than help when designing and modeling a building. Not that Fallout building really compares to re-world modeling tools, but restrictions on a tool just make it frustrating. 
---
Most of the crafted drinks weigh significantly less than, say, boiled water... that's my primary motivation
---
it is stack with multiplicative.
---
I feel you op. I think its hilarious people will shit on the game then go play it and come back talk more trash and go back to play again etc. Rinse repeat. People need better priorities lol 
---
If you’re PS4 add me, same as this username. I have a fallout date til 1030 with the boyfriend, but I’m always looking for more people
---
True, but at least the loot would all be there, also level 50+ xp becomes less and less important
---
Have you met the players in this game? Some of them deserve it
---
yea, that happened once as well
---
I would never guess that audio drivers would cause the hang up but on this game anything’s possible. 
---
Exactly! The goal isn’t too discourage people from playing, even people who took advantage, because if we are all honest, very few of us didn’t benefit from the exploits, I have my TSE gauss and I sure as hell
---
Didn’t find it, and it sure as hell is worth more than what I paid for it... the goal
---
Is to move forward and leave all that in the dust... 
---
The first I’ve heard of the clean server is this post, I’m not sure how that actually works, but in terms of your idea, I think that’s a fantastic way. To the majority of people it would literally be unnoticeable, to high levels, it would be a sacrifice for a balanced game, and to those felonious few, it would be an opportunity to do no more harm, or start fresh! which I’m all for! 
---
I'm level 63 and the only 3 star legendary I've seen is a fire axe. Feelsbad.
---
I'm actually still waiting on a second gatling gun (non-laser) to drop from anywhere so I can start modding one of my main weapons.
---
It is worth $60. You thought it was. You've gotten $60 worth of play out of it. Saying you didn't is just your obvious attempt for free stuff. 
---
Greedy? The company sells entertainment. it's all about selling a product. Greedy. Get a load of you. 
---
Everything they make is for disposable income. And here you are trying to make some argument about them being greedy, when you've already stated you feel entitled to more because STORES lowered the cost of the game. Not Bethesda.
---
Man, do you try and return toilet paper claiming it didn't catch all the poop? That you didn't get your wipes worth?
---
So when she gives u the  Excavator armor you can become her portable stash 
---
Same, I would love it if anyone has any idea on superior versus improved etc.  These "adjectives" aren't useful. 
---
YOOOOO... PLEASE FILM THIS I WANT TO SEE THIS!!!!
---
You mean the underarmor?  You get one of the 2 types I think as a quest reward doing the enclave questline, which is nearish endgame.  If they give you the urban skin you can still buy the forest skin from one of the enclave vendors (not sure which).  I think the forest one looks better than urban but it's just color difference.
---
Max level has +3 strength &amp; +2 perception I believe.
---
I know it’s not now, but maybe as an update?
---
Yes you can, granted not all but there is some.
---
Damnit!  Let me back in! https://imgur.com/gallery/kox2U3R
---
i think that if you store other items in a footlocker for example that you are at risk to losing that item if something happens to your camp..as far as a shared stash box..no that is not possible
---
Not your fault but your preference. Everybody has a different play style when it come to these types of games. We are all independent and individuals, because of that we will always have different opinions and preferences to things.
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
I disagree, If I, as unstealthy as it is possible to be in a thundering metal house, can run up crouch, and still land a sneak attack sledgehammer blow on a wide range of enemies then a sniper should have no trouble at all in whatever armor they care for.
---
Enemies in this game are blind, deaf, and often don't see players for extended times for reasons I can only think of having to do with latency and the online delays between the server. I am finding stealth way easier than I normally do, and I have never cared for stealth. People may not realize this, but you can sneak attack most enemies in caution state, even as they fire in your direction. 
---
...
---
My more general 2c
---
Never repair anything. The costs of repair are really high, unless you find an amazing legendary, or some other unreplaceable item that you plan to use even after level 50 then fixing things should not happen.
---
Scrap as many weapons as you can.
---
Try to aim for 100-200 of every type of junk in your stash, and no more, with few exceptions it is easy to have too much junk, only springs, screws, and plastic have value beyond 200, at least until so late in the game this advice stops being relevant. Bulk and sell as much as possible, as often as possible.
---
Don't hang out in the savage divide, skip it and go for the mire and cranberry bog in the east, or stay in the forest, ash heap, and toxic valley in the west, the savage divide is a mid game quest hub, but it also has things all the end game players want that don't exist in the end game areas, they thusly make the middle of the map a super hardcore zone full of level 60 enemies, with everything else being easier, most of the time. I recommend hitting up the bog when you decide to cross over, it has surprisingly good resources available, especially adhesives, each red pitcher plant gives 4 if you harvest it quickly, and with the perk green thumb 8, it can be hard to keep in supply otherwise.
---
make friends, or at least allies, and invest in at least 3 charisma so you can share team wide perks, these make the game so much easier for everyone involved, as having 3 charisma means you can give everyone 1 extra perk in effect, and having 3 people giving you one perk back gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility early one when you need it, you don't even have to play in the same area of the map, and can share perks anywhere. 
---
Pvp is a mess, you probably want to set to passive and stay there until you choose to go pvp, a number of generous people were handing out free explosive shotguns to devalue people who were asking real money for them, all duped of course, and a lot of people, especially level 50 and above with blow you to smithereens in one hit if you aren't careful. 
---
Yeah I never use power armor either
---
Cool. Are you on console or PC?
---
I wish, but no. I'd be able to make things a little more organized.. like put all my food and drink into a fridge container. 
---
I filled Shaun's room with Teddy Bear's and Jangles in two play throughs. I couldn't add more in the first because they would fall out of the window or just entering would disrupt the whole pile! 
---
As to the micro transactions: aren’t all the Atomic Shop items cosmetic only? I don’t think there are any items for sale that actually can help you play better or defeat enemies easier. 
---
"ohhhh look at that sloth, Bob, isn't he cute? What a cute sloth! I want one Bob, let's get a sloth!"
---
"Linda, please don't pet the giant sloth"
---
"Awww come on, he's just a big sweetie, aren't you Mr Sloth"
---
*tames giant sloth*
---
Mine checkpointed saying I had all the clues but then when I got to the facility it wouldn't open the door. Had to run back and get the correct keycard and then go back to the facility. Fucking annoying.
---
I'm sorry, but what? You would be OK with paying to save your perk card loadouts, which should be a basic feature in this type of game? Absolutely not.
---
I would kill for actual progression.....
---
I would love it if succeeding at an event refunded your caps spent to fast travel to it. Since events are so frequent all over the place, this means you have a near-infinite source of gameplay that costs you nothing to engage in (assuming you win the event)
---
Yep. Vampire Switchblade + Martial Artist + Radicool = Haven’t died in a nuke zone in weeks. 
---
OMG spare us the bleeding heart sob story. 
---
Unfortunately, I think this may be a difficult list to provide as I have seen the same level armor have different DR, ERs even when they are the same level. For example, I have gotten drops of Metal Chest armor pieces with no modifications with different DR/ER than Metal Chest pieces that I have seen for sale and craft. I have even seen these resistances vary from the exact same merchant. Not sure if anyone else has experienced the same or not.
---
I don't think so scooter.  I paid full price and I got to play during the beta period and for however long it has been until the price drop.  That time in game has value to me.  Not sure how you could think that was a rip off.  
---
My issue with it is that the light, the bottom section, below the blades, also spins.  It's just low poly enough to notice it.  My biggest complaint with it is that it lights up the room above it.
---
Xbox, I assumed you were too since the thread was on xbox
---
I might need this faction changing info too, I feel the need to get some energy weapons and mods...
---
No way, no one has ever heard about the engine being old. Its not like its a meme or anything at this point. THANKS!
---
I never have weight problems at all without power armor especially since I got marsupial
---
 And anti-armor has diminishing by damage systems of fallout 76. If your damages are 4.8 times higher than enemy's armor, then armor piercing is starting lost its efficiency. If your damages are 6.8 times higher than enemy's armor, then armor piercing lost it's all efficiency. 
---
Same thing with the wendigo and the clown outfit.
---
- notify them the behavior is detected and give them a chance to stop
---
- ban them for each offense moving forward with increasing durations until they get the point
---
You don't ban gamers for doing what they do best - you don't discourage them for beating your systems - but you do need to detect / deter the bad behavior for the sake of everyone else's experience. And that doesn't mean you need to lose a customer in the process.
---
I at least know that the acid attack will go through whatever cover you're behind.  I've been in a concrete bunker and had the spray come through the roof.
---
Gonna be honest, was a bit disappointed that this link wasn’t a rickroll. Definitely a hilarious build though.
---
Sadly, dupers and duplicated ítems are a lost cause...
---
Every post you've made in this sub is just complaining and mocking people who enjoy the game.  Are you desperate for attention or just a mediocre troll? 
---
Further, I think anyone who actually loves fallout, is comfortable with some change. If you are more overpowered in an online game
---
With your peers, than you could ever be in their single player games (which is saying s whole lot) than you probably understand that change is needed. 
---
She clearly has good taste, she married me. But unlike some people I don't base my enjoyment of a game off other people's opinions of the game. I leave that elitist bullshit to the professionals. 
---
My guess is a update next week and the week after then a week without a update or maybe two 
---
They and assaultrons are the only enemies in the game I have to use tactics and grenades for, but I just found a sentry bot that could do high damage to me too last night
---
Just realized that recently I have this issue too.
---
Oh well, hope the next patch addresses and fixes it.
---
Wife and I just watched this together. ChickenNuggies death was tragic lol.
---
Did he drop any killer loot?
---
I use 4 only because this is the same world, i am not saying this is destiny or GTA.  This is the same world and engine as 4 so why the difference?
---
How the fuck did I miss that?
---
&gt; isn't that the point though?
---
There is no point. I have a giant home that can't fit a few thousand bobby pins in it. Why do I have to prioritize what I can keep? How is that fun? I can understand not being able to carry 100 rifles, but why can't I build an armory in my base? It's exactly what people would do in an apocalyptic situation. The reason we can't keep a bunch of stuff is because Bethesda is not good enough at code to maintain a large list of items for two dozen users at a time like every other MMO on Earth is capable of.
---
yeah but sense the dark ages? 
---
I went to my first zone at 17
---
Only time I saw him spawn was when WS was nuked - and he was glitched and didn't move while me and all the WS bots beat him to death.
---
Except it's a videogame and there is no real world harm of any kind for duping nuka colas my friend. Exploiting a weakness of software is something you'd pay security company's hundreds of thousands of dollars to do - should the dupers send the bill to Bethesda then?
---
Did you get a plan you had to read, or did you just somehow learn the plan by doing the event?  I've done the event a bunch of times now, and haven't gotten any plans at all.  I've done is solo, with a bunch of other people, and as part of a two person team.
---
Just curious what I might be doing different, or if they nerfed the rewards.
---
Yeah, but how is that any different than when your hard drive crashes normally? Equipment failures are bound to happen eventually regardless of being stored on the client or in “the cloud.”
---
My normal weight of stuff I carry excluding junk without perks is 3000. with up to about 1200 more in junk on top depending. If I could find some calibrated shocks for my excavator I could probably add another 1000 pounds to that.
---
Before you ask, I do not fast travel, ever. After hitting around level 50/60 I decided I wasn't having fun fighting the weight system, and decided to try ignoring it at the expense of fast travel, and I have had way more fun since then, and now I can't go back, the advantages outweigh the luxury that was fast travel. Now I fight the super encumbrance limit ;)
---
I killed it for the first time the other day and the loot wouldn’t load, then the body disappeared, didn’t get anything 
---
My Harper's Ferry home dropped me in the water about a dozen times as well. Even when I built elsewhere, near the smallest of streams, that's where it liked to drop me. I've stopped building near water.
---
I imagine that maybe they check a few different spots and pick the lowest so that players don't end up on a rooftop or something, but they're not testing whether the spot's underwater.
---
If you don't have it already, taking over a workshop teaches you the "water purifier - small" plan which can be placed in dirt.
---
and 50% armor piercing is not 50% damage boost. It has maximum 28% damage boost on limited cases. 
---
Tbh Idk anything about any of them. I’m only watching Etho’s new series on the Pokemon server.
---
Absolutely, balancing all around is needed 
---
I can mule ya, user name is the same as above.
---
You wouldn't think it would be that difficult to adjust. If nuke A hits spot B spawn C. If spot D, Spawn E,etc.
---
My camp is already prettt low budget and I run the same exact camp design on two characters so I’m gonna do some experiments 
---
You got a discord? We have a group, I can help you out. Need the same in return tho, need to make an alt lol. 
---
OMG YES!
---
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get over it soon.
---
&gt; Honestly we probably wouldn't even care if the loot was worth it... but more times than not, ~~unless~~ _even if_ it's in a nuke zone it's garbage.
---
FYP
---
and 4 was different than previous versions. 
---
So your point is still not valid. Each game is different. 
---
== *X-files music sting starts playing* ==
---
I'll check my inventory for it. I don't remember when he popped out telling me I was the winner but like everyone else it was super random and got me like "lol wut"
---
My luck must be better. I have had multiple TS drops and one explosive drop. When they nerf explosive effects, I think TS will be the next cool gun. 
---
That mask is BAD ASS. Do want 
---
Well I launched charlie, then went to a silo near r&amp;g statjon, so idfk if those correlate but I did not see the nuke come out 
---
no, *buying the mod* is like buying the water heater.
---
Installing it is like ... well, installing it.
---
Installing shit isn't easy for everything, you know.  I'm not a gun person, but I imagine changing out the receiver / barrel / stock or even the clip is not quite as easy as you think.
---
I'm sure, in the post-apocalyptic world, there's less emphasis on "user friendliness".
---
Needing a perk to install a mod is a lot less immersion ruining than, say, having a shotgun that does more damage than a literal nuke.
---
Yeah I'm guessing that too. I just expected something small to stabilize the servers or something, maybe remove a bug or too. Been a while since the last update, that's all
---
I found that the “log off” function when ctrl+alt+dlt works for me 100% of the time
---
Just in case you don’t find a fix. 
---
I'm sorry for you but it was preventivable. Games at Day-One could be bugged. Bethesda games, overall at the beginning, are bugged. I cancelled the pre-order 2 days before release because of the huge patch; it was symptom of a not carefully planning.   
---
I waited for 1,5 month and spared myself anger.   
---
I went up there to watch my the impact from the first nuke I launched
---
They drop fast later on in the game.
---
Many of the containers are inconsistent and although they appear to be med boxes won't work with the perk.
---
But I also encountered the same issue which just sort of went away after some time.
---
Hmm that's stupid. I'll see if I can test it too. I might have plans for it...
---
“You got baseballs too? Oh yeah for sure no scrapping”
---
Today you just gave the normies a solid 200 cap spot that not many people know about.
---
No it's not. It's not like that at all.
---
It's like I walked into your home, and I made copies of all your stuff. It hurt nobody in the process. I duped your food and your girlfriend, and I gave you some duped food and girlfriend's, and then I shared duped copies of your food and girlfriend to the rest of my homies.

Complaint #31,873 about the Scorchbeast. Welcome to the party, we're glad to have you.

I'd love to see one in the wild - only one I have ever encountered was the Lake Eloise spawn
---
Then submit a trouble ticket. PS - they already know.
---
I agree 100%. I even recorded a video once of my standing still for 60 seconds straight with just a green screen. Couldn't even see my health or ammo indicators 
---
Can we also just get normal stashes like in fallout 4 instead of being all connected to the same stash 
---
People like the fishlamp. If you like the fishlamp you might buy it
---
I found a port a potty with a corn stalk growing out the of the seat.
---
Honestly even if that was true would it matter? People have made up their minds whether they are going to like FO76 or not for the foreseeable future. I could care less well crafted communication as long as I know what changes are made and when there is going to be downtime for an update, I can continue to enjoy the game.
---
I can't believe you guys are killing Jake - he's got 5 unicorn-dragon- pups to feed!  XD
---
The problem is that xbox and sony have to approve updates they could fix pc right now be releasing updates for pc every day without a hassle 
---
It a turret from nuka world
---
I guess you just don't understand how retail works. 
---
Retail companies by the game from the Game Company. They buy it cheaper than they sell it for. Even cheaper than when they mark it down. They can't return the unsold products. 
---
So if you bought your copy from Game Stop, then it was Game Stops choice to mark the product down. Not Bethesda. 
---
So who did you buy your game from? Go take it up with them. They are the ones that marked it down. 
---
Does the different colored pippy boi have a different colored light?

and in other news IDGAF about...
---
I cannot agree with you more and I’m somewhere around level 150 or so. 
---
The sound of those fluttering wings and that first screech usually convinces me to log off. 
---
Scorchbeasts suck rocks. 
---
Thank you for your reply. Much appreciated.
---
Yeeeeeah! 
---
It's very annoying to have to unequip combat cards so I can pick locks.  I get why there are limited slots but it is a huge negative on QOL once you hit the endgame.  Quick swap would at least mitigate some of that I guess.... Frankly I think combat and non combat perks should have their own points bucket to fill rather than be combined.
---
No it is I've gotten 5 or 6 calibrated shocks for the T60 from them.
---
Fuck this abomination
---
I just need a way to turn the music off all the way because hearing it  gives me the insane urge to go back to Skyrim and I can't keep doing that. I have a mountain of games to get through 
---
Maybe kids really do have a problem discerning video games from real life. If this is what an average Redditor critically thinks and applied themselves then this world is as crazy as For and CNN would like us to believe. Holy shit!
---
Find worthy players like u/batman1876 to donate it to, so they can turn it into serums and the like and distribute to grateful crowd.
---
1) turn the other direction
---
2) run until you have distance on them
---
3) shoot/vats in the head
---
4) done
---
I don't have any issues dropping them, even without Legendary / TSE weapons.
---
They're just not worth the time or effort.
---
IT isn't smarter then you they just know how to use Google better
---
Nope, its just different pipboy, menu is same. And light too and yeah it burns my eyes too lol.
---
I probably will!
---
Damn, I was hoping I'd be the one-millionth complaint so I'd win a lifetime supply of tissues.
---
Console, xbox one
---
yeah move it more inward
---
Submiteeeed
---
I got the legendary ghouls slayer gamma gun the other day
---
A RAAAAAAGING TWO-SHOT BONER! 
---
Mole Rats are annoying, but it could be worse. I've got a friend who laughs at almost everything in-game and solos the nuke silos. He still thinks twice about fighting bears because of their constant staggering attack.
---
This was a $60 AAA title at launch, not a free to play game.  It is ridiculous to support nickel and diming players for quality of life improvements like this. 
---
Mine didn't correct til I ran the scan and repair. Gosh was that frustrating. 
---
I would love to have this. But I think the player vending will be a good source and fix for this. 
---
I would love a set of stairs that can snap to the left/right half of a tile. Then I could make an internal staircase and go up 2 floors in 1 tile space without having to use the 2x1 piece.
---
Eh, it was a running joke from a post made thirty, maybe forty minutes ago. I do agree with your post, I was just going for the easy laugh.
---
I’ll give you 1k caps for it
---
Mmmm... There is already a class action lawsuit in the works soooo...
---
I am a gun guy, and yes, it is that easy.   The receiver might be a challenge but most things are easy.  You are telling me I can make a pipe pistol out of trash (maybe 100 people could do this), but cant change the mag on a combat rifle (a 10 year old could do this)? 
---
every game that has trad able items has a market like this
---
Where did I say I had dismissed other people's issues? I did no such thing. I said I simply didn't mind the issues as much as others.
---
Yeah mods can make the game as you imagined like sim settlements for fallout 4 seen it was like this what I wanted the settlement system to be like.
---
they just disappear into the ground if you do this, then they come back up behind you and strike again and stagger you until you die 
---
 I already sold it lol
---
Had the same problem
---
Happens to me as well when your far enough away 
---
I have a few vouchers, but have idea how to cash them in....
---
What we get : 
---
" In the next two updates we will begin talking about the awesome new features to come in PvP, new content and the future. Stay tuned!"
---
Ok so I'm done with the quest already so I can't get the siphon. I'm talking about after the quest is finished I know you can actually use the terminal for holotapes but it dosent seem to work. I have the strategy guide and it says you can use it to make your friends a holotape but it dosent seem to actually work. 
---
Its like one out of ten that's worth while to me. I've gotten some neat plans and weapons, shitty armor piece though.
---
Except that you cant exactly flood a market that has no limit,in the 1st place.
---
Probably the difference between heavy, regular, and light versions of the armor.
---
I bought it literally the day before the price dropped lol. It’s still a fun game though and don’t have any regrets paying full price. It is what it is.
---
People who disconnect aren't software engineers, don't work for Bethesda, even if they were they probably aren't in Dev Ops and don't have access to the 3 sets of servers operated for the game and have any insider knowledge to how the platform works. So yeah - probably just perpetuating false information.
---
I have trouble with a similar problem i have 3 in it but I can't share a 1 star perk card. As soon as I share it. I leave the page and its off. I got rises of addiction and still the same thing
---
Had those assholes knock me off a cliff one time...
---
Yeah, I guess the game decides it must be bugged when it sees that during fast travel? No idea.
---
Sad to hear it's apparently just a thing that happens, though. Guess I'm just screwed out of the single most important weapon I'd found in 150+ hours of playing.
---
There is a "secret" room in the abandoned bog town (north of Watoga) that spawns lots of globes, typewriters, pencils, etc. It is a good place to hit for some repairs
---
Water purifier + stimpak or radaway or radx + superduper + chemist = cap factory. Or stuff to give away to noobs
---
If you had multiple characters that you actively play on it would fill up too fast. 
---
Put a key pad on the outside and a pressure plate on the inside. The wiring detail is a little more complicated but still rather easy. 
---
I will give it a try, thanks
---
u/Ladydevann can you please comment on this.  It is a little nuts that no one from bethesda has commented on any of these threads but we get comments on a lot of the "Check out my house!" threads. 
---
Y’all should hire me, make me president so I can fire you and your entire division. You are completely worthless and a total waste of money. Why are you o reddit? Bethesda should be isolating itself trying to fix its problems, not gerrymandering to the public on reddit. Y’all have a collassal flop on your hands, and you’re about to lose the monopoly on good post apocalypse games... and what does Bethesda do? Hire reddit admins. Hire 600% more PR people... whoever is in charge and making decisions for Bethesda is leading y’all straight into the dumpster.   
---
If you cared about fallout or Bethesda you would be trying to revolt... instead you on reddit playing with may mays and randos tryna get them k-points.   
---
*if we get a reddit account with over 10k karma then we will know our game was a success!* -Todd cuntward, probably 
---
&gt; I am a gun guy, and yes, it is that easy.
---
See?  you have the perk.
---
I agree with this completly.  Tired of launching Nukes, doing daily quests, and running at 5 FPS during Queen attacks.  Dupers are a pain also as they create more unstability for the server.  
---
The disconnects have been a problem since day 1... Before duping. Dont be so simple.
---
No I’m sorry I don’t found it  on an alt that I ran for a minute until the Excavater PA bug was fixed like an idiot I didn’t write down the location haven’t found it yet on my main but it was on a body you could loot
---
Can't be because my PC is bottom tier. Shit it was bottom tier when I built it using an i5-2500k and I've never had the infinite load screen. 
---
From what I can tell the Scorchbeasts only land in specific areas. So if by luck you're somewhere on the map where they weren't tested properly they will never land.
---
Near the railyard in the Great Divide, on top of a half-destoyed building, there's a teddy bear using a magnifying glass to examine the rear end of another teddy bear... not sure what to make of it.
---
There could be so much more data and lore they can dump into this game.  I think the quality of the terminals is in a good place, and they don't have the amount of lore books to pepper the world like Skyrim.
---
All I am saying is I would like to find a terminal with a story of the Rusty Abernathy Maid would be nice.
---
yeah the hold my beer of gaming moments 
---
Having something like this is the only reason I can see paying 800ish caps for the floor safe for your camp. Right now it’s tied to main stash box which makes it pointless. Even better would be if we could put down the floor safe then cover it with a rug or something. 
---
Yeah, I started minmaxing and theoreycrafting as soon as it came live but soon I realized that its pointless since the fights already feel trivial for the most part and the level gain is so rapid that i count early game as grinding through 1-50 and then the actual game starts, at which point the its no longer a challenge so I switched to every weight reduction perk there is and other QoL perks rather then just minmaxed destroying machine. It's a bit disappointing. And honestly, what is actually the point of duping all that OP gear when the game is not that hard anyway
---
Pipe weapons are the only safe thing in the game
---
Yeah, I found this out when I was a wee lad and going after the Overseers tape in the ash heap, had 2 of the things stalking me when I finally made it to one of the warehouses where I thought I was safe....
---
I'm just sayin Bethesda wrote in their strategy guide that you can use this terminal for actual holotape duplicating but that does not seem to be the case.. Wouldn't be the first time the strategy guide was wrong... 
---
I couldn't resist trying to take them all... I think I have about 64 and I can't get rid of any of them &gt;\_&gt;
---
I think the wiring is my worst enemy. May I ask if you are on PC and mind coming over and have a look?
---
I would end up just putting stuff in it free for the taking, but good idea
---
There is nothing to devalue.
---
There is no value.
---
The value of the game is only manifested by your conscious or subconscious mind - it's worth what it's worth because it's worth it to you.
---
Open a window, or better yet a door and walk through it and experience real life. It's out there. 
---
\+1
---
you can get ultracite and prime plans from SB... so not completely rewardless... granted its a hell of a low chance.  I've pulled 2 out of the hundreds I've killed.
---
I have a legit level 20 explosive gun and it can kill me instantly if I’m too close to someone and fire it. The explosive damage is WAY too high lol
---
Its called pacifist mode.
---
I've seen 5 at one time, and had to kill 3 of them at site alpha, the other 2 remained off in the distance occupied by something else fortunately
---
VATS is your friend. Turn around and wait for them to reappear again.
---
I'm glad &lt;3
---
It should have been part of demolitions ecpert from the get-go
---
wherever it is now just move it back about 25 steps..problem solved
---
If they don't want you farming the end game boss for end game loot, what do they want you farming, trash mob ghouls. /s
---
I know for ps, there's an approval process to go through sony for any game update after full release. So, not completely their fault on the time between updates.
---
There are perk cards in strength and (possibly) endurance that prevent stagger while wearing normal armor. I also have learned to always carry a one handed weapon on me as well even though im perked in two handed as things like fists and claws can usually math their attack speed.
---
So when i get perma-staggered you can mash the trigger and use the attack to stagger back/block the molerats. I literally switch to my moleman claw, mash the trigger and just wreck them.
---
It does not work on you or friendly robots
---
Meh, if I wanted to farm legs, I'd nuke whitespring. I kill the queen for serums, not legs.
---
I’m not thrilled the price plummeted like it did, but I’m the one that preordered. Nobody forced me.
---
And yes, we enjoy it. Frustrating bugs and all. We have to TVs in the game room (65” and 55”), and bring a third one down for my son (50”). Makes for a crowded room. Lol
---
Nope just intel stat set at 11
---
Lucky I wish I could get my girl to play videogames at all.
---
If two players are attacking an enemy and it dies both get loot. If the turrets get the kill *maybe* the owner of the turrets gets loot if they tagged the enemy. Everyone else is out of luck. 
---
I saw one C.A.M.P that had the turrets behind a garage door. Cutouts pointing to a large pylon, which happened to be a switch that opened the garage door, unleashing the rage of the turrets, and opened the entry door at the top of the stairs. Setup for those who get overwhelmed and need to escape. 
---
Yes, the have to move my base because can't remove pieces is just insane.
---
I had this several times, restrictions to stairs should be looked deeply, or the issue itself.
---
I'd also love to snap floors to foundations.
---
Thanks I just couldn’t remember where it was same as Gilded Grasshopper don’t remember where I saw it at pretty sure it was inside a building though
---
The extra capacity would not be worth making it lootable.  People would just ignore it and continue to push for a greater stash limit.
---
Oh, its "guy who explains jokes," guy.
---
What happens behind the haystacks, stays behind the haystacks
---
Robbing safes would become the only thing I do, all the time
---
The value of production and delivery of in-game items is close to NOTHING and the market is perpetually CAPPED by the install and active player count. LOL
---
This happened to me at Westeck last night.  I got 4/4 searched after clearing the joint out.  Kill the Boss popped up.   My trick was to go to the Data/Quests/Events tab and hit C to show on map.
---
Fucker was all the way over at the East end of the big tunnel. I took a moment to scrap the gigaton or two of weapons and junk so I could fast travel, and the event ended.  No reward.
---
Something must have killed it (damn scorch beasts) or it spawned by a cliff and it offed itself.
---
Lol, spot on!
---
If you can run into a building that is instanced, you'll be ok. Running into a "regular" house is useless. And if the sonic blast doesn't get you, the poison cloud will.
---
Friendly robots where?  Except for the ones in whitesprings, i can blast away at a friendly robot all day and not hurt it.
---
I think they're saying that, if 600 is the effective technical limit, then it's much more achievable to allow transfer between alts (effectively giving you 3,000 storage while the server only has to load 600 at a time) than it would be to revamp the servers to the point where they can sustainably track 3,000 per player all at once.
---
Mule alts are a pain, sure, but with the increased stash size I really don't think they'd be necessary for 99.99% of players. You already have wiggle room for extra armor and weapons alongside a full suite of junk.
---
I’d like to craft legendary items using hard to get plans and materials
---
I refuse to go there alone. I went once to Watoga and got smashed by the bots. 
---
I’ll only go if there are other same level or lower players. 
---
No, not even on legendary. :(
---
I have even seen a scorched behemoth.
---
I really enjoy OutsideXbox, and OutsideXtra. They highlight the big games but manage to remain fairly neutral. Similarly, PlaystationAccess. They're the PS equivalent of OX. If you're looking for long playthroughs though, you're gonna have a rough time
---
This, the only things I will always pick up are anything that has screws or springs in them. Otherwise I keep 75-100 (regularly used) junk, 40-60 (semi used junk) and 30 or less (of rarely used like bone). I bulk and sell the rest. 
---
I do hoard lead since I my camp is near a vein, I probably have about 14 bulked piles atm, I will do my bullets en masse when I get to a certain amount of material, using about 10 piles. Steel, I will keep enough for repairs mainly since it is so common place. If I know I will be needing it, I will starting keeping more (but to be used soon) or farm super mutant towns for pipe rifles. I won't hold on to too much.  
---
It's still a delicate balancing act, but once you've put enough time in you will know what you need.
---
Perk cards can help take a major load off as well. It is easiest to just sell what you don't need. Donate what you can't sell, by putting it in containers discussed on the sub that in high traffic areas; registers, suitcases, lunch pails, etc... 
---
Better then me ranking up Pharma Farma to lvl 3 and not even knowing there was a search button :(
---
It's a whole war in their comment sections
---
Oh, its “guy who has nothing better than poke at reddit posts,” guy.
---
I appreciate it. I do understand looking for a solution is what the community wants. I don’t think the 2 are connected on the level of the carry weight causing the disconnects. I think what happens is when the dupe is done, the forcing of items to create over again and the substantial amounts shown when traded cause a huge impact as well as cause crashes when the dupe itself is done. I think the duping process itself impacts the server with the forcing of the disconnect. Possibly causes errors in the server. These servers tend to have huge issues which can even lead to wrong mobs spawning in the wrong areas. Such as white spring being overloaded with comi bots instead of ghouls. I have multiple pictures of bugs that have happened in these servers. If they wipe all players with the current way Bethesda has been, most of the legit players will possibly quit. Especially if they’ve stuck it out long enough to build these high level players and stuck it out through the bugs and everything else that has been a huge issue. The duper’s will always come back. Some of them make a living off of this right now. When they find a way to ban these players Bethesda themselves may actually make more money because these duper’s will have to buy another copy of the game to play. Like you stated, ammo and junk who really cares? But weapons have became a key issue with the community due to duping. I personally don’t feel as effected by it but that may also be due to the fact when I’m in a server with my group, we typically take half of the server slots and the other half are usually low players who are just playing the game. Playing solo may be completely different because you can chose who half of the server is that you play with. So I do see it from both sides. What I would suspect that is going to happen is they will push this off until this huge patch. When the patch comes out, the fix will be in it. Over the course of that next week, bans will probably happen as well as wipes based on certain criteria’s. They may also implement an auto ban when someone is duping. From a programming standpoint it would be hard to check if a player is possibly duping unless they’re doing the process which would include checking if the player is picking up that stack of 300. If Bethesda really wanted to troll the duper’s they could allow them to get to that point and the moment they pick up that 300 a ban message would pop up. 
---
Aren’t the bunks at the prison both off the ground, and full of diseases?
---
Ugh, I wouldn't be able to stand it - I'm too hyper and want to run everywhere.
---
It’s worth it, I honestly think the online in 76 is a lot better with more to do and a bigger variety of content. If you have had your fill of red dead now is a good time to jump in. 
---
i can confirm this works. Thanks so much this!
---
Do the excavator armour mission and when you register it it will give u the plan. 
---
Whitesprings are the ones I meant. It happened seceral times I would kill a friendly robot on accident while fighting deathclaws in a nuke zone. 
---
I am constantly amused at all the armchair dev'ing going around this sub. Any person who claims they have any kind of knowledge of how difficult any of these bugs would be to fix has no idea what they are talking about. Without direct access to the codebase and working knowledge of the entire project, any discussion of "this would be so easy to fix" is completely absurd.
---
Reminds me of an old client I had. When trying to explain why we couldn't change something in his software, he would respond with "like... couldn't you just write something like IF this happens, DO this?" Oh really? Is that how programming works? Thanks for your insight xD
---
My wife doesn't play with me, but she does say all the things in the comic while I'm playing.
---
She’s been in love with Fallout since she first played Skyrim if that makes any sense. Started with Skyrim and played that for what seemed like non stop a year and a half. Then someone at Game Stop suggested Fallout 3. Then Fallout 4 came and now we’re here. I enjoy watching her play because she actually plays the game to it’s full potential. 
---
SHHHHHH!
---
Did you check their site. They had a Jan 1 announcement. More patches coming later this month, but no firm date yet.
---
Is there a certain level that I need to be on? Or where can I pickup that mission?
---
Empty a cryolater clip into her?
---
Just walk into Whitesprings or the Enclave bunker or log off then log back in and join a friend who stayed?
---
It's hard to get my wife to play anything that isn't Nintendo hahaha
---
I have yet to complete this successfully because on each attempt, all ghouls throughout time appear at once and instakill him after the first safehouse.  Hero to zero, no time flat. 
---
Don’t use it if they implement it? Someone else’s fun is different than yours. You still have to explore to get things. I know this is just your opinion but don’t you think the concept of your opinion is a little limiting? Just for an example. If I would have a build dedicated to melee and then another build dedicated to rifles and  another build dedicated to pistols (3 separate characters) and I find a good rifle or pistol on my melee character. Why would I not want that new concept of shared but limited in weight storage to transfer to my character that actually needs it? Should I trust someone if it is actually a good weapon to not take it and actually transfer it to me? Should I sell it only to go on my other character to grind out that same weapon? I mean it makes sense to want to have that storage to transfer. A grinding game is fun but when it becomes too grindy then it is no longer fun. Some people put in way more hours into this game than others, so yeah they may want a little convenience. It’s not game breaking like you’re saying. It’s not like duping. It’s nothing like duping. 
---
I got a GAS Certificate off a mr handy fuel tank i picked up off the ground. the prize bot gave me 100 prewar money. 
---
That's what I thought at first too, but I have seen 2 Heavy's with different DR/ER before. Literally everything else appeared to be identical.
---
No. Melee combat is infuriating. VATS takes too long to acquire. 
---
Jokes really aren't your cup of tea, I see.
---
Yup. This is me and my boyfriend almost to a tee, except he goes "I'm gonna do it anyways." Now he's level 50 and I'm at 30 🙄

MY ancestors dont smile down on me, there do on you, but thats not a good thing...must of my ancestors were bad people, i am german btw ! LUL

Currently at level 82, I have been involved with 5 SB Queen battles so far, but unable to complete any of them,
---
The first time there were about 6 players attacking and when the SBQ got down around 20% with 4 minutes left, they started suddenly disappearing (Disconnected) 
---
On all 4 other occassions I have been disconnected shortly before Queen Death, and unable to reconnect to that server.
---
This is extreamly disheartening as killing the Queen, and acquiring the Queen loot is important, but to date all I have been able to do is waste resources in the endeavor.
---
If you are dying to mole rats, coming to reddit will not help you. Figure it out. Or get a melee weapon for these specific enemies.
---
Everyone on reddit knows this already, it's posted multiple times a day. Destroy their shit and move on. 
---
Exactly lol. Tho I could see a few people’s camps getting destroyed as someone looks for a safe they don’t even have. 
---
I think Tolkien and Skyrim stole from fallout76. they went back in time to write those stories and make fallout76 look like some poor copy of them, when in reality they are poor copies of 76.
---
I’ve been playing a lot with a friend of mine and we’ve realized that the two times out of too many nukes to count our group has been alone at Whitesprings it’s been magical. Everyone gets a tag, loot loads faster, we can do the disconnect reconnect trick to spawn things if we clear the lap too fast. The issue is that the entire map sees a nuke drop on whitesprings and immediately joins in. I imagine some people server hop until they find a nuke to join. It’s so annoying when everyone things mine mine mine and has to one shot everything to make sure they get loot. I don’t mind people joining our nukes it’s when 3/4 played come in with their exploding shotgun and clear everything before most of us can get tags. 
---
There needs to be a shift in mentality, if a server already has a nuke we switch map. I think that if more people tried to launch their own nukes instead of amassing 10-16 people at the same one it would become common knowledge it’s a better experience with fewer people there. I honestly am starting to wonder if people haven’t hit general status cause they don’t want to do quests and just farm loot, or if people speed through the quests too fast to realize you can request a location for a key card and gather them easily. 
---
Not so pro-tip. If whitesprings gets stupid we just go launch another nuke on harpers ferry. It is not as good as Whitesprings when everyone is being a team player but it is better than Whitesprings when it is filled with explosives. 
---
Couple that with someone hitting her with a Cryolator and you can make short work of the queen and any other scorchbeast. I scoffed at the Cryolator being useful until I learned that. 
---
I simply grabbed fruit from the same low hanging tree as you did 
---
Just did, a double capacity one. made absolutely no difference
---
I literally ignored the main quest on Bethesda games until several hundred hours in.
---
Kinda bit me in the ass with 76, when I realized all the basic plans and recipes I hunted down or traded for would have been handed to me if I didn't ignore the overseer trail.
---
No real regrets, though. 
---
It's actually still draining. If you start a sprint with full AP and then go into pip-boy, you will have no AP when you exit. Such an awesome design. Couple that with laggy servers that decide to just stop regenerating AP at all for seconds at a time (but still let it drain). It's a miracle we can ever sprint.
---
If you're on PC, I'll repair your armor if I can. Ign stonekraken. I have loads of most materials, and the perks to make it cheaper

Spent 6 hours grinding it out to lvl 45 to use the Ultracite Power Armor received from Belly Of The Beast... go to my stash.... to find that it has magically disappeared. Huge bummer. Don't know if I want to keep playing if this is going to happen a second time. I'm enjoying the game but this just sours the experience so hard. 
---
Well, my alt has almost 2.5k on him.  I have 10s of thousands of ammo, 100s of flux, all legit collected.  Note I've been playing since beta and my main is lvl 204, over 350 hours played.  Your idea kills my alt and ends my game.  
---
With the prevalence of TSEs in the game, I got one for a contingency plan. 
---
A wanted/not wanted duo looking for camps to destroy? A random griefer following you around? Somebody one-shotting through the slap damage? Pull out my TSE .50 cal with full heavy gunner, bloody mess, stabilized, demolition, grenadier, and tenderizer perks.
---
If duping is fixed and pvp protection is fixed, I'll gladly throw my tse in the river.
---
In fo4 intelligence(I think) affected crafted items strengths.  It could be the same case here too. Or you could have a different perk. Some increase resistances of armor.
---
Ok my gt is SAWT Sinper 
---
Your other post deleted itself so just message me when you’re on
---
I use it and it’s great. Simple and fast. Easy to install just read instructions. 
---
Would be cool to tame a brahmin and put containers on it and have it follow you (like traders have) 
---
Yep.. Everything is like an avocado....
---
this would actually be huge.
---
That's the thing though. It isn't worth $60 and yes you got jacked. Unfortunately someone has to be first. There was nothing preventing you getting on the refund bandwagon and buying it again later. I payed $18 and feel I got my money's worth. My friend paid $14 and hates the game.
---
Honestly I bought it for camo painted Power Armour and because I hope they pull a NMS and make it a great game later. I didn't want to have to pay a higher price when they eventually fix it. 
---
Well if I don't use it people that do gain an unfair advantage. What you are talking about is a good use case for a hypothetical system of this type but people will mostly use it as an easy way ti not have to deal with weight limits.
---
Nuka girl outfit was also bugged by a patch, which is almost worse because I remember what it originally looked like (was great) but am stuck with a lobotomized version.
---
Well, except these are one shot then reload. So you'd get two shots off in quick succession, but then have to reload two different black powder pistols.
---
looking at you, Canned Beef Stew
---
Yea great mod, wish there was a way to provide the functionality to the console community though.
---
How does this work? Does it slay them or heal them more? Just had \*\*\*legendary gamma gun drop the other day, it's either for scorched or ghouls, I can't remember at the moment.

There is the "Better with Salt" perk which essentially "salts" your food to preserve it longer. It does take up a perk slot, though. Maybe they could add an armor suffix "preserving" that reduces the rate of spoilage by xx%.

Hot plates, typewriters, fans, handcuffs, toy cars and trucks, globes, yao guai

She should try Second Life. Ultimate Barbie Dress up!
---
Same. I wonder if some patch happened because I’ve definitely seen her frozen in the ground before
---
You on Xbox? I have a regular two shot handmade I can give you guys. You have to share though.
---
Yeah they should just remove pvp. The interface is 100% not meant for that kind of interaction
---
Did you actually hit it? When i used the normal barrel i didnt see it get frozen. When i swapped to the long barrel (turns the stream from mist into tiny snowballs) i saw a noticeable diffrence. Unless your cryolater has the explosive affix (gives it stupid long range for some reason) use the long barrel.
---
Thank you for this info. I use the Raider Power Armor and I been wanting this info. Thank you so much. 
---
Well that's what I meant, a walk back to the Resort since that is closest instanced area, with the bunker you have to walk around back. It's just a slow walk back and if people don't have canned coffee or nuka cherry to boost their AP, they will have to let it refill. Then there is the Deathclaw that seems to randomly spawn when walking up to the resort driveway from the clubhouse. As far as a friend, I don't play online with anyone, will it let you fast travel to them while overencumbered? It's a long walk with several things to slow you down in that 2 minute window. 
---
Got one too. Been useful from the last 30 levels and it almost instakills with max sneak bonus.
---
I don't think It did anything to them maybe healed them less idk
---
But, but ... You can't have my Perfectly Preserved Piece of Pie!
---
My main point!!! Devs have given us all these great perks and weapons and variability, and absolutely no reason to use them, every enemy is the same, there is no tactic, there should be enemies who give us a reason to swap perk cards 
---
*finds mutfruit in cool*

oh cool, i'll go make some adhesive

*spoils in inventory*

must have been a real good cooler
---
I'm on xbox and just got to work. I use conduit to go through walls but here is my basic setup. 
---
Pressure switch inside. 
---
Generator to conduit, conduit to wall connector, wall connector to pressure plate, pressure plate to door. 
---
Outside keypad switch. 
---
Same generator to same conduit, conduit ran and built outside to run towards keypad switch, keypad switch to door. 
---
This is the basic principles of a double switch on one fixture. The pressure plate remains off until stepped on giving power to the door and the door will close automatically after full open and off the switch. The key pad does the same thing except you need the key code provided to turn it back on for the brief period of time. Standard on off switches will constantly feed power with no interruption and that is what you need for the door to function properly. 
---
Hope this helps. 
---
Well maybe since she has ice based attacks freezing won't work. I don't know for sure but what I do know is that she can catch fire. I will have to try this next time I fight her.
---
This means the event expired or failed. The marker just doesn't remove itself sometimes. If you can't FT to it, it's not there basically.
---
and what is this 4 inch canvas bag used for?
---
If I have damage increased because of skill (like you know, better aim) it makes no sense for that *increased damage* from those skills also affect yourself when firing at a target too close.
---
Plants can tank more damage than my turrets. Now if I could just get them to fight back...
---
Yes, I do have to agree with you here especially the part about how we were blind from the beggining when choosing our perk cards. I feel like my build is all wrong for the way I play. And yes, my armour peices are very mismatched with various leather and marine legendary peices tied together and shoved under my greeser jacket and jeans to hide it!
---
My original point was just that this game is here to stay so I know I will eventually get that full set of the same armour through gameplay. I still refuse to server hop for specific things because its like another form of materialism. I was glad to see materialism blow up when the bombs dropped. It leaves us with the simplicity of the survival aspect where you take what you need, leave what you dont. I realise most people do what Freddy Murcury sang when he said "I want it all and I want it now". I fear my game I love so much will go stale too quickly if I do have it all in one go. 
---
This happens when you move around while trying to place camp. Once you find the spot you want to put down camp quit build mode then reopen. 
---
Place the camp without moving your character and the camp will place at the price shown. It seems to be a bug. 
---
Lvl 25 is the earliest you can craft the armour. you start the mission I forgot the name but its bottom of the map about center way looks like to towers together. You go there and in the parking area there is a sign there check it and the mission starts. You can do it at any lvl just can't make the amour till lvl 25. 
---
Two shot easily, armor pen is king against the queen though. That’s why melee is so strong against her. 
---
Why are you pretending that it's a comparable scenario? Testing for security exploits is a highly controlled environment and is asked for by the company in question. They willingly contract people to do that for them. Outside of such a predetermined agreement, exploiting weakness in security is a crime. In this case, it's a video game, and it negatively impacts everybody else who plays fairly. It violates the game's ToS
---
Forget where exactly it is, but in the eastern side of the map is a parking lot and 2 stores (descriptive I know) and there is a baby carriage with 2 garden gnomes. They are looking at each other with hats on and stuff in their hands and booze in the cart as well. 
---
There's already tabs for each item category to keep things organized.
---
ditto, i would love to be able to build a deck over the water so I can get to my purifiers
---
True, but you don’t die from the first flame burst.  Depending on your level you’ll have at least 1 opportunity to escape via fast travel.
---
Melee - Block ... it should stagger them and then you strike!
---
You need the crystallized barrel that shoots snowballs
---
Is there a source on that?
---
I'm all for modding Bethesda games, but I don't want to get banned and have to write an essay to Todd Howard because I want my hud color not to be the same color as the terrain.
---
Blowholes. They are it's weakpoint.
---
I just bash them 
---
Lol. A couple people proved your point for you. 
---
No, I understand he sells T60, my point is they also sell T51b.  
---
This is exactly my experience. My buddy convinced me to try it and I had never experienced something so awesome in a game before. I never really tried an RPG before Fallout 3. The massive world and total freedom paired with the post post-apocalypse universe completely sucked me in. 
---
My personal bet:  
---
Fallout has loads of historical things that, in a multiplayer game, can either be kept just as they were and be the only thing people use because holy shit its so OP, or be made significantly weaker, at the expense of previous playstyles from single-player games.  
---
A reasonable way to do that is to put them in a shitty place initially, get through the initial phase where they are absolutely crappy and people are mad, then get them to the levels where you actually want them. This way you "listen to the feedback", and you get to get people happy about where you placed the levels of power of certain items.  
---
I suspect that there are certain aspects of the game where Bethesda did not properly calculated dedication of its playerbase, and thought things will take longer. But looking how Alien Blaster, something that even in its tooltip is described as powerful, is only viable as an exotic sex-toy because it only tickles, I just cannot believe that anyone sane would do that not on purpose.  
---
You might call me too optimistic with Bethesda, but I think that some of the decisions that they made, that people complain frequently about, were placed there just so that a bigger problem doesn't emerge and a satisfying solution to the bigger problem is defined and put in place. An example: Imagine what would happen with caps value if not for the nonsensical 25K cap limit and 1400 cap vendor pool AND the 25% cap return value from sold goods AND NO MORE FUCKING BARTER??! Economy would have to be wiped clean after the beta, then week later, then two weeks later, then month later or otherwise it would be broken beyond repair. Why? Selling throwing knifes would allow people who like to watch their bots to their job for them to get to hundreds of thousands of caps within the first three beta sessions.  
---
The truth this that at this level of game complexity, and with playerbase who likes to break stuff (wasn't breaking stuff one of major parts of the experience of previous Fallout entries?), there is simply no way to make sure shitty things are not in the game without letting thousands people in.   
---
I think once those things are smoothen, we are gonna see big boosts to certain items, so that those things that are the META now will simply cease to be one, because there will be things that are better. I think they knew that, and thats partially why you see so many things copy-pasted from F4 - because they knew they have much more complicated puzzles to solve for now, and while those are shitty, they are rarely a dealbreakers.
---
Your teammate is going toe to toe with the scorch beast queen. She gets in a big hit and his health is at a sliver. As the medic, you go in for the heroic save with your stimpak syringer. And you miss your friend... hitting the queen instead. Her health goes up 30% and your friend just turns to look at you in disbelief as she devours him alive. 
---
&gt; You're more than happy to call them out before they fail though.
---
Yes, that tends to be what happens.
---
&gt;If you can only complain and never compliment, that says more about you then the company.
---
I don't compliment for 'business as usual'. I do for 'above and beyond'.
---
Stranger in Numbers enables some truly broken dps. I’ve seen one god rolled melee weapon with the right perks/buffs/mutations take like 1/8th of her health in one attack. 
---
I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking?  Saving data in a more robust environment than your personal computer helps protect against equipment failure. 
---
Honestly I'd like if after they sort out duping and other major issues, they should just wipe. Or create other servers with a newer version of available content so others can play their old accounts if they want but others can have a fresh start. 
---
oh, that makes sense. Can you get it from scrapping?
---
Oh ok then yeah I've also gotten excavator shocks and t45 stuff from him
---
Oh shit, this would be so great. Honestly that would make the stash’s limit almost where it should be (I would like to see it cap out at 1000, even if it took unlocking through caps/high level quest).
---
Did I just read that someone equated duping with rape and murder
---
You don't need them. If you haven't already, go do the quest to craft excavator armor. You get a full set, that you can actually wear, and you can re-craft it at higher levels as you level up. And it gives you a big carry capacity bonus. That's the only per shot you need until level 50+.
---
I think that’s how I got it. Could have been a plan though. 
---
Do they attack teammates? Or randos that stumble by?
---
My wife plays Pokémon go with me but has shown no interest in console/computer games.
---
If she did we’d need a second PS4 and TV but Id love it.
---
Her university will put paid to any play together for during semester though so it’s probably not worth it...or she’ll become addicted (...she has a lot in common with me) and I’ll have to ban her so she can try and concentrate on uni.  (She is brilliant, HD average...but procrastination due to mental health issues can be her downfall like it was for most of my uni days).
---
TL;dr: you’re a lucky guy 
---
you dont know the logic, why would it make sense to you.
---
  My wife's been a FO/Skyrim fan for a couple years, now.  We only have one PS4, so we don't play together.  That would be a recipe for disaster.  She sneaks and stealths, I walk in with PA on and blast shit.  
---
I totally endorse this idea, lol!
---
A trillion different websites on the internet and nothing but gnomes :(
---
I don't even have any hair, so who cares!
---
You did win the Lifetime supply of Tissues ... you just have to go take them from ... Sandy ... the Scorchbeast.
---
There's also a legendary slot thats unused, and what you described a reasonable tactics of kickstarting an online multiplayer game where economy plays a big part. Let first wave be broken and learn how to deal with the ways people break it, give people second wave, wave1 stuff is now old and boring and everybody wants wave2
---
You did get something. Two weeks early access that those other people missed. If you didn't want to pay release prices you could have waited. Games ALWAYS get cheaper. 
---
AP when sprinting seems massively inconsistent in general. Jumping seems to affect this as well. Taking literally any action (such as opening the pipboy) before the game has registered as "no longer sprinting," can continue to drain your AP down to nothing. In the same vein, I've been sprinting and watched my AP steadily climb as if I was walking, then go back down when it refills. I honestly don't know if it's a bug or not at this point, because it's so inconsistent. It's like "isSprinting" is just a flag, but that flag is horrible at getting updated.
---
Is [Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/) up to date?
---
Aw man that would be amazing! Our anniversary is in a couple of weeks. I’d be such a hero. And yes, we are on Xbox. 
---
 tancels is her username
---
 mine is MrTammy (don’t ask. My wife is a riot and created my profile for me. 🙄)
---
My wife and I play together but it’s more fun to just do things and deal with what happens. 
---
I’ll be online about a hour or so. I’m down to help out. 
---
Jesus, how many TS weapons do you have? I'm 200 hours in and I ~~have not one~~. I would kill for a 2 shot lever action. And you use a "simple" one. Probably when you are not using you simple ts handmade or ts gauss.
---
Just remembered I have a TS Balck Powder Rifle, which I don't use because of the aweful fire rate. 
---
Cyber Monday on a key website. Kaching. 
---
OMG you are so shallow and dense. Good bye.
---
Just another Rust twat doing what they can to bring griefing into a game designed to avoid it.  
---
Just made it past lvl 25 so I should be good to go. I'll look for the towers tonight. :-) Thanks!
---
Uhhuh, sure.
---
Looked it up the place is called Garrahan mining you go in the doors to the main building down the stairs take first left take it all the way to the end left through the door back right and there is a computer you get the plan for excavator and directly across when you make armour put it on and register it by hitting the button .
---
And you can set a macro to change load outs too, to make it work on the fly! Not perfect but takes only a second to switch from sneaky to melee to lockpick/hacking once it’s set up. 
---
Wow I could not disagree with you more on this. 
---
That's been a mod since COBL and Oblivion. And Bethesda still hasn't done it. No idea why...
---
I don't know if this is just me and a weird glitch or what, but if I sort my SPOIL I get a weird mix of  condition lengths mixed with items that don't spoil (chems/bobbleheads). It's totally useless for me on PC 
---
Who needs ladders when you can just hang out in the Blackwater Mine radiation puddle until you turn into a kangaroo?
---
no, you only needed "Wacky Wasteland" to see aliens in Fallout: New Vegas, the ones in Fallout 4 are just a random event (random chance of triggering, but always appears at the same spot when it does)
---
Delightfully devilish, if I do say so myself. 
---
You are truly a pillar of the “raider” community
---
Good info, thanks
---
Have you never heard of zip guns?
---
Use up all your ammo and stimpacks for a useless piece of armor, nah!
---
I’ve gotten some of my best stuff from checking vendors that I see someone else walk away from. Some other people’s best stuff!
---
Perk cards should also affect stash boxes imo.
---
LO. I did the same thing in a Hazmat suit. Go mighty Assaultron, kick his ass, pew pew. ;) Nothing worth taking.
---
It’s a good idea.
---
I’d be happy with just 200 more stars spade though.  I can store enough junk with 600 to get by bit I have to choose what legendary pieces to store way too much and have had to throw away some great legendaries I could have traded...probably...if I could be bothered doing that.  (Mostly 3 Star heavy weapons and pistols).
---
I’m trying to build either a set of legendary combat armour or marine armour but so far have about half of each and that takes up a fair chunk of stash space.
---
As does the spare ammo for my quad handmade (it’s not worthwhile using for me yet as I don’t have the mods and don’t have the plans).
---
Tl;dr: ops idea is great, I want stash space increased first as it is just on the side of being too limiting 
---
There is a mod in fallout 76 nexus called better sorting.
---
It’s phenomenal. You can break into sections and see how much each section weighs. It also tells you about the stack so you can see “oh I’m carry 30lbs if Stimpaks”
---
Tons and tons of meat piles... 
---
I hate school.
---
Liberty Prime.
---
My PA needs PA.
---
Sorry I don't come from a society where people doing their jobs is worth congratulating. That's what they are paid for. Now if they do something special then sure, but doing what you are paid to do doesn't get a 'thanks'.
---
For the most part, yeah. When your character is standing beneath a light source they look like a monster.
---
Environmental lighting has improved though.
---
STILL have yet to find a TSE
---
I'm at work...there are pens...everywhere.
---
And Mr.Handy doesn't?
---
They did fuck up in that the beta wasn't long enough to test out all of the bugs we quickly found after launch. Still enjoying the game, but they need to come down hard on the dupers. The disconnects are going to make me quit. 
---
I dropped a gun for a newer player last night. When I stepped back I couldn’t see the bag, but they could.
---
If you open your map or pioboy while sprinting, the game leaves you in a sprinting state, draining your AP. Before opening either, let go of the run button and make sure your AP has stopped decreasing.
---
It's insanely stupid but once you get used to doing that you can avoid the AP drain much of the time. 
---
Well he found you and he was so disappointed he killed himself after surviving the apocalypse.
---
How is your ego doing Op?
---
&gt; Priority #3:Nerf the power of a “mule.” Ok bear with me while I explain: for the purpose of explanation, say your carry weight is 100, at 200 (double your carry weight) you are no longer able to walk, at 400 (quadruple your carry weight) you are no longer able to trade, pick up, or functionally do anything besides drop items 
---
As someone with 2 mules (one solely for caps &amp; trading on the market and the other only for junks) I would be down for even a hard cap at double the carry weight of the character.
---
A character lvl 1 after creation got 155 carry weight, being capped at 310 is fair knowing you also have a stash, \~1000 cw per mule (without leveling &amp; upping STR / strong back / PA shocks or DP armors) is HUGE.
---
Known.
---
&gt;The problem with your line of thinking is that you're suggesting they make legitimate in-game items "practically worthless" and I don't think you quite understand the ramifications of what doing that are.
---
This is why I stopped playing destiny. I played a good amount for a couple months and had a really good set of gear. Decided to take a break for a couple months. Logged back in... all my gear was suddenly lower stats than the commons I'd pick up on mobs.
---
I really hope bethesda doesn't do anything like that.
---
Immediate hotfix: 
---
•Remove ability to transfer items to non-quest world containers. 
---
•Limit crafting to 10 weapons/armor of the same weapon/armor piece at a time.
---
•Explosive trait on weapons no longer effected by Demo perk.
---
This would significantly disrupt the current methods dupers use to duplicate and curb the affects OP weapons have on gameplay. Would also buy more time to explore ways to detect dupers and their items, though I don’t really think pandora is going back in the box in regards to the duped items already in circulation, but perhaps they can be tracked moving forward. Explosive weapons should be a primary trait on weapons just as Two-shot and Bloodied is. The combo of the 2 are leading to some of the insanity in OP builds. I would be open to them making a fix by making comboed weapons (TSE) unable to be equipped until we take them to a weapon bench and “choose” or craft it into either a Two-Shot or Explosive version and removing a star. Something like that would be more difficult to implement than a hotfix would allow though. However it would significantly alter the worth of perhaps millions of pounds of weight dupers are carrying.
---
Add  tl;dr please
---
The only thing Bethesda nail was our collective ass. 
---
It's when someone A. Uses it in pvp and wipes someone's whole base and non stop kills them and others. B. When someone goes to nuked whitesprings and kills everything there or C. The worst of all when some dupers it and than everyone has them
---
Funny how the quest at  Camp McClintock doesnt have this issue, it seems to spawn the item when you take the quest and not when you join the server. i wonder how many more containers are like that. 
---
Yeah, but a few weeks out?
---
I love this game, but come on. You're getting into apologist territory.
---
I've got a sneaking suspicion that fruit in our inventory all works like bananas in a paper bag. If there's ones thing in there that's a little more past ripe that rest, it'll speed the rest of them along.
---
I carry a TS pipe, TS lever, TSE lever, and a TS harpoon.  Found all but the pipe, a friend gave it to me. I've given away to friends an explosive 50cal, explosive shotgun, TS Gauss, and some other TS /explosive.  I can clear a loop around whitesprings in a few minutes and do it nuked or not whenever I don't see anyone there or when I first log on.  I hop to events after that have high spawn or guaranteed legendaries, like uranium fever.
---
We've also been nuking the SBQ or whitesprings more lately.  I'm lvl 125, not much else to do.  But it's fun with friends
---
There is only one stash, and every container is that stash.
---
I normally just let it hit me, then use the damage ping to find its location and power attack with my sledge. Almost always works.
---
We actually have that set up in the living room so we can both play. It’s nice. It’s hard not to get addicted to games sometimes. We can totally relate. 
---
Also, thanks man. You are too 👍🏻
---
I'll have the Lobster Thermidoor please. Oh and could you add SPAM?
---
I can craft the witches outfit. Found the plan on a dead trick or treater wearing the outfit. 
---
I love this game, but reality is not that simple and binary.
---
10 grilled radstag yesterday, full condition, cool, I’ll have some extra carry weight to carry junk and stuff back.
---
Clear whitesprings and loot everything in 10 minutes.
---
10 spoiled meat.
---
...oh well, better not let it go waste 
---
Id sell left leg for jus 1800 atoms.
---
YouTube vid on it I think that's the only 4
---
My alts are, i havent figured out my main
---
Too many people on this thread comparing duping in a video game to murder in real life – to explain to the rest of us what consequences are. Yet you can't discern what an inappropriate, innaccurate, dispropotionate comparison it is you've just made. You sound nuts. Maybe kids should stay away from videogames. I don't know. It's not rational. You have irrational beliefs and desires and some strange sense of morale ground where no morality even exists to question. 
---
I don't think there is any help I can give you but seek a mental health professional, try medicine, or go get AIDS.
---
There could be dregs in there man!
---
I got a 1* rolling pin from the queen
---
Assuming the Queens 300 DMG resist, you are saying if your sheet damage is 2040, or if you are able to hit for 2040 or greater with Sneak / Ninja, that armor penetration is effectively not needed? 
---
Preach! It’s why I stopped playing in groups, I’ll be by myself having fun exploring (no fast travel) get into a fight with scorched/mutants etc and I love when your health gets low and adrenaline kicks in “fuck fuck fuck”. Then what’s this? “bam bam” my friend fast traveled across the map and puts one shot of explosive round in each of them then gone as quick as he appeared. Just kills all joy in my opinion. Should of had the heart to tell him 
---
yeah, but you might leave it inaccessible...^^^^^^^/s  
---
You don't, you mod the barrel. All effects are based on which barrel is equipped.
---
It’s so stupid how they only spawn in vendors at 15-19. And the prison event route can take a while. So just glad that I can help out some of the people who outleveled it while I’m in the right level bracket 
---
Ok thanks for the input, it was a quick thought I had after seeing this post. May I ask how come you disagree?
---
One hunter junkies reduced weight lead pipe coming right up. 
---
Has anyone been banned yet for sorting mods?
---
Yeah but youtubers dont know everything lol so I just like to double check and update on the one by Harper's ferry, it cant be built in.
---
You probably got the  Ultracite Gatling laser Prime receiver plan. 
---
Like, how do you die to mole rats? Just.. how?
---
You... you get me.
---
Yes :( 
---
For an entire leg in good condition I can get you 5000 atoms. I know a guy in St Kitt
---
You sound like a lone wanderer like me. I totally get that. Its more the server hopping for loot and materialism that I dont get.
---
My favorite is Scorchbeast Mixed Meat Stew. Has anybody ever actually killed enough Scorchbeasts quickly enough to get one of every one of their various meat drops?
---
And if so, did you realize that your get better buffs from eating each of the meats individually than you did for making the stew?
---
Standing at the shop workbench as I saw this: arond 100  wrenches, 6 adjustable wrenches, several dozen screwdrivers, a metal bucket, 2 desk fans, and 6 boxes of 1000 screws each
---
So a lifetime supply of screws and steel scrap but nothing else
---
What for though? I really don't understand the need for so much inventory. I pick up practically everything, weapons et al. and scrap them at the thousands of places where I can scrap them, if I start hitting my stash limit, I go and make guns/armor and scrap them for a chance at getting a mod until I'm back down to my "minimum scrap" (enough for repairs basicly). I'm never gonna use 100 radaways, so I just keep my level at 50, similarly with stims and other items.
---
I don't use mines so I sell them to vendors or just simply throw them out, I feel like if you have an item that you use instead of a different one, then there's really no point in holding onto the other one. 
---
I've been wanting to make a Mr. Handy buzz saw, for ages.  But only just realised that the fuel I need is BEING BROKEN INTO SCRAP, you BASTARDS!
---
If it's a Mod or a Required item, please make it a manual scrap.  kthxbai
---
Yeah I was just saying cause he also looked everywhere and you might have found a different one
---
Mine did that on PS4, it ended up fixing itself after an update. I have about 6 different quests that do it too. I don't place as much now because of all the quest bugs.
---
if you can't kill a mole rat then you should just farm levels and come back. they're one of the easiest enemies to kill.
---
Budget is fine, stop hoarding heavy stuff
---
Post a picture of you stashed items and sort by weight....maybe we can advise
---
Falkor is a friggin dragon you monster!
---
They already do that regardless of your saying. That doesn’t change the usefulness of this system that would actually benefit players with multiple characters and play styles. Also if you’re really against it you can just have a storage that transfers 5 items at a time. Makes it to where if people were trying to abuse the weight issues it would be more of a hassle for them to put into shared storage, hop characters, take from storage, hop back, and then repeat. They would easily choose to trade someone or use a second console/pc to do this. 
---
I’m sick of blue screening because of people breaking the server with their duped items.
---
Bethesda said it is so low because of server stability. they said they will increase it.
---
When your STASH is at 590, it saves plenty. :P
---
The part of them I hate the most is how if you've fought enough of them you can always tell when the game is going to force you to fight one.  Sometimes they just spawn on your head, but most of the time the game pops them on the horizon and then just has them sort of casually start flapping in circles in your direction even if you are completely hidden/chameleon etc, whereupon they "discover" you and start going nuts.  There was a good reddit post about it a while back but basically it's just a really obvious, lame mechanism for creating needless conflict -- with the most annoying enemy in the game.
---
Ive gotten a lot of vendors, a good number of 1-2 star legendary stuff are there. I found a level 15 anti armor baseball bat with the chain mod already on it. 
---
She’s thinking about creating another character to play alongside of mine. Lower level. I think that would be cool but I also like having a personal bodyguard in case I need it. 
---
Someone just posted a thread with the numbers.  Is this a contrary point?
---
if you log in some quests reset, not sure which ones do
---
Some folks are just dicks.
---
Gotcha ok. Much like everything in the game; need to find the plans.
---
If you dont want to play that way, you dont need to. Its your full right to play the game the way you want! 
---
That's basically what a seasonal ladder would be. An occasional fresh start to the world and economy that players can opt into separate from old characters. I really don't think that they'll do a wipe. That would piss off way too many people.
---
Don’t go around punching people 
---
Why initiate PvP if you have a trading station that you don't want destroyed?
---
Like the Grafton monster. You have to be quick to get a peice of him! 
---
yes. exactly.
---
Wait, there's new stuff in the atom shop? What are they? (Cant currently check right now)
---
Ok, so which weapon is it for? I already have the ultracite fusion cores...
---
The fact we can manufacture arms, ammo and complex machinery, but can't get a thread roller in an industrial town area like the Ash Pile?  
---
FFS.
---
Camp budget, not stash budget.
---
Joke's on you, I just bought a new Xbox One X and got FO76 for **FREE**. As a result I also have a spare console now
---
I'm level 128, I'm farming Whitesprings, doing Uranium Fever, Violenbt Night, mob events and what ever else I know legenaries show up. It's not like I'm sitting in my camp and wait until the cool weapons fall in my lap. I just not get any good stuff. Some days ago I got 13(!) armor pieces in a row while doing the Golf Club. Not one weapon.
---
I was so happy when I got a two star weapon just earlier. It was a level 15 handmade. Yeay!
---
Ye 500 damage with maxed explosive damage heavy gunner and expert 
---
They already do that regardless of your saying. That doesn’t change the usefulness of this system that would actually benefit players with multiple characters and play styles. Also if you’re really against it you can just have a storage that transfers 5 items at a time. Makes it to where if people were trying to abuse the weight issues it would be more of a hassle for them to put into shared storage, hop characters, take from storage, hop back, and then repeat. They would easily choose to trade someone or use a second console/pc to do this. Plus just because you wouldn’t use it doesn’t make it an unfair advantage. You could use it if you would want. It would be your choice not to. 
---
If they are using a VPN you then ban legit players. 
---
Yeah, let's add more server instability. Good idea. 
---
Haha nice. I should try that. 
---
Heck yes!  I hate using that 2x1 staircase.
---
a bunch of high level mole rats and you're lower level than them? do you think there's only low level mole rats in the game? the legendary glowing mole rats are the worst. 
---
Hey! You can’t talk to a magical luck dog like that! 
---
Exactly, the best solution for this is( on PS4)  to go to the home screen, press start on fallout 76, and UNINSTALL. Waste of money and time. I tried to play again  last week, and after waiting 30 minutes for a patch to download, the 3rd scorched I killed glitched out with that stretchy neck bug. How many patches do they need to fix the simplest of bugs????? Such trash, this game diserves all the hate that it gets and more. They scammed consumers on all fronts. 
---
Yeah, I do agree.  The idea is to make you make choices.  This is a fundamentl difference from FO4, where we could hold everything forever.  
---
I've CHOSEN to collect all sets of PA.  So I must change my storage paradigm.  Until I decide to trash all the PA.  :D
---
or, they could do like FO4 and give us Storage cases/Mannequins.. That way you can show off cool armor and have Guns on the wall?
---
Please do, we don't need a pot apocalyptic OSHA.
---
Holidays man.  One strategy you can employ if this works you up so much, enjoy time with your family while they get to enjoy time with theirs.
---
Just to add my brief 2 cents...I'm reminded of WOW. The vanilla was capped at 40(if I recall), and everyone grinded for their purples. Next expansion, lvl 50 cap and the new greens shit on the old purples. I don't imagine Bethesda planned to keep 50 at the max (at least I hope not). Though honestly, they should have probably capped levels too as to keep relative consistency, but it is what it is. Basically, next"chapter" or whatever they call upcoming big updates, upping to a lvl 60 gear cap, while unlocking new end game and mobs would keep things balanced without insulting their current loyal player base... Or you know, something like that
---
Well for perks you could get blocker which will reduce their damage in between … but for armor the raider chest piece has a reduced stagger mod which essentially eliminates stagger altogether, not sure about power armor though I don't use it. Oh also though if you switch to a melee weapon right before getting hit and hold block it throws them back and they get staggered which leaves them open.
---
Don't poke bears kids 
---
Not yet they aren't.
---
Lol. It makes no sense why you’re complaining. If you don’t want to be bothered why punch him in the first place? 
---
lol why not its a great song.
---
pretty much all the songs on FO76 are good i love them all ;)
---
You missed the opportunity to call it "Mein C.A.M.P.f."
---
No. They need to rework perk cards to create meaningful choices. When you can swap perk cards anytime to be optimal in any situation it defeats the purpose of the system. Just like not being able to swap talents while doing mythic plus in wow. The game design principle is the same. 
---
The easiest solution would  be to introduce a traits system. Traits are Passive always on effects that are separate from the current perk system. 
---
the lag spike was very realistic :)
---
Instead of a bar just give me a timer and put the closet to spoiling on the top of the stack OR I also wouldn't mind not having food/drink spoil, that must take up some server resources to track everyone's food/drink spoil rates. So many times I've went to eat/drink from a stack to find out I have a bunch close to spoiling after consuming the full ones. Something needs to change here.
---
On top of the mountain, above the collapsed train  tunnel outside of Harpers Ferry is located a deceased hiker.  When I found him, there also happened to be an alive dog sniffing around and crying.  It was the saddest thing I’ve seen in the game.  I’m not sure if the dog is always there or we both just happened to be located there at the same time.
---
That may be the case sometimes, but I've never been able to do a Mire horde event even when trying just after they pop up on the map. I have never had it happen in any other zone.
---
Did I do a never-ending stutter?!  He's a majestic luck dragon!
---
I play solo all the time and love it. I like helping others and doing nuke zones but I feel like most of the game is better alone. As far as running out of things to do, I haven't dropped a nuke yet and only did a scorchbeast queen zone last night. But I've still played about 180hrs. That's 33 cents an hour. Once I finish a few more quests and achievements I'll move on to a different game for awhile.
---
😂
---
Yeah.  I was wearing lightweight custom leather armours.  Stopped using them when I switched to PA, just kept on regenerator so change into on missions to save healing items when doing admin work.  
---
So then I remake the leather when needed for a couple minutes work and some experience and a way to get rid of spare scrap.  
---
You *did* start it.
---
I think you dropped this "/s"
---
Original approach to sell stuff
---
Sorry bro I'm on xbox
---
this is always funny..im assuming this is a todd howard line right?
---
I knew they would.
---
Im looking for them on xbox if your willing to sell
---
This does need to happen.  
---
THIS DOES NEED TO HAPPEN.
---
No idea, I seriously doubt it.
---
On PC, pressing 'F' brings up the wheel menu. From there you can 'Change' each tab so your '1' to '=' keys are what you want, not just a random assortment of favorited weapons.
---
I don't know what Beth had to consolize this. The FO4 system of holding the 'Fav' button worked fine for numbering weapons.
---
Only the Hardened Mass is junk though
---
What luck is your character at cuz I found a tse 50 cal with 14 luck after 5h of farming over a few days
---
That would be nice in addition to making a bank character easier. But I don't have enough camp budget to store every little gun. 
---
On a side note, I want more damn camp budget. I can barely make my camp visually appealing and functional, much less defensible. 
---
Thanks really! Going east of that around this,just doesn't cut it.
---
why do you have to understand ? you dont matter to his game-play nor does you being bitter about dupers mean everyone has to pay 
---
This one bugged out on me for a few days as well, just had to keep trying until I got it.
---
What you guys don't seem to understand is that there's a difference between a PvP fight (which is mutual) and destroying bases. I PvP all the time but have never destroyed a base, because I don't want to have a bounty on me
---
It's really not hard to understand...What I did was a request to pvp, I didn't even do damage to him and I left when he said he's in pacifist mode
---
I was more making a statement. Data loss due to hardware failure is not uncommon. It’s no different from playing Fallout 4 and having a corrupted save and losing that character. 
---
A more robust environment does help protect against that, but it doesn’t eliminate it either. Unless Bethesda has a raid array set up, which they probably do, they could lose all out player data too. 
---
Those are bugged too. 
---
Change a pipe pistol into a rifle, it will benefit from both pistol and rifle perks. 
---
Change the scope on a pipe rifle and the sights will sometimes be wildly inaccurate until a relog. 
---
Unpopular opinion it seems, but for the record, Bethesda, I completely disagree. Scorchbeasts shouldn't be carrying equipment at all unless I get to cut them open and rip if off the dead sap they swallowed myself.
---
This is how she killed her first scorchbeast.  Terrified until level 49. Then bam. Decided to go into the hardest area of the map. Took her like a half hour and did it. Proceeded to take tons of pics and has talked about it for about 24 hours now. 
---
This is an absolutely reasonable request considering the fact that the assets are in the game.  
---
You loose five points because there is no absurd in your comment, but you gain twenty for the quality of your suggestion.
---
Those aren't ladders, they are effectively doors to instances areas
---
What?
---
That made me laugh harder than I expected.  :)
---
How much you want for keycard?
---
Staggeringly good idea.  They tell us the time to expiry for STATUS items, why not food?
---
Cool man. I’ll be on around 4 central and I’ll get you added. I have a job interview and the gym tonight but I’ll be on later too
---
As good.
---
That I agree with, I only whip out my TSE if no one is around and use my Tesla at White Springs but as much as I love this game it’s drawing to a close for me so I’m using the TSE to keep me interested. Shouldn’t matter to others how I play if it doesn’t affect them.
---
If you pay attention to the quest and the loading screen tip, the alpha of the horde keeps spawning more enemies if you don't kill it. This is why the event quest is to kill the alpha.
---
Certainly an attention getter.
---
What would Fallouts Argonian Maid be?
---
Playing the game is the best way to gain experience Launch a nuke or go to a nuke zone you go up a couple levels
---
Pepperoni rolls were never invented in the FO timeline which is further proof of the terrible shape the world was in before becoming a pepperoni roll-free hellish wasteland
---
Sleeping gives up boost tho
---
So are you saying mutual pvp is not a part of fallout 76, and that there's no different between asking if someone wants to battle versus destroying the base of a passive player?
---
It’s a horse because the legendary is the lynch pin (it’s explained in loading screens sometimes).  Kill the lynch pin / alpha and the horde will fracture and fracture.
---
It doesn’t really make sense for most of the enemies (why would radrats follow an alpha radrat? Because it gave a convincing speech to rally them?) but that is the explanation given.
---
It’d make sense if they were bandits for example as a strong leader has held tag disparate groups of people together many times which fall away after their death.
---
Also would sort of make sense for enemies like mirelurk queens and regular mirelurks, scorchbeasts and scorched, etc.  (or scorchbeasts and any group of scorched enemies in general).
---
Sorry, all out of spam.
---
What’s a pepperoni roll? Is it some kind of fancy schmancy sausage roll?
---
I was stopped on my way to whitesprings by a ‘prize bot’ who told me I won a raffle, gave me some junk and then said I owed $76,000 is back payments.. gotta love the random.
---
Actually the amount of .50 cal ammo you craft is 180/280 rounds for 10 lead/40 steel.... it's 100 base, +80 from lvl 2 Ammosmith, and 30% chance for +100 from Super Duper. Super Duper \*DOES NOT\* duplicate the bonus ammo crafted from Ammosmith.
---
That being said, the .50 cal machine gun is definitely one of the best heavy weapons if not the best--find yourself a Bloodied Explosive Two Shot one and teabag the scorchbeast queen as she melts. Furious isn't too bad either, but remember that the bonus damage resets back to zero if you shoot anything other than the target you're currently stacking on--even missed shots that fly past the enemy and hit nothing (or the ground/trees/whatever) will reset the bonus damage.
---
The only Furious weapon I've kept and used was a Ripper that also had Executioner on it; that thing stacked incredibly fast and it's pretty hard to miss or hit a different target with a melee weapon. It was great as a last resort, but it was still pretty terrible when compared to other stuff. The bonus damage from Furious does have a cap, and "very fast" weapons reach that cap.... well, very fast and then plateau. Even a .50 cal machine gun with Furious would likely hit that cap pretty fast. You get more bang for your buck with the Bloodied modifier and just maintaining relatively low health (high rads helps). Or going with Explosive and/or Two Shot. Or both. I have an Explosive Two Shot Western Revolver that is my vertibot-one-shotter. Wow I started rambling there, too much weed. Or not enough. Going back in-game.
---
farming is trash-tier game playing
---
&gt; It's exactly the same as the set I use normally...  
---
&gt; It was a set another player left out in the world somewhere...  
---
*confused emote*  
---
I mean, I guess it's not the *least*-likely thing to ever happen that you and *random player* have exactly the same power armor but these statements seem to be a bit contradictory. That said, as /u/atfricks said, there's a huge difference between someone with 2 sets of identical power armor and someone with 30,000 TSE shotguns. 1 is perfectly reasonable (a "good dup" in your parlance) and one is patently ridiculous ("bad dup").  
---
Would some "bad dups" get missed in such a scenario as is proposed here? Almost certainly. Would some "good dups" get unfairly included in such a scenario? Probably. But just wringing your hands and going, "Fuck it! We can't fix this! Everybody gets to keep everything!" would be a death knell for this game.
---
I note that no Bethesda representatives EVER comment on threads about duper’s, cheaters or hackers 
---
This is a terrible idea and make it even easier for cheats to store and transfer duplicated items
---
It would be I'd live to have one. But is also like legendary hunting rifles to be possible
---
A cool-down timer based on the number of cards swapped that would limit complete overhauls and maybe not allowing switchups in combat (or incur a larger switch over time). You could also make it cost AP or tied to an INT QOL perk.
---
Alright I’ll rephrase, don’t punch people and complain when they come back for revenge. 
---
Sarcasm aside, you are exactly right. What's wrong with a space that the game may see as inaccessible when it may be perfectly accessible elsewhere?
---
Most people farm XP by doing Whitespring Resort ferals or server hopping events. For me, I'm in no rush to level and want to level up naturally by just questing and exploring.
---
I second that with all my heart. Would be cool if you could combine items. Example:  
---
To get Two-Shot Explosive -90% Weight Combat Shotgun, you would need to craft the shotty, then take it, together with 3 times Two shot, 3 times explosive and 3 times -90% weight weapons to somewhere cool, trigger a crafting event, and complete a related challenge. From one side, a lot of work to do, from the other, you can get yourself just the exact thing you need without being singled out by RNGesus
---
well fortunately I haven't spent any actual money on atoms, just the in game rewarded ones. the fish lamp however works, little guy goes to sleep when you turn it off. 
---
There are Stalker mods where that happens.
---
I know right? and the missile turrets are the worst.
---
How did this post make it to the front page again? This is like the third time!
---
You can take them all, but only one is marked as your individual quest item
---
Stealth makes them a million times more manageable, even while they are in the air.  
---
Shoot, then move perpendicular to their path.  They will dive bomb and spam the radioactive doughnut attack thingy at your last location.
---
What's the revenge based on? Getting tickled and then left alone. You're an idiot
---
I don't. Just play the game and XP comes. Go out, do whatever you want, go where ever you want, and kill what you can.
---
And you will get XP and level up. 
---
But man seriously imagine these things fighting for territory, 10/10 would participate too
---
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, why should this cost money and why would you be OK paying for it?
---
Whitesprings runs, when its not crowded.  If I know I will be on for a few hours I will take as many workshops as possible and just bounce around defending.
---
I need to kill The wendigo in a clown costume 
---
I used this method to catch up on equipment.  I had spent a great deal of time with Workshops, getting a lot of experience there, but not much equipment of use.
---
I had nothing legendary at lvl 50.  White Springs solved that with this method.  Good mention that it's great for XP, too.
---
Sultry Super Mutant? 
---
Luck effects legendary drops?
---
A assaultron maid 
---
Or only Dog Food. Yummy.
---
Yeah, you asked me not to...but i have to ask about your username.
---
it felt almost 100% drop rate in the stress test
---
Why
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Don’t know you do so maybe you are partial to a cape? Good luck with the job interview! 
---
I hardly even look at my xp or levels.  Sometimes I'll go to swap out perks before I realize I've gone up a level.
---
I do drop in to WhiteSprings when a Nuke's there.  I also paradrop into interesting Events other people are participating in.  Forgot this, thanks for the reminder.
---
you sir deserve a bacon pancake
---
600lb stash space is not ok...
---
Can confirm, there are 20+ of this key in my inventory due to this quest (and you can't drop them after). The quest only updates after you get the exact key assigned to you and you can accidentally press R to 'take all'.
---
I made a post about this the other day and the overwhelming response was that these mods are safe. It's the reshade and cheat engine stuff that folks got banned for.
---
I'd be careful with lockpicking mods, too. As long as it's client side and it doesn't give you an unfair advantage you should be good. 
---
They literally just got done with holiday breaks, and they are the ones who chose to release it right before the holidays. I think they've had a decent enough break to do some freaking work. Every other person with a job has had to work
---
no you haven't
---
How? destroying passive bases and mutual pvp are two different concepts in the game, which apparently you fail to understand
---
I play on pc with a controller, and I'm close to 50.
---
I have shit hand eye coordination, and this test was really easy?
---
Perhaps you are making it harder than it needs to be?  Maybe doing a part incorrectly that is stretching your time. Perhaps find a video on youtube or walk the course first?
---
Your friends body language indicates he is upset by something, I think you should ask him what is bothering him.
---
Honestly don't know. I asked this in a different sub a few days ago. 
---
And why would we find the Overseer ... she is what drives the future ... (hopefully)
---
Doesn't he share caps with other Whitesprings bots?
---
There's ballistic damage and rad damage on the gun. I would normally see the ballistic damage take effect first, them the rad damage would heal them half a second after. So if you're increasing damage, you could potentially kill a ghoul at the end of his life
---
Has anyone tried either artillery or an orbital strike on a base like this? Will it do enough damage?
---
Have you found you get good weaponry and plans this way?
---
You’ve not found the overseers body yet? 
---
I was wandering the wasteland, found the power armor. Been using the power armor for probably two weeks. Noticed a few days ago that I had two sets when I definitely only had one before. To my knowledge, I didn't do anything intentional to cause it. My guess is that it happened when I got disconnected at one point or another. 
---
But yeah, I'm all for fixing intentional duping, but getting banhammer happy like OP suggests would be even worse for the rep this game gets. 
---
Very clever, a neckbeard on his high horse
---
Atoms are free. You can get them doing challenges. Allow challenges to provide a means to improvements to the game.

Harper's Ferry, West Tek, Silos, Horde Events, Uranium Fever, and Sons of Dane event. I usually get a level from Harper's Ferry, West Tek, and Uranium Fever after being Well Rested and eating Cranberry Cobbler.

Farm white springs so many enemies there you can lvl up fastest there with a team in a nuke zone sharing the inspirational perk I believe its called with sleeping gets you a well rested aditional xp for 1 hr I think. 
---
Thats awesome! I love this game because even now Im learning/finding new stuff!
---
I don’t think I am, really doubting that I’m an idiot. 
---
I got overly obsessed with defending them.  I realised that retaking them at your convenience might be easier on the scheduling!  Seems like the rewards are similar whether you defend or retake.
---
Quickest way I think to complete it is go to the first look out tower, near the original vault, on the port-o-potty get the key, go up to the top of the tower and open the chest, if it's already opened, unlocked or otherwise not updating your quest, put an item in it and close the UI then reopen and take the item back out, try with different items until you get a quest update … I think it's intended you loot a rocket launcher from one of the strongholds it's supposed to send you to, but fails.

Yeah, it happens with her quests sometimes. Logging out and back in seemed to fix it for me. 
---
I've not had any multiplayer issues on FO76 so far.  I have had a shit load of multiplayer issues on GTA. 
---
I love the game as a whole but C.A.M.P building is the most disappointing aspect of the game for me as they are not only difficult and expensive to make but also very limited in size and ability to personalise. I was also hoping for them to be... more important I guess? It's hard to justify the cost of a big fancy base when it's actually more convenient to move a basic 2x2 that you can easily blueprint anywhere with you.
---
I was an avid 'builder' in rust. I think for all of the games flaws base building was fantastic and bethesda really should of looked to that as a benchmark for how everything should work and snap together. If there were 3 things I miss most its ladder hatches, code locks and the hammer to upgrade.
---
You’re right. The best way to play the game is by your specific non-arbitrary “punch bitches not bases” rules. /s

I get bones, livers, and lungs.  yay.

Do you focus on the tasks, or the equipment as a measure of progress instead of level?

So what is the difference between listening to tapes and having an NPC say the same thing?

According to the internet, the pepperoni roll is some kind of "Italian gusher"

What about grape and gorgonzola pizza?
---
I do the same thing. I have nuked a few times. I have found a good melee but was given a couple good legendaries. I sell junk I'm not using to get better guns.
---
I see your point, people should not feel the need to server hop and should be better rewarded through gameplay. And it sounds like you have an actual life outside gaming which is much healthier than watching a loading screen lol.
---
I thought everyone would have found it by the time they get to the Silos. I’ll not spoil the surprise.

"Billy Mays here! And I've got something to show you! I have 3,182 TSE Shotguns with EXACTLY the same stats!"

Doesn't their "cloud" server setup make real time somewhat impossible?  I have no idea how it's setup but assuming we play on dynamically created local worlds that still need to connect to another location to keep persistent character info.   
---
The latency between the local world and persistent database would be a problem? Or is that not how it works?
---
The Lusty (and Deadly) Deathclaw.....oh lawwd
---
I see your need as reasonable and valid and a possible solution would be to let players view the contents of the stack with some expand key
---
Have the wife farm nuke zones while I browse Reddit to look at all the weird and disgusting user names.
---
If you weren't an idiot you'd understand how it works. As of right now you're on a high horse, without realizing that you 100% play by those same rules when you're playing the game
---
I've got your pepperoni roll right here https://imgur.com/gallery/TlOR1h8

No that’s me and my camp next door.

Oh, the Cobbler sounds good.  What's the benefit from that?
---
I haven't found all those, yet, but Harper's is on my list so I can visit the vendor for plans.
---
...and what’s one of those? This clears up nothing, just adds to my confusion. XD
---
People forget to drop the mats lol. Makes this so much easier.
---
Great tips on the addons, thanks.
---
Surprised he hasn't been killed yet. 
---
*because the game is paused*
---
Agreed! Also, remember that turrets consume a lot of the budget. Consider removing turrets to free up space. 
---
haha, that's adorable.
---
Its still not pay to win any more than any game that has ever been an mmo.
---
Every single mmo has people selling geared out characters, gear runs, gold, ect. The dupping is a huge problem, but don't lie about the game. People will always find ways to profit off of exploits. There isn't even pvp really yet and this game will never have a competitive scene because its not designed to. 
---
Are you upset people can use money and break the terms of use agreement  to get ahead of you slightly? 
---
Don't build defenses. Build a cat walk. Foundation, stairs 2 floors up, then mesh flooring to all the spawn points. The main problem is finding them. A cat walk getting you from spawn point to spawn point makes it easier
---
I had this happen the other day:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad6bv0/i_am_become_death_no_seriously_stuff_is_dropping/
---
The difference is that I had been on the server playing for at least 2 hours - likely longer - and no nuke had been set off in that time.
---
It's definitely a bug.   I had nuked flora spawning, bloaties running amok, and legendary monsters spawning.  It was so weird.  It lasted at least an hour before I got bored and did other stuff.
---
If you ever do, please come post/brag about it.
---
Sounds good. She’ll be on most of the night but I’ll be home around 7 eastern so that works out.  Good luck on your interview. Thanks again. She’s gonna flip. 
---
I just want stairs that attach to the SIDE of the floor so I can complete it with a half floor. Also, make floors from the atom shop work on half-floors
---
They are the worst.  I'll usually fight the one if it appears but you will get 3 that show up at once and it's just vibrations and green screen the whole time. Cant forget that server lag to they create from attacking you.

Of course. Yesterday, I was in need of fusion cores. So I went around to places where I know suits of PA can be found. In one such spot, I got two fusion cores. Then in a toolcase, I found the plans for the Barn set, the last building style set I need. I haven't seen it on a vendor. Then in another container, I found the plans for Nuka Quantum Grenade. 
---
I've good weapons. Good armor. All from just playing the game.
---
if you're only looking at it from getting to the end, I'm sorry to tell you, the game isn't designed to have an end. it's meant to be played for fun. 
---
How u guys take
---
Animals 
---
I haven't played in 2 years but a few of my guildies still play every day. Losing my main character name a 2nd time after another server merge was the final straw for me. 
---
Ive often wondered this, and I put it down to the fact that they’re HEAVY weapons. I.e you can’t aim down the sights of a heavy weapon. I find them much easier to hip fire, and I think that’s by design. 
---
I think I have 2 characters that can still get it (both around lvl 25). PM me for a gamer tag, though I won't be on for another 6 hours. I will only charge the cost of the plan + Travel cost (so around 700 caps).
---
Commenting what I put in every thread like this:
---
Behind the scenes, Bethesda adds unique ID's to items (like Dark Souls 3). Don't tell the community. Dupers continue to dupe with unique ID'd weapons. Dupers get instantly banned for having duped items with the same ID's.
---
Elaborated more:
---
Currently, nothing has unique ID's that get checked with the server side.
---
If they go about this method, without telling the community, they make a new column in the database table and have it auto generate random ID's. Part of the ID would have the ORIGINAL creator's ID (Similar to how Warframe has it), and the rest would be a random identifier for the weapon that cannot be reused.
---
This would mean all previously existing duplicated weapons would all have unique ID's now, and anyone still duplicating would get caught as you can't be reusing the same unique ID.
---
To prevent dropped items banning a different player, the game can remove the item from the player's inventory without banning them because it sees who the original person was that had the weapon in the first place. Bonus points if they save a trade ID that saves how many caps were traded so they could reverse it (Warframe again).
---
One weapons is the Gatling Laser, the Ultracite Gatling Laser is the second. The prime receiver goes into the second ... not the first.
---
There isn't a body tho, there's a holotape but people think it's only to offer her comments on the local population. If she died she wouldn't be able to leave a holotape you find only after you fire a nuke
---
Please read thru this guy's response in his own thread it is hilarious XD you're not an idiot btw, big fan XD
---
nah, lets just go one step further to catch them at the source and ban everyone that has picked up more than 1500 wood scraps
---
Skyrim looks so good in 2019.
---
The Queen is way too easy for her to drop 3* 100% of the time or anything higher.  The only thing hard about the fight is getting the leechers out of the fucking bunker to help.
---
But my plan is full proof you can’t stop me now.
---
[Gushers!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_Gushers)
---
Honestly though, what did you think was going to happen? 
---
&gt;Why do I have to prioritize what I can keep? How is that fun?
---
on the opposite end, how is it fun if you can just loot everything with no repercussions? what is the point behind caps, or any worth, if we can just amass everything? in more hyperbole, would it be fun if you were given the best items? ("how is it fun grinding for the best items?").
---
in the same vein, why must i look at my character slug on so slowly? why can't we have a x2 movement speed bonus? how is it fun running around slowly?
---
strife is a necessary part of any game. all games are based on it, some implement it better some implement it worse. inventory management is a huge part of the survival genre and it's expected of it to exist in some degree here as well. some people like that kind of things.
---
but without talking of extremes, there absolutely needs to be a limit to how much stuff you can store, out of a game-play perspective. is 600 a bit low? yeah i think it could be increased. but i hope it never comes up to 2000 or something like that. so much space isn't really needed and eliminates the purpose of items entirely. by allowing excessive hoarding all items become worthless and devalued.
---
Not having everything on you. Just take what you need: weapons, ammo and some aid, you d'ont need the junk and the workshop don't need to depend on what you carry on you. 1400 (800 what i talk before + 600 on stash) weight limit is more then enough for most things if you ask me.
---
Yup, this is really confusing.
---
There are 2 actual Gatling Laser guns:
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser
---
and
---
Gatling Laser
---
And each of these has their own mods.
---
The Prime plan for the Gatling Laser goes with the Gatling Laser (not Ultracite).
---
There is a separate Prime plan for the Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
hah, ps4, sadly.
---
fighting the SBQ with like 12+ other people is a slideshow
---
I'm not looking for the end.  I just found I seemed undergunned for a level 50.   When I finally started on the main story, the rewards seemed weak, as though Id over leveled myself.  I was seeing opposition for lvl 50 without being armed and armoured like a 50.
---
I mostly like just walking, not triggering questlines, just fighting local enemies.  WhiteSpring gave me the arms I needed.  And farming PA the defense.  I run lvl 45 Excavator Armour and am walking Appalachia looking for mods for the others.
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
If you have two monitors you can reach the task manager on the other screen. If you don't, you're probably sol. 
---
Shhhhhh, it’s more fun to just say “you haven’t found it yet?” And make people wonder. XD
---
Bless your heart
---
Did you look at the sidebar?
---
But I’ve picked up more then 1500 wood (insertion pikachu meme)
---
Thanks for sharing that, that’s good to know. 
---
As a level 43 I didn’t even know you could get sick from sleeping
---
I just ignore them, even if they're blasting me. Sure as hell ain't gunna waste lead on something like *that*
---
If I may speak for my self, I'm not in PvP and the only reason I bought my TSE weapons is because Bethesda made high level enemies bullet spongie as hell. There's no fun at all, shooting a fucking single Level 68 Supermutant like 5 minutes with regular weapons that are level capped at 50.
---
Melee besides is balanced well imo.
---
I got 15 strength and several Melee skills and not one hitting anything unless under certain condition, but also don't need to hit things more than 2 - 4 times depending on weapon.
---
 Ranged weapons are way too underpowered, unless they're TSE, that's why people so after them 
---
Regardless? Yes.
---
Everything else?  Nah.
---
Stealth sniper kills them fast and they usually land after one shot looking for me which makes if even easier to headshot them.
---
I died due to server disc and couldn't get my bag it sucked 
---
Y'all really should visit WV. 
---
Just saying.
---
We don’t have those in the U.K.  And why would you want a pepperoni that explodes in your mouth? XD
---
I go and kill people in silos sometimes rping to stop the nukes.
---
We have received no word of a patch yet - can you provide a bit more context.
---
I lost X-01 Tesla coil and T-60 Shocks just today - and I am 100% that i didn't get a warning - this likely happened when repairing the anti-air equipment.
---
Lucky, I WISH I could get a wife.  Instead I have this fallout 76 game.
---
I understand your plight, but struggle to think of any other medium where I've payed $60 for hundreds of hours of entertainment.  Don't tell the video game industry, but I'd be the sucker paying $150 for new games, based on time value alone.
---
A movie ticket is almost $20 where I live for something that gives you 90 minutes.  
---
Same exact thing happened to me and a friend of mine. We bought maps off of the Fallout 76 discord and we went to the spot to pick up the items so we'd have the plans to craft stuff. He tried to trade me the plans he already used and we both crashed the server.
---
Now when I log in same issue. No pip boy. No fast travel because I'm over encombured though it says my weight is 0/240. When I punch something I get my lever action equipped. I can use my box and everything just fine. 
---
I also found out that if you due on that account the server crashes. If you get close enough to another player to where it says, "Invite to team/Trade" the server crashes. 
---
I also put in tickets to Bethesda and they haven't found a solution. I even asked if they would just revert my character to earlier save data and they said thats not possible and neither is clearing my inventory. I shouldn't have used my main account for that. Lost my level 216 that way. Over 200+ hours on the account. Hope the next patch fixes.
---
You know, I’ve come across something similar: https://m.imgur.com/jKT5XkH
---
Look up MICRO UZI STOCK (in all caps) he sells them for 100 caps a piece I got marsupial and speed demon from him. His base is at the bottom left of the map between Camden park and nuka cola factory
---
It's not a matter of disagreement, it's literally a game mechanic. Destroying the base of a non-wanted level player gets you wanted and has negative effects. Regular pvp is mutual and does not result in a wanted level. What about that goes over your head?
---
Yeah, at least a rifle 
---
Thank you both - so that means that I will have to find the plan for the ultracite gatling laser and then I should be able to craft the prime mod for it.
---
Well, all the things you aren't doing are good places to find the plans and gear you are looking for. 
---
You're way too late on that idea...
---
I want a Valet Parkingtron.
---
They are tho, why does an mg42 that shoots .308 ammo do less damage than a 10mm PISTOL? It's a bit ridiculous
---
*Protect and Suave*
---
when did Beth confirm they don't ban for this?  Got a link?
---
I demand that rectified.
---
I might tweet good ol Joe again.
---
Must be op as hell
---
Not so rare. You can find it on sale in Watoga or Whitesprings bunker.
---
It improves range and acuracy.
---
Ign stonekraken, always happy to play alongside other vault dwellers
---
I've had to do that too. There is no shame in it, the long dog is a formidable foe at any level.
---
Ice machines should preseve food for longer without spoiling. The 5 canned meat stew from feed the people go had within an hour. There's no point in eating 5 at once... Or make the xp effect stack.
---
@ Bethesda where’s my were-Deathclaw mutation
---
I’m on PS4 and level 36, wanna do it together? 
---
Have you gotten the broom closet ending?
---
Ive found that if you go to the quest menu and highlight Roses quest and search for the marker (C on PC) it’ll show you on the map... but that the quest marker otherwise doesn’t show up in your heads up display or whatnot 
---
Deliciousness
---
Thank you for the great help!  For those still looking, here are my screenshots to help you find the three markers I found.

In order: Spruce Knob, Bog overlook, and Top of the World
---
a lot of the people who talk shit or deliberately rate the game low have either not played it or logged on for about 15 minutes with their minds already decided. 76 is bugged like mad, there's quest breaking ones which REALLY suck (i personally have encountered but friends have) but a simple relog fixes the issue 90% of the time. suits rushed the game for christmas and it cost them quality, but the game is super fun. the pvp mechanics are fun but doesn't leave you with nothing after a death like other pvp games, the scenery is god damn gorgeous and the sound design is honestly really good. a lot of love went into this game and if you dont like it for valid reasons then absolutely fair enough. if you're just hoping on the hate train, do something more productive, even if that's actually specifying why you think it's bad
---
I use Makeshift Warrior for my melee character and I've never needed to repair. I only repair when I see things start to get around 50%, which is about once a week or two
---
That's weird as the fix to show the marker on map is to relog once then it will show.
---
If you are bored of Whitesprings, and you have the deeps, just running through the bog can yield a ton of xp. You got like 10 scorchbeasts, a couple hermit crabs, a couple deathclaws, a bunch of gulpers, 3 mirelurk queens and a bunch of kings, plus all the normal scorched/ghoul/mutant packs you come across. You just need to know where they are. 
---
I marvel at how some of the people can do so much with the budget.. I mean, mines taken up by mine and somehow I keep finding stuff I never stored being stored... usually produce..
---
It often takes multiple attempts to connect to a server on pc, so server hopping is just an exercise in futility.
---
I agree, they're pretty awful. I think they need to be given an AP meter like us (a bit lager than ours sure) which forces them to land after so long in the air. it's ridiculous they can just stay up there forever and nonstop sonar us. 
---
oof. thats rough. must be a duper then.
---
Royal Jelly can be found as loot from Giant Honey Bees. I've gotten a few drops myself.
---
They dont have to delete every duped item. They can look at all the characters and determine who has duped items by file size. A huge file would be flagged and then looked at. If it had thousands of leather/grenades/fusion cores, delete the characters associated with that one.
---
Fix the ability to duplicate then delete all characters that have large amounts of items and the other characters linked to that one as well.
---
Cover ALWAYS works for me but I usually use buildings.
---
Even a tree works at reducing the effects and damage if you line it up right.
---
Also, get a dense mod for your armour chest piece, suddenly they can’t do shit with that attack...their acid attack is still killer though
---
I’m on pc but thank for the offer good luck in there
---
I am 29 and have been wondering this question for too long. Thanks for asking it
---
I’d craft my own nuke silos and turn my camp into Site Delta.
---
Uncle handy
---
Because then they would have to dramatically increase the timer for launching nukes and its already a gamble of will you maintain connection to the server, we dont need to increase that risk
---
On the Oceanic servers (key word oceanic) it throws players from NZ, Aus, Japan, China, etc to these servers. 
---
I have friends from these countries and we all see names and hear accents from these countries all the time, never any yanks, or anyone from europe.
---
Now I know why. Anyone from Oceania who has joined a friends server from the U.S. or Europe will be able to tell you.
---
Pc? Sell me one
---
Your client still handles the requests you send up to the servers, cloud or no. The filtering of repeated requests to make something can be blocked there. 
---
lol I saw you on another scorchbeast complaint are you actually counting?
---
Int does affect crafted items. 
---
Also, if you use the repair/crafting perks and get 200% durability you get bonus DR/ER based on INT.
---
thats what i remembered as well
---
Same. My guess is they have like no interior lighting since those seem to take up another good chunk of budget. 
---
Thank's for the help.  I found an actual "mining helmet", and it worked.  
---
PS: killing Level 40 Glowing Mole Miners with a Level 5 pickaxe sucketh.
---
Melee/Rifle
---
I'm honestly genuinely confused by all the comments here. You already own the game, you beat red dead, I suggest you go to fallout again give it another shot. I thoroughly enjoy the game. There are a lot of frustrating bugs and what not but it feels like you have nothing to lose. 
---
Rad resistens is the only point where normal armor lacks :/
---
Can be an advantage when fighting against ghouls but sadly not working well for exploring nuke zones.
---
I hope they balance some stuff, there are many people who dont like playing in PA :&lt;
---
Find the overseer is the first quest. It feels weird you can't complete it. 
---
I always need screws, and steel.
---
They are the two items I always run low on.
---
Its a great mod, I use all 8 slots in it, saves so much time and its not a cheat.
---
Interested in this also.  I managed to get a good ranged weapon but without the perks it's just plain annoying to fight scorchbeasts that don't want to land.
---
Actually, what about "seasons"...like Diablo 3 now does it.    Each season last 3-4 months, after that you can still play those toons but in a non-season server.  This lets the dupers have all their dupes but a clean season every 3-4 months keeps them out of the market unless you wanna play a nonseasonal toon.   Once a new season starts, the non-seasonal servers don't give atoms or have the abily to get "seasonal" items or quest.  
---
I agree TSE’s are overpowered but...
---
Healing factor has the huge drawback of crippling stimpacks in combat, making combat healing quite difficult. 
---
And groups of high level groups, scorchbeasts, royal mirelurks and assaultrons all still do damage through power armor.
---
I haven’t, I got the train station toilet ending though. Having to hide in a train station toilet as scorchbeasts rain their green hell on you. Despite the fact you’re level 17. That character died that day
---
Ladders, like the ladder that makes you go physically up are possible, but it's kinda understandable to see what issues would happen.
---
Both Fallout and Elder Scrolls have ranged weapons, yeah? What happens if a player climbs a ladder and just cheeses a fight? Well, obviously, just make the NPC climb it. Raiders, Bandits, Skeletons, they can climb easy enough. Dogs, Deathclaws (okay, maybe they can get up another way), Wolves, Trolls, Molerats, Chaurus, all completely helpless since they can't physically reach you without the sort of silly Source engine "slide up ladders."
---
Yes, thanks, but also when?
---
Jeez is the dupe glitch really that bad? 
---
You must have a shitty sense of humor then. The points I make are valid game mechanics...destroy base=wanted, mutual pvp=no wanted
---
Are they though? Most duper’s I see are trading for other items. Not as many are duping nuka cola (only source of caps as you can’t dupe a cap stash). Doesn’t really seem like currency is duped en masse. 
---
Usually Bethesda has it as bones are prewar and corpses are all postwar
---
Yes, this. Plus let us lock gear to prevent selling/scrapping. Also show us what we have equipped in vendor trade screen so we dont sell something when in power armor. Thanks.
---
"You haven't been listening to Allied propaganda again have you?"
---
Look at me! I’m edgy and cool 
---
Wanted was presented as being "bad" so it seems odd to give wanted status for intended PvP.
---
Figured.   Silly me!
---
On my main PC I haven't had any performance problems, but I had my share of strange glitches.  
---
Surprisingly, sometimes I play it on my mobile PC, and while its a slideshow by default, I don't observe those glitches that I do on my main PC.
---
My husband and I play together too.  
---
He gets annoyed that I have to search every container and every inch of a new place we come across.  Can't miss anything good!
---
I haven't even toyed with that... my main concern is finding a good spot that isn't already taken.. and is easily defendable..
---
I was just thinking that when I was reading the rest of this ... a pickaxe!
---
It still benefits from rifleman
---
The better is just remove two shot-explosive combination. So it's just ts or it's just explosive. But more better is just reduce the damage, but not too much
---
So you are aware of how buggy Bethesda games are at launch. You buy it and yet you complain about the bugs in the game? Bit ironic no?
---
I got it for 160 or so caps at Harper's ferry I was level 35 now 42 but I got it because it was also level 50 and goes with my build. Still have yet to use it. Also found a level 45 instigating assaultron blade at the golf course. 
---
It's intended. There is even a terminal IN THE MAIN QUEST describing you this in the senator's bunker.
---
I have a sneak character and the schorchbeasts never manage to find me as long as I keep crouched when they're above me though, so YMMV
---
I didn’t have to pay the lottery tax, so I guess I’m good! Better this way than to have Mr. Repobots repossessing my CAMP. 
---
I paid for the game, I paid for some atoms to purchase items, Im not paying to change my card, BS.
---
I made this post and then like thirty minutes later, another person commented on how the scorchbeast was not fun. So I copied/pasted/updated the number. I was just going for the laugh and wasn't going to start actually counting. If it amused you, it's a win.
---
Maybe..But still sucks for the people that found stuff legit, and having to farm again for jetpack and calibrated shocks would be horrible;) But they could also improve vendor items, which they probably should to stop server hopping..
---
This is the kind of enemy that should be legendary and drop legendary gear. 
---
I don't see whats so legendary about a random lvl. 42 ghoulie boy that spawns by the hundreds. 
---
Not so much complaining that we see these legendary ghouls, just wish these rarer enemies were more often than not legendary. 
---
I'm level 130 and have seen 1 behemoth. they are my favorite enemies by far ever since I fought my first one in Fallout 3. 
---
I'll trade you an ultracite left arm plan for some 5mm 
---
You start off with VATS.
---
Yup thats what tipped me off as well. 
---
? I've killed him every time I've encountered him, usually takes 1 bullet.
---
It's a camp, not settlement. You can build a decent sized house as is. A smaller one with defences. 
---
I really don't have an issue with current budget size.
---
Found a video on a workaround for it. Uses 1 Terminal and 1 Switch.

---
Shotgun + enforcer (AGI perk) will allow you 30% chance to cripple wings/thrusters forcing the things to land or slow down
---
It was quite funny but I’m glad you haven’t spent days going through reddit looking for SB posts lol
---
I just ran out of wood repairing my super sledge (I think it was) had to go out into the forest like a noob and look for wood piles lol
---
Honestly, other than Skyrim, this is the only Bethesda game ive bought.
---
Maybe heavy weapons? Uses strength the same as melee, so it wouldn't require too much special shuffling. Otherwise, if you're going to have a high perception, rifleman is a good choice. 
---
I was in the porta-potty in my Camp the other day when a SB attacked. 
---
Luckily I didn't die ... that would have been sh---y!
---
It has to be, how else would they be selling caps online? And it's not even a few people, they are taking out fucking Google AdWords ads to sell them and listing them on eBay. Seeing as the most amount of caps you can acquire without duping is 600 caps (I might be wrong), to sell that many they have to have a pretty serious duping operation going on.
---
I have a Vampire Gatling Plasma.  
---
I love it. When it's not broken. Which is never.
---
I forget where i read it but i believe furious caps out at +15% damage
---
3 options
---
* shotgun + enforcer (great for scorchedbeasts alright for cargobot)
---
* handmade + tormentor (great for both, but it's very heavy)
---
* 50% limb damage pistol/rifle (if you're lucky enough to get a legendary like this great, now you don't really have to bother with perks for it)
---
Stalker mods are where games go crazy. Having bullets and mags as separate items and having to load them one at a time while making sure you didn't lose your valuable clips to a burer.
---
Misery mod I think it was, they all blur at this point. 
---
Atoms are free
---
on the day atoms will give you benefits its the day i will stop playing.
---
Fix it and give the option to restart from scratch, and only play with those who did the same 
---
I got the junk, health and food reduction perks and I never run out of room
---
I typically find better loot by server hopping the watoga station vendor for weapons and armor that people have sold. I burn through much less ammo that way.
---
Nuked Whitespring with Tesla rifle and golf club house camping = all the exp. 
---
reasonable ultimate hoarder endgame goals
---
Starting petition to change "radiers" to "anti-Preston-Garveryers"
---
also add what system you're on
---
There are armour mods that reduce the effect of incoming staggers.
---
Every enemy in the wasteland is quite capable of killing you
---
Hmmmm, TIL. 
---
For it to acquire the target. 
---
Yeah. It is kind of bad to take all that effort and cap someone spent on it so I can see that side too. I don’t even bother anymore because I don’t have interest in PvP at all.  Most workshops go unclaimed on servers I’m on. People don’t want to put in effort then lose to disconnects and PvP. Other than plans I find everything else pretty easily so not worth it.   PvP and Pve or private server I think would help. Then PvP could get on servers with action and play style they like. Wouldn’t even need bounties. LOL
---
THAT MAN HAS TWO LEFT HANDSSSSSS
---
No such thing!!! Next you're going to claim there's aliens and UFO's in West Virginia too I suppose....or some headless monster. C'mon, man!!!
---
;)
---
If I have learned anything from any game, you might as well throw it away after a nerf.
---
Mhm... Falkor (Fuchur in German) is a companion of Atreyu and Bastian. He is the only luckdragon to appear, although five others are mentioned in passing. He helps Atreyu find a cure for the Empress after escaping the web of Ygramul the Many.
---
I just run away as fast as I can.
---
It sure looks like they want you to have a different character for each one of these, and a really patient friend to pass gear from player to player with. And other ridiculous shenanigans instead of just playing the effing game.
---
I've been thinking about doing that, but I get mostly crappy legendaries. Will people still buy those, like the ghoul slayer's and such. Is there a pricing master list or do you have to watch the market for a few days to get a feeling for what people sell at?
---
Or are you talking about chems and other things like ammo?
---
That sucks man. Did the queen last night with my little brother. Not sure if we’re gonna be able to kill it, I’m 122 with a TSE gatt, but he’s only 33 with no legendary weapons. 7 other dudes with TSEs happened to be on the server, showed up, and we mercd the queen in 8 minutes (fastest i have personally ever seen her go down). We both got 3 plans a pop. Gotta keep killing her and you’ll get the good drops sooner or later. 
---
Thanks, man. 
---
As long as it was fun, death before dishonor. We all have our ways of sustaining in the nuke zone, it's only a matter of time before some youtuber shows them our secrets and all you mooks will learn that way.

I bought a piece of armor off of a player for 3000 caps.  The armor has +25 radiation resistance, but for some reason, the radiation resistance doesn't work.  I was *hoping* they would be able to remove the glitched item and replace it with one that works, like support can do in 99% of multiplayer games.  Hell, Steam Support even got off their ass to help me in TF2, and we all know how bad Steam Support can be.
---
But, evidently, the support personnel for Fallout 76 have zero tools and are incapable of doing anything.  I'm not even being facetious.  They literally can't do anything.
---
All this + nerf TSE guns.
---
Yes people will be upset their dupe is not as powerful but this game is 2 months old. Anybody leaving now because of that wasn't sticking around for the long haul anyway. Besides, right now, I don't remember what most perk do. Unyielding and bolstering? Think one is good stats when low / high health. Other one is other way around? Dunno. Isn't TSE so doesn't matter. The ones that lower item weights are nice. But give us a reason to want something that isn't TSE. Which, btw, shouldn't have been a possible combo when The community was bound to find a dupe glitche early on.
---
I live in Ohio. Real close. For what reason should anyone visit WV? Lol 
---
Just as you aren't mean to stack those two stairs. /endofconversation
---
I couldn't believe they were real.

 Seriously it just made me laugh again!!  Love it 
---
No, I sold it to the medic guy right as you enter the Whitesprings.

At least I have hope that I'll be able to get another.
---
Lol ew
---
If you're on PC I know a guy who can hook you up with a new serum easy-peasy. Yeah it sucks, but at least the community can ease the pain
---
That's Tom, he keeps me company while I'm crafting or watching TV. I miss companions. 
---
Why are you in such an position/area where you're low level being attacked by high levelled mole rats? Why aren't you running?
---
You just seem not that experienced/smart when fighting them. 
---
Other then Whitespring kiting, turrets aren't all that great.  I know its not for everyone, but bulding without turrets leaves you with plenty of budget to go big.  
---
I get my fair share of garbage too.  Didn't mean to imply you weren't doing enough farming, just sharing my methods.  I drop 99% of what I find on the ground since it's mostly worthless.  I'll find a 3* weapon maybe once a week, it's usually poop.
---
How about those 4lbs deathclaws? 
---
“Anti-Preston-Garveyers” so basically everyone except Preston Garvey himself?
---
If people can't detect his sarcasm at that level they're already dead.
---
Damn your good (jokes aside this is actually a good idea to get rid of duped items)
---
you used ontology wrong
---
Oh well. Good on ya, anyway
---
If you are holding more than 32 of a single weapon, your account is deleted.
---
once people get bored they start to become total assholes. 
---
I agree!!!! This needs to be implemented. I would love to have a main character for solo, another for when I’m playing in a group with friends and then maybe a third character for testing stuff out or maybe just trying a new build such as a pvp one. But currently with having to start from scratch each time is kinda frustrating or when I find some awesome items for my alt and can’t transfer them over.
---
Yes, in my experience, even the cheapest level you build can grant you mods when scrapped. 
---
No one ever does.  Don't blame them though.   Easy to miss if you're not on Reddit much, as that's where sites typically place adds lol
---
I know that's why I find it weird they didn't add one for first person.
---
Lol - had the new york bacon pancakes mix for my ring tone for a long time. XD
---
Nah, I just threw out a number. There's no reason to compile SB comments. It's pretty well known outside of BGS offices how crappy a monster it is.
---
Hi /u/Ladydevann, how do you guys pick and choose which threads to comment on in regards to bugs/suggestions? Do you pick them personally and choose what gets sent to people at Bethesda or do they tell you? Is it completely random? It's just weird because there have been so many other useful/productive threads and while stair placement is certainly something I'd like looked at it seems like small potatoes compared to many other bug reports and suggestions that go unheeded.
---
I could see value in a cool down. So if you take it it's worth your while.  I'm very curious to see how private servers work out. 
---
&gt; here’s no way Bethesda is that horrible at balance
---
umm...
---
It’s a bit harsh yeah.
---
On both characters I finished with around 3 seconds to spare.
---
Just can’t take the balance ropes and beams too fast.

---
i love this 
---
I was thinking last night that it would be nice to build down. I made a small base that has all the crafting needs with no walls. I would like to have an area under it just for myself.
---
The carry weigh would kill all shop owners like Lou
---
Where did you get my custom loading screen from?  
---
And seriously, I haven't been doing any photos before level 50, and when I started, I returned to that place to give it a shot.
---
But they do have one for 3rd person.
---
Im still not paying to change cards, 2 worst ideal ever.  
---
I thought this was going to be a feature at launch and waiting for an announcement on when we can swap loadouts for perks/weapons/armor
---
Thanks very much! I have been trying to adjust on the fly but I often only get a moment or two before the critter starts moving again (it's actually part of what makes it fun). I'll definitely check it the letterbox frame! Great tip! 
---
Gave me a handmade. Dope bot.
---
The equivalent of the double-pump meta. 
---
&gt; furious caps out at +15% damage
---
pure fiction
---
Hey, they got that more than correct. Lolol
---
I got the gauss rifle plans from one of the vendors in watoga.
---
If I had a two shot gauss rifle I’d use it (I had an anti armour one but then I got the mutation that nerfs energy damage and it’s damage went way Down so I got rid of it).
---
The perk batteries included makes the ammo weight negligible.
---
Online multiplayer 101:
---
Dungeons --&gt; Bosses --&gt; Boss loot
---
Boss loot required for:  Raids
---
Bethesda: hurr durr, rNg! 
---
I can craft it for you on pc now if you want. Maer mine with 2 pressure switches
---
Same could be said about your state.....and your drivers
---
That mod and Better Inventory have improved Fo76 exponentially, I'd quit without them.
---
As of this morning, they're annoying me while I'm trying to cook up some rations with small inconsequential bits of damage until I quit and log on a different server.  Go play on the interstate.
---
Everyone that I have spoken to knows about it, plus this was covered by many youtubers.
---
No more of a reference to 3 because that vault is closer
---
Yeah but when I get rushed by too many enemies and everything slows down, and I try to swap to a different favorite too fast I end up just looking straight down, surrounded with the wrong damn gun out.
---
I disagree. The game is already easy mode. People want to buff it and make it even easier? I mean why not just enable console and we can just print whatever we want?
---
Literally the only thing to do at end game is try to get good rare gear, I dont want it easier personally. It would also deflate the value of that gear in an already wrecked economy.
---
I swear this game has more bugs than the Amazon rainforest.
---
Just finish each session at a workshop.
---
Or just fast travel to vault 76 first.
---
Log on, take workshop, bam free travel point for rest of session...until you crash randomly then you’re fucked
---
ROFL who downvotes this? Wow you sure got back at ME for saying something you don't like!
---
I usually try to set a goal each time I sit down to play - yesterday it was setting up a fallback base in WS, today its gonna be trying to get the flux needed for a decon arch for said base.  And then there's the daily vendor hopping to try to get the caps needed for the letters set.
---
If I'm in power armor, I just ignore them and keep walking. If they persist, I hop servers.   
---
Get the fudge out of my face with that nonsense. 
---
One of my fave locations!! Great for a quick xp boost, fun with friends and endless routes 🖒
---
I don't see why they can't simply meet halfway and deliver a "read only" Pip Boy app that just displays your stats at least. Or even if they won't do that, give us an external API so we can show off our stats on social media and make our own open source pipboy apps. 
---
That's what you get for trying to make sense. Downvoted by angry misguided people who do not understand the market. I bought Fallout 1 for full price and now you get it for free . OUTRAGEOUS! I could have just waited 22 years and gotten it for FREE!
---
Don't know about bugged, but it just needs any mutant stronghold, the ski resort just northeast of the top of the world usually has one nearby
---
I'm upset that I didn't go see him at the Mothman Festival when they were in Point Pleasant area I would have had so many questions and everything like that but the biggest thing that I have a problem with is that it seems like the lack of landmark locations and as small as the map a lie is in comparison I mean he'll the New River Valley Gorge is in the wrong place in considering like you know Beckley and you can Kino Flatwoods and you know geographically speaking
---
That’s very helpful, thanks. If I don’t have the mats I’ll hit you up :)
---
it is not only matter of laser gattlings. all of energy weapons with legendary explosive has same problem.
---
[Lunch break bears](https://i.imgur.com/gPqp7o7.jpg) think this was the first set I found and it' still my favorite.
---
Oh yeah no, absolutely.
---
A little bit by mama dulches 
---
this is what my friends been doing, hes currently upto 4 dragons, a 2 shot black powder rifle, 2 black powder rifles, and some other bits and bobs
---
ive got 2 more dragons to give him when he gets on
---
hes dressed as a confederate
---
I don't know if this is a bug in my game but, if I start shooting in third person and leave the shooting button pressed while going into first person I can still see the square reticle. Helps to be more accurate. I mostly use the gattling gun so with slow fire rate I can afford to use those first few shots to aim.
---
&gt; Not useless stuff we vendor 
---
More like, not usless stuff I drop XD I have way better luck selling high radiation fluids and glowing blood to the vendors from any given nuke zone, to the point where I will never have a need to sell that 15cap legendary to a vendor :/
---
I'm sure this will get downvoted but I disagree with the underlying assumption that banning people who are violating the TOS will kill the game is false.  
---
It doesn't matter how "loyal" these people are.  They are making the game demonstrably worse.    
---
By your logic it's ok to let anyone do anything regardless of the consequences so long as they are "loyal".  No, that's just not a premise I can get on board with ;)
---
You don't need to put a limit on it. There isn't a limit on it in real life. If I want to horde massive amounts of useless junk in my house, I am free to do so. All you have to do is make the items stack in your inventory. If I have 10,000 bobby pins, keep them in stacks of 100. If I want that many stacks fine. If all those stacks in my item list are a pain to manage, I can throw them out. They will be in my way, just like real junk in my house, and I will get rid of them. 
---
Inventory management is important on what you can carry. I'm not arguing that. I shouldn't be able to carry every single type of weapon. However, I should have the stash space to go back to my home and get whatever weapon I want.
---
Tse are *broken*  because of the perk cards that can be equipped to boost the damage. Also of everyone bf as a tse isnt that kind of balanced? I'm strictly against pvp tse because of how easy it is to die or be killed but me and some friends did a 4v4 and we all had tse it was kind of fun to be honest with mutations and strange in numbers
---
 Lastly they should  make the durability of tse to maybe half and also be able to craft an explosive receiver maybe that way everyone has access to these weapons. 
---
I hadn’t  seen those . . . You remember where they were?
---
You know moisture and oil on computer parts is bad right?  Hope you have a helluva filter on your compressor... Or just throw a little Dawn on after you spray it out and run it through the dishwasher to clean it back up.
---
Scorchbeasts are just cliff racers with more pixels and a ranged attack.
---
I think it would be nice to designate a stash as public.  there are some nice things that I no longer want, and rather than just drop them in bags, it would be nice if someone could use them.  like the yellow sniper I found in a bag in the middle of the road in the middle of nowhere.  was nice to find, but what are the odds of anyone finding it.
---
I mean not for nothing, but other recent survival games that FO76 seems to take it's queues from do not have a limit to how many items/resources you can store.  Games like Ark and Conan Exiles have a limited amount you can carry, but you can build as much storage in your base as you would like/have the resourced to build.  You have to earn or collect all of these resources, so these games understand that this can be time consuming and difficult work and give you the option to save what you want to save.
---
I also believe many of these games allow for more players per server than FO76 does as well.  Im guessing it's to do with the CAMP system and how your CAMP is not a permanent place in the world, but it's not really good system IMO.
---
just don't use 2se energy weapons. it is worse than none-legendary.
---
Ok, so the Service entrance is on the backside of the resort facing the Whitesprings Railstation.
---
If you are talking about the other bunker entrance, once you enter the main entrance of whitesprings, head downstairs as you would the shops. Stay to the left and run down the long haul, through the movie theater, still hugging left till you get to the elevators. Go to floor 3. It will be on the right wall when you exit the elevator.
---
I just figured out why I bought a barn set forever ago and can’t make any barn pieces.
---
Yeah, thing is, a lot of legendaries, even really good ones, either aren't as good as what someone already has, or don't fit the build. Sure you could go on the bazaar subs and try to get some decent caps, but that seems like a lot of effort. So for me, if I don't need it, and none of my teamies need it, vendor it is. But if it's something interesting, maybe I'll use it for a few minutes first. And I might as well see if I have any plans for it. But after that, vendor. Maybe someone will have use for it, maybe not. Either way, those 12 caps are mine.
---
There is no such thing as 'the TSE problem'.   The effort to manufacture one is simultaneously entertaining and sad.
---
Im glad it took you an hour to figure that out.
---
Now learn to sort your life out and grow the fuck up. 
---
Any 10mm? Ran out fighting a scorchbeast and a high level behemoth yesterday 
---
Yeah me too. Don’t know if we will get them but it would be nice to have servers.  Or as a friend that plays ESO mentioned they have specific PvP map areas and group PvP matches that are planned. Sounded neat. 
---
I wouldn’t mind a ‘leave workshop’ function either. And I don’t build  defenses around extractors so a passer by could just take stuff. I’d never know since I don’t camp at the workshop afterwards. They extractor fills so take it and when I finally get around to coming back it will have filled again. No need to kill me after I just paid caps and fought enemy waves and just built the extractors. Lol. Dude!  Rude!  
---
My team does like the racetrack workshop. But it isn’t about the workshop. It’s about having a fun team area we can build and stay at. Wish teams could set up close Camps. Anyway lots of wishes. Lol
---
fishing level?
---
i solod it no problem at lvl 55 i completed site alpha with nowhere near as much prep as you its meant to be done as a team i assume but i was able to solo it easy
---
hit the big bugs with big hammer.   
---
How what works? And if you know, then describe how it actually does.
---
But if to allow those alts to move stuff around you need to create a 100-200 limit shared storage, that the server needs to track anyhow, I'd rather see that be tacked onto the 600 to make an 700-800 limit player storage.  If the server cant handle the extra, it doesn't much matter what people want to do with it, it wont happen.  
---
The only other way to allow shared storage would be to lower the personal storage to turn that into shared storage, which would most likely upset people more than the value of the shared storage helps.
---
I'm just saying that we dont need 3000 storage per server, just a little more per player.  That and mule alts are annoying.
---
I saw the cooking show one before I started taking pictures, but now that you reminded me Ima go get that one. 
---
There releasing more information tomorrow.
---
It tends to be streaky for me. I can go somewhere and all of the boxes will turn up extra stuff and then sometimes I'll go somewhere and get multiple duds in a row. I would put my overall success rate better than 50%, but not 80%.
---
the story doesnt make fucking sense. nobody coming out of the vault looks over the age of 30. that means that the vault only took in small children, but none of that is mentioned at all. also 20 years later the overseer sounds exactly the same. theres just too many holes there for me to ignore... but if you start replacing their dialogue with shit like "vault-tec didnt prepare me for this" or "vault-tec told me that this" instead of the "i remember" then it suddenly makes sense. because then the vault overseer was also a child, but then you have to fucking ignore her entire personal story. the story of this game is full on garbage. its like they didnt even try to run this story by a focus group lol.
---
But of course we’re not lacking in Atomic Shop items. Got new ones today
---
Actually the game is running pretty smoothly in my experience. I’m not complaining. 
---
Funny enough, the "assault rifle" is a hybrid of three other real world LMGs; a Lewis Gun, an MAS and an M249.  
---
God I would die to have ramps in game, they're the best part of spring
---
I’d rather they work on bug fixing than feeding the egos of the “notice me senpai” gamers that demand constant attention. 
---
You can complete the quest, there are just tapes at every nuclear bunker according to the wiki which means you have to go to each one individually. 
---
You are interacting and connecting with actual characters, you are actually part of the plot and not just listening to it and you get to make actual choices.
---
Yea I watched "trend chasers" as well but i realised they are speaking shit and saying "we the gaming community" and say stupid stuff. (cleanprince, downwardthrust) and i had enough and unfollowed and removed from the suggested content, EZPZ. Indeed, it's nice that you can simply choose what to watch/see etc...
---
But the part of a gun you can stick anything in is the barrel...OHhhh
---
Damn wish i had thought of that when i first started.
---
Yup 
---
I had a base furious 10mm smg I used against SBQ it was the only weapon on me where I could see her hp go down... I had a pretty OP 3* grognaks axe that did nothing to her sooo I dunno 
---
Okay, that’s good info thank you. So on the load screen what do they mean by power armor increases carry weight? On my other power armor I get a carry weight of an extra 100 weight but then it bugs out back to normal carry weight without power armor. 
---
witcher 3 had dlc that was produced AFTER ITS RELEASE DATE!!!! bethesda TAKES CONTENT OUT OF ITS VIDEO GAMES AND THEN SELLS THEM LATER! 
---
HUGE FUCKING DIFFERENCE YOU PLEB. i bet you deny the holocaust happened too. fucking wank. 
---
I mean, both ammo types are very common, and the fire rate means you do more damage per second with the LMG. 
---
Kinksters
---
But I’ve got a lot of wood. Right now.
---
There is a similar perk in Luck for Rifles.
---
&gt; you can damage one slightly more than the other, and the inventory screen will separate them
---
If you are using the black powder rifle, you can use the bayonet mod on one and they would automatically be separate.
---
Maybe
---
That makes two of us, but on days where I’m not really feeling super motivated to do other stuff I’ll try to go back and find the ones I can remember and get shots of them. 
---
Totally with you on power patcher, but I keep breaking my legs jumping above explosive rounds or firing too close. Like my helmet is still at like 150%, but I’ve repaired my legs twice. Not really sure what’s going on there. I started running it out of hatred for springs. 
---
I feel you on bear arms as well, I’ve been looting miniguns looking for that gilded paint and it helps, but I usually just run with a Gatling gun and and a sword and lucked into a lightweight explosive Gatling. It weighs 4lbs without perks, only a little more than my sword. 
---
Now I want a pistol/revolver with it to run like the wind with the agility perk card.
---
It's far too late my dude.  This should have been done before release, not two months after.
---
You can't un-ring the bell.  Why are you still playing?

I spawn her almost every night of the week after work (7pm PST) and usually 3 per day on weekends.  KOSOWNS.
---
Robots in the silo's absolutely ABSORB bullets. I highly recommend a good melee weapon. Friends make all things easier though, because it gives everything someone else to shoot at. You could prob run it solo if you knew exactly how and where to go though. Also, disabling turrets most of the time (I.M.O.) is a must. 
---
The joy of murdering that uppity flying bastard should be reward enough! 
---
Seriously though, they are super annoying. I have found that pulling them into large open areas helps convince them to land. So does a cryolator (specifically one with a crystallizing barrel so you get some range on them). In my experiences hitting them with said weapon and stacking that movement debuff seems to get them to land fairly regularly. If you don't have the barrel just hosing them down in the off chance they do land keeps them down for longer. SUPER useful if you run with a buddy that happens to punch things in the face irresponsibly hard. 
---
at the top of the world, on the middle floor, outside of where you can even get to, theres a gnome on some skis about to take a journey
---
From earlier postings I read its 200%, so about a two shot. This is why I posted my question
---
Agreed :)
---
i figured that much with explosive bugging the weapon, thought there might be a workaround, but apparently not
---
I can even give you the bos combat armor chest plans for the trouble 
---
I knew it was on the 3rd floor, but whenever I try to push that button, it says that it's unavailable (or something to that effect). I always have to find it manually. I know I'm getting close when I see all the hand scanners on my left.  Until last night when I was wandering around trying to find it, I didn't realize there was a soda shop either. A floor plan would really come in handy. 
---
Welcome to 76. Scrap things that are higher level than you, sell the legendaries, and don't hoard. It really sucks I know, but you get used to it. Don't forget to drop all the ammo you aren't using too.

Is this mod allowed?  Please refer to Bethesda's article on mods: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/kw/mod﻿](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod﻿)

"Is this mod cheating?  The functionality of this mod still requires you to manually open your Perk Cards menu and manually save or load your desired cards. It is not automated."
---
Can you see him from the windows?
---
Man some of the community base mods from fallout 4, would have been great additions to fo76. CAMP seems to be such a big part of the game, but just like everything in FO76, it doesnt seem quite like its a finished part either.
---
They're stacking duped bobbleheads, of course it's not okay and will be around until duping ceases someday
---
Melee is incredibly easy to solo, it's pretty much just walk from point a to b.
---
My sniper sucked, was slow and shitty.
---
Ah thank you!
---
Yes, it does. Take off your Pack Rat perk to see actual weights.
---
Also, you can sell bulk scraps to vendors for okay money.
---
Spam is good. i cant cook it right. Ive tried to make spam fried rice. Never works out. 
---
 It was good in Hawaii though. Or maybe everything is good in hawaii cause you are in hawaii. 
---
Ill just stick to scrapple, pork roll and Philadelphia foods. I make a scrapple chesse steak. My claim to fame. Its just about the most philly thing ever. 
---
I have a plan for you by the way. Already got them for everyone else and I’m holding onto one for you when you want it. And that’s completely up to you. I’m fine just giving it to you at cost, but if you want to give a tip you’re welcome to xD
---
oh nice! I have been getting pretty creative trying to build multilevel camps. This would have come in handy last night.
---
Not if you use two Quad powder pistols.
---
Are you saying the "Follow the Overseer's Journey" quest no longer appears under your side quest list?  Because every single thread when someone says that it's debunked.
---
Oh dammmn
---
Level 101 from just playing with some Lead/Legendary farming at Watoga and at this point i dont know what to spend my perk point on. I have all the perks i wanted already.
---
I did it as a  duo with my daughter.  It was tough but do-able.  Spent lots of. 5.56 and .45 rounds in there 
---
For me, it is either a guaranteed server crash or instant death from somebody with a duped TSE.
---
https://imgur.com/a/GGAZOAa  you have to have marsupial or a jetpacjk to get on top of the various signs, dont know which one it was
---
It sounds good at first glance.  In practice it becomes quickly annoying in every game where having mule characters has become common for me.
---
There isnt a lot of reason to play lots of different characters in this game, so passing stuff around for twinking purposes is less relevant, shared storage really is just to fill up a character to carry your extra crap.
---
As for technical stability issues, I am less certain on that.  I mean, there are limits I am sure, but plenty of other games allow for far more storage, equally complex items in storage, and more players online at a time.  If this is a technical limitation, it is a solvable one.
---
hey i get it, up until a week ago i was one of the shills who was coming thru this reddit downvoting threads like this and commenting shit like "the game just came out, its got its ups and downs, disney world didnt work when it was first opened up look at it now!"
---
although now... pretty certain this game is more like Jurassic park... 
---
TSE  (Two Shot Explosive) weapons are meanly sought after because of how effective they can be in any combat situation and even more deadly in PvP with the right perks. On top of this it's also a good source of caps if you have a TSE Weapon to get off your hands 
---
yep!
---
During the reveal of Fallout 76 in May/June 2017 at E3
---
You are supposed to stack those stairs /youneedtoapplylogic
---
Not yet
---
Why would they ban dupers when it's an intended game mechanic?
---
I'm enjoying my 60$. And I have a thought that I've invested in TES6
---
I have both :-), I’ll try and get a shot from outside tonight. 
---
It's a lot easier to solo once you've tagged along with folks who know what to do and can familiarize yourself with the silos. Having hacking perks helps too so you can at least turn off the turrets.
---
If you're on PS4 I'd be happy to help you (or anyone else) new to nukes. Lvl 140-something, I can typically solo a silo in like half an hour barring any stupid bugs like the mainframe cores disappearing or accidentally blowing myself up with my TSE.
---
Wait is 30 seconds not enough time to kill scorchbeasts? I must be doing something wrong/right because they rarely live for more then 20 seconds in the air let alone the fact they are insta dead when they land.
---
Sometimes NPCs respawn when a player loads in like enemies do, you'll see a lot of concierges. 
---
It bugged out for me too, I couldn’t see the quest marker on my map. Strangely though one of the people in my group could see the quest marker and guided me to it so I could complete it. Very strange bug.
---
The way that these have popped up for me when I looked on the map is there are 5 locations. If you search 4 of them and still haven't found it, you now know where it is. I believe that this is why it shows 4/4 instead of 4/5.
---
I'd argue a Quad Explosive powder is more powerful than TSE because of the nature of black powder weapons.
---
&gt; **Tier 5** - Targeting HUD, Tesla Coils, Stealth Boy, Jet Pack, Calibrated Shocks, Reactive Plates
---
I've seen all of those several times in the WS Enclave Bunker, **except** the damn Calibrated Shocks.
---
I've done it a handful of times, with a few death's in there but I was pleased to find you don't lose Silo progress from death.   
---
Does anyone know if it scales to team play? It seemed like it'd be awfully easy with one extra person. 
---
No you don’t because of damage resistance I can kill maybe 4 scorched with a mag from the LMG 6 if I miss less than 5 times it takes a solid second and a half to kill a lvl 20 scorched even with rank 3 heavy gunner rarely even a second to put one down with 3 ranks in pistol perks

Defended the game from what?

Mine must be bugged, I've got all the tapes and it's still active.
---
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MINING AND SMITHING UPDATE
---
my god, if FO76 did events like GW2 does, I would play the living shit out of it
---
thatd be great :D
---
Could be a known bug, and they're just going to fix it with the rest when(if) they do so. Also possible they don't bother as a company policy to reply with a human until/unless they have a fix ready to go. I imagine just wading through the garbage reports to get to real problems that needs fixing would be a herculean task right now.
---
As far as I know, they have no means of simply editing your character to fix something (they traded items during the bloody greenbriar event, where it would have made sense to just spawn stuff in). Kinda wish they did, just start bopping dupers one at a time if need be.
---
All that aside, how did you test the rad resist? My understanding is that it's got some rather stupid math involved behind the scenes that essentially encourages power armor use in high rad zones. It's possible you did a full strip-down test, damned if I know, just asking.
---
USO, OCDECORATOR and Scrap Anything are winners
---
I haven’t encounters bugs with plans luckily.
---
Just buying the same plans 4 times because I can’t remember if I’ve got them or not and don’t want to risk it
---
The two shot explosive weapon is the highest ranged dps weapon which in each weapon archetype. The reason for the weapons being so strong is the Demolition Expert perk effects the explosive damage on the weapon. 
---
Just tried and didn't seem to work but I found out how to display the links I think.  Had to click the three dots for settings then click community info.
---
hah! I like it.
---
it is ok man, there is no reason though.
---
Also someone on here correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the weight reduction only affects then base weight of the weapon and not the added weight from all the mods. 
---
My alternate char is a healer. While I totally agree that most times it's more cost effective to just die, there are many situations where it's a huge help. For instance, inside buildings and caves, these dungeons you speak of.
---
She's only strong playing with a team, but is always fun, and it's nice having a different play style option. The buffs are nice too.
---
Each time I blew up a nuke on whitesprings I hope that in the meantime they made nukes obliterate the building they hit.
---
Not saying that at all. All I’m saying is that according to [this](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_Mission) article on the wiki, it should be completable, with a note containing a potential fix for the bug. 
---
I have a gamma gun that does +30% damage to ghouls.  Tell me that aint worthless. 
---
It does save some weight. Take off Pack Rat to see what stuff actually weighs while in stash.
---
But definitely bulk the stuff you’re looking to sell off first, because there’s not always enough plastic to go around.
---
Huh, I'll have to check that out, then, it didn't seem to get anywhere when I had mine on, but that was a while ago, maybe I just didn't notice.
---
Just kidding mah doge.
---
Much &lt;3!
---
It’s basically a FN minmi or m249 saw with a water cooling thingy
---
No I don't, cuz it'll still do more dmg than an average boomstick or rifle
---
Imagine if they came out with animal, robotic, and animal robotic companions
---
anyone who hates that settlement loving commie
---
Information. I hope it's patchnotes, not another excuse
---
You need to hit an enemy before it dies to gain access to its loot table and xp.  When with a group of people this is usually called 'tagging'.  Lots of people hitting an enemy, but no one really trying to kill it so everyone gets something.
---
TS and TSE are as they say on the tin.  One does double damage the other does double damage plus explosive damage.  What kind of killer wouldn't want that?
---
It was great in Borderlands 2 when Claptrap just outright explains that the secret stash is for twinking between characters.
---
Making the bobbleheads unstackable seems like an easy fix.
---
I’m Chinese myself and I can confirm that they say “Fa Xian Mei Guo Ren.” Which is “ American detected “ sometimes.
---
I just did it solo at level 54. Went in with 1k each of .45 and 5.56, my completely normal handmade and lever action guns, didn't run out of ammo for either of them, and didn't break any weapons or armor. I did run around in my T-60 power armor (which I usually don't use), and I only ended up using maybe 5-10 stimpacks at the most.
---
I have no experience doing this in a group, but I'm pretty sure I read that if you do this with more players, the quest throws more enemies at you. I've seen several people post that they are actually easier solo.
---
I'm honestly not sure what to tell you. My experience was very different from yours.
---
So...everyone..
---
I wish they would just set it higher across all vendors so you didn't have to run around.
---
OMG thank you for this!  
---
I have a ton of those plans, that and shielded is all I ever get from tech data turn in's oh and knight. 
---
The only “chrome” I’ve seen is on the X-01 when you strip the prototype paint off. 
---
As the state of the game exists now, I agree with you.  Stopping the cheaters and duping needs to be a top priority.
---
settle down, hoss. New stuff coming soon enough.
---
I've seen items in them called royal jelly but it's listed as a 'junk' item when I loot it and auto scraps, if that's what we are supposed to use for the cooking recipee, then it shouldn't be an 'auto scrap thing
---
&gt;&gt; When I attack a base, those are hard earned caps I am throwing away
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Then don't be a dick, there is literally zero reasons to attack someone's base besides griefing, you get nothing out of it.
---
At level 240, the end game is boring as fuck. The Wrecking Ball Park exists for a reason, the only thing I do in the game is destroy bases, have a friend point them out on the map since I'm wanted and rack up the bounty lol. More fun than killing the queen or whitesprings I'll tell you that much. 
---
Skin, singular. Just minigun. 
---
Two shot: a legendary prefix which causes the weapon to shot 2 bullets at the same time, for the price of one. Essentially double damage.
---
Explosive: a legendary prefix which cause the shots from a weapon to explode upon hitting something. Effected by demolition expert perk, so when used with that does massive damge.
---
TSE: two shot explosive. A weapon that has both the above prefixes, does an absolutely massive ammount of damage if respective perks are used (a tse level 45 pump action with 3 shotgunner perks maxed, demo expert maxed, and bloody mess maxed does 1145 damage per shot)
---
Tagging: tagging is where you get a hit on an enemy before another person kills it. This allows you to actually get loot from its corpse. 
---
I know exactly where you took that shot. 
---
Fuck that cave!
---
Please make the game retain quests, especially Daily quests, when you log in after being bumped from the server. The game recognizes that I'm in a team and brings me back there, so it should be able to retain the Daily quest I had. (It's bad enough that we aren't really doing the Daily quests together, we're just playing side by side going to each person's differently assigned objectives.)  But the returning player ends up with no Daily at all and re-logging in doesn't fix it. 
---
I know there are problems with quest and quest progress retention in general, but this one is particularly frustrating because you don't even have a chance of picking it back up through location or activity. It's just gone and all you can do is help others finish theirs. 
---
They said tomorrow is a update
---
Two shot weapons fore two rounds each time the weapon is fired.
---
"Tagging" is doing any damage to a mob so you get xp and loot when it dies. 
---
I encountered one near my camp, it nearly killed me twice and I liked it back to my turrets and grabbed a rocket launcher out of my stash. It is MUCH easier to kill with AOE. never found the body though.
---
I did, thanks! :D
---
There's a discord server with lfg groups. Search for it online and just join. More the merrier.
---
as if there wouldn't be even MORE complaints about not having anything to spend atoms on if there weren't new ones 
---
nah dude, offend them. fuck em. they have completely missed the spirit of fallout. they are the idiots who want linear mmo fallout with zero choices where everyone plays the exact same shit. 
---
you gotta remember vro, these are the same folks who will buy skyrim 10 different times because they feel its the right thing to do... (oh i got skyrim for my pc, my laptop, my ipad, my iphone, my ds, my xbox, my playstation... now lets get it for my *washing machine...)*
---
Hmm I'll have to try that.
---
Well the key to farming plan locations is to not pick up any plans that are not the one you are looking for. Once you pick up the plan, none will appear there for you for like 24-36 hours. Not sure if you are picking up any plans you find but if you are, this is why none are spawning.
---
Perdy gud 
---
is that the only thing? not to be a brat but discord is a niche im not interested in lol
---
Then they will just have a bigger inventory with more entities, or if you could just not own two of the same it would punish collectors.
---
What they need to do eventually if they can (after all current dupe methods have been removed) is remove all bobbleheads in all inventories above stack size 20 from the game and go from there.
---
What would have taken the cake is to switch to a firebreather's outfit + fire axe that they can see through the window while roasting.
---
I don't give a shit about videos. I want fixes, new systems, the pvp thing, and opening it up for mods and private servers next winter. Then I can REALLY play. 
---
They already said tomorrow will be the road map for the next two updates.  Though I doubt you care and just need an excuse to hate more. 
---
Ironclad is dope
---
just south of top of the world there is a canyon near the road.  I found someones base there one day that had the starting base brick at the top of the cliff, and then the rest of base more or less hung down from that off the face, it was pretty nice concept.
---
I couldn't fix it directly, but every time I log in my budget starts sort-of-correct. I've still got a broken industrial water purifier or six stored, that I can't delete, so I can't make any really fun camp stuff, and scrapping items did tick up my budget instead of down, last I checked, but on relogging it would be normal again.
---
I get it too on PS4 with two different PS4 systems. I think it’s the server communicating with your system telling it where all the mobs are. My suggestion to Bethesda would be to make the “guards” stronger and make less of them. A lvl 75 badass assaultron could probably defend an area better than two or three level 50’s. 
---
It's the only one I know of, sorry. 
---
All we would have to do is find a few brown rocks, bring him the head of the destroyer of worlds, and dance for his amusement.
---
We have a few professional sports teams, Lake Erie, cedar point and several beautiful state parks. So not really. 
---
Thanks for sharing!!! I also have an alt mule with more than 2.5k, this idea though inconvenient for people like us, who will just have to make a third mule, or be more selective about what we keep; will effectively end the problem of people who are carrying 100,000 pounds of handmades around. You aren’t the issue or the target. I’d love to hear your ideas on a better solution! 
---
The way AP regen/deplete/sprinting/encumberance bugs out is one of the craziest things in this game. Almost never makes any sense what that bar is doing.
---
I agree. With the favorite system, when your item is favorited you can't trade, sell, or drop it until it's unfavorited. 
---
Pretty sure it is called powered doors.  I think I picked mine up from Graham.
---
Hello! :D
---
Yep, loot timer. It's at least 20 like the vendors, maybe more.
---
Bulking lead and aluminum does reduce the weight in half for those junk items....
---
I didnt say it was well designed at all. I actually get that server hopping rewards players with desired possesions more than the gameplay and thats not the players fault. I said in theory its designed for the long haul. But if everyone thought compleating the quests and events was compleating the game, its going to be a pretty empty place soon.
---
I've bought 1 of those by chance - but I suspect its more that they're so in demand that everyone buys them, while the other mods might not always be bought up on sight.
---
It can take ages to save up to buy things (especially power armor paints). We’d be kept busy for quite some time before needing new content in there
---
I never said "you can't play it like and rpg"...I said it lacks any real gameplay thus is a $60 movie. But I doubt you would know the difference.
---
Just don't let the players craft new weapons if they are holding 32 of them already. Make them scrap and start over. If you have one mod left to discover, are you going to craft more than 32 of the same thing? What if you discover what you need on the first few tries?
---
Seriously, the building system needs an entire patch or two just for it alone. I love what they've done thus far, but it has such a long way to go to be decent (like allowing clipping into terrain with certain pieces, being able to align items to the ground, etc.). 
---
Exactly! Someone made the parable of wow earlier, and it just makes sense. It both fixes the issue of duplication value, and gives additional end game content, for the people who when they aren’t playing the game, they are talking about the game on reddit.... I don’t mean to sound entitled, but damn they need to take care of us, because you only get one shot at a loyal fan base. People who buy games 6 months after release are generally not going to be the ones who keep coming back and buying your atoms etc... 
---
I'm pretty sure all weapons heal the same amount. I'm not sure if there's a way to make it stronger. 
---
You on Xbox? If so I’ll buy a shielded plan
---
\*Still getting perk cards I need is certain circumstances at 115\* Huh?
---
I dunno, I still think "get a hit on it" for Xp would be less abusable (although by all means, let groups get XP, even if just split amongst them, because yeesh)
---
Also it kind of obligated you to an uncomfortable silence during a birthday party and an awful lot of uneaten pizza.
---
sorry man i am on PS4 or I'd join ya, ik there are others that will tho!
---
Whitesprings clubhouse, the MR. Handy in the crafting area.  However, you may find that farming vegetables is more productive in the long run.
---
Qol and game fixes is what came of the devs communication with the community..what's not to understand
---
It's a bug that happens sometimes if you disconnect (even briefly) while acquiring a mutation.
---
Unfortunately the only way I know to fix is to use radaways to clear all mutations, then start over.
---
I found that one, but I have trouble finding any pocketed plans for the limbs.. Where did you find it?
---
^100% this
---
Thank you for sharing! 
---
It would be great to read more if you like to write!
---
At least he told us minions to take some home
---
Great idea! There have been lots of talks of this idea, in variations, like through dlc, or seasons, or clean servers, however they do it, I think the consensus between everyone is it’s a good way to progress the game, address the dupers, and defuse the bubbling anger of their loyal fan base 
---
I've been playing every day since Beta started and yesterday was the first time I didn't really care about logging in to play due to the fact that everywhere I go, I saw everyone using TSE weapons now ... having played for more than 300 hours and never seen a single drop in over 230 levels across two characters, I highly doubt that more than half of these people gained theirs through legitimate sources.
---
It is seriously fucking ruining the game and needs to be addressed - this game is on the verge of collapse ... the same shit happened to The Division so Bethesda better do something before the end of January of there will not be anyone playing their game except cheaters.
---
That's great! I'm looking forward to getting some good shots of the frogs. The fact they all move around is part of the fun. 😁 Have you shared your photos anywhere? 
---
Can I get a officer suit?
---
I'm online now. Staticchmbr1 is my gt. I'm unfortunately near the top of the world, and can't fast travel due to weight.. I can make my way down 
---
hmmmm bit late on the reply.......considering how long ago i posted this lol
---
i was just thinking about this last night! i would love an underground base. 
---
That is incorrect. You can hop 5 servers and they will start appearing again. I literally farm only plans and mods.  Now what is interesting is at certain locations in the bog and mire you can not get the same plan at the same location for 20-24 hours. But others can spawn.   
---
This was two and a half days of plan farming : [https://imgur.com/a/a1B0Es4](https://imgur.com/a/a1B0Es4)   
---
I normally do this and sell them in bulk to someone when I need caps since I am fine on them I have been on an alt playing. 
---
https://youtu.be/pCOJY5VJRIo
---
758k views that is half of the playerbase alone with all of the controversial stuff surrounding it 
---
I mean, unless you lock your doors/gates, hostile mobs like mongrels and rats will open them and attack you. I've literally had irradiated dogs open my door and attack me in my house. 
---
I got some I can sell for ya, I’ll be on in about an hour and a half PS4 if your on PS4 
---
They show rarely at the Watoga train vendor and BOS vendorbot.
---
Seems like it is acceptable round these parts :/
---
They way they've said they will release info on the next two updates lead me to believe that we are going to have to wait for a patch. 
---
If there was a patch scheduled for tomorrow why not just say instead of trying to calm people down with "info on the next two patches" BS.
---
Hope I'm wrong and we get patch notes tomorrow (meaning a patch as well), a hot fix to correct the lever action rifle animation wont count as a patch in my opinion either well not one that deserves mentioning, unless of course it's wrapped around a patch that actually fixes duping, removes the duped items and puts in the ground work for patch number two to fix the ever growing list of broken features.
---
Bethesda suck they really do, and seem to like ignoring customers :/
---
:D wanna make very public live stream wager with lots and lots and lots of witnesses so that when i win you have to pay up? how does a cool $5000 sound? :D
---
A "two shot" legendary literally fires two projectiles with every shot, for the price of one piece of ammo.  So, potentially, you're getting two hits for the price of one.  There is some discussion on how two-shot effects stack with other modifiers (such as perks that give bonus percentages to damage), but by any metric it's a pretty nice effect.
---
The explosive effect makes a small explosion at the point of impact.  With the right perks, that becomes a big explosion.  Weapons with high rates of fire (machine guns) or that spit out multiple pellets at a time (shotguns) can dump a large number of explosions on a group of enemies for little cost.  Again, pretty nice.  Also a good way to blow yourself up if you fire in close quarters.
---
A legendary weapon with both the two-shot and explosive (TSE) legendary effects is thus quite powerful.  So as the previous responses have said, TSE weapons are often the most deadly in the game. People here generally use that as shorthand for "powerful endgame level weapons."  TSE guns were, unfortunately, also heavily copied using various dupe bugs.  So there are an unbalanced, disproportionate number of them floating around in the game now.
---
As for "tagging," I assume they're talking about using a weapon with a recon scope.  Once you view an opponent through a recon scope (by aiming), a diamond indicator will appear on your screen and your compass showing where that creature is at all times.  This effect will remain until you change weapons or until the creature dies (and sometimes will even hang around on its corpse, a bug).  
---
Ok so yes, single player games and even offline games do have cloud save options because yes, its not uncommon...  And yes... you can bet that the servers on AWS are using redundant storage.. 
---
LOL you expect people to be our personal slave and work through holidays?  
---
I swear people in this sub just love to complain to hear themselves.
---
That's a really fun idea.
---
If you wanted to be cheap you could just instance them with a hatch.
---
Any event reccomendations? I know Uranium Fever and Violent night, but are there any others that always spawn legendaries? (Oh, AWOL armaments spawns legendary gutsys... if you have the save for killing waves of the bloody things)
---
I think weight management is better for some specs than others. 
---
For example, every weapon category besides rifles has weight reducing perks built into perks that you would take for your build. 
---
There are no weight reducing perks for rifleman and rifles are extremely heavy (~22lbs each). 
---
I’m not saying it can’t be done but it’s is definitely more difficult and requires either using perks to reduce weight of other items or playing RNG roulette to find legendary armor with weapon reducing stats. 
---
Concentrated fire, target the turbines on the outside, I forget what they are called. You take them out and then it won't move. As for SB, I got nothin.
---
New thing today on the atom store- chrome minigun skin. 
---
Yes, GT is MrEMar give me 5 minutes to log in 
---
And now the last 4 digits of your social for security reasons? Mhmm. And now the first five numbers?
---
Is she Tammy 1 or Tammy 2 though? 
---
I'm on Xbox thanks for the offer though!
---
Dense chest mod + assasins +sentinals 
---
We nees an explosive resist perk
---
Lucky! I’m gonna try the event tonight regardless, hopefully I get lucky
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68ndaZSKa8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68ndaZSKa8)
---
Agreed about other items not mattering, they need balance, I’d love to use weapons for my play style, rather than building my play style around weapons that are better than anything else could possibly be... idk if a direct nerf is the right move, I think something like raising the cap, and leaving TSE’s in the dust st lvl 50 would work too. The biggest nerf they could do to fix this issue Would be to change how demolition expert and other perks affect guns. That’s a nerf that we all want to see 
---
Give me a sec and I’ll swap worlds and teleport to you. Invite me to join your game :) ggjigglephysics 
---
:( rip lol I’m sure there are!
---
If I complete a treasure map does the map itself disappear 
---
coming from fallout 4, where i literally horde EVERYTHING, its hard to not do so. im getting there though.
---
They could benefit from looking at things done by ANY other multiplayer game. I'm not sure why Bethesda is so determined to try and re-invent the wheel, including all the same mistakes made along the way. This is doubly confusing since they're under Zenimax's corporate umbrella, so they should have had access to multiplayer skilled and experienced personnel.
---
Yes mate.
---
In Watoga Emergency Services (I think) was Jangles lying on a table with an alien on his face. Nice Aliens reference. 
---
I thought I checked there but maybe I missed it, I'll check again. I get adhesive from farming corn+tato+mutfruit, how do I get oil from farming vegetables?
---
You damn cape oppressors! It’s 2019!! 
---
&gt;Runner's high
---
Sounds like a pretty cool luck based perk
---
75% of the time I spawn at the base the cliff my house sits on so I have to run around to climb back up. It adds a little suspense to fast traveling to camp. Getting parasites would suck though 
---
When did you purchase it originally? Seems like a long time to wait to then claim "Good Customer service" but hey ho.
---
I only trade or give plans away. Shielded is a trade only plan, there is not much I need so make an offer. 
---
Would you be interested in a full BOS Combat armor set?
---
It appears to be the spawn place for them. Saw them there all the time
---
I wish I could remember the location with a bathtub full of soap bars... That would be nice to farm
---
They need to bring back the Rock-it Launcher but fix it so we can shoot our melee weapons.
---
I usually manually close the gate after entering it. So I think it would be fine if I do keypad on the outside and normal switch on the inside as long as I close the door manually after entering the inside?
---
At a house across the street from this house there’s a man who died doing snow angels on nukacola bottles lol 
---
I just edited my post above so multiple folks could see. /u/gstaff, Bethesda community lead for FO76, posted on their forums in the link I provide above some clarifications including that interface-only mods are fair game.
---
I didn't think I'd see someone mention this, but it's what I always imagine when people talking about playing games with a spouse...  We play it with other people, but when we played alone the first time it did not end well.
---
There are mods for the other games with this stuff included.  That's kind of one problem with FO76.  You get less ability to really tailor the game to your preferences.  It would be less bad if it was a very different game with very different functionality.  Otherwise the multiplayer actually walls off a lot of functionally options placing all choices on Bethesda to deem as a universal improvement and implement.  You'll never make everyone happy, so you're stuck aiming dead middle on everything.  Multiplayer is a tough world to design for because you're always passing off someone.  FO76 feels pretty good on the whole though, so they did pretty well for aim.  My only wish is open world building with no rules with full persistence and like 100 people on any server just goofing around.  The hard part with this game is you don't feel like you're making a difference, no real world building, uh not Fallout Minecraft?  Haha.  I have dreams.
---
The only problem with this is lead farming... when you pick up that 180 barbell, it's 180lbs until scrapped.  
---
your a fool
---
Lol, I’ll keep being a raider 
---
Does anyone know where broken power armor pieces go in your inventory?
---
have it
---
Is always there for me. I'm pretty sure that's where they just chill until dispatched by event activations and government supply requests.
---
First time I saw that though, I tried crossing the bridge thinking they were circling some sort of boss/place of interest.
---
There's been some speculation that it's a marker for future content on that part of the map. Or it just makes no damn sense like so much else in this game. One of those- lol.
---
You don't, I had a brain fart &gt;.&lt;
---
I kinda want a steampunk armor skin to go with it. There’s something magical about delivering ye old ass kicking to the scorched. After a kill or two most enemies get one shotted thanks to adrenaline, stack it up to five and kill just about anything with 5-10 shots. That may be while you and I see the ammo economy a little differently 
---
Gatling are great because they have the accuracy and ammo efficiency of a sniper with all the stopping power you’d expect from a big gun. I can’t believe the .50 cal does so much less damage with a significantly larger and more powerful ammo type. Something about minigun and Gatling laser damage just feels bad for how much ammo they take to kill anything. Would actually be completely on board with a nerf to Gatling damage and a buff to the .50 to make them make sense, or at least make the Gatling require .50 instead of 5mm
---
The scorchbeast meat stew is weird, cooking each meat seperately is much better stats boost.  I guess you could stack the stew on top of the other meats but that would require an insane amount of SB farming.
---
I also wish they would land more.  Hate it when they just fly around constantly harassing me.
---
Or give in to the dupers and get a TSE weapon that one shots em, at least until they fix those (if they ever do).
---
\+5% XP for an hour I think
---
The only thing that bugs me about it is when you turn off the lamp, it's like the fish gets turned off too. It just stops swimming.  
---
Unplayable. Bethesda, plz fx.
---
Ramps and pepperoni rolls
---
All these people talking about crashes every 10 minutes...upgrade from your dial up provider kids it’s not 2004 anymore. 
---
Haha it happens
---
I got my worst loot ever from a queen kill yesterday.  No plans and one 1 Star piece of armor, 
---
If you want that feeling of "I can go ANYWHERE!" try Breath of the Wild. Weapon degredation shouldnt be a problem for someone used to playing fallout 3 :)
---
How much?
---
telephones dont have screws or springs in them do they? i though that was mostly copper and circuits 
---
Probably your local hardware store
---
nah, give 1000 base stash and let us earn 1000 more via ingame activities.
---
That's good you decided to fight it head on, because that's the quest the game shows you that you're ready for them. Or if you're like me ready to ask another player for help
---
 I walked what seemed like half way across the map with a nuke launcher the broadsider and some sniper rifle just so I could put them, in storage. 
---
I know i have enough ammo for 2 wars, as long as I am not using 10 mm
---
I have yet to see one of these in the game and I've had it and played each day since launch.
---
Also never seen a mega sloth or flatwood monster ( heard one I think, not 100% sure lol)
---
Well it kinda does make sense for an explosive weapon to do more damage to everything. The player is the same as an enemy, and a legendary weapon with explosive shots is just a grenade launcher.
---
Are TSE effective in silos? 
---
Wow 700 karma for posting known facts since beta?  Sign.  Me.  Up.
---
What
---
Horde events always have one leg, but that's bottom of the barrel.  Honestly, server hoping whitesprings is probably better
---
You can craft the barrel onto other syringers after the mission.
---
bethesda just hired something like 200 people to deal with PR problems... this doesnt mean they will be opening a call center to deal with customer complaints, NO... this means that 200 people will be sitting on computers 8 hours a day DOWNVOTING people who say the game is bad. new age damage control is disgusting, and you can see it happening all around us in this new digital age... 
---
try a medication and makes your dick fall off? too bad, there are 10,000 people who are going to say that the medication made their *dick fall ON.*.. whoever shall we believe? 
---
it would be fucking absurd if it wasnt factual. 
---
A lot of those bigger issues have been brought up again and again. You might post something, or come across a post, and think "this is great, why isn't Bethesda commenting on this and forwarding it to the dev team?" Maybe they don't see the thread, or maybe it's that they saw and commented on it last time it was posted, or the time before that.
---
A squirrel or chicken could beat Rover, OHKO :'(
---
did he PM you too? He's not going to post here anymore because we are all "arrogant short sighted high horse riding neck beards" lmao
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Would ya look at that.
---
Wanting the game to feel like it’s not made of glass isn’t hate
---
Na I wasn’t cool enough for a PM sadly. 
---
I collect everything but I run back to every workbench to scrap everything instead
---
bruh the guy just wants people to hang out with chill out 
---
I'm glad I started a new character then.  All I have to do is make sure I have the caps and can get there at level 15.
---
Just because people have a different style of play doesn’t mean you should tell them to kill themselves.
---
It's 2076, why can't we have Skyrim on the pipboy
---
Passionately disagree that The Division was worse at launch. It had issues, quite a few of them, but much more of the game functioned properly than not. In FO76, almost nothing functions as it should 100% of the time.
---
Ironically, Bethesda IS making all the mistakes The Division devs made. Namely, trying to play catch-up with the cheaters and exploiters, instead of banning them. For the first 3-4 months past release, The Division devs kept trying to patch all the holes. And as soon as they closed up one, people started exploiting the next. It's a rookie mistake. You can't keep up with cheaters and exploiters, you have to go after them directly, not just close off the weaknesses they exploit. It's the same rule that says it's impossible to create new content as fast as gamers will consume it. Exact same principle here. And it took a good long while for The Division devs to pull their head out of their ass and start actively hunting down and banning people. Bethesda is making the exact same mistake.
---
By comparison, remember what happened when people found an exploit in Diablo 3? Blizz made it immediately very clear. If you hit the exploit once or twice, said "This isn't right", and stopped, nothing happened to you. If you abused it, you got your account rolled back. So not only did you lose your exploited progress, you lost any legitimate progress you made in that time also. Meaning you could be 90% sure that if you exploit, you will *not* be allowed to profit from it. And if you abused it AND told other people (on forums, Youtube, whatever) how do to it, Blizz made an effort to track you down and ban you permanently. And it worked decently well. Not foolproof, of course, but quite well. That's the difference.
---
Based on what I saw so far, I don't think Bethesda team even has the basic tools to do individual account rollbacks, or keeps any kind of logs to help them zero down on dupers. So, in this regard, they're even worse than The Division devs were. 
---
Bottom line, I'm reasonably sure Bethesda's team is completely and utterly unprepared for what it takes to run an online game of this type, and is completely out of their depth. And that's to say nothing about the flaws in their core design.
---
For example, they stripped NPCs away, because players are the NPCs. Which is fine, in theory. So they want us to trade with each other. Problem?  No barter tools! And no communication tools, because not everyone can use voice. Also voice makes it impossible to QC the game, unlike text chat, which produces logs that can be checked and monitored. That's why it's so weird to me that you say The Division release was worse. The game came out with player hubs, global trade text chat, ability to link items into chat, which made trading really easy, a working barter system, etc., etc. It had issues, but it also had working systems already in place, which...worked. FO76 is lacking these *completely*. Right now it is literally a single player game with rudimentary multiplayer tacked on, but no systems in place to make it work. Which makes it far worse. And, I hate to say it, but reviewers agree. 
---
Yes indeed:)
---
Yeah, and sometimes it fails to drain while running. I've noticed it mostly happens on slopes (both up and down hill). In short, this game is so poorly made.
---
source??
---
Yes. The inventory management mods in previous games included a mod called KeyNuker or similar. This would group all your keys and some quest items into a "Keyring", from being scattered among Misc or somewhere else. You could then expand it out and explore the keys inside the Keyring.
---
A similar approach could be used here for the CND of similar items.
---
Imagine how those of us who pre-ordered the Collector's Edition now feel.
---
I was going to counter with the fact that in the lore horses are meant to be extinct but... well...
---
It's the hornwright executive ID card. I think you get it from the hornwright HQ, or the hornwright estate in the ash heap near the garahan HQ.
---
Maybe wait and see what the message is tomorrow about the two new patches? 
---
That's too bad and he deleted all the other comments he made sorry you can't enjoy them like I did
---
I love that he's running away. 😂
---
Almost Sovngarde...
---
I say RuneScape because there are destinations in the game that really lend itself to use these same mechanics. Whitesprings / top of the world for GE. Voting booths at various locations. Nuke Zone or raider arena for PVP. 
---
The more I think about it, the more I want them to add a the glowing sea from fallout 4 and make it function like the wilderness. With great loot and objectives to entice players in.
---
It wouldn't necessarily be 100-200 of the same type of tracked storage. I'm pretty sure the contents of your stash stay loaded in memory the whole time you're playing; they could add a new storage box that doesn't retain any memory of its contents, but instead calls a different backend when you put items into it, effectively removing that item from the server. That's pretty much how Ark handles cross-server item transfers.
---
Screws, Springs, Gears, Oil is all over the place and found in so many items. People don't setup their component view well and then they struggle.  
---
Example is Acid.. There is so much acid in the world but if you don't setup the component view properly you miss out on so much. The amount of acid one can farm from WSR is crazy.  
---
I do agree on the recipe, mods and such.
---
Your grammar is sadly lacking and made it difficult to read your post. 
---
There are still bugs like that in game, but they're much, much reduced from what they were. At its current state, it's about as buggy as a standard full release from Bethesda. Which, yeah, not great, but it's a crazy ambitious game from a very small team on a tight budget, so I'm definitely willing to cut them more slack than Bethesda. Plus, they were beta for three years because they wanted to get the AI, story, etc. right... and, by and large, they did. They may have been stretching the "don't rush things" advice a bit there, but they were transparent and communicative throughout their dev cycle, so I have a lot of respect for them.
---
And yeah, highly recommend giving it a try. It's not technically demanding - they built it in Unity specifically so it could scale to a lot of different hardware types - and it's well worth the small amount of money they charge for it. Play it single player for a proper survival horror experience, or multiplayer for a fun base building survival game with horror elements.
---
So what you are saying in a nutshell is ‘the game is easy if you cheat’
---
Thank you Capt. Obvious 
---
That's what I thought but I don't have it listed
---
Sounds like a wicked troll my friends young kid played on the Mom of a Doctor.  
---
Oh, Dad was going to get us first class seats.  They were only $20 more, but he didn't want to spend the money.
---
She was pissed and steaming the entire day.  "This is just the kind of thing he would do!!!"
---
Clearly not that well known if people are giving me Karma. 
---
Thank you!! 
---
I would add that one way to help I'd make most containers in the world either "remove" only, or limit the capacity to something like ONE pound.
---
At that point dupping becomes a painful chore, and maybe impossible.
---
psa if you have 20 of them, you can do this 20 times.
---
As I read this I came to an idea that what if the devs put a toggleable option between use every junk or just the raw materials
---
It’s a good idea imo. You’d have to make sure there was an override to put all items back into one stash incase you ‘misplace’ a stash box. 
---
Lol rekt
---
Jealous. I've been trying to get those plans. To clarify, a trick-or-treator is one of the ghouls right? Not another player?
---
The keypad will close the door shortly after it opens all the way. The only down side is the key code is randomly generated upon building it. The pressure plate I use on the inside acts as a switch that doesn't interfere with thre outside key pad. It always stays in the off position until stepped on. At that point it will turn on to open the door. Once you step off it will turn off and allow the door to be closed after it has opened all the way. This is my preferred way to doing it because you can give your key code to friends and give them access while others you rather not have inside can't get in. Also it's easy to get out, step on the pressure plate and the door opens. Step off the plate and the door closes. 
---
But giving out a shareable stash would effectively have the same effect, except you would now have 600xnumber of characters storage space.
---
i cant fathom why you guys stay in a toxic relationship with this game unless youre suffering from stockholm syndrome
---
your dedication, faith and passion for the future of this game is, genuinely, admirable, but there are much, MUCH better games to put your energy into.
---
this game was a quick cashgrab with the fallout aesthetic plastered all over it, like putting a pile of shit into a nice wrapping
---
i do hope your game will enter a playable state though, even though that should have been the case AT LAUNCH, so youre part of the problem. you all only have yourselves to blame, and i hope you guys reconsider before you preorder/purchase starfield/tes6 comin up from bethesda.
---
Game is empty compared to other Bethesda games and this the most buggy.
---
I've had that and the damned explosive vents plan drop 3 different times. That said, the Ammosmith and Super Duper perks will be the end of your ammo worries.
---
You have a wife you get to game with. Congratulations! You've hit one of life's jackpots!
---
That’s one of my screen shots and favorites too! Mine was taken at night though and my charger is sort of kneeling and looks like he’s part of it. One of the best I’ve taken so far. 
---
Almost every BSOD I've had on my PC has been due to faulty RAM. Only once was my SSD the reason for it, had to buy a new one
---
It’s like Bethesda didn’t even try to fight one, how can anyone get spammed with that sonic blast, screen shaking, impossible to see and think ‘that was a fun experience’ just annoying and pointless 
---
all these problems are solved by
---
1. Playing the game
---
2. Trading with other players
---
Are you able to lockpick and hack? Getting the turrets to attack everything makes a big difference. Waves of robots become far less of an issue.
---
Do you have a stash of broken computer cores? You can repair them at a bench in the silo and avoid having to search for those damn things. 
---
Also, having a good melee weapon helps. I use mine to save ammo and strategically bash turrets that take an interest in me.
---
I couldn't find anywhere else so I apologize if anyone else has posted this.
---
On PC, Has anyone else noticed when you log on your player experience resets to 0?  I'm not a very high level and I realized this just the other day but every time i log off whatever XP i gained during that play session disappears and is brought back to 0 for that level.  
---
No wonder I have been stuck in my 20's for so long.  I only get to play for a bit at a time so if i don't level in that session it seems I lose any progress but yet my quest data is saved.
---
Has anyone else noticed this?
---
I think only unarmed.
---
As for SBQ...the meta is a farce right now so hard to comment there.  When someone is 3-shotting her with a duped weapon and duped bobble heads, it’s hard to take anything seriously
---
Suggestions that I should hate it.
---
What you seem not to realize is that you can "defend" something in a positive way, by simply saying you saw more positives than negatives. Which is precisely what I did. I was happy to admit the game had lots of problems, but I liked it anyway. Therefore, at no point did I dismiss other people's issues. Simple.
---
No problem. Hope you get some use out of it. Even if it is just for crafting/scrapping for mods xD
---
Might be bugged, I have an electrocution type effect on enemies when I use the electrified hatchet 
---
2 nonlegendary 50 cal mg's spawn on the map for free both near grafton, I'm sure there's post with the exact locations, just fyi
---
Thanks for that info
---
There's a cave west of Vault 76 too. Only saw it once, so I don't have an exact location, but don't think it was too far. A bit north and west.
---
lol how about you sit down.
---
The problem with banning anyone with a tse weapon is the majority of people bought them. Most people are playing the game as intended. 
---
yes. we get new ones every tuesday. they are added in bulk with the major patches and then released on a slow-drip schedule every week. the items we are seeing now were finalized *at least* in early december, if not longer.
---
y'all will bitch about anything.
---
That's actually a valid point.  WV pepperoni rolls.
---
I got ripped off sure, but alt accounts are only $20 so I can't be mad at that.
---
Watoga and the Whitespring
---
I.... i might just have a picture of my wife's character in a nuka-girl costume in an inappropriate pose with the tongue of a dead snallygaster.
---
500 caps. 
---
Cranberry Juice - 2% XP bonus.  
---
Most of the very basic recipes are just filler, I agree.  They could be condensed, as you propose, to a generic heading with appropriate minor bonus to make them better than boiled water.  
---
I would still kill for a storage method to make food fun.  Better with salt just doesn't cut it.
---
It's an awful game mechanic, a bandaid that takes the place of true content.
---
Hopefully in the future there's going to be some drastic changes to this.
---
Grafton, Whitesprings, and Watoga.
---
Agreed. I'm tired of finding a three star legendary and only getting a one star item. 
---
It's decent now, I don't  know that it's AAA quality but it's still very enjoyable.  Lots of server disconnects though, but otherwise bugs aren't too bad.  I didn't finish RDR2, still on the last chapter, it just became too boring of a game.  I'll have to pick it up again someday.
---
Stfu.  Play since launch pay more. I didn't cry when I bought wolfenstein in October and it was 50% off in December. Crybabies
---
For me it was mostly comparable to the dragons in Skyrim. Very cool at first to see/fight but very annoying later on to the point I just ignored them and kept on walking. 
---
They're not that annoying once you get used to fighting them. Worst case, get a long range scorch killer weapon, and they drop pretty quickly. Two days ago I managed to snag a Two Shot 10mm, which I put a Scorch Killer receiver on, and I can drop them in about as fast as I can shoot a magazine. So all it takes is one mistake from the SB, and down it goes.
---
And the ass pain, its searing!
---
Effective in blowing you up if you aren't careful, definitely. Those Gutsys will sneak up on you...
---
Killed a lvl 95 Deathclaw in the very far north on the map.  Also crap loot.
---
Swarms scale to the  group.  I was reinstalling mainframes when someone entered the silo and everything regenerated..  luckily the other person was a high enough level to provide cover while I finished .
---
The other thing to consider.  Both times I’ve launched I’ve immediately been disconnected.  Last weeks launch I even sent invites to other high level players on the map.  DC’d 3 times before getting the “world full” error message.
---
It all worked out in the end and I ended up having a blast with a group in a nuke zone on a different server.  Just once though, I’d like to launch a nuke and enjoy the nuke zone created.
---
Watoga has two separate vendors close by one at watoga station and the other at the super duper mart both have separate cap pools. 
---
I scrapped my handmade ouo 
---
I changed to imger!
---
It's 15 on kinguin
---
I do hate them, but I love killing them. While crippling the wings doesn't always work, it does work most of the time. They really need their AI reworked because their attack pattern with the sonic pulses is all kinds of fucked up.
---
you can set component view right and still need to spend or time to walk from location to location or pay for teleport so Server Hopping is still Most Efficient 
---
I've given this some thought and 100% agree with you on #1.   My change would be:
---
2. Move Explosive to primary prefix so that two-shot cannot combine with explosive.  Also, tweek explosive to not benefit from perks or nerf it to hell so that you have to have perks to make it worthwhile. Also, make two shot not beneficial for every weapon. (Fix some of the underwhelming &amp; underused legendary to make them worthwhile) 
---
Calling RDR 2 a movie is a weak buzzword to apply  to a game that has over 100 single player hours in it. I’ve gone tens of hours without touching a story mission or seeing a cutscene, but my anecdotal experience is pointless and so is arguing about a games quality with someone who is salty and uses buzzwords from /v/  
---
i paid $60 exactly once and this gives me the right to demand that workers put in crunch-time hours even post-crunch and no one gets pto or holidays ever
---
Have you ever sorted by CND?  It sorts the items with any condition on the bottom, instead of putting items about to condition out on top.  It seems backwards that you would have items that do not have condition put over items your looking to figure out when they are going to spoil!!
---
That made me imagine a world where Amazon eventually has so much money it just buys out all the land in the Amazon rainforest
---
I don't have an oil regulator on my compressor. And, well, as far as the condensation, I just don't know, I mean, I've been doing this for years.
---
But yeah, I guess the level of moisture that comes from an air compressor may be specific to brand and model. Maybe I just got lucky.
---
Explosive weapons are not as big a deal as people think in pvp. The only advantage they have is the aoe from the explosions, which if you believe me or not if you are moving fast enough the game wont register the explosive damage. I've shot people and seen their health drop to zero (with the gray bar) but then they get all the health back immediately. Almost as if they never fixed that bug. It is extremely prominent on flying enemies, namely scorchbeasts. The game registers the full damage with the explosion added then for whatever dumbass reason reduces the damage to if the weapon didnt have the explosive effect. I've only ever seen it on enemies that are moving fast or the shot was too far away from the enemy but still registers full damage. Tse weapons are great but they arent the most reliable
---
The god damn long dog... Gives me the chills just thinking about that abomination.
---
Or the stash could be 1200 and we’d never have to worry about it 
---
This is on Xbox one s as well don't know if it's Xbox tho as my friends seem to be fine
---
These are so annoying.  Had one left as the last mob in a workshop defend wave and couldn’t kill it...
---
OKay the only things I need are a few serum recipes, a few ultracite PA mods like calibrated and internal database T60 jetpack, T60 calibrated, T45 jetpack. 
---
Yeah basically i just need PA mods now, I have all gun plans all basic armor plans and mods for both every camp plan.
---
I have two full sets of weapon % reduction armor and 1 full aid I have guns and more guns and even more guns. 
---
I think it affects weapons at least some from what I've personally noticed but I could be wrong. 
---
Just Keep grinding, I don't think Luck points have anything to do with it, I have gotten about 5 truly GOD roll drops out of probably 400+ legendary kills.
---
But, I have read, and tested the theory, with several other players, that when a Legendary enemy Mutates, and regenerates, there quality of drop improves, and our consensus is that it's true most of the time, so don't try to kill them to quickly, let them regen if they will.
---
All that said, not all will mutate, and 75% of the legendary loot I get goes to Vendors, Suitcases, Overseers Cache, Newspaper machines, and Doggy Bags, after one Whitesprings nuke I dropped all 27 items I acquired.
---
Yeah I feel the same way. I bought it for 60$ and a week later I see it for 35$ at Best Buy :/ shoulda know better I guess.
---
Yo you gonna come get this plan? I have some shit to do around the house. 
---
I've noticed a great deal of people complaining about how bad the game runs are on consoles not PC. That's just friend work friends and people on here so no idea if PC actually is more stable than consoles or not.
---
Everywhere. I have to regularly dump steel as I have on average 2500 or more
---
If by bitching you mean criticizing/expressing concerns and by anything you mean legitimate problems about the game then yes. We’re bitching about anything 
---
Do you suggest we just ignore fun content in a product we paid for? 
---
or wanting a game that doesn't crash every hour.
---
or for dupers and exploters to be perma banned like they should be
---
or for servers to actually not feel like I'm playing in the middle of siberia back in 2005 with Counter strike source...
---
None of those are hating, it's wanting a game that functions like it was meant to.
---
My explosive cryolator freezes her. Not to where she holds completely still, but she gets all iced over and slows way down. 
---
Two shot doesn’t double damage. The second projectile has base damage and is unaffected by all perks and such.
---
Only on beds considered to be “on the ground”, which seems to be most beds in the wild. 
---
In your camp, anything not on a floor piece counts as being on the ground regardless of the bed design. Sleeping mats are fine so long as you put them on a floor.
---
ah i saw that too, it seemed like some mathematicians scribbles. I am unsure of the reference though, I wonder what it is
---
I just got seem to find I am mostly looking for iron ore veins because I can make alot with super duper
---
This is the most uninformed response I could imagine
---
Twin Lakes have fixed level 50 Behemoth spawn
---
well no fucking shit they can’t recreate an entire state in the game with every location
---
Keep them flowing.
---
A sale is not a "price drop". List price is still $60.
---
I really want an handmade rifle skin...
---
I've done this multiple times solo, primary or secondary melee with a sniper rifle for turrets if I didn't have hacking skill on that character.
---
Even at level 35.
---
Take plenty of ammo make sure your weapons are fully repaired, food, water, extra stimpacks... plasma grenades.
---
It's time consuming but fun.
---
Nicely done!  You have a good grasp of internal narrative!
---
Someone telling you or suggesting you should hate something isn't an attack or something that needs defending, at most its an opinion that is different from your own and at worst its someone else being ignorant.
---
Saying you saw more positives than negatives isn't defending Bethesda its just your opinion about a product Bethesda has sold.
---
Personally I'm in the same boat, i like / love the game. What i don't like is Bethesda's customer service and broken products. People round these parts are very quick to jump on anyone that has genuine issues with a product they purchased and seem to think its acceptable the way in which Bethesda seem to be ignoring them / handling them.
---
Banning accounts would be problematic. I have a two shot explosive handmade rifle, it was given to me by a level 94 after I helped his buddy. Is it duped???  Who knows. Did I dupe it? Definitely not.....
---
No she has a totally different name. My name is tanner and once she introduced me as Tammy... “accidentally “ but who knows with that one...anyway it just stuck. 
---
She still likes to play tricks on me when I go to pick up food at a restaurant and instead of having it under her name or my name she has it under Tammy....like I said she’s a riot. 😑
---
It may take some time, but i know where you can farm them. In Watoga, go to the train station vendor, then head west along the tracks till you hit 3 stranded cars (one of them is tipped over). Inside the open cart should be a plan, for me it has always been BoS underarmor. Near there is a NAR repair yard or something like that. There can be a plan on one of the tables in the room that has the crafting station. Another location to check is the flooded train yard nearby. In the line of cars that has the power armor station is a shelf with some grenades ontop of it. The plans will spawn on one of those shelves.  
---
Hopefully this helps you or someone else in this sub. Good luck :)
---
Yeah fuck all those waiters who you should tip
---
"i don't like that they added items to the shop because it makes it seem like they're prioritizing paid content even though those items have been in the game files for literal months ahead of time and they're on a timed unlock" is not legitimate criticism my dude
---
I left the game and came back to it.  I have a lot of fun playing it, even though there are still some bug issues.  It is way better imo, now than when it was first released..rdr2 story mode is a great game but I did not like the online portion.
---
Thank you for sharing!!!! 
---
I want to prephase my response by saying: from an ethical and moral standpoint, I think duplicating is wrong, it’s hurts the community, and I made this post with the goal of finding a way of ending the issue once and for all. So know my logic does not stand to let anyone do anything at all. Nothing about my intention  suggests that. 
---
Now for the meat... from the standpoint of disciplinary action: is it the duplicators fault, or the developers fault? There are scenarios in other games, where tech savvy people have been able to exploit the game for profit, this was someone doing something outside of the game, that affected the game. To me, this is both illegal and immoral and those people deserve whatever punishment they receive.
---
Let’s be clear, if the developers built a game where all you have to do to duplicate an item is drop server and rejoin, that’s not an exploit, that’s a game with fundamental issues. To ban someone for using in game mechanics, would be a mistake, because ALOT of people have used or benefited from that. You are suggesting quite a round up. There is a better way. 
---
A regressive bonus that still stacks, 1st bobblehead is 100% second is 90% 3rd 80% and so on? 
---
Cheating ?
---
wish you good luck with a Jet Pack purchase 
---
They are a cancer on the game and no new meaningful content (pvp or pve endgame) can be delivered until they are fixed.
---
They don't want us to play it efficiently. The longer we have to play the better it is for them. 
---
Yeah, I've tried every single workaround out there to complete this quest, and it still just sits there, taunting me.
---
And when I get it, it will be all the sweeter!
---
Wear is it,
---
I put my camp somewhat between Top of the World and White Springs, that'll give you 3 within a short walking distance of each other. 
---
Efficient how? It takes time to disconnect/reconnect... I'm gonna do that to get a few scrap from a spawning Yao Guai when I can farm locations? No thanks... 
---
Yo, thanks for this. I must have just not alerted it or something because I have definitely discovered this area but didn't see the behemoth. 
---
FWIW, I was able to solo it with 1000 5.56 rounds, a few .308 rounds (not many opportunities to use my bolt-action) and a Ski Sword someone sold to a vendor that had 30% increased swing speed, 50% armor reduction, and +1 Agility.    
---
I have to agree - melee is king.  I hate that that's true, but it is.
---
Because you can’t save or load an old save. At least for now they seem content with giving debuffs.
---
Though with sleeping it’s about health restore and bonus XP.
---
There's actually 7 vendor factions with 200 caps each, so you can get 1400 per day out of them. There's [this map](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/).
---
Whitespring and the Whitespring Bunker are close and two different factions. They have a ton of vendors each. There's also a Whitespring Station vendor.
---
Watoga and Watoga Station are kinda nearby, also different factions, but the city's a death trap.
---
Quit your bellyaching.
---
Yeah thanks! She reminds me every day 😊
---
I'm just tired of fast travel taking forever sometimes, and random disconnects when I'm in the middle of an event.
---
Fixing those two problems would go a long way with me.
---
ritual binding apparel bugged please send help
---
They’re scaling to YOUR level. When there is someone at a high level, they scale to the highest leveled player. You must be the highest level player in the area
---
When I play games I want it to be rewarding. That does not necessarily mean loot, but I need to get something out of the fight. Otherwise, what's the point in playing the game at all?
---
If they were fun to fight, that would be a great reward in itself. But they are not.
---
Oh okay thanks for the info, I had no idea. 
---
There was probably high level people nearby or who had just left the area causing 5he high level spawns. You probably just got unlucky with there being no high levels
---
Not a bug or patch.  Higher level mobs spawn due to higher level players in whitesprings.  But if you are the first into the area. They spawn around your level.  
---
Get rid of the one drawback of the stupidly OP explosive guns?  Yeah, okay.
---
One of these greeted me, a wide-eyed level 21, at the gate booth the first time I approached a fresh-nuked golf club, eager to try out this legendary farming I had been hearing about. He immediately hit me all the way back to Welch and I decided to hold off on nuke zones for a while. It's still the only time I've ever seen a behemoth.
---
When the division launched I was falling through the map and wall glitching and killing end game bosses...the dps was fuckecd and server disconnects..and random stat changes and much more
---
Lots of ceramic &amp; glass jars, pre-war money, bucket loads of pens and pencils, about a dozen cameras, some costumes (including a witch hat!), toy cars and trucks, board games, couple hats, a few boxes of lightbulbs, coffee pot, 2x crossbow, paint and paintbrushes, lots of duct tape, several tool boxes. I’m sitting in my home office / hobby room. Also luggage is stored in the eaves here, no idea what is in it. And two trash cans if you want to go all can-do!
---
If you ever wonder why servers crash.
---
Dont be a douche, sheesh.
---
But you have the choice to do it that way, you don't have to.
---
You can mark the items you need, go play the game and still collect more or less what you need whilst exploring / clearing / pvp'ing.
---
Just because YT says do it this way doesn't mean you have to.
---
Scrap everything... You'll be swimming in steel.
---
here's a link to a self-help site to assist with your hair-trigger. Oops, I forgot the link bc I don't give af
---
I do but I go through it real fast
---
I don’t know, I wear heavy combat and I’m pretty sneaky. I’m able to crouch three feet away from a super mutant.
---
It's not that simple.    
---
There's no central trading area devoid of pve. Not all have a mic or headset. Many don't turn it on for their own reasons. There is no text messaging option. WoW's trading hub has been efficient and constantly busy for years.   
---
Many people who play have friends who are 1)on a much different schedule and 2) don't know anyone who does play. People are more concerned with fast leveling and farming stuff. It's quite boring to need things and take hours upon hours; which many players including myself do NOT have tons of time for. For us, doing things more efficiently is better.
---
What does the cryolator actually do?
---
I found 50 Ultracite in the Glass Cavern.  Just finished the find the Botherhood Scribe mission and found him in the Glass Cavern.  
---
While doing the mission I ran into a Scortch Beast at the second emergency broadcast location and it took a lot of ammo to take it down.  I was looking for the 3rd emergency broadcast site when I ran into another SB.  Not wanting to face it, I was running away when I stumbled on the entrance to the Glass Cavern.  Finally, shelter...  Of course it was anything but...
---
The first half wasn't too bad.  I was equipped with an Automatic Laser and was able to take out the robots with no problem.  I kept seeing dead Mirelurk Queens, Kings, etc. and robots everywhere.  But, hey, it's nothing that I haven't seen before as a level 50.  And then at the end, there is a fissure, a Scortch Beast, and all of a sudden a bunch of scortch spawns. 
---
I took the Scrotch Beast down to half health with my Super Sledge and the few remaining Stimpaks.  Just before being killed I was able to swipe two Stimpaks off of a dead Mirelurk Queen and find shelter for a breather.  I switched to my 5.56 machine gun and went to town, purely focusing on the Scortch Beast.  Killed it, and with the last of my health and bullets, took out the scortched, who were pounding on my Power Armour from all sides.
---
Finally, I could breath...  I gathered up all of the Ultacite that I could find, shored up my health, and headed for the exit.  What do I hear circling overhead of the exit shed, another %$\^%#% Scortch Beast.  I did the only thing that I could, switch to hidden mode and then sneeked through the cranberry bog around him and then by another one before making it safe and sound to the train station...  Collapsing at the train station, I immediately bought a bottle of Vodka...  (grin)
---
I've been running around in T-60 power armour and it works quite well.  I have the repair to 160% perk so it lasts a long time too.  I haven't found the XO-1 or plans for the Ultracite versions yet.  I also still need to complete the excavator power armour quest, finally have enough materials to do it.  I also haven't found very many T-60 sets.  I put mine together over a long time of exploring, even before I could use it.
---
No it really doesn't. But this type of thought is exactly why there is so many self entitled people in this world.
---
Oil is everywhere. The great thing about Fallout is you can be lazy or take the time to do it right.
---
Doesn’t the fact that you slow down to a snails pace every 20 steps get annoying.
---
I think it only makes sense that we should be able to build our own bunkers or even a smaller scale vault.
---
Instancing that wouldn't be much of a problem, and if we had the items from fallout 4 to create with, it would make it more interesting and fun!
---
You might be able to get a base close enough between a responder and raider bot, either between Flatwoods and Sutton or R&amp;G/Lewisburg.
---
Otherwise the only places with 2 vendors is Whitesprings/Watoga
---
It said kill 5 legendaries but it didn't say which ones... xD
---
Throwing knives and tomahawks are insane 😁
---
NANI?!?!?
---
What am I missing with Queens and multiplayer? Every time I kill one, there's 5 other people. It seems to me that the first person who reaches the dead body loots it. Every time I get to it, its empty. WTF?
---
The first couple times I did it solo was a slog as you describe. Now they are not an issue for me, mostly because I know exactly what I will be facing in each section of the complex. 
---
Make sure you have the 3 hacking perk cards equipped so you can hack the terminals and turn off the turrets and robobrains. You can also remove the targeting restrictions on the turrets and robobrains and have them attack the other robots, but then you don't get the xp for killing them. 
---
Here is what I take with me on a nuke run now.
---
10 nuka grenades
---
Instigating Grognak Axe (Double damage if target is at full health)
---
All Rise (Super Sledge, reduced weight, health +10)
---
Troubleshooter's Sub Machine Gun (+30% damage to robots)
---
500 rounds of .45 ammo (minimum)
---
I usually have to repair my Grognak Axe once during the run because that is the main weapon I use. All Rise is my backup melee weapon for when the Axe breaks. The sub machine gun makes quick work of the lower level robots early on. I mostly bring it just as a change of pace from the melee. The nuka grenades I mostly use when entering an area I know will have a bunch of assaultrons waiting for me. 
---
The thing that made a huge difference for me initially was hacking the terminals and turning off the turrets. That makes things a lot more pleasant.
---
A couple final tips:
---
Make sure you have a couple nuclear key cards when you enter the silo, because if you type the code in wrong, it eats your card. 
---
When you get to the point you can actually launch the nuke, go back and find a crafting station. Scrap junk etc. to make sure you are able to fast travel when you launch. First time I launched I was over encumbered and had to spend most of the countdown dumping stuff from my inventory. Got to the nuke zone just after the bomb hit so I didn't get to take a photo of my first mushroom cloud. 
---
Honestly you'd be surprised and how much stuff you can pick up just walking a few towns.  
---
People want immediate satisfaction so they buy or server hop. I had over 4k of steel in my stash until I realized how much room it was taking up and dropped 2k of it lol.
---
i’m running a crap ton of mods, including this one and other QoL ones. Not banned. 
---
This is the first time I’m hearing of this kind of problem in an MMO, why are Bethesda’s server so shite? No other MMO has this problem of having too many items causing server instability lol
---
Well lets see. It's not been that long. They have been communicating better, and are working towards keeping that problem.
---
They announced that there's going to be a Inside the Vault tomorrow before posted this.
---
Had *YOU* simply did some work and checked the twitter feed, or any other outlet they use, you would have seen that. Instead you come to reddit and bitch about bad communication, because that's way easier than being an adult. 
---
So maybe you not be the douche. 
---
Here is my idea of fixing the duping issue. Yes I agree obviously to first patch the current duping exploit then as many people and such as yourself is saying make higher end gear like weapons and armor at 100 or so with maybe more than 3 stars. Those will be the most sought after.
---
But I want to go one step further so that in the future if there is a new dupe we don’t go down this same road. And my proposition is to make ALL legendary weapons and armor that will be in the new power level be account bound. Or limited trade only with a friend for a few hours then it is account bound. Diablo has this feature on PC and heck other games like Destiny don’t even let you TRADE ANY loot. So having the high level legendary weapons and armor not be dropable or  tradable (but change it to having it be able to be scrapped or sold to vendor at high price) I think will be a good safeguard for the future. Of course I know the trading community will take a hit. But I feel like every time they “patch” the dupe exploit not even 3 HOURS later their is already a way around it. So I feel like this implement is needed.
---
You have to go to an open area to get them to land more frequently.  A road or clearing is best.  It's the worst when they spawn in the Mire, because there's so much tree canopy that they basically never land.
---
I really don't have that much trouble with them when they're flying.  Then again, I specialize in long range with 15 Per and AG, so I usually have 70+% VATS hit chance and a ton of action points.  Usually the hard part is finding where the body landed.
---
I do wish they always dropped at least a 1\* legendary guaranteed, but I've gotten pretty lucky with plans lately.  I got 1 LMG ultracite receiver and a couple ultracite armor mods.  The ultracite scrap really isn't all that exciting at end game.
---
I noticed them there last night. I tried to shoot them but nothing happened.
---
I am hopeful that their silence on this issue means they've got a solution in the works and intend to whoop some ass without warning. Well, that's the dream anyway. Raising the level cap is the most obvious solution, a lot of games have done this to "wipe the slate clean". Diablo 3 a while after the initial release is one example.
---
GENERAL
---
Favourite part - the edit! :)
---
Totally! Like I said, they gave us the mechanics to make a tactical team and play well, healers are more than necessary in many games that are similar, in this game they haven’t pushed the mechanics far enough, every enemy fights the same, and armor is generic, I hope they fix it so your healer becomes not just a secondary account! Thanks for sharing(:
---
It is basically the dragon fight in skyrim which rewarded you with a components for an armor and an dragon soul. Now we get nothing from it.
---
Both weapons will use an ultracite fusion core when modded with their respective prime receiver.
---
Oh you didn't care if they were separate cap resources? Grafton has Grafton Station and Greg in Grafton, he's unmarked in most vendor maps
---
Where there is a will there is a way . These are excuses. Every platform has messaging, everyone who plays 76 has internet. And player vending is coming soon so..
---
They aren't different at base. 
---
Change the explosive perk so that it only works for grenades and grenade launcher ammo.
---
There, fixed.
---
The bathtub is located southwest of the intersection between the railroad and the road to Camp McClintock (just off 86b).  Follow the railroad line southwest until you reach the second power transmission tower from that intersection.  Here is a [Fallout 76 Map link](https://fo76map.com?notes=566sfEKjSuh) with the approximate location.
---
Exactly. Perk loadouts (Decks) sounded like a great idea to me, until I got to that same sort of point - I have enough combat perks in Perception I can't just keep all of them and the three lockpicking perks equipped all the time. So, any time I want to pick a lock, I need to open the Pip-Boy, open the Perks screen, unequip something, equip the three Picklock perks, exit the Perks, screen, pick the lock, then pray I remember to do that entire thing in reverse to re-equip whatever combat perk(s) I'd un-equipped.
---
Decks would mitigate some of that, but it'd really only be a handful of button presses saved - I'd still need to deal with going into the Perks screen and changing things before and after every time. There definitely needs to be some sort of balancing to it, but overall, I think some sort of passive perks system would be a great addition.
---
(I actually have some ideas on that, but don't feel like going into detail right now - was typing this at work, and it's time to go! XD The TLDR of it, though, would be: limit it so the number of passive perks that could be active for the same situation is limited by your SPECIAL stat (eg, Travel Agent could just be made to cost 0, since nothing else affects fast travel, but trying to use Power Smith and Power Patcher at the same time would require a 6 in Intelligence, not 3, since their effects stack. \[The food/drink perks are especially a problem to sort out.\])
---
Have seen ghouls, and even mongrels/dogs use elevators too
---
Trading with players has been tarnished with the whole "scam" rumor that is floating around and people don't trust it.
---
it's month without content next week. guess i should just go and kill pink fat giant bat for the 100th time and get those sweet ultracite explosive vents
---
I don't know why I didn't think of that!  I'mma start doing that now!
---
You can make Watoga safe &gt;!by completing Mayor for a Day. Side benefit, you can farm legendaries and they never shoot back!&lt;
---
That’s a great idea! This keeps people from just dropping shit for people to get around the no trade thing! 
---
Saying a game is worthwhile to someone who's saying it isn't is obviously "defending it." There's absolutely nothing wrong with the phrasing there.
---
I know some people are quick to jump on anyone with issues, but I'm not one of them. And I'm pretty sure doing the exact same thing in reverse, to a stranger, isn't the best way to respond to that, anyway. I'm not a stand-in for every dismissive person you've seen. I'm someone you don't know and have no reason to think deserves some crappy bug.
---
Sorry if you're frustrated with the state of things, but I don't see that as a reason to trawl around for schadenfreude.
---
Apparently no one at Bethesda has spent any time at a gun range before.
---
Wish I could get my SO to just play games with me period. Lol
---
This was one of the main mods I used in 4. My wife gets annoyed when she watches me play and we can’t find the body. Multiple times now she’s asked why it isn’t the same as when I played 4, because it saved so much time. 
---
Oh that's the problem. So my legendary molerat and radrats a don't count. I guess I should reach for larger legendaries. I'm hunting legendary radstags now!!!
---
Absolutely. I was more so emphasizing that a product being fun with friends isn‘t or shouldn‘t be a selling point because anything, whether it be free or not, can be as much fun with said friends. 
---
I just have several suggestions.  I hope they are not repeats, but I can't say I've read the whole thread so I apologize in advance for wasting anyone's time if they are.  Thank you for reading.  
---
When shopping at a vendor, please mark plans you have already used.  The amount of caps I've wasted is sickening, and it's getting to the point where I'm going to have to start keeping a log.  
---
There's got to be a better solution for feeding/watering yourself.  Presently, popping open the menu to eat/drink happens way too often to involve so many inputs.  A happy solution for me would be a "quick eat" and "quick drink" button on the radial menu (maybe L1 and R1 while the menu is open) to quickly eat and drink.  An option to decide how the food/drink is determined would be nice (prioritize: low spoil|high weight|low food%|high food%|val) , but ultimately I'd be happy if the game just picked one method of determination and ran with it (like how healing salves getting mapped to the stimpack button works).  
---
We really need the ability to create loadouts of perk cards.  The perk card system is clearly designed for us to swap cards, but swapping out all these cards gets pretty tedious (doubly so since we can't get rid of unused cards).  I'm only in my 60s, but I can already envision myself using several builds with the cards I own *right now.*  The problem is either going to get much worse as I level, or the desire to level is going to dramatically diminish.  
---
This last one is a bit of a fantasy rather than being a "need," but here goes.  It would be pretty cool to have a high level quest that involves repairing the rail system or building some sort of train.  Once the quest was completed, fast travel would be possible to fast travel from the train stations to other train stations, using the station information terminals already present.  The fast travel fee would be reduced (say, half the cost to fast travel the normal way).  The loading screen could show an image of the train/vehicle, since the train probably wouldn't actually be present in the world for others to see (or would it?  Either way).  
---
Nuke zones.
---
Interesting, yeah definitely some kinks that could be worked around, lots of moving pieces, what would you suggest as a work around for that? Maybe make that 180 not weigh so much haha
---
They should just allow them to spawn in specific areas where they actually have landed and remove them from defending events. Had to fight two of those flying fuckers at the munitions factory and holly hell my 10mm ammo and 43 stimpaks where gone just like that. best part is that they did not land once RIP to all the ammo and stimpacks we once had 
---
You dont even need to spend time at a gun range to know the difference in the 2

When one of the robots told me to have a seat and someone would be along, I got out of my power armor and sat expecting nothing to happen.

I was Inside the glass cavern and got killed by a scorchbeast’s atomic breath flying around outside.
---
Yes, which is why I said "it had issues". But for the most part, it worked. You can glitch through both walls and floors in this game too. Easiest example, use VATS with a melee weapon. I've passed through both the walls and the floors of the walkways. As in, I am on ground floor, I jump up, VATS target the enemy a floor above me, and attack, this ports me through the grate floor and to the enemy. Pretty much how placing the mobile cover and using that to glitch the wall in police precinct in The Division worked.
---
Random stat changes are very much a thing in this game also, albeit not exactly the same way. For example, if you happen to have Herd Mentality mutation, your Barbarian and Evasive perks won't work, because they don't recognize fractions, only integers. And don't get me started on Strange in Numbers, that one fucks things up spectacularly for some builds. 
---
I mean, I could give you more examples, but you get the idea, right? I get that you're a fanboy, but please don't insult me by saying it's an uninformed response. And if you claim this game's release was better than The Division's, I think you are being overly subjective, or worse, intellectually dishonest. And as I've said, if you look at user and critic reviews, they agree. This game is considerably worse rated, and with good reason.
---
My impression was all the way from launch. I was talking about a different game with the weekly updates, I didnt really make that clear looking back at it.
---
Gamer or not, we ladies do like to nag. Haha.

Exactly, what's funny is Granny Tea + Cran Relish + Med-x gives a total of like 80% DR or something like that, since they are different sources

market76 has 15,000+ users, if johnny rly needs those gears 1 post can change that. Anyone with 76 has internet and dexterity, can google fallout 76 trading and use reddit or some other website.
---
Yeah i realized that last night.  Had like 60 recipes and plans i was carrying around.  I dumped about 15 in a suitcase that were duplicates at sutton station.
---
Why can't I run anymore? Aaaarrfjbejarghjd!!! *respawn*
---
I could not agree more
---
Absolutely! I’d love to search for weapons based on my playstyle, not build my playstyle based on my weapons... we are all playing the same way rn, because there’s only one or two rolls worth having comparatively 
---
Super mutant spots are great because they consistently drop shot guns which give a few steel when scrapped. 
---
Yeah, its been posted here a few times at least a month or more ago, but new people join all the time. I think its a good note for people that didn't know yet, like me. Karma on reddit is meaningless so who really cares.
---
the last of us

toss a grenade directly under you, i did that and it falls through the world's floor (grass, dirt, etc and not buildinhs)

Sometimes the only way to kill them is to stand still and look for the dirt clouds by your feet when come to you. Then swing or shoot and hope you 'hit' the dsmn thing.

I am a man who walks alone and when I'm walking a dark road at night, or strolling through the park when the light begins to change I sometimes feel a little strange — a little anxious when it's dark.

Fear of the dark.

I have a constant fear that something’s always near.
---
It does launch, but another player needs to destroy it (gaining wanted status). Not a very functional item, and certainly not worth the cost. :-(
---
Considering how weak the turrents are (missle aside), I don't think it would hurt too reduce the amount of budget that they  eat up. I'd like to see that in a future update.
---
I sort of think that since there's already a gold/gilded minigun that can drop in the game and it's easy for beth to just change the color, this is a test to see if guys who are big into the discords and trade subs for tse-type stuff will pay cash to skin those op weapons. Stock minigun sucks- most normal peeps aren't going to pay for this and i'm sure they know that, but the hardcore players who grind and use the op stuff might. 
---
Get the scrapper perk card (1 point) and scrap tf outta guns that drop off mobs. 8 scraps per shotty for example.
---
it's like the gaming equivalent of "AS A TAXPAYER........."

There is tons of violet flux in the ferns under the patches of trees by the prime fissure in the south east. I got like 20 in 10 mins there.

I only played for 3 hours today and was disconnected from the servers 9 times. The dupers are really getting on my nerves! I barely left my camp area today.

Not this much, this fast. I could havr saved 20 bucks if I just waited a week. Thats a rip off.

What platform do y'all play on and your respective levels?
---
Exactly!!!! We have all been affected. I’ve never duplicated, and I’ve always been role playing as an architect, I’ve built some huge bases that took me days to complete for people, and they pay me in caps or weapons. I have no way of knowing if what I have is real or not, though at this point I’m confident they are all duped because I see my weapons for sale all the time now. 
---
You're all douchebags, including you ya filthy duper.
---
TBH I think the flaw is being able to server hop in the first place.
---
Let me explain before downvotes though.
---
If, from the beginning of the game, you were kinda soft-locked to a server for a period of time (and if the servers were more than 20ish people) then there would be an obvious scarcity of things like power armour around the map, world spawn resources (can traps, plans) and basically anything else world spawn related. 
---
If they then randomized these spawns within certain zones so it's not just a set amount of time before they appear again then that would encourage exploration by players outside of just fast travelling to a couple of locations.
---
If that were the case then people wouldn't have been running around in full suits of matching power armour day 1. It would have been closer to the trailers where guys were running around in mismatched PA if they were using PA at all because of the scarcity. Probably would have seen more people actually using normal armour.
---
You wouldn't be able to just hippity hoppity between servers to find what you want, so if you see a guy walking around in his full suit of matching T51b laying down justice with a heavily modded 50cal you know he's a fucking badass. The dopamine hits would have been immense when you saw a suit of PA standing there for looting, or a plan sitting on a bench.
---
Of course, all loot would have needed a major rebalancing for that to work, and you'd probably need a guaranteed way to farm for certain mods or plans (enclave commendations, technical data trade-ins, etc) because true RNG is terrible, but it woulda been a far superior system if you ask me.
---
But I guess that doesn't suit the small dopamine hit loot casino that game devs adore.
---
I would disagree that 600 is enough space, but I like the idea of an account space.  I'm curious to see if they actually run with this one.
---
you know that if you play just one number on the roulette, you have three times better chance to win than you have a chance to find that Jet Pack at Vendor  
---
and you think it's cheating if you're bet more than once per day 
---
While this would somewhat help, it isn't the fix to the problem. All this would mean is having to be more careful with said weapons in tight quarters. When there are enemies in a hallway such as a vault will have, they tend to funnel themselves. With distance, this just makes for prime real estate for TSE users as a couple shots takes out the whole group. 
---
I asked if I missed something because I had looked online. As I responded to another comment,  (to someone who wasn't immediately triggered by my question, some who didn't go straight to rude and sarcastic) I had missed the link in the Jan 1 post (tweet?). Probably because I dont normally use Twitter and was only on there to see if Bethesda had posted any updates. 
---
I saw some posts that said they just say gibberish, so that's cool that they do have some real lines
---
its for power armor unarmed attacked and inflicts bleeding
---
&gt; And if you claim this game's release was better than The Division's, I think you are being overly subjective, or worse, intellectually dishonest. 
---
Couldn't agree more. Them saying TD's launch was worse than FO76 is the funniest thing I've read all day.  
---
I get more blue screen crashes *per day* on FO76 than I have every other game combined for the entire lifespan of my PS4. 
---
funny cuz some new players would call this lucky lmao
---
Yea I was just joking because of all the 5mm I've dumped into sbq to get multiple ultracite plans.
---
what counts as unarmed?
---
Ya I just found those 5 points better spent on Demo Expert, or stuff like Batteries Included. Besides, late game you're pretty much looking for any excuse to use up scrap, so fixing most guns becomes way less of a hassle because the parts are basically meaningless.
---
So it might be great to save on repairs early on, but it becomes mostly moot unless you only carry like 1-2 weapons at a time, because you can just swap till you hit a bench. Seems pretty overkill to double up on CND perks 🤷 but I guess it's viable
---
not sure how you'd debunk something like that.. but based my experience it seems luck plays a role. at least a small role. i have a character with 30 luck who seems to get more 2-3 star drops than my character with only 3 luck. not that I'm getting better effects tho. could just all be in my head, but i feel like luck certainly helps
---
&gt; It's an awful game mechanic, a bandaid that takes the place of true content. 
---
It's meant to force you to explore beyond the confines of the missions.  You can add a lot of content but not every location will have a story.  Some locations are just there to discover and scavenge.  
---
But yes, Fallout has always been a time suck.  That's not going to change.  
---
 reverse flame thrower
---
Yeah it all depends on your playstyle tbh 
---
I didn’t know that! I use 3rd person rarely and heavy guns even less, lol.
---
I agree with a permanent solution! don’t know exactly how the solutions works out, but I think your idea is great! Soulbound weapons would work, or limiting legendaries to trade only for other legendaries, whatever they do, it needs to be a permanent fix! 
---
Last two scorchbeasts I've fought dropped no loot to the ground. The first one must have got stuck at the top of a tree, unreachable. The second landed on top of an unreachable roof. Wasted so much ammo on fighting them both :(
---
There shouldn’t be an issue creating whatever kind of trading hub you want. What’s the downside besides lost time if nobody uses it? Do you already have a discord community to interact with? If so, start there and figure out the supply and demand consensus. 
---
Thanks for sharing. Sometimes I feel very lonely in my enjoyment of the experience of dealing with Appalachia as my character discovers it. 
---
I have no interest in min/maxing or optimization, and DEFINITELY zero interest in grinding, ever.
---
Not the best examples, some of those thing can be procured easier elsewhere. But you're not wrong.
---
There's a glaring difference between this game, and other, better designed games. I really like Elder Scrolls Online as an example. It's not a Bethesda game, but ZeniMax Online Studios game (ZOS). But both they and Bethesda are owned by ZeniMax. So if ZOS can do it, Bethesda should too. Anyway, ESO doesn't stop you from server hopping (or rather instance hopping, since every zone usually has multiple instances of itself). But what it does do is eliminate the need to do it. How?
---
Well, I'm running along on a lvl 21 character in The Divide. And I have to go into a location for a quest. I got in, and enemies are lvl 68 and absolutely annihilate me, like Mr. Gutsy Colonels. Heavily armoured, very mobile, and hit like trucks. Why are enemies lvl 68? Because some lvl 100 player ran by 10 mins ago, that's why. So I server hop, and now enemies are level appropriate. How is this handled in ESO? Better. Everything in the world is scaled to you (or rather you are scaled to max level, but this fact is hidden from you). So you're lvl 21? Go to a location, it'll have lvl 21 enemies! No problem, no need to server hop. The corollary of this is that any players of any level can group together! A lvl 21 player, and a lvl 50 player, see the same enemy as lvl 21 and lvl 50 respectively. And each player gets their own loot from the kill, and their own XP, which is level-appropriate. Unlike FO76, where if at lvl 21 I team up with a lvl 100, either I'm going to be fighting lvl 68 enemies and getting loot I can't use for 20+ levels, or the other guy is going to be fighting lvl 21 enemies, getting almost no XP from it, and loot that he can't possibly use because it's 20+ levels below him. That's a **MAJOR** design flaw.
---
You mentioned gathering materials. And yes, it too forces server hopping in this game. I go into the school to collect some plastic. But oops, someone already looted it all! What do? Server hop. How is this handled in ESO? Again, better. All world loot, not just containers, is instanced to player. Two players walk into the room, and there's a piece of bread on the table. In this game, whoever grabs it, gets it. The other gets nothing, and has to server hop to get bread. In ESO, each player takes bread. When they take it, for them it disappears (until eventually it respawns), but neither player is forced to server-hop just because someone else cleared the area 5 mins earlier.
---
Same with vendors. If a vendor sells something, he sells it. There's no need to server hop to get it. And nothing is level-gated, which is beyond idiotic. If I want to pay a high amount of coin to buy a recipe for a gun that requires lvl 30 to equip it, and I want to do this at lvl 5, **why the fuck don't you let me?!** What's the problem? Just tell me what the recipe produces, and what the level requirements are, and if I want to, let me buy it. Don't just block certain recipes because I'm not certain level. That is completely asinine. Best example is the Handmade Gun plans, which are abundant up to lvl 19, then seem to disappear, or become exceedingly rare. Also, mod buying is a good example. I see a mod. Mod says "Bladed". That's it. That's all the info it gives me. Bladed what? Bladed board? Bladed bat? Bladed dick? OK, fine, I'll buy the mod. Whoops, the game just broke it down for parts, because I tried to repair something. Now, imagine visiting the same vendor, but instead of "Bladed" it says "Plans: Bladed Board. Requires: Board (lvl 2 and higher)." Better, right? Same principle can be applied to literally every part of this game. 
---
And so on, and so forth. This game is indeed **awfully** designed, from the very core. Every single system in this game needs to be re-done, basically from scratch.
---
The power armor fist.
---
I believe they should remove the explosive effect cause honestly it is really annoying especially when people can just one shot things. Maybe replace it with 15% more damage or make enemies explode and cause area damage 
---
go to a location to accomplish something is pretty much where the similarities end
---
Man tell me how I was trying to escort the Messenger Mr. Handy and I get jumped by a mutated honey bee. Then the next wave, not one, BUT TWO SCORCHBEASTS LEVEL 50 while my level 30 ass is trying to walk the messenger. Truly an event that was not fun.
---
i have one how many caps we talking
---
I am also a huge proponent of balancing explosive weapons but wanted to keep this to a single suggestion.
---
Here's to hoping they change it... 
---
Or if you're like me it shows you how to sprint over to the quest marker, grab the thing, then sprint to the exit.  Mostly because that damn scorchbeast inside just flies through walls pooping its acid diarrhea constantly.
---
Why it cost so much? I have like 3 of that...
---
You use her reddit? 🤨
---
Some times vats helps
---
I have one, but it's pretty empty in terms of nothing is set up cause I don't want to get things all nice and fancy and have no one join and it be a waste of time. I also wanted to do this because of the whole player vending thing coming maybe soon ish lol this discord would be a way of letting other players know they are online and their stock is up or they added more to it yknow?
---
How much do you want? 
---
Springs come from junk too. A lot of different junk.  Junk is literally everywhere. Same for oil. In fact, I know how to get 20 oil in 10 seconds from one spot. Gear, screws also from junk. Some junk gives all three. I'm literally sitting on 350-500 of screws, gears and springs. And not from Yao Gaui, Grafton, deathclaw or wendigo farming and server hopping. I also have 120 ballistic fibers, aslo not from creatures, but just learning what junk gives what. 
---
I find recipes all over the world. Yesterday, i found plans for barn set and nuka quantum grenade while out looking for fusion cores, in the forest, near Flatwoods. I get plans and recipes from doing events, taking over workshops, and completing quests. Besides just finding them in the world when exploring. 
---
I learn mods from scrapping armor and weapons while doing things in the game. 
---
I get legendaries from doing things.
---
Without server hoping.
---
See, instead of reading what others say to do, I go out and I play the game, learn things, find things, kill things, do things, explore places and get all that I need. 
---
If your server hoping, you are trying to game the system.
---
Try playing the game. You'll be surprised. 
---
Why is this a problem in FO76 but not in FO4? Like what the actual fuck is wrong with Bethesda how do they manage to fuck something up that wasn’t an issue in a previous game
---
Oh you just run through to the small cavern and shoot him through the opening
---
I tried once and maybe 6-8 Gutsy's gunned me down simultaneously inside the elevator. The screen was barely loaded.
---
That might be a job for power armor.
---
They said a couple weeks ago we would get another 200lbs of stash storage this week so...
---
I agree on nearly all points of this article.
---
1. Spammed Sonic Boom
---
2. No Landing
---
3. Garbage Loot
---
The only place I differ is that I won't close the game...  The risk is too high my camp spot will be taken if when I return.
---
I would probably redo your endurance perks. I don't think limb damage is really that big of a deal to warrant maxing (just use a stimpak to cure) kinda the same with life giver? I suggest more perks like radicool, photosynthetic, sun-kissed, and ghoulish. I like these because of how helpful they can be in a nuke zone.
---
I’d love for Bethesda to shut us all
---
Up, I want so bad for them to do something that just immediately restores faith. I guess we will see! 
---
Well it’s both of ours. We share it. 
---
That's your problem.
---
You think that only way to play the game with certain items. Anything less isn't good. 
---
The game isn't the problem. 
---
Not really, circular zone, mobs run in, spawn in, kill mobs possible boss at the end, or not. Reward pops at the end. Events. Always pop on a timer, always the same location, always the same bit of story. 
---
If the blinding screech attack were just toned down so that I could actually see and shoot the fuckers without VATS it would be fine. They die really fast when they're actually being hit.
---
That is a bit of an exaggeration
---
i use a mule. i don't dupe though. my end game is just hoarding enough crap i'll  never use since that's all i can do.
---
punching things without a weapon.
---
My wife and I play too, but I'm level 106 and she is level 53. We both got the game at launch. She just spends all her time making her house look "cute".
---
*dammit woman, we had nuclear detonation less than a decade ago and you want your post apocalyptic homestead to look cute?*
---
Yep.
---
Not as a Mistress of Mystery spec :(
---
That scorchbeast just doesn't have to listen to the Voice of Set.
---
World chests for the win!
---
You found the new iteration of FO4's neverending legendary modifier
---
Just Riften? Hehe, she's everywhere.
---
I think the problem is they have all these ideas, but at the same time there's so many bugs. Seems like they're very ambitious but it's no realistic. They need to take everything a week at a time until most things get ironed out while adding small things along the way
---
The explosive should be area damage, not 7 grenades that explode on impact! Lol 
---
Yeah I found that exact spot all of them outside the map and can't be shot down. I also took a picture
---
"If everyone is Super, then no one will be!"
---
God, I love that quote
---
What about the dead radroach on a toilet with a bowler hat and cane
---
under shelves. Also you can now sort to show only items that you can build. 
---
First, I just don't think Fallout 76 is a good game, and that probably won't change for a while. It *was* released in an unacceptable condition, and I'm glad that you can recognize that. But if everyone rolls over and just goes with the mentality that it will get better, which it likely will, then games will continue to be released like this. I don't think people should be personally insulting you about anything, but honestly you're really asking for it. Your last edit just called all of the people answering you degenerates. And you know what? A lot of them are either on your side, or at least being civil. So stop making a bigger deal about it than it is please. The internet will hate what it wants, no one person controls that. Making a rant on reddit likely wasn't the best way to go about voicing your frustration.
---
i want one of these longbois for my camp!
---
Who knows.  My excavator armor gained +100 on weight every log in if I would not exit it or die during a play session.  As long as I left the server with it on, I got +100 on the next login.   Got it up to 2000 carry weight before I died in a nuke zone.   Tried to replicate it and can’t get it to do it again.
---
Just finished this solo as a level 60.  It was tough, especially since I had taken down a Scortch Beast prior, using a bunch of ammo.  But I made it through in T-60 power armour and no legendaries, just modded guns and a Super Sledge.  
---
Dead NPC human. She can spawn in most of the random encounter spots. I specifically found her in the far northern edge of the savage divide in the western side at the resource node there. I think it's lead? From the resource node walking toward the cliff about halfway is the random encounter spot. 
---
Be warned, it's a nice place to build, but that random encounter spot likes to spawn scorchbeasts about 40% of the time. 
---
If I wanted that I'd be playing darksouls or almost any soulslike game over this buggy unpolished pile.
---
Could probably sell the extras for more than a few caps
---
it's also possible to get these in game for free. I did. 
---
I agree, I think legendary weapons should improve upon certain play styles and builds not the other way around where we are building based on one weapon no matter type of weapon just that it is a TSE.
---
BTW hope you enjoyed you trip to Utah - I live up here in Park City =)
---
I'd also like XP and loot to be more support character friendly. If I'm support, hanging back and healing and buffing the team I should get some XP and loot from their kills.
---
Melee kills them sometimes
---
Can u please send me and my clan a screenshot? We are still not able to find them.
---
Thank u so much
---
if it’s just caps 2500 but i’m looking for an x01 and t60 jet pack, and 2 x01 calibrated shocks. if you have any of those or anything else i might want then i’ll give it to you for free 
---
I feel more ripped off by the lack of quality than any price drops.
---
REMOVE THE STUPID MAGICAL LEGENDARY EFFECTS ALTOGETHER.
---
This isn't Elder Scrolls.
---
Mothership Zeta 2.0!
---
The problem with patching dupe exploits is that there isn't really a coding issue allowing them (nothing to patch).  The issue is server communication right now.  Until they shore up the server communication between their servers and our clients, people will be able to exploit to their hearts content.  Given my rate of 1 disconnect per hour playing honestly, I'd say there is a ways to go.  While your "mule" idea is interesting, I worry it can be overcome.  The dupers would just find a way to not need to move (some already have done so).  Many aren't duping the junk they build to enable duping.  They're just duping valuable goods.
---
I just think jumping servers is exploiting how they intended the game to work. If server hopping was intended, then they would allow all items to be bought from a central vendor.
---
I would prefer all items to be available, but randomly dispersed between all 20+ vendors which will make you visit them all to find the item you want. Then set prices for everything, so that mega rare items like the jet pack is set at  50,000 caps, which would make people do trading more often for ammo and junk etc. to get the caps required for the item. Everything should have a price rather than just a RNG which allows exploiting the server hop thing to reset timers or change the vendor item list
---
I found the plans in the ruined trainyard west of Watoga. It was in one of the train cars I believe. Try looking there. 
---
You can find hot dogs here and there in the environment, and just eat them as regular food.  There's a daily quest at Camden Park that requires you to play carnival games for prize tokens.  I always seem to get it if I choose to pay less caps for fast traveling on my vendoring circuit and go to Summerville Station in the Ash Heap.
---
 sad truth, to buy one mr fuzzy costume you have to repeat one daily quests 148  times 
---
I wouldn't mind being able to shoot throwing knives.
---
Agreed. I'm level 46 and I have only fought them twice. Once was at level 30 with the help of super mutants. But now I avoid them if possible and if not I will instantly quit the game and jump on a new server without any regret or thought. Not worth the annoyance.
---
Sorry looking for those as well :D 
---
2,5k it is. Add me: Aermarine 
---
FO3 is Oblivion with guns - Everyone (2004)
---
/eyeroll
---
Sure. Ok, You are being so honest. 
---
They also are not challenging.  Even at 40.  Just don't some PA and chip them to death with guns or melee when they land.  No strategy at all.  Even less so if you have the perk that auto stims you at low health.
---
It's a giant waste of resources and time in a game that is already a giant waste of resource and time.  If Bethesda had honestly thought of that, it would be the greatest piece of art in games since Braid.  But they didn't lan on a self aware joke on how bad the game is.
---
And before the fan boys start whining, yes, this game is bad.  It is poorly designed, optimized and executed.  It's the definition of a bad AAA game.  It's okay that you like it, cause I do to.  But it is definitely a bad game and people should acknowledge that and start holding Bethesda accountable.
---
I got mine from a supply drop in the forest. You could try spamming them to get it?
---
Scrap Everything and Place Everywhere were required mods for FO4.
---
I kind of want something that looks like a donation box. Bonus points if you put it in a maze.
---
They already have that I think. It's a holotape that costs almost 1000 caps. When I looked up what it does it tells you what silos have been used if I remember correctly.
---
Appreciate that, thank you, I'm considering more of these.
---
What are these plans for ?
---
To quote Warframe "if everyone is over powered, then no one is" 
---
To start it looks good. Endurance perks are a little meh but huge deal. Once you find a bloodied weapon and unyielding armor I would start respecting for things like nerd rage, serendipity and radicool
---
The nuclear silo holotape tells you the current status of all 3 silos so I don't think number 1 is necessary. The rest is good though, especially number 2.
---
There's only one display case. If you don't see it maybe you mistook what plans you have. Also remember to scroll left and right to see varients. 
---
Lets say you find the X-01 jetpack on a vendor at level 47, its better to wait to make your level 50 set and apply it to that. In the mean time, it get accidentally scrapped cause you made 1 too many bullets.
---
AHH that explains the 400+ carry weight I had yesterday. I was wondering where that came from. 
---
It’s next to the storage tab I believe. It was at the far right end side of the menus if I recall. 
---
Ah, thank you!! Corrected it. Appreciate it!
---
Why are you so triggered right now? Your freaking a bit out cause I asked a question. 
---
Damage isn’t horrible, but the hit detection is really garbage. 
---
Cap each, will trade also though 
---
You can just download it but you have to in the launcher click down on the &gt;&gt; at the top of the games bar to see more games then find them
---
It's still concerning that after all this time, they're still late on getting out the details.  I was really hoping this would be the month they got their act together.  I hope the "details" in the article are worth the wait.  Given past articles, I'm not convinced they will be.
---
What further info do you need? Open Bethesda launcher, download the games, play them. 
---
I’ve seen the vertibots come to pick up a cargobot from there before - it’s def their spawn point. :)
---
Thank you very much! 
---
You can access the games via the launcher. 
---
Thank you very much!
---
To be honest, it basically looks like an advertisement even knowing what to look for.
---
I contacted support. You can use the Bethesda.net launcher to download and install them and play them for free.
---
1 spoiled meat
---
Use nuka grenades the damage is in a bubble so it hits even underground. 
---
In general yes. The lighter the armor the easier it is to sneak, that is not including mods or effects.
---
With mods. Shadowed + Ultra-light and muffled work best to increasing your stealth potential.
---
When it comes to legendary effects. There is a effect that increases your ability to not be "sensed" in stealth, which when applied to any armor helps greatly. Weightless is another that helps as it further reduces the weight of your armor reducing the "noise" your character makes.
---
Tie ALL of those together mixed with a fair amount of AGI {which also increases your stealth}, you're almost invisible. Save for the random mob that spots you cause of server latency or something like that.
---
&gt; Priority #2: raise the loot cap to 100
---
Nooo. Do not propose power creeping out of this problem. This creates a ton of extra rebalancing required for every other aspect of the game. Queen dead in 30 seconds, players missing out on tagging mobs, every other event and current challenge completely trivialized.
---
On top of this, dupers don't just have the guns - they have profited immensely in caps and other resources. If left untouched they will still be the first to acquire the new best gear through trade.
---
Any way you slice it some repercussion has to be leveled at the dupers and those who have benefited indirectly from duping.
---
If Bethesda can identify which accounts actively is duplication exploits, ban them. For those that did not actively exploit but have unrealistic quantities of items, remove said items.
---
Also, nerf two-shot + explosive. Both affixes are leagues ahead of all others individually and are completely broken in combination.
---
Have you been tracking your actual ammo? Tried removing all ammo from your inventory?
---
Coming back to this for farming information, thanks. I agree server hopping shouldn't be required and really it's an exploit in itself. I farmed over 200 Mothman Eggs yesterday, shouldn't be a thing
---
Can you throw in a spoiled veggie?
---
This would be wonderful for solo players.
---
PC only?  Im on ps4
---
**By leaving the location and waiting for the event to respawn as "Retake Munitions Factory" will resolve this issue**
---
is that the one that's being filmed? can't remember where it was but there's a teddy bear looking through a camera at another bear holding a knife. and behind the camera is the director bear with his hat and glasses sitting on a stool. like a little teddy bear cooking show
---
Thanks!!
---
Guns with Limb crippling effect will force them to land, also I find if you can take cover from their sonic attack, they will commonly land to try other attacks, and that's when I introduce them to my Awesome Shotgun.
---
Oh also just leave let it be overrun come back and kill whatever new spawned. Nuka is the the safer bet though make sure to also have on grenadier 
---
You poor thing... just kidding I have come to accept atm that most of the event give a lot of garbage but there are gems in the rough if you know what your looking for. I honestly find some of the rarest plans from these events. They can be as beneficial as forbidden knowledge items in bos quest. People just dont know about them or the ones that do dont openly speak of these thing to keep them ultra rare. I know I dont speak on it often.
---
I have for sure the right plans, if u can screenshot it would be great
---
It was actually a meme before the latest E3. He was referencing the joke by saying “Sometimes it just didn’t work.” 
---
I lost an X-01 jet pack this way and it hadn’t been used straight away because I didn’t realise you need 5 x stable violet flux. Which I didn’t have. To add insult to injury, I was lucky enough to find another one the following morning and also lost that one as I was unaware why the first one had been lost.  D’OH!
---
Who said you cant have both? There has been an explosive quad double laser gatling floating around with 2000 shots a core
---
I just want like a dozen different varieties with different tactics and powers. Mods will do it if they don't.
---
Wish there was more rewarding ways of receiving items - for now I'll go hunt the Queen for those elusive plans only she drops but yeah, playing the game in the end becomes a grind is no less dull and boring unfortunately.
---
They already have that tools, if you try to drop PA parts with ATOM shop paints, a warning pops saying that it will be destroyed. And if you open a trade menu, those items doesnt show.
---
Nah, not split. Just put in additional containers. Each of which can be labeled, so you know what's in it from just looking at it.
---
Elder Scrolls Online did this beautifully. Every character on the account has their own inventory. Every character on the server (there's 2, North American and European servers) also shares the same bank. Meaning, if my character A is melee, and my characted B is ranged, my character A could dump all his ammo into the bank, and my character B could pull it out and use it. Unlike in this game, where you need someone to hold the ammo for you while you character hop. Each character has their own house (thing C.A.M.P.), and inside the camp they can place many containers, which are separate from both your inventory and your shared bank space. These containers can even be labeled, so you can have a box called "Outfits", and that's where you store all your outfits. You can earn more boxes (via completing dungeons, challenges, etc), or buy them. And they are completely insulated, so if you want access, you physically go to the box, open it, and pull stuff out.
---
Really beautiful and elegant system. 
---
That’s actually one of the best and easiest ideas I’ve found on the Internet hahaha thanks man I have like 120 of these air drop holos, need to try that out but I’m going to sleep right now
---
That's not being triggered. 
---
That's just being tired of dealing with people that have an excuse. 
---
Everyone else saw the posts. But when you looked, there just wasn't anything there. 
---
/sigh. 
---
A bunch of legendaries didn't work for me when I was doing the officer quest for the Enclave.
---
Like what?
---
Do Uranium Fever event in Blackwater Mine.  Loot ALL the corpses, there's a work bench on the way out of the event room.  Scrap all the weapons, learn mods and get tons of steel.
---
i have also encountered it, i missed the fist part of the dialog when i recorded it but i got the part when he gives it to me and tells me he got shot. you can watch it if you check out my xbox account and see my clips my user name is ProvenEnd35. Also i found it just outside of whitesprings resort
---
there is a place, I'm hesitant to say it.  It starts with an H and ends with a 3 and it might be in the south.   There are iron and lead veins in significant quantity, such that acid will become your most prized commodity.
---
Yeah, I can understand that.  However, unless you're willing to keep heavy ionized meat, radiation fluids and glowing mass in your stash, you need to have some enemies to kill to stabilize the flux.  I killed maybe 10 enemies at the munitions blast and only landed one glowing mass, so I could only make 1 flux.  Fissure prime has a good variety of all kinds of flux aside from fluorescent (which WS is crawling with, so it's no big deal) and plenty of enemies to kill for materials, so it seems like the best of both worlds.  If there was a chem bench in the blast zone, it would be perfect.
---
The games were never released for PS4 so yes, you would need to download the bethesda launcher on a pc, sign into your account, download them, and play them on the PC. 
---
Interesting, does that mean the rare vendor bot responder spawns there as well? I found a random friendly eyebot on Cranberry Bog and wonder if that was a spot for the vendor as well
---
Wrong sub 
---
Yes It is literally infinite, I ran it down to 0 reloaded and boom 99/999  that is with me dropping all ammo on the ground. 
---
So I have a instigating explosive double barrel shitty that never needs to be reloaded and can never run out. 
---
I got that all once and thought about how good of a stew I could make.
---
Stop being a little brat and do what your parents say.
---
This reminds me of a heartbreaking post back in FO4 Reddit, where a player father rebuilt Sanctuary with a nursery and playroom filled with toy cars, rockets, bears, and blocks, for when he reached Shaun.  When he finally found Shaun, he couldn't bear to look at the area anymore, so he blocked it all up with concrete and brick like a tomb.  :-(
---
Yeah they do 
---
The Tesla is a rifle for damage considerations. The crafting sections are honestly kind of wacky- several weapons don’t fit in any neat category. Gauss is an energy weapon (in crafting and affected by Grounded mutation) that deals ballistic damage (and I’m not sure if it’s ammo falls under Batteries Included or the Ballistics weight reduction perk). 
---
No welfare legendary gear
---
And why have I not figured out how to display things in my display case? I don’t think I’m that incompetent, but shit work.
---
Learn not to call your mom that, ever. 
---
I paid full price for PC and Xbox, and I'm completely fine with it 👍
---
Guns is my main source. You get 4-6 steel each
---
Haha!  I thought that too but I found out the other night you can even hide in tents but you have to go to the very back corner - seems to work in all small "buildings too"
---
ahahahha 
---
https://youtu.be/JuKX7MvQYcc it's worth hearing at least once lol 
---
The first time through ... When you know ... I stopped going to that house all together.
---
Good for your dad
---
Oh shittt. I was thinking you would need some kind of verification to access the games. Thank you. 
---
You just described a split container system.
---
Oh I built the club to attract anyone who wants to fight. I like it when people come in peace to make a civilised challenge and also really like it when they come to break things lol either way, I get to duel with them / attack them freely if they get a bounty. The place is meant to provoke pvp in any way which is exactly what I want. Absolutely anyone is welcome. 
---
When someone issues a civil challenge by messaging me, I'll let them know explosive weapons suck, and in 90% of cases they seem very happy to switch to something else happily as they agree the combat is infinitely better if both sides stay away from them. 
---
When someone is super keen to use nothing else but their most OP explosive one-hit bloody bloodies (people that lack ability most of the time), its still OK. I ignore them at first, hope they get violent, as soon as they get a bounty, I have  an awesome chance at ruining them.

This is the problem. Because they have an explosive bullshit gun, the only way to play against them is to wait until they have a bounty (which is quite easy, especially with some "light" provocation lol), then to nail them with my most powerful moves. The fight is over within less than a second whichever way it goes. IMO, that's a very flawed, restrictive, and very repetitive system, that seems relatively easy to fix. 
---
As I said before. Anyone that fights without these weapons is a much more varied and interesting match up. Every other weapon in the game has a weakness, some kind of flaw. The reason the OP weapons ruin PvP is because they are bloody close to perfect in every way, which makes every other weapon redundant. Take them away and the rest of the tools in the game seem to be more balanced. Maybe not perfect, but much more balanced than things are now. 
---
The most fascinating fights I have are with people who don't have these OP monstrosity's at all. Even if they use super melee builds with one-hit capability, they are still extremely vulnerable, and fights can be like a game of chess for many seconds or even minutes. That's real, enjoyable. attractive PvP gameplay with longevity, and its there in the game waiting for us! The only thing in the way is the existence and now widespread use of these explosive round guns that have the ability to make even a 5 year old, at level 5, pretty much unbeatable. Its just point and click to win instantly. 
---
All explosives are beastly, but then they come with massive risk as most lack range, can't be used in close combat and take a lot of skill to pull -off consistently. People using fat man shots in PvP is actually really rare, even if they don't have an OP explosive round weapon. The shells are too valuable and the machine is perhaps too clumsy, heavy, slow AF. 
---
I haven't come across anyone else that is unbeatable. The only unbeatable players are those that use these childish, overly perfect for every situation, explosive round Titan guns. Every other way of playing seems to take practice / has major weaknesses = better balance. 
---
I know its a tall ask for a game developer to make a bit of a u-turn and remove one type of item that seem to be drowning the game like a ball and chain, but I and anyone else who hates the current domination of the OP guns that require no skill whatsoever, can dream about their demise. 
---
Tired of people ranting and want to blow something up with your Big-DICK gun? Then check out my bio, come on down to The Combat Zone I've built and let off some steam! 
---
I'll be here to .... Welcome you... :)
---
I'm not making excuses because I dont have anything I have to explain to you. You didn't need to "deal" with me at all. You CHOSE to comment and be sarcastic and rude. You dont have have to believe me I dont give a crap. 
---
Yes yes it's "dupers fault" I've seen the screenshots and youtube videos that guide you how to do it and I'd love to see them banned from internet for life.
---
However, old saying goes: don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
Assholes. Assholes never change.
---
However, Bethesda could change their game.
---
Might be a random encounter hotspot like fo4 had.
---
Poor accuracy, in my experience. As in, it feels half the shots miss. And I'm not talking about VATS being wonky, where you have a ghoul in your face, you put both barrels of your shotgun in his mouth, VATS says 95% chance to hit and you still miss. That happens too, but it still misses beyond that, even with iron sights. Some kind of bug with the projectile, I think. 
---
Lmao go back to your incel nest, you dont like the game, you dont play the game, all your here to do is attempt to troll. Take your own advice, get a life and move on.
---
You have been judged and found wanting. And hair trigger, thats all you buddy ;) enjoy your salty tears, piss jugs, and cum covered sweat pants.
---
We need a sonic Gatling!   See how long it takes till they start complaining about us.
---
Say that to my furious handmade. Just because RNG hasn't smiled upon you, doesn't make it untrue.
---
how tf is that funny?
---
This probably says something about you as a person.
---
Made the mixed stew once after running the Glassed Caverns.  Hecka lotta bonus right there.
---
Don't lie, you don't have friends
---
Also a shotgun with the enforcer perk makes scorched beasts cripple fast and land for you to take out with melee. I would drop the rifle perks for that.
---
Where did I say to ban everyone using a tse weapon?
---
So wearing full trappers gear with deep pocketed might not be the best for a stealth character? Thanks!
---
Yeah you'll run into him in weird places. Usually found in or around Charleston the most.
---
Simply go through every single option till you find it. If you learned the plans, unless you got bugged, it should be there.
---
Why is it so hard to do this for yourself?
---
If all he did was bust your ass you are lucky I'd have been picking up my teeth if I had ever called my mom that. Hell, kid that woman made you wrecked her vagina to bring you into this world and asked you to clean up the house she pays for. I'd worry about your parents not your punk ass friends they will come and go you only get one set of parents.
---
No I play game to collect certain items  
---
and this is obviously worst collecting system 
---
after 170 levels there are not many things that I miss 
---
yes  I have no recipe for handmade rifle  because I passed 45 lvl and can not buy it anymore 
---
enjoy the game without problems 
---
Yup but also put some level 80 ghouls and scorched for high levels it would be amazing also they would give just a bit more xp then late game content would be more fun imo
---
Glad to help. Good luck!
---
I've never hopped for such small amounts per hop.
---
Camp mcinlock, one hop nets me 60 springs.
---
Sugar grove, one hop nets me 30-40 screws and another 20 springs.
---
Agreed 
---
I'll give it away... but dont tell anyone...
---
Big bend tunnel. Easiest, quickest steel farm ever.
---
But that's between us. Right?
---
If it's real it's funny because you spoke to your mum like that and got what you deserved if it isnt real it's still funny your trying to get attention 
---
Yeah, same.  I never said don't use the mod.  I love Better Inventory, Perk Loadout Manager, Glowing Items, etc.  Just feel like since it's Bethesda, a small disclaimer can't hurt.
---
So, power armor doesn’t inherently give you any bonus carry weight. What it does do is set you to a minimum strength of 10 (or 11? I forget) which gives you more carry weight based on the difference from your base strength.
---
Excavator armor has a “bonus” 100 extra carry weight beyond that when you have the full set equipped.
---
Then you can put motion assist servos on the chest to gain +2 str (above your normal/PA minimum), and if you can find them, calibrated shocks add +50 per leg. 
---
The bonus 100 from Excavator is currently bugged to double its value if you’re wearing it when you log in, but it goes away once you exit and reenter the armor. As far as I know other armors do not do that.
---
You’re clearly a mouthy little punk. You got off easy, in my opinion. 
---
Why do you keep responding to someone who your never going to change their mind? You seem to need to prove what I think isn't true, even when you say you don't give a crap.
---
Responding means you give a crap. Otherwise, you'd just ignore me.
---
Sort by weight not good enough for every type of item in your inventory?  /s
---
Seriously tho, I agree, please add some more functionality to the inventory!
---
Learn some manners. Dont cuss at your mother. 
---
Whether or not your fathers action was the right thing. It happened. 
---
Life is about eating shit. This is a taste of adulthood. Eat shit. Move on. Theres nothing you can do. 
---
It was a feature in FO3 I believe. Don’t know why they dropped it for 4 and 76
---
You're gonna feel awful about all the times you hurt your mother later in life, that goes for most people. Maybe not awful, depends on your definition of awful. But you'll think about it when you think of her, and you'll wish you hadn't
---
Elder scrolls team? Yeah, this screams bullshit to me. 
---
r/lostredditors
---
I agree with the OP. 2000 stash space would be great, but I would prefer an easy way to transfer to my alts first.
---
In a not tldr version did they're fallout accounts get banned or youtube?
---
Wendigo cave and Lucky Hole mine are definitely the two of the most amazing locations in the game.  The monorail elevator is probably the most spectacular view in the game.
---
If they're easy to kill and require no strategy at all, I don't see the complaint in them not automatically giving good gear every time. 
---
It's like they've never made a multiplayer game before.
---
Take screenshot or vid, post online, post link to this forum? :P
---
Oh! I thought it was from the Watoga high school event. Thank you for the clarification.
---
 Technical data is a quest item used to initiate and complete the repeatable quest [Forbidden Knowledge](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Forbidden_Knowledge_(Fallout_76)). The holotape [Preservation of technology](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Preservation_of_technology) describes the need to collect technical data and deposit it into a secure location in the basement of [Camp Venture](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Camp_Venture). 
---
I love how the caves are similar to 3 and new vegas in design but also have the new engine beauty. The caves in 76 felt more natural. Way more than 4.
---
I've done it three times, and I still have the quest in my list.  Id doesn't seem to want to go away.  I hate clowns.  I don't want to dress like one.
---
Some guy on youtube made a cave base and made some recommendations for smaller caves, do a search. The one he chose he didn't look appealing and was at the top of the map.
---
‘’Twas a joke my friend.  
---
I’m sure you helped a lot of people and I personally find new things I didn’t know daily.  Your post is eleventy quadrillion times better than the majority of posts here. 
---
Tone doesn’t come across well on reddit.  
---
"Increasing melee damage to stay in line with the explosive two-shot weapons..." /s
---
No keep the rifles. You have some perks you don’t really need. Just get enforcer and you’re good
---
Take the punishment like  A 'man' and dont be a dumbass 
---
I know I shouldn't have called her that but he was wrong to beat me in front of my friends plus I'm 14. im too old to get whooped.
---
If you bought the "display case" plans at Whitespring, they don't actually let you build anything, unfortunately. The clean white display case thing is actually under a plan called "Bookshelf." I have no idea if the wood and glass display cases you find in the world exist for camps yet or not.
---
Yeah could work, the way warframe does it is you'll get stronger and stronger enemies as long as missions go on. So maybe they could blast zones progressively more difficult until it goes away. Probably show what lvl range of enemies it's spawning on the map.
---
 Are you? I've never had an issue with a molerat even with them being higher level. Know the weak points. Super mutants and protectrons are easy to kill if you take it their legs for example. 
---
Molerats? Headshot or bring a shotgun. I did the entire enclave quest solo starting at level 8. That's right, I fought two level 25 deathclaws, one legendary at level 8 to start that quest. Molerats are the backstreet boys of Fallout...
---
They could just trace IP's and tie those to the accounts. Then look into their inventory and know whats up. Ban both account main and mule and move on.
---
In no way is it okay to leave all this mess in the game now. 
---
People either need to learn to be okay with TSE's being removed for now and rebalanced, resetting all accounts back to zero or executing a huge ban wave. The later being the hardest and most man power involved.
---
I'd gladly do it to have a better game. One with an economy that can actually be built without duped items, where players are willing to help one another again.
---
Because I'm not a child. I can not care if someone is being a jerk and still respond and tell them they are being a jerk. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.
---
Its funny you chose this as the reason when its just the game mechanics.
---
it is, that's what I'm talking about. so is cavalier's. the problem is that the effect relies on the server, so sometimes it triggers too late. kinda like the explosive bug, but in reverse.
---
explosives are hardly the only op prefix.
---
Me too. 5+ hour sessions with no dcs or crashes.
---
Been that way since the last patch
---
What's better is she even brought it up, either in a letter back to him or just a general address saying that it wasn't up to her but she understands the problem with it, it frustrated her too but she was just the actress
---
If it got some fucking durability buffs i would use it exclusively. It's so good. But yeah, a handmade with explosive anti-armor would be pretty sick!
---
You are a bitch and hopefully you will grow out of being a bitch but we all relapse and all need correcting. Be thankful your dad whoops your ass instead of molesting it. Be thankful you receive whoopings instead of losing your job. Be thankful you receive whoopings instead of AIDS. Be thankful that you are just 14 and have a healthy life and don't have to worry about shit right now.
---
Except Quad/Double doesn't work properly on Cores ammo weapons, sadly. And the only reason to not have both is putting the points elsewhere lol
---
You said "we need to be able to split our stash into different containers", which can be interpreted in a few ways. Which is why I said "not split. just put in additional containers". Split is not a good word to describe this. Separate, maybe, "split" implies you take a whole, and separate it into pieces. What I was suggesting leave the current system as it is (it works, sort of, let it be) and put in an additional, insulated system. Not split. Augment. 
---
I chatted to support about their game having a memory leak after digging through the Event Viewer to see the logs of all of my game freezes and they still blamed my hardware. They personally don't give a shit and won't pass along serious problems with their games unless it's something they can actually mentally fathom.
---
\&gt;elder scrolls online team
---
lmao what
---
Nuka grape with cola nut perk removes 1200 rads
---
It won't be patch notes. Those come after patches
---
Same, except I killed Graham. I went to loot the body and thought, "why does this super mutant have a name?" I looked him up on the internet, and for a while I was worried he wouldn't spawn for me anymore.
---
Ok. It may be better to wait and see what player vending means before trying to set up a Discord hub dedicated to it. Ideally the best system of getting notified about vendors will be in-game but I am pretty skeptical about it. In fact, I fully expect player vending to be mostly meaningless in the game but I hope to be completely wrong. 
---
But in my book, you're the jerk. 
---
You didn't look. you just came and complained. And looking over the other comments, you have a whole range of reasons why. 
---
You're still trying to convince me your stories are true. And I'm just not going to believe you. But please, continue to show my how much you don't care by responding yet again.
---
As I tell my husband, "just because it's the apocalypse it doesn't mean we can't have nice things!" 😂
---
One issue I can see from this, even level 35 TSE are still ludicrously strong, a level 50 TSE might not be "the best" but it still oneshots basically everything, and if we say that armour gets stronger too, it just makes anything not TSE comparatively too weak.
---
Nothing should be guaranteed.
---
 there are two trick or treater random events the other one had a vampire? Saw it near pumpkin house. 
---
Really I use that for aluminium never saw much steel 
---
That's not how double works. And the game designers are the ones who decided the whole tier system, so they're the ones who made it mutually exclusive lol. Plus, double would only push it to 1000 shots, and is glitched currently to not work anyway (the display can't go above 500)
---
No, you are never to old to be taught manners. And clearly you still haven’t learned because you ‘seem’ to be more worried about the children you will forget in a few years instead of the parents who raised you and provide for you.
---
Neon signs
---
Not only that, but the junk you need to repair your gear. It's a flying resource sink.
---
Neat
---
Killing them quicker doesn’t change the fact that they’re extremely poorly designed
---
Except you couldn’t build it because your CAMP doesn’t cross characters. It would have to be an account STASH box located at train stations, sort of like what SWTOR does on the fleet, which wouldn’t be bad.
---
I should be thankful my dad whooped me and my friends are going to be talking shit about it at school?
---
It has a lead deposit and is in a good spot near several landmarks.
---
Ok I read it, seems like fake news. Duping videos are still up from what I can see
---
Just so you know, every time they "patch" the dupe, another pops up. I doubt they will ever get rid of duping honestly. 
---
I thought that was regular alpha enemies rather than the event.
---
If you really have 3, not the small letters plan, then you can sell them for 4-6k each
---
It has spots for a junk extractor and a lead extractor 
---
Regarding Priority #2 , while I think the idea of increasing the item level cap is an interesting solution to devalue existing dupes, I think this solution will make legal players quit if they grinding Whitesprings for a TSE and got one legitimately.
---
Priority #3 will make legal players quit who like to go on long dungeon crawls carrying a ton.
---
Players that exploit will find a different exploit, don't let legal players get caught up in exploiter punishments.
---
I picked mine for the view.
---
I don't think it's funny for a child to be beaten with a belt. This is not discipline it's volience. 
---
No this kid should not have spoken to his mother in such a way, (OP is in not acceptable and you should apologise and never do it again) but a father doesn't teach respect by beating it into a child. He teaches fear. 
---
Kid I am sorry this happened to you if you are being beaten you should raise it with a teacher you trust at school. 
---
Hard to argue, really enjoy the game but it is often just fucking terrible.
---
No no I didn't mean it was gonna be made specifically for player vending that's soon to come, I just meant when that does come this discord would also be a means of players letting other players know that their vending/vendor thing is set up and if anyone wants to browse their wares they can join them. This discord will be a new 76bazaar or market 76 if you will.
---
i agree. i think an essential feature for the longevity of the game
---
You're full of shit.
---
Division was broken at launch and for a long time after wards.
---
Leave home, get a job, and take on the world! Quick while you're young and still know everything *lol*
---
Junk canon and a converted sentrybot to carry the ammo. 
---
Oh shit. I hope someone notices this and unbans you.
---
This is totally Bethesdas fault. People were screaming in reddit during b.e.t.a. that the usernames should not show up ingame and character names that we give to our avatars should display instead.
---
Nothing happened. Except hacking.
---
Oh wow that was a big fail. I had no ammo left for my gauss and no other weapon in my inventory. Nice one :D thanks for the weapon though. Been looking for this one forever. 
---
Iron veins will straight up give you steel.  No need to smelt it into steel
---
They got banned from Elder Scrolls Online. Doesn't say they were banned from other Bethesda games.
---
Exactly! The bloodied build gave me hope that there were other play styles, but nothing compares to a TSE demolition expert build, and it’s sad.... I want a ESO type experience where in order to beat the end game bosses, you needed a tank, a healer, a mage and a Dps. With this game everything fights the same, so only one playstyle matters, a dps... 
---
Hell yeah! Loved all the fresh snow, how long you lived in PC? Did you go to school at PCH? 
---
I've seen it fly away like it was a rubber band.
---
You are fighting a fucking dragon, how should that not be rewarding
---
If you look again you’ll see the teddy under the magnifying glass has stiches on its rear end and there are a couple spools of thread beside them.
---
While we're at it, could we get it so Ignition Cores aren't marked as a source of Nuclear Material for making Ignition Cores? I had the materials for 4 cores but was confused as to why I was stuck at 3/4, and ended at 2/4 before I figured out what was happening.
---
If you speak like that you aint to old
---
With you. Not between others discussing the same thing.
---
LMAO!!!!!

If Hitler were a 76 player
---
It's an area marker.  
---
Mine was at Radio Tower HN-B1-12 (by the plane crash).  Killed a few muts, but left one alive, ran in and grabbed out of the crate on the right (from the front door).  It has to be a weapon you 'steal' from a container, btw.
---
your not to old to get whooped if your not smart enough to behave. I'm 44 and my dad would still beat my ass if i talked to my mom like that. don't want to get beat then don't be an idiot. Your should be thankful your dad cares enough to try and beat some sense into you. 
---
I haven't bluescreened in weeks on my og ps4.
---
1. It's peacefull and quiet
---
2. Lots of water
---
3. It's my happy place
---
4. Very therapeutic ambience
---
They aren't easy to kill, they just don't offer any challenge.  They take an immense amount of resources to bring down if you aren't melee and if you are melee it takes a good amount of time to wait for them to land.
---
I don't think they need good gear either.   I think they just need to not be bullet sponges and have less spam attacks.  They aren't challenging enough to reward good items, but they use way to much time and resources to even be worth fighting.
---
Which for some reason 76 relies on SB's being a common high level for with location spawns, random encounters and workshop defense all being part of the SB spawn rotation.
---
Your feedback is one more reason for griefers to continue 
---
I found an acid supply, a killer view and a low level spawn point for me to feed on.
---
They're releasing a new inside the vault tomorrow that will provide details on the next two patches. 
---
This is one of the things that really killed my enjoyment of the game because it didn’t feel like neglect on the part of the developers, it was conscious design decisions like the “accidentally finding you” mechanic that create a really not fun gameplay feature, and as far as I know they’ve not mentioned any plans to change it. And I don’t know if the seemingly infinite sonic blast is deliberate or a bug but that just sucks all fun out of the fight - it’s not like Skyrim’s dragons where you can take cover (since scorchbeast blasts are explosive) and you can’t alternate between shielding and attacking because they never stop firing.
---
I love this game, but every time I fight a scorchbeast it really makes me reconsider.
---
Dude your friends are going to talk shit about you every single time you mess up. That's what friends do. If they are your real friends though they are going to do it to your face and it's not going to be as hurtful as you think - you're going to feel embarrassed and laugh about it. It's fine. Laugh it off. Learn something from the experience. 
---
The takeaway right now is you shouldn't be worried about how your friends are reacting, you should worry about how your mom feels right now. 
---
Pick up every gun. Theres a bench to scrap before you enter, in the middle, and after you exit.
---
I have lost dozen of bags in the waste land. Hoping a glowing mole somewhere has a really nice base camp ⛺️ built in the wastelands
---
Place your camp next to a iron deposit. Anywhere there are robots, morgan town, flat woods. If you up to it, the Grafton workshop does steel and many others, so pick a workshop and just mine it, dirt track also does it.
---
Like I said, I was expecting a comment like this.
---
I've had them land next to me while I was crouched behind a tree. Turned from hidden but it got jumped by a snally so I ran away. Best place I've fought them is Treetop. The branches really mess with their spam and they seem to get frustrated and land a lot.
---
Water and acid.
---
Ha, you had concealment not cover, BIG difference in a shootout.
---
What time have they been releasing these?
---
Good. And it is a fun fun place to look at. Lots of memes and dumps of memes and jokes and cute animal videos. Just don’t post selfies except at Christmas. It will be a great time kill and when needed can add cheer to your date
---
You did miss it lol. Its the pinned post in this sub. 
---
Whitesprings Train Station, the shops in the hotel, and the Enclave Bunker vendors are all right next to one another. 
---
I sure can! And how about some spoiled fruit to sweeten the deal?
---
And there was going to be a crossover! Oh, the opportunities lost!!!
---
What's the URL for your comic's website?
---
How much stuff is in your inventory?
---
I'd love this make seeing someone's camp interesting. Itd give people a reason do go through other people's camps other then just being a dick and breaking everything. The only thing is of its locked then they may get wanted just to open an empty safe. But I guess they were trying to steal
---
I would but I got my camp set up where I like it. Thanks for the tip tho
---
I usually catch it after the fact, but I think it's usually morning/afternoon in the US when it usually drops.
---
They have always bought items that don’t bulk. Or at least as long as I can remember ... which could be wrong.
---
The better inventory mod is amazing and will show literally you the total weight of each category (weapon, aid, junk etc), the total weight of a stack of items and will filter items to show thing like on food/cooked food/drinks etc. Make it so much easier to see which specific weight perks are actually worth using for your build.
---
Mods like this one, the perk load out manager and the in-game chat mods are also all amazing. Functions like this is what people have been asking for all along and make the game much less tedious. It's just a pity that these functions arent already built into the base game without the need for modding.
---
A lot of people also seem to confuse these QOL mods with the malicious modifications like cheat engine which do potentially result in a ban. It is relatively safe to use these QOL mods and the Fallout engine is pretty much made for modding. To install these it literally uses a text file that the game is already setup to use. Bethesda just dont guarantee they will keep working if they apply an upgrade.
---
Yawn. 
---
Needs to be serious consequences for those that have been duping and exploiting the game. Love the fix ideas but i will not be happy unless we see consequences to those that exploit.
---
Exploiters deserve no pity and are just scummy gamers.
---
Looks fishy.
---
But I do wish Bethesda would clarify a few things. Because, to date, I've not seen or heard of anyone being banned. I have a guy on my friends' list, he exploited the heck out of the trap disarm glitch back in the day, had literally tens of thousands of grenades. Reported him, several times. Nothing happened. This isn't unique to this game, I had a similar experience in WoW, where I reported a farmer bot, and left the game for several months, maybe as much as a year, logged back in, and immediately see the same bot, same name, just doing the same route through the zone, like nothing happened. But it actually made me feel all warm and fuzzy, that sense of familiar nostalgia. I wonder if he's still doing it. Doubt it, but how cool would it be if he was?
---
no problem, i only use it for cargobots anyway i’m sure you’ll get more use out of it than me, and i don’t have a single rifleman perk so it’s a pea shooter for me
---
More assumptions I have to disagree with here.  
---
Assumption #1: there is a vast number of players duping, so many that banning them all will disenfranchise a large percentage of the player base.  Really?  Where are you getting this information?    
---
Assumption #2: duplication is a "game mechanic".  By this logic any bug can be used no matter the impact to the integrity of the game and it's only the fault of the developer for not patching it.  Again, I have to disagree as no large software project the scope of this game will ever be bug free.  
---
There's a reason players sign a TOS, and that reason is so the developers can protect the integrity of the game.  Yes they should have patched this bug long ago but regardless it's not OK to dupe items.
---
Funny thing is your the little bitch
---
I suppose it's possible they're using the ESO team to investigate that stuff and take action, as it would make sense to utilize an existing team to investigate this stuff rather than create a new one specifically for 76. I do agree, though, possibly an attempt to get more 76 hate views with bullshit.
---
I put up with a lot of crashes, disconnects, etc. but this is one thing that completely ruins the game for me. My camp near Aaronholt homestead started doing this. I built my house, put all the items, everything was fine, then it started doing this thing all over the place when I move the camera everything disappears. I started removing pieces, roof, walls, items, everything and it was still doing it. Even when only the CAMP item was left, the CAMP item and some pumpkins that were growing wild are disappearing when I move the camera.
---
[https://streamable.com/jhbvi](https://streamable.com/jhbvi)
---
I want to move the CAMP and then move it back to see if it will fix itself, but that will probably cost me hundreds of caps I don't have available right now. So I hope you can please fix this.
---
Might be because it's not a mmo.
---
Its as much of a mmo as call of duty is.
---
Tell your friends you are an ass, and make sure you apologize to your mother. 14 years old is plenty old enough to know right from wrong.
---
Yes great for sniper because gauss can get a silencer.  You may find the two shot hurts VATS and aiming body may be preferable, or manually aiming.  But still awesome.  Be sure to charge the shot when you can!
---
Hello again! I bring to you [UberToast's Cliffside C.A.M.P. Retreat](https://imgur.com/a/tm6LQrE)
---
I appreciate your time and opinion. I believe my camp to be a fine example of form and function. Taming the fierce Appalachian wasteland and making it fit for civilized society again.
---
You're warranted to complain, sure.  But do you play the game more, trying to get the shiny?  If you do, the system is working.
---
A flat ground floor for me is enough.   
---
I became mad trying to build foundations down the hill! 
---
I was seeing an extra 100 pounds for a while. Never got more than that though
---
Lol if you don’t think this is an MMO you’re delusional
---
I agree 100%.. usually if I see one I start to run to the opposite direction... I’m currently level 39 “only”.. and I’m usually getting attacked by level 50 scorchbeasts. 
---
I always wonder, when  I’m going to be level 50, will they remain level50 and get less dangerous of their level cap will also increase? 
---
Any tips for me at the moment, is appreciated! 
---
You can buy gauss rifles to scrap (and maybe plans too?) in the basement white springs shop
---
You are crashing the game lol. Your inventory is the reason why.
---
Literally got Ultracite explosive vents from her every time. 
---
I didn’t know this. This should really be changed. The best part of energy weapons is the light show!
---
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose
---
Yeah, but Scorchbeasts still can’t claim the worst Sonic Boom in video games.
---
would be interesting if that was tied to the gun and not you, would sell for a pretty penny.
---
Define "broken"? Did it "have issues"? Yes, it did. I never claimed otherwise. But "broken" as in unplayable? No. It was considerably more functional and stable than this game. And...for the third time...just read the goddamn release day reviews for both games. It's very clear that The Division, despite its flaws, was in a considerably better state than this game. 
---
I'm a bit like this.  A few sessions farming PA, a few milking workshops.
---
Holy Cow, how expensive is the letters set? I got the small ones from workshops.  Are you talking about the neon glowing ones?
---
I thought it was. I was doing many of my own tests after reading it and found pretty much the same findings you did. Thanks for confirming it.
---
I wanted to fight them to down one on my own. Then I got over that and just wanted to be left alone, so I would server hop if I couldn't FT away. Now I refuse to server hop. I'm not leaving hell bat, so leave or die. Make your choice. 
---
Downed three a few days ago because they decided to surround me at that place south of the lake near thunder mountain. Pretty sure a SB nest spawned as a random location nearby, but I couldn't find it. 
---
Beginning? You mean you weren't already doing all that? 
---
Welcome to the party now you get to wait for dlcs
---
I don’t have karma listed in my barrel options either, I’ve broken down about 20 and have 3 stocks, several sights and barrel wise endangerol, radscorpion poispn, and bleedout I think but def no karma
---
Ok thanks cause i've bought exactely them.
---
Do u were able to found something similar to the display cases in fallout 4?
---
Actually, the handmade rigle is because a drum mag holds 85 rounds. 
---
I like the idea of cutting down on mules. I'm a massive hoarder and even I manage to keep everything to one account. No matter what you are doing or how you are playing, you do not need that much space. 
---
You can submit a report ticket, and if you have video proof then they may issue a temp ban
---
I can tell when they’re going to attack because it’s as soon as I repair my weapons and have more than 20 stimpaks on my person.
---
This is why we need Preston Garvey giving us endless settlements to save. 
---
That's the Messenger quest. You're supposed to escort him to his destination but it bugs out sometimes because the robot paths weirdly and can get stuck. Spontaneous death doesn't surprise me much.
---
I always get downvoted for having this opinion but I think they're designed to increase the grind of the game. This game is all about being as grindy as possible so you spend more time playing it and are more likely to buy stuff from the atom store as a result. This enemy is hard to fight and not in a fun, challenging way, just by being an absolute ammo sponge. It uses up all your ammo and stimpacks, damages your weapons and armor and leaves you nothing. Everytime you fight one you have to once again grind to recover the ammo, stimpacks and fix your broken shit to get to where you were before the scorchbeast encounter
---
Yea the first few times I noticed it, it was just 100 extra.  Last night something was rough and I got booted from servers for two hours after 5 to 10 minutes of playtime before I finally found one stable enough to play, and die.   Which reset the glitch.
---
far remote location, no defense required since not a living soul nearby, scenic location right in the middle of lategame hotspots
---
but no water and no extractors
---
You would be wrong I have 4 pieces of your impossible armor then... I can post a picture on somewhere and link it if you want. I would love to indulge you. :). God roll would have been Assassins, Sentinel and Powered. I have not come across that godlike piece. I also have a Unyielding Sentinel +1 perception chest
---
What system are you on? I have nothing to lose and will hunt him down.
---
My wife and her mom plays on PC :( im so left out on ps4
---
&gt; if you have video proof then they may issue a temp ban
---
For what?
---
I meant split. Separate.
---
Yeah I submitted a ticket, but couldn't get the gameplay.
---
The event rewards for killing the queen is a bunch of stable flux. And people die a lot after the queen does. Simply scavenging paper bags near her body and youll probably find at least 1 bag from a dead player.
---
I'm sorry for your loss &lt;3 lmao
---
You can redeploy you base instead of fixing everything. Caps instead of materials. 
---
I have not said that it is just a game or you should get over it. I just think this will encourage griefers to even extend their activities
---
[Alterations i'd make](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f649589&amp;d=c72pd0pk0pl0i12l71lu2lt2sb2s40ss2sm0se2sn0sg2a00pp2cm2a72eu0ek1ei0ir0s10a80ck0li0a12&amp;w=&amp;n=Melee/PA/Rifle)
---
* if you're worried about losing ap to fast may want to swap dodgy for escape artist and max tormentor
---
* with fix it good power armour lasts ages also if you don't use vats in PA fusion cores last ages so you usually only have to carry 3-4 for a nuke zone
---
* stimpaks are very easy to obtain after you get pharma farma and chemist (i have over 800 on my character) so even with twisted muscles limb crippling is not really an issue and is a bit of a waste for 3 points
---
if you have any other questions regarding the alterations feel free to ask
---
There is a Fatman over there too, up the mountain
---
Why dont you go back to fortnight that sounds more like a game for you 
---
I can't wait for TES6 
---
Well shit, I am XBOX.
---
What platform are you on? If it's PC, gimme your IGN and I'll drop some mats over
---
It just be like that sometimes. Sometimes you dont think it do but it be.
---
Good for you man!
---
How come you showed up so late?
---
Duping much yes?
---
Oh really? I didn't know that!
---
Right Skyrim would be way better if the dragons you killed dropped no loot and didn't give you their dragon souls
---
 man... instead of killing it I'd love to give it a gatling plasma and point that idiot at the fissure... go have fun buddy
---
Opening a door doesn't move them anywhere, an animation wouldn't play showing the dog climb the ladder because it can't. I don't think it's really the same, any NPC can open a door, but not all of them can climb a ladder.
---
Dinner date with my manniquin tonight!
---
Because then you could just unequip your cards after depositing everything, putting the stash over the limit.
---

---
Seems fishy. The people who were banned for using Reshade had letters from Bethesda, not the ESO team. 
---
Her Live name is your Redditt name?
---
LOL all is fair in the wasteland. 
---
How did you get foundations down?
---
I've done hundreds of trades of xbox and PC never once had an issue.
---
This is a good QOL change that I haven’t seen discussed yet. 
---
I had no idea this was a thing. This explains how my mods disappeared.
---
I bought the tricentennial edition.
---
Full price.
---
You know what I’d like?
---
Tricentennial skins for everything.
---
I don’t even use power armour lol
---
Find something else to play 
---
I have a resource node I like, and I'm positioned well for decent travel costs to most of the endgame areas I play in. I do have a nice view, but that was a tertiary concern.
---
You said ' they aren't challenging ' and ' require no strategy'. I'm just responding to your statement . Many people would consider ' not challenging' and ' easy ' to be interchangeable terms. My mistake in understanding your point .
---
Post apocalyptic scenario
---
Inflated prices as in any world-crysis.   
---
All joking aside, I agree w/ you
---
1. Ticks! I have ticks whenever I spawn in. My turrets kill them before everything is loaded, so I just pick up the tick blood ^^
---
2. Water
---
3. Wild crops for my herbivore needs
---
4. It's beautifull and quiet.
---
I don't know where the best spot is but I got mine from Cranberry Bog where SBQ is. The ferns under the trees give violet. The plants give crimson. Equip Green Thumb (P) first. And kill mobs to get the hardened mass to convert to stable. I had to go back because I forgot to kill anything the first time ☺
---
It’s deff worth 13 people love to hate on it, yeah it’s got issues but it’s not that bad 
---
Huh?
---
I wasn't calling everyone degenerates. It's the select 20 or so who are saying things like "I want you to feel bad about buying this game" and other things. I wasn't directing that at everyone who commented.
---
I have 3 x 3 "Rifleman" perks, meaning I'm as skilled as possible at using a rifle, such as aiming it, so I do extra damage.
---
Is that damage applied to me if I shoot at something five feet away?  Or does that not effect the Explosive damage?
---
Also, my Demolition perk increases the damage from the Explosive attribute of the rifle.  Being expert at "Demolition" would mean that you know things like where to place the explosive for maxiumum effect, like, I would aim the gun so that the bullet would go into a crack between shell sections on a Mirelurk, right?  So, it doesn't make sense that the area splash damage would hurt \*ME\* more because I have that Perk - it should hurt me less, because I "know what I'm doing", being an "expert", right?
---
And we're talking about small bullets, not "grenade" size shells.  If the  bullet went inside me, then exploded, well yeah that should fuck me up, but if it hits another monster five feet away, I don't think I should be insta-gibbed?
---
When logging out please do the lords work and commit robot genocide at whitesprings 
---
Yeah you definately play more in persuit of that cool item. I just wish you could work towards these things through fun gameplay rather than hoping to get lucky. Perhaps if those rare plans unlocked at the vendor after completing a quest line for the faction or collecting some wierd specific crafting materials or just having a huge amount of caps. They current system based on rng vendor inventories means the only realistic option to get some things is server hopping - which imo is not very fun gameplay haha. 
---
From what I understand, destructible bases by players was designed to prevent greifing, not to create a way to do it. And Bethesda has been pretty clear about being against greifing and harasment. I know it's a feature in the game, but I doubt it was intended as a way to be an ass.
---
Ok.....good point but just add a check for that when unequiping cards.  If the stash limit goes over don't allow the player to unequip until they reduce the stash!?!?
---
I picked a nice little spot near watoga that has everything. Plenty of land for farming crops, plenty of water for purifiers, free robots to defend my camp, and even an irradiated stream to farm mutations if I want to (for whatever reason all the other water is clean, only that one stream is radioactive). It's also nice to have my workbenches there; Watoga is a central place to be both for the two vendors and to rest up after a queen fight, but it only has a couple workbenches that are spread throughout different dungeons. Having them all in one place without having to fight past a bunch of mutants and scorched is great
---
Thank you.
---
Let’s hope that’s not the case. Let’s hope they do have a team dedicated to this game and troubleshooting exploitable bugs. If they didn’t already have a new team of people ready to support this game’s player base then that would speak volumes about the future of Fallout 76 and their dedication to the health of the game. Certainly what we have seen so far looks pretty grim. 
---
They're not even close. The dragons in Skyrim dropped good loot, fulfilled a gameplay mechanic being that you get dragon souls from them, would drop regularly and easily avoidable if you didn't want to fight them. The scorchbeasts are way worse designed
---
I think the slap system would indicate that's not the developers mindset
---
Phoenix and the bots. Yes,upvote.
---
Heh, when my TSE Gatling dropped from a supermutant who had attacked my base, I had shadowplay save the clip as a sort of certificate of authenticity.
---
is it really 13 pounds? I've got over 180 hours played but somehow feel ripped off...
---
The whole point is to rebuild above ground and you want to build your own vault lol.
---
Vault tec will sue you back into the industrialised age
---
Well u got me there, lol I guess what I mean is they spent time and money in the past making something, so they're definitely gonna put it into their other games
---
Ok i was just wondering because i never found some raw violet flux there. Seems like I am blind as fck 😅
---
There is a tiny spot on the rocks in the water fall/ stream that he can't seem to path to, so he runs back and forth trying to get to you instead of running away like other supers. If you are literally a few inches in any directing from that spot he'll get to you no problem. Found it by accident. Been awhile since I've been up that way though. 
---
No they just had to redo 90 percent of there game
---
I think it's definitely worth more than that, it is a fun Fallout game to play until Fallout 5 comes along. If you're looking for a sequel to Fallout 4 it is definitely not that. I paid full price and am very happy with my purchase.
---
Yeah. It’s our mashup name. Some of her name some of mine. 
---
I mean we only had one Xbox up until Christmas so we only needed one Xbox live name that we both played on but now since she wanted me to play with her we got a new Xbox so we needed a new user name and she thought she’d be funny and make it MrTammy. 
---
Don't get on the hype hate train. Most of us piss that money away on coffee in a week.
---
It's a good game.
---
I am always late :(. Ask my boss about the past year. It's one of my unredeeming qualities.
---
Thats what I think is missing. Let us use tge hide for scorch armor, carve knives or stocks out of the bones. Make tgem a resource people want to farm.
---
Well It doesn't say specifically that they got banned from TSO, it just says their account is ban 
---
Just drop an orbital strike marker, then an orbital strike beacon. Then run. Problem solved.
---
Logging on to confirm,  will update
---
I went to try a Census Violence event and when I fast traveled there, I saw a lvl 50 SB. (I'm 135) No biggie, I hate fighting these things since I am melee with a shotgun, but I'm here. 10 seconds into the fight, along comes 2 more SB, both level 80. I fought all 3, but my God what a pain in the ass. Total waste of resources for a fight that is one of the worst gaming fights I have ever experiences. I mean, I just wasted ammo blasting my shotty into the center of the sonic breath as I couldn't see a damn thing with three of them spamming that the entire time. They each landed once, but not long enough for me to down them, so I ended the fight picking away at the three as they flew around. 
---
I don’t like change. And I spent time on it and I’ve grown accustom to it. I’ve also been playing since release, and I’m only on my 3rd-4th location. Oddly enough, to this day, I’ve never seen one other person in my C.A.M.P. 
---
Think I know where your talking about will check there
---
 add white chocolate chips and sold! 
---
I found this happens sometimes if you swap from a gun while reloading 
---
(i.e. I finish firing my combat rifle while it's reloading I swap to my black powder pistol and it now has 8 round before I need to reload)
---
I found I can fix this by putting the gun in my stash, exiting my stash and going back in a grabbing it out
---
found this works with all types of guns so if you want to make a dragon that only has to reload after 100+ shots you can do this with an lmg (note this is technically exploiting a bug)
---
Well I have already built a god set up within the past 57 hours.
---
But thank you for your input!
---
It's hard to reach on foot and provides good lines of sight in all directions.  It's surrounded by a variety of resources including different plants, ore, and lumber.  It's also very close to two different locations that few people visit but which spawn a wide variety of plans, weapons, chems, and junk, as well as several radstag bodies that are nice for grilling before going out on a trip in case I later need the +20 weight bonus.  And finally it's only single digit caps to fast travel to a number of different vendors including Whitesprings -- but isn't close to the usual nuke radius.  Only downside is it spawns enemies constantly (including inside my house) but most of them are molerat/wolf types so even that is basically free food.  I didn't plan to be here permanently but it's been over a month and I haven't found any good reason to move yet.
---
Good.
---
Yep!
---
Good for you?
---
My best melee weapon is a legendary deathclaw gauntlet with bonus heavy attack dmg, extra dmg on attacks on same target, and +1 endurance. Only problem is I can’t use it with power armor on so I get shredded by turrets :(
---
Why are socialists like this
---
The website is not really updated as we were trying to see if we could pick up more of a following on Instagram so they’re all on there.  inmancomics
---
Acid. Always bulk Acid. It talks 10 to bulk, but breaks down to 15.
---
Dont white knight complainers bro. 
---
Ever accidentally scrap a floor? I have to deconstruct my fucking building to put it back. 
---
My excavator power armor never gets damaged. I noticed it when I tried to use the fix it good card to repair it to 130% but not a single piece needs to be repaired. Been using it for about two weeks now undamaged.
---
That's actually largely due to the overall loss in plastic you generate.
---
they allow you to place neon letters so you can write whatever you want
---
Whose to say the OP didn't do something?
---
&gt; and this is obviously worst collecting system
---
The game isn't a collection game. That's an aspect. As you play, you collect more options for playing. 
---
&gt; I play game to collect certain items
---
Certain items seem like saying best gear in game.
---
What are TSE?
---
Its as close as I can get to being equidistant from every vendor pool (minus the responders) that also has water. 
---
Theres a resource but I dont use it currently.
---
Typically ticks are the only thing to worry about, the turret takes care of it most of the time. On the back side I got an annoying rat problem, munchin on my crops every now and again.
---
Its permanent until I find something way better
---
Sabotage would be epic.  Have the silo implode when someone has previously sabotaged the silo.  There would be bitching and chaos but still
---
Pfft.  Please.   Not even the worst from the same company.  Some of us remember Cliff Racers.
---
If they didn’t want it to be a part of the game all they would have to do is make it free to repair when broken. Or just free to repair if broken by another player. Pretty sure it’s working as intended. They said they want tension when players encounter each other. 
---
I don't know if you're reading these... but the doors don't fit in the brick door frames. 
---
^also ^can ^we ^have ^less ^strict ^clipping ^so ^I ^can ^build ^off ^old ^houses ^thx
---
That assumes they have a system in place to (easily) trace IP's, and a system in place to detect when a player performs the bug and/or a system that checks for large stacks of certain items of value and/or a working report system.
---
At this point, best option from my POV is to nerf the TSE guns and balance the game to not revolve around having them. Make it so TSE is not the default go to gun for every occasion. Or at least make explosives less OP.
---
I present to you: Poshtectron.
---
Either that or removing the perk transfers related items above the limit into the players inventory.
---
Supposedly he was afk, but that's why the video proof helps. He could've deserved it for all I know
---
Its probably your connection or you're a packrat.
---
Those are bug culprits for dcs.
---
We play the same game on the same servers and i run the oldest ps4 revision available.  You crash 40x more often than i do......
---
Nice find 
---
yoU'rE bEiNg eNtItLeD. 
---
lmao I agree with you some free stuff to compensate their lack of quality for those prices would be nice
---
Ya just the game mechanics to have, and use 1000 bobble heads to 2-3 shot thr end game boss lol. Now that is funny. I knew this would be hilarious
---
Try to find teams and go to nuke zones to level up.  I can help you out if you are ever online . GT: Centurion EL1TE
---
That... did not help. :)
---
For sure.  That's why I cleared it up.  Sorry if it came off as stand offish.  That was not my intention.  I agree that it was not clear that I meant unrewarding as a mechanic, rather than a quick victory.
---
I'll definitely day that I've crashed during a trade but mabeh 2 times and that's cause I spam bumpers fast
---
My turrets wrecked a bush when I used to have my camp near Whitesprings on the road outside the gate near the bunker road. No clue what it wad until the meat pile showed up at the bottom of the steps. Mongrel dog meat. 
---
I tried to VATS whatever they were shooting, but it would target something in Watoga, then cancel. 
---
I guess they never miss
---
Holy shit man. Really?
---
Its a GAME.
---
I swear some people are so sensitive. The kinda people that when they get old are gonna be the curtain twitching neighbours gritting their teeth at the youngsters outside having fun 
---
"They better not trample on my daffodils"
---
Fuck off.
---
I killed may be hundred of them, could be a little more. I would make several changes:
---
1. Sonic stack shall be singular (or burst of three shots) dodgeble cone attack, which stuns you or may be even cripples like headshot. Key word: dodgeble. So far I only found one way to reliably dodge around half of the “rings”: good timing with x-01 jet pack. 
---
2. Drastically increase damage of green fog - it shall be like carpet bombing, so people are scary when a scorchbeast make a diving run on them.
---
3. Add Cryo attack like the queen has, but increase the slow effect, which reduces
---
damage dealt, reload and movement speed.
---
4. Make them predictable at landing: be it 50%HP of damage to wings (which might be hard to those who doesn’t use VATS). Chaotic element is fun, but now it is mostly frustrating.
---
5. Their Landing shall produce Nova attack which pushes you from her, gives huge spike in radiation and ignores armor.
---
This might deal with “glass canon melee” guys who like to roam wasteland with 20% hp / 80% radiation, who like to catch SB during landing animation and insta-kill her.
---
6. Drastically increase their melee damage on the ground, but slightly reduce their speed. They definitely should damage people faster than stimpack heals you.
---
Also due to strange explosive mechanics in game make them extra durable on the ground. It takes me like 20 TSE shots from gauss to kill one flying, but on the ground it takes like 3 shots.
---
7. There should be “wave” mechanic to the mobs they summon. Scorched first, then beasts harder and harder, so if you don’t kill scorchbeast fast you get overrun.
---
This one may be more suitable for Fissure sites’ scorchbeasts.
---
8. Make them roam the whole map randomly.
---
I got tired that my camp being invaded frequently by SB, while my friend one block away never suffers from anything.
---
9. Make a pity timer on them, so every next SB killed increases the chance of getting 3* legendary. Timer is dropped when we get one or ultracite mods plan. 
---
10. Make a simple counter in pip-boy to show how many I’ve anihilated. Make it a pip boy mod.
---
That would add competitive spirit to the hunt. 
---
11. Make them more frequent and harder at nuke zones. At least when Fissure is nuked. Flora spam in nuked territory is such a waste of time, when you kill everything threatening in liken couple minutes. 
---
12. If you wanna add Raid feeling - allow us to make craft-able ultrasonic  translators which attract them, so you can give it to tank and “Aggro” them - extra bit of team cooperation.
---
Currently they jump from one party member to another ending up doing almost 0 damage.
---
They should learn focus fire.
---
Here- here!
---
Never thought of this... but it is what I manually do at least a couple times a week, and I don't even play a lot.
---
If you nuke Fissure Prime for the Queen, a lot of plants in the area have violet flux 
---
It’s high up. It has a water source. Close to the middle of map and it was an accident at the time but I’ve left it where it is because it’s close to whitesprings
---
Yes. Both Watoga and Morgantown Highschool's have tons of plastic plates, trays, spoons, forks and plastic pumpkins. You'll be showering in plastic after you do a run thru.
---
If it's legit, then good start, but they have a long line of bans to dish out before they're done
---
tag it in your inventory to track the things that have plastic, but things i know are easy to get a lot of
---
golf balls, pool cues, golf clubs, laser guns, pool balls, packs of cigarettes
---
It is ok. I don't blame the dupers or people who abuse the system. Honestly I give them a thumbs up, and is the reason i don't out dupers or people who abuse the system. In my eyes its 100% on the developers of this travesty.
---
Go down to Ash and give the Charleston area a whirl. Have you done the Fire Breather quests? Matches up with the Overseer/Responders/Top of the World. Camden Park has good mid-level scorched. (1 up to 23) - lots of plastic and a power armor, too.
---
What quest lines have you done?
---
Also Bolton greens has a pool table and the balls give a bunch 
---
Agreed pelican 
---
I love my melee so much in Fallout games and i have a top tier one. But it is nothing compared to my TSE shotgun. Even without perks its base damage is more than my melee with perks. Exploiters have made it so common for TSE weapons instead of 100s of hours of legendary grinding. They are sold on mass insanely cheap.
---
Part of the reason i closed my store down was i couldn't compete with them. Selling serums under 200 caps is not worth the mats used to friggen craft them.
---
The only way to deal with a TSE greifer as well is to have one yourself otherwise say goodbye to your base. Then its a back and forth until someone is bored.
---
I don't know if this will fix it but it's worth a try. Another way to search a container is to aim a gun (not a melee weapon) at it and it'll give you the option to search the container with a different button (it's square for PS4, I assume it's X for Xbox).
---
I guess I'm just from a different Era of gaming, where the only reward for beating hard bosses or fights was a sense of accomplishment and not some snazzy reward. It's just my take on it .  I'm only lvl 30 and haven't put as many hours in as some and would be considered a casual ( as I've had the game since week one ) . I've gotten my ass randomly kicked by them maybe 2 times from not paying attention and just getting fucking nuked. They are scary as fuck and I just run the fuck away and hide when I see them. 
---
It reminds me of a part of final Fantasy....  8 or 9 the one with Zidane where there is a tunnel you have to pass through early in the game that has a ladder with a warning that says 'danger' . If you climb the ladder you get attacked by green dragons that are WAY stronger than you and just rekt you.  They serve little purpose even later in the game , except as maybe a way to get xp at end game . They just exist . 
---
I haven't.
---
That's a good point, they didn't make it free and so there was obviously some intent for it to be destroyed. Where did they say they want player tension? I've got a good idea of the devs intent with the game, and I don't remember that in any promo stuff
---
This is stupid.... Every fallout since legendary one have plasma rifles as end game weapons. Shame on Bethesda
---
From what I read here, they did catch every one of these issues and devs were begging for more time but Beth had to get it out for the holidays so they pretty much released it as is and figured the bugs would be manageable. And now they understand (i hope) the magnitude of that horrible decision. 
---
I think/know you're applying too much to the perk system. They're just perks, attributes. Some of them do change aiming, like VATS perks, but not expert perks. Expert perks are just modifiers to damage, not skill using said weapon.
---
It hit me after my 3rd time manually doing it today. Would definitely save us a lot of time. Might even reduce the complaints about stash size too.
---
I craft and sell mutation serums daily and the scaly skin serum requires coal. In my 200+ hours I've never seen coal once. I'm now setup on a coal node.
---
you got a boyfriend i bet he doesn't kiss you
---
Why? Because I want issues addressed and care enough about the game to make concerns heard so the game can get better? 
---
Or are you just using the latest trend of hating on Fortnite to try and insult me?
---
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10

Did I miss the number for resource node?

The rifle itself is all right but the damage is somewhat underwhelming...it's weaker than a combat rifle but is slower and has a much smaller clip. However, if you use the flamer barrel, it's amazing - the damage barely drops off but it gets a ridiculous clip size of 300 something and deadly DPS. Ammo is pretty rare but it's relatively easy to make. I'd say get it if you can find a mod or plan for a flamer barrel on it

Golf balls at Whitespring

crap hit detection and can heal some enemies
---
outside of the gauss rifle pretty much all energy weapons are meh
---
Better wait for the next 2-3 major patches, then you might also save another 10 Pounds
---
Watoga can be a bit rough if you’re low leveled 
---
Just tested it, and I stand corrected. It is affected by the rifle perks when in semi-auto build. All mine must have been autos.
---
I purchased at double that price and it was worth it for me.
---
Haha, I missed it the first time around, but I can easily get 70 violet flux with greenthumb on in the bog. Like the 1st comment said- check in the patches of trees. 
---
Yup prime. I come out of there with my raw then I can process 
---
Lol tell me about it.

I see.  I lost well over 4000 caps now buying the wrong recipes.   I think I am closer to losing about 100 caps per day fast traveling around trying to get to vendors.  It’s just part of the game.   Don’t worry too much about those.   Easy to get back, just have fun and take it lightly.  
---
Before level 30, I walked everywhere to save caps and explored.    Based on how it sounds, 300 might be a big deal to you and you may be lower level.   There are issues with the game, certainly.  If you are on PC, I will drop off some legendary items if that will help.  I get about 10 a day of all different levels.  Should help quite a bit with the struggle.  
---
An ex once put my name as "SnuggleMuffin". The hostess couldn't say it with a straight face -_-
---
You are utterly misunderstanding me if you think im saying most people are duping. I’m saying many people have come into contact with duplicated items. You kill a guy and he drops 100 bulk steel? Is it duped, who knows? You look in a container and find a TSE handmade, duped? Who knows. You go to a vendor and find 11 two shot explosive black powder rifles, duped? Who knows.... all of those have happened to me personally. You already know I am not speaking for the world, I’m speaking for my experiences through my lens, and my experiences tell me that I’m probably not alone. 
---
By your logic any bug being found and used because it it’s in the game is a bannable offense. Why punish someone who spent $60 on your game, because they found something without any altering of the game they purchased, and used it. Sure Bethesda could ban all these people, but luckily they are smart enough to
---
Understand that is no way to treat your fan base
---
When you deliver a product that has an abundance of other issues as it is. 
---
You are welcome to disagree, and I welcome your critique, but I am also thankful we both have no power or say in the decisions, because banning no one, and banning everyone are two pretty shitty solutions. 
---
There are a ton of ferns around Grafton. Was part of a nuke run there once just to scoop up all that violet.
---
*sigh* you need an honest to god pepperoni roll.
---
I love bacon as well 
---
Hell you should see my Tudors Biscuit World biscuit I make.
---
Point being there is a fine line between a pepperoni roll and a stromboli that has bacon in it.
---
I am a sneak sniper build so that helps 
---
If you're level 22 the Grafton area (forget the zone name) is perfect for you. I'd advise exploring forest region and Grafton region until about 30. Then move on to ash heap area. Once done with those three areas you should have enough mats, skills, and caps to tackle anything damn near. I play solo and that's been my method thus far. Sure it can be challenging at times but you'll be alright with those general guidelines. Don't be afraid to put off the main quest. Some quest rewards are level 50 so the game assumes you're doing stuff besides rushing the main quest. That's about the best advice I can offer. Hope it helps.
---
Not really. It's perfectly reasonable to have a dedicated team to investigate this stuff assigned to more than one game. We don't even know the size of the team that handles that stuff for ESO. The team serves the same purpose regardless, and quite a bit of these sorts of investigations start out manual but become automated rather quickly. In fact, it's drastically more efficient to automate these things than investigate each case individually. I used to work on a team that would investigate and take action on accounts for various exploits or methods of cheating in a MMO, which we extended when needed to another one of our titles. Another studio I worked for had a single team dedicated to anti-cheat for about 4 different games (and that was a rather small team, thanks to the software developed to address it). Bugs are handled differently than investigating exploitation. While there is some overlap (QA team communicating identified exploits to the investigation team to find methods of detection, for example), existing teams benefit from a wealth of knowledge in how to operate (investigative techniques), how to automate, and just generally the terms of service and what constitutes a violation worthy of taking action.
---
Should they have separate QA teams? Absolutely. Those are the people who will identify the technical aspects of how the exploitation is possible. Investigations teams can work pretty hands-off once they determine how to identify the exploiters in a sound way.
---
so no new patch this week, that means a month without updates. Nice
---
Tell me more about your in-depth knowledge of the way the game is coded.

Oh wait, you don't have any.

Troll away, troll.

My girlfriend and I also own Fallout 76. It usually goes something like this: 
---
Step 1: launch the game
---
Step 2: Select 'New Game' at the title screen
---
Step 3: Greeted with Loading Screen
---
Step 4: Internet crashes and we both get disconnected before we can even load in. 
---
This literally happens every time. Fallout 76 desperately needs some form of an offline mode. I don't care if that means I have to use my spare gaming rig as a server, user hosted private servers are a necessity. It's so sad to hear that fallout 76 will never receive this feature and that I'll likely never get to play. 
---
Oh well... It's still kinda fun watching other people play... In 144p. I guess it's time for another thousand or so hours in the Commonwealth... *Sigh* so long country roads, hello settlers that need my help. 
---
I keep avoiding that cave with the level 91 mystic death claw...   I guess I can go hug him
---
I did mine by scrapping. Didn't take long to get most, if not all that way. Your bigger issue will be getting some of the components to make them like radscorpion stingers (meat bags are a good choice btw).
---
I like this idea, but let's say I opted swap in Cha heal boosting cards on my stealth rifleman to maintain overwatch on my team during a whitesprings blast.  One, I would not be getting any xp because I'm not getting hits on enemies (of course the team could agree to share legendary loot, but that doesn't help the xp situation, and a whitesprings team run is a guaranteed level at least).  Two, trying to target a player that's zigging, zagging and being surrounded by enemies is basically impossible.  The syringer is a single shot weapon and pretty slow to reload.  Even if I'm using VATS and build for that, the current system only focuses on the closest enemy.  We'd need to be able to toggle friendly targeting on and off, and be able to scroll through targets like in the previous games.  
---
If VATS got a bit of an overhaul and we could go into settings for target all, target enemies only, target friendlies only and/or gain the ability to cycle quickly through targets, this would be an interesting option.
---
A team shared xp perk would also be needed, or the incentive to act as a medic isn't worth the loss of both xp and losing your legendary drops to share with others at a golf club spawn session.
---
Alternately, giving the syringer craftable ammo that would have an AOE party buff/enemy debuff effect that counted as damage for loot and xp purposes (with positive effects scaling with party based perk cards) would work with the current system.  My build would be perfect for it as a sniper, and I'd have no problem with taking on that role assuming I could reap the same or similar rewards that I can with an explosive rifle (no it's not two shot and fake, just mutant slayer and explosive).  I think the hardest problem would be to convince the other 10-15 melee/shotgun/heavy builds to stop zerging into the clubhouse once a spawn starts and bring the fight to the parking lot so that the system would work for everyone.  Fissure prime would work fine, as it's fairly easy to climb up on the elevator shack and use a rifle from there.
---
Nice location. Available for anyone to use in the area. 
---
Water and usually don’t have an issue with someone building there.
---
Lol y'all still play this game?
---
There is a fishing resort.. Forget the name... west side of the map.. has a ton of golf balls.
---
golf balls at golf club
---
Yeah, how about a lvl 50 3 star. Plasma Gat and two scorchbeast in the bog. Gave up because the fuvker got all its health back.
---
That...doesn't make it bad or broken. Just means they found a better way, a way to improve the game, and did it.
---
For comparison, look at Diablo 3. On release, it wasn't great, but it wasn't broken either. It had...flaws. So Blizzard knuckled down, worked hard, and released the Loot 2.0 patch, which addressed a lot of the issues. Doesn't mean the game was "broken at launch", it's just Loot 2.0 made it much, much better.
---
Similarly, Elder Scrolls Online had a patch, called One Tamriel, which basically changed how the entire game world works. Previously it was zones, chained together and strongly leveled. Each zone was specific level bracket, each zone had areas, each area also with specific level bracket. Which made the game feel on-the-rails. Not "broken at launch", but not great. One Tamriel patch changed that, so that the world is leveled to you, and you can go anywhere, any time, team up with anyone. Feels like a totally different game now. BUT, the actual content, all the zones, remained the same. They just changed one system. 
---
For final example, look at WoW. Precious little remains from what was released originally. Even original zones, after Cataclysm expansion, have been completely changed. Does that mean the game was "broken at launch"? If that's what you're suggesting, there was 6-8 million subscribers at the time who would disagree with you on that one. It was, and still remains to the best of my knowledge, the single most popular subscription-based MMO in recorded human history.
---
In short, just because developers "redo 90 percent of the game" doesn't mean what they originally had was "broken at launch". It just means they found a way to improve it, and they did it. It may have been imperfect, but not necessarily broken. 
---
Having said that, I still disagree that they redid 90% of the game. Not in my experience, anyway. They tweaked a lot of things, but for the most part not much changed. So even IF redoing 90% of the game was something bad, they still haven't done that either.
---
I really don't get you guys. Like I said, if you want to fanboy on FO76, go for it. Just don't try to drag down The Division into the same mire as FO76. It doesn't belong there. For all its flaws, it was a far better product, and with a considerably better team behind it.
---
:) Always looking out for others Beagle. 
---
Jesus christ I really shouldn't use speech to text.
---
Nice find! Shit like this is much more interesting than farming nuke zones. 
---
Hm.  I could go check all the fountains and see.  Now curious
---
Yeah, I tried that one but it never actually pointed me anywhere. 
---
Dont try to compare this piece of shit to an acctually good game like skyrim
---
It was kinda a given with black Friday about to hit
---
How many times did they patch or fix Fallout 4? Yeah, they never gave us the ball. It's always been in their court until we stop giving them our purchasing power.
---
Damn, that makes sense. I started hopping arounf lvl 26 and lvl 42 now and have avoided leveling up until i get them but they never pop up. Maybe i'll just fresh.
---
Grab it the price is insanely low. Just hold off playing until our next major patch though. Having some serious issues with exploiters and server stability.
---
But the game is pretty darn fun and just needs some love.
---
You have the link to the discord?
---
I have a suspicion that's actually a bug with food and the condition bar, but i haven't been able to verify it yet. maybe you guys can help me out. so let's say you have some muttchops at a condition of 5% (meaning they are about to expire). you then aquire brand new dog meat, and cook it into muttchops. my suspicion is that the new chops are lumped in with the old chops and will actually expire quicker than they should. have you guys experienced anything like that? would be nice to get this verified once and for all.

The drum for the assault rifle holds only 5 less rounds it’s really no big difference oddly enough all of those qualify as a light machine gun

Imagine when player vendors is a thing, people will complain if they go into a player structure and [surprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F4qzPbcFiA).

&gt;Where did they say they want player tension? I've got a good idea of the devs intent with the game, and I don't remember that in any promo stuff
---
They said this constantly prior to the game release. I think even during the main game reveal, they were talking about how they wanted player interactions to carry a certain sense of "drama". It was when people were asking about how PvP would work, and whether you can completely avoid PvP if you are in pacifist mode.
---
You can level an alt or buy them for about 1500 caps or less on the trade posts. I farm them legit for other players on my alt and sell on there.
---
That quest specifically stated 1 Star or better on the terminal. Because ... nerd and I read  that stuff!
---
Obviously you have to go for the world record time for taking down a scorchbeast queen
---
I'm playing on a X1X and haven't had nearly the amount of issues that I see here. If it's people on console complaining it may be from the lower powered versions like the X1s and original PS4. 
---
I played several hours per day when I had time off for the holidays, and I could probably count on one hand the number of server DC's I suffered.
---
My last kill I got ZERO. Nada. Zilch. I even traveled away and came back. Nothing in her loot table at all for me. I haven't played since then (over a week ago). Absolutely killed my desire to play (for now). 
---
Remote.
---
Difficult to get to.
---
Good views of nukes and Watoga.
---
Close to resources.
---
Don't be a little bitch. People in the game are just as dangerous as any enemy, you outta swap games if you prefer something less cutthroat. Just wait till PvP servers come out.
---
Junk cannon would help to clean the world by recycling pieces of toxic junk into ramdomly spread garbage, a fine idea

Good question.  This thread helped me out a lot. Didnt know I could save space in stash like this.

600 is not enough at all. Needs to be 1000 at least

Removed everything to make sure it wasn't one item causing it.

I like my little pond, it has honey and Radstags tend to spawn in the same place when ever I return home.  Though last night it was cats, not a lot of meat on cats.  It is also on the noobie trail, so I hope my purified water and  diving board are helpful.   Oh an on occasion my turrets attack swarms of bees, very entertaining.
---
Only seen ya helping others sooo not sure you can be a troll lol.
---
Couldn't agree more. I'd say they are the worst part of the game but they have a lot of competition. They are definitely one of the worst things about the game.  
---
I respect that, I guess my one question would be: how can Bethesda ban only people who have duplicated serially, with pinpoint accuracy? Like where is the line? If being in possession of duplicated items isn’t the line, than how do they reprimand anyone? 
---
The problem with raising the loot cap is now you have an even worse case of haves/have nots.  
---
There's already basically 2 groups of players: those with TSE weapons/god tier 3\* melee and those without.  Probably 85% of those with one have a duped item, either knowingly or unknowingly.  Bottom line is if you traded for a TSEor immaculate 3\* melee weapon instead of finding one out in the wild there's a high chance you have a duped item.  
---
So raising the loot level will only make the power difference between players even worse, further alienating those without these new level 100 god tier items.  
---
the TSE/god tier 3\* melee meta already trivializes end game content.  SBQ raids are over in 2-3 minutes these days and only take that long because the queen will fly around a bit spamming her dive bomb attack and flying way off into the distance.  
---
The TSE/God tier 3\* melee meta has already trivialized PvP to the point where all that matters is who gets the first hit in as 100% of the hits are one hit kills.  Increasing the power of items even further just makes PvP even worse, though at least PvP is largely optional in this game.  
---
Also this suggestion ignores all the other duped items like duped serums, PA mods, and anything else that's rare.
---
Going to have to disagree. GW2 has infinitely more event mechanics than mobs, locations for the events change based on where the NPC's have roamed, locations move across the map, etc. etc.
---
I have no interest in PVP, therefore I will avoid PVP servers as much as possible.
---
Yes to the last thing!
---
yesterday i found Mr White (breaking bad) burying his millions in some barrels. 
---
I have rank 2 sneak perk and in power armor it works somewhat. I have tried numerous times either my variables are off because you cant get the exact same camp of mobs or it works.
---
I thought that new games aren't affected by holiday sales. Like on Steam new games are never on sale during summer/winter sales. I am sure there are the exceptions though 
---
yes
---
I read it also. And I killed a bunch and didn't get the credit.
---
Can you elaborate on "actually scorchbeast equipment" just if your looking for gear the simple solution is
---
1: a torso with the dense mod
---
    Why: makes their sonic attacks do slap damage
---
2: rank 3 of the blocker perk in the strength category
---
   Why: with their sonic attack gone this helps with their melee
---
3: any sort of prime, scorchbeast killer, or zealots weapons
---
  Why: more damage so why not, technically not needed
---
4: prisoners or zealot legendary gear 
---
  Why: less damage from their poison 
---
Honestly only 1 and 2 are needed
---
Stop complaining learn from your mistakes n when the next game is released wait for the price drop. All these posts about feeling ripped off are stupid, battlefield V also had a price drop even red dead n spider man had a price drop around the holidays. With all the hate online of course retailers are lowering prices, they have too much inventory n are losing money. This is economics, supply increases n prices drop. Demand drops n prices drop. I paid full price the day before the release n knew it would be cheaper around Xmas cuz there are always holiday sales. I wanted to play at release n paid full price to do just that so did you. You said you love the game so why is it so upsetting to support a game you love to play. These posts make no sense to me. If you bought a pair of shoes n walked around in them for a week n saw them on sale you wouldn’t go to store n demand the sale price. Or maybe you would do that but the store wouldn’t be responsible to pay you the difference. 
---
Healers should get more exp for just being them.
---
Sounds like communication is an issue at home. I’m sorry you have to deal with that. You shouldn’t have called your mom a bitch but she shouldn’t be humiliating you in front of guests either and neither of them should be hitting you. Do your best to be cleanly and do what’s right. In 4 years you can get the hell out of there. It sucks that you have to come to Reddit for emotional support but just know that living in a shitty home environment is temporary. 
---
Ah, well to each their own I guess. I'm just saying the game allows it so why punish a player for "raiding" it is fallout after all.
---
I have the Carnivore mutation.
---
400hp per piece of meat. 
---
The only reasonable way to fight them is with the Enforcer perk; the most obvious solution is to make their wings and head vulnerable to limb damage - score some hits with Enforcer and you'll disable the screech and force them to land.
---
Of course I feel ripped off. This game is one of most blatant cashgrabs in gaming history. It only worked because people love Fallout. Next time Bethesda won't be so lucky, they're currently EA tier and have 0 credibility.
---
Super mutants can often drop laser weapons, which break down for 4-6 plastic each. I just farm a few areas with those for a bit, which also helps stock up on caps and common ammo.
---
They just need to make Demo expert pve only and voila. 
---
May have to bounce to another server then. Because it appears to be radiant - like the miners key - it may have to pick a new location for you to see it, especially if the location got looted by someone else before you got there.
---
If only I could get my husband to play! 
---
Fix the issue then delete all current items in game except armor and PA.   
---
I love the game. I wanted a multiplayer fallout game since I started playing FO and now I have it 👍🏻
---
Ok , thanks 
---
Good thing me and my wife play good games.
---
Worst part is god knows when the first dlc will even come out,
---
Did he also beat your mother if she stepped out of line? 
---
Eh, I'm closing in on 200 hours so got my money's worth.  Considering the volume of AAA SP games you finish in 5-10 hours I don't get the fussing.  
---
Only time I get a bit salty was mass effect andromeda, and that was because they abandoned it at roughly the one month mark.
---
Thank you for that insight! I have an elementary understanding of what the actual issue is regarding patching it... and you are right, weight isn’t the only answer, people could dupe right up to the weight, sell and repeat. I’m interested to see how it finally resolves
---
It's...fixable. We just have to wait and see if they fix it. I mean, their track record isn't the greatest. The Lever Action rifle was added to FO4 in '16. It had a reloading bug, where you fire one round, reload the gun, and it reloads all bullets, even though only 1 was missing. They ported the same gun into FO76. Along with the reloading bug, which they didn't bother to fix, in either FO4, or FO76. Similarly, Bethesda released Skyrim in '11. Since then, they ported it how many times? Yet, ports still contain bugs, reported back in '11, which still haven't been fixed.
---
So, I'm not exactly holding my breath for any significant improvements. But, it could be fixed. 
---
I just want better quality for $60 
---
Honestly i don't know because they allowed this issue to grow for eight weeks. I just don't know what they can do. The biggest problem is if they show no blow back then future exploits found will be used by almost everyone.
---
I don't care about outfits. I can easily find one to cover up some armors that look really bad but have good stats.
---
That's a weird flex. but okay. 
---
I usually launch a queen at night after work every day for the server. (launch at approx 7:30pm PST)  psn: KOSOWNS.  But then I like to go do my own solo thing after.
---
Armor mostly spawns in based on your character level. Try cranberry bog locations if your 50+
---
I am, thank you!
---
* Overlooking the Whitespring, but outside the normal Whitespring nuke radius.
---
* Central locations keeps fast travel costs down.
---
* A short walk to farm the behemoth/gather water, similar walk to farm Yao guai for springs. 
---
* Cliff on three sides means less materials needed for building.
---
* Almost never has dangerous enemies spawn nearby. Most of the time it spawns chickens, frogs, or rabbits.
---
Pew pew cry some more why don’t you. 
---
Good to know.
---
May be my imagination but I think I might have seen your named dots on the map together before.
---
killing any windego won't do. it has to be the specific one marked my the quest. that was the only way i could complete it
---
It’s useful if you want to run a heavy weapons build, but as far as a TSE gatling plasma goes I wouldn’t recommend it for just that weapon. It just breaks way to quickly. The ammo for it is fairly easy to find though, it’s not to hard to craft either. You could glitch the weapon for infinite durability as long as you don’t unequip it, not sure how that works but I’ve had it happen a few times so far. 
---
For most things the build is 100% overkill, but that’s what’s fun about it. Very satisfying to decimate those flying rodents and hordes of enemies. Ammo does tend to be an issue so I usually have to craft large amounts every now and then. Of course, the stronger your weapon the less ammo you use. Most enemies get one or two tapped which saves greatly on ammo.
---
As far as how fun it is, that’s subjective but I personally have loads of fun with it, especially against beefy enemies or hordes. Nothing quite like the sound of a heavy weapon at a fresh respawn of the Whitesprings golf club.
---
Fuck that. Just give me a damn elevator and call it a day please and thank you. 
---
Hey there new buddy!  Come check out my camp.  Bang you’re dead.  Take your loot and bounce servers.
---
Damn that is one thing I trust Bethesda with. Not abandoning this game. I have very high hopes. Sorry about your mass effect let down 
---
Would but your world is full haha
---
It would be especially useful for those of us playing on consoles, so we don’t have to go fire up our computers.
---
I agree. I worked hard to build in a cave but had to move because it spawned me inside the mountain with now way to get out to my camp. 
---
All Rise is a super sledge worth getting. Do the Mayor For A Day questline if you haven't already. Sledgehammers are life
---
No, you dont just go after the suppliers. You go after the customers and suppliers. That's the only way this stops and doesnt happen again.
---
Be careful though. The extended explosion radius makes tight quarters much more dangerous.
---
Finally someone I can relate to! Bring back Fisto!
---
Level 56, level 100+.. there's no difference once you hit special limit.
---
 Lol with the mod that makes it shoot snowballs you can freeze it so it moves very slow
---
Proximity to water and central to the traders I visit so it's cap-efficient.
---
The lounge at the Top of the World has a shit-ton of plastic plates. 
---
Finally something we agree on. The amount of times they released Skyrim was gross.
---
I imagine part of it is they don't want people making weird floating buildings. Shitty way to go about it but that's probably part of the thought process. Honestly they could solve so many issues if they'd just let things anchor to shit that isn't the ground. God forbid we snap something to an existing wall.

I have a 2 star Executioner's Chinese officer sword with 40% faster swing speed. Will sell for 300 caps on Xbox if you want it. Would work perfect!
---
Thanks, I guess their opinion on player interaction was a little different than I thought!
---
So, as a matter of technicality I 100% agree with you about the need to stop nukes. 
---
However, nukes are one of the games main features, and it's fun blow stuff up. I was thinking if we could still go into a low level server, to grind for legendaries or just to watch the pretty light show, I'd be more open to the idea, but it's still kind of awkward. Having different DEFCON levels give different items would be awesome though.
---
Aside:
---
Perhaps we could have something where we have to nuke each fissure site, and complete Scorched Earth, in order to progress the plot.
---
So to get Bethesda’s attention:
---
First you need to buy $500 of micro transactions
---
Then you need to buy Skyrim 10 times
---
You need at least 10000 hours in Fallout 76 to report any issues, because anyone new to the game is always wrong.
---
Lastly, you need to wait until ES6, (or go play RDR2) because F76 is a waste of your time.
---
I'm on PS4 and actually looked into reporting players. Per the FO76 support page, we are supposed to follow Playstation's support page for reporting players. That is, adding the offending player as a friend, and then reporting them...
---
&gt;  (reddit is just the largest forum, any other forum is going to be an even smaller amount of players complaining)
---
you're new to the internet I see
---
Let's not pretend the ATOM shop even really contributes that much to it. As a whole it needs a lot of improvement. 
---
The flame throwing responder house gets a replacement from the bag
---
This hurts to read.  I would love a TSE.  Tried yesterday for a couple hours to get to the blast zone to see if I could scrounge one and never made it past the Scorchbeasts. :(
---
YES!!!!!
---
In any game? I don't think so. I've faces more frustrating opponents in adventure RPGs that I played as a kid (and can't remember the name anymore). But in Fallout, they definitely take the cake. Fighting them is annoying and they make exploring locations close to fissures real PITA (like Mosstown or the Pumpkin House), because the game likes to spawn them frequently.
---
It's annoying that they seem to know the area where the player is. Everytime I observed from distance that a new SB came of out the fissure, it started flying in circles roughly above me. Well, they are giant bat, maybe they hear me breathing, fine. But what about the fact that they engage me shortly after turning my light on, even when sneaking (with full sneak build). Aren't bats supposed to be blind. The other two annoying parts are the homing sonic attacks and bad loot.
---
I've actually managed to develop a tactic to fight them with my stealth sniper. I just pop Psycho and start shooting my Dragon from stealth. When Caution flips to Danger I just run few meters and crouch again. Usually this drops me back to Caution (thanks to a handy Agility card) and I can continue shooting with the Dragon.
---
So in short, from my point of view SBs need three simple fixes to make them acceptable - they shouldn't see light (or at least make them engage), their sonic attacks shouldn't home and their loot table needs some buffs.
---
In regards to balancing it will definitely be an issue, I had the idea of making events true level based, like if your level 200 and want to do the flatwoods event, those protectrons  should match your level, then there is the issue low levels stumbling in high areas... it’s a puzzle. 
---
I don’t know what Bethesda will do with duper’s and I don’t even want to touch that, because it’s more than just in game, that’s real life and real people, and I don’t have a place to speak on what people do and don’t deserve. I think not every crime is equal, and people who are duping and selling those items for real money should get in some real trouble though 
---
I got an explosive black powder pistol off one. 
---
One hit kill in PvP. Neato.
---
When are we getting looooooooooongmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
---
It's not like it has 999999999999 damage. It is just a double expo. It is kinda neat spamming it but man recoil is  bitch. 
---
Great point! It is a nice way of telling everyone to cut it out without punishing them directly 
---
They're like "yeah I saw the other fifty posts within the last hour I'm good". 
---
Yes thats what im afraid of. It does not add damage right? Just radius
---
Imo loot is fine. 
---
What is your gamer tag?
---
I have the blue prints for the Gun so I can make it when ever I want 
---
&gt; Elder scrolls team? Yeah, this screams bullshit to me. 
---
Same, although I don't understand why the guys would lie &amp; why both of them had everyone kicked out of their discords.
---
There is no working dupe glitch on ESO atm so it's unlikely the message was sent (if it is legit) to an ESO player who did some duping recently.
---
If it is BS then it's beyond my understanding why some guy decided they wanted to fake the Bethesda message but forgot to add "Fo76 team" instead of "ESO team".
---
Rebalancing will be necessary no matter what, I have good ideas for that! Stay tuned for the next post! 
---
if you crouch while scoped in with a rifle you actually gain AP instead of losing it while you walk. So all you have to do is walk normally until our of AP, then sneak and scope in and walk until AP bar is full and repeat
---
Todd be praised! 
---
600 is fine for everything other than weapons and apparel (maybe ammo too but unless you have a stupid big backlog of heavy weapons ammo you're probably fine.)
---
The second you add those to the mix 600 is no bueno, and honestly I'd much rather have unlimited stash than separate stash budgets or a cross-character stash.
---
(Not to say that I don't want a cross character stash, I just feel like stash size is way way way more of a problem right now)
---
Reveal your secrets oh glorious sloth
---
and you hop on your left leg counter clockwise while wearing a worn fedora on you tube.... that is the important part.
---
two shot explosive legendary weapons. 
---
Lead Deposit, Nice view over a cliff.  No random spawns.  Close proximity to places I go for cheaper fast travel.
---
Someone explained it’s an issue with server response time, not in game code, I’m not sure anything about servers or any of that, but I don’t think it’s impossible to tidy up shop so to speak! 
---
Depends who you ask.
---
Some people say yes. Others say no. Last I heard, it was actually no. One guy even tested it. He fired at a wall, and had his mate get closer and closer along the wall, until he got hit. Then he took off Grenadier perk, which should have dropped the radius by 100%, and his mate didn't move, and fired again. The mate still got hit. Meaning the explosion radius was already at its original (default) size. 
---
You can test it yourself, without too much pain. Just get 1 star of Grenadier, and shoot at a wall as you get closer with it equipped. As soon as you take damage, stop, take Grenadier off. Fire again. Still taking damage? If not, Grenadier worked. If yes, it didn't work. Just don't use a shotgun, or you'll 1-shot yourself.
---
I'd test it myself, but when I heard this, I didn't bother getting the perk. So I can't tell you for certain how true it is. If anyone wants to test this, please do. Some guy did a video of Speed Demon and Gun Runner not stacking, and it pretty much put that whole debate to rest there and then. We could use the same with the explosive weapons.
---
I’ve heard the Gatling gun is a strong choice.
---
Cool. Great job!
---
Its marleting is very similar to ESO honestly
---
mods only 'scrap' when you don't have the mats and do a repair, and even then it shows you it'll consume it.  Is it anoying that it can do this, sure, but ultimately it comes down to some one not paying enough attention to what's listed as going to be used to repair something.
---
The thing with Hardened Mass, and potentially Royal Jelly, is that other 'craft materials' of junk are 'immune' to being auto scrapped, making it spotty at best and a case of 'what are the rules' where as with mods, it's the same every time in that it lets your consume the mod to ensure you can fix item x if you don't have enough mats otherwise, and always has that option on.
---
tl;dr the big difference in the consistancy of things with this
---
Foundations are for the bottom floor. Seems like the wooden floors are for second or third story floors. 
---
Totes mate, it's all good.
---
  However to the person who down voted me on my comment about the clarification..  Lol why? 
---
General consensus is probably Gatling Gun. I was lucky enough to get a drop on both an explosive and a two-shot one and they both decimate everything in its path. I think one of the energy guns is strong too but supposedly wears down extremely quick. 
---
I second this! I will help him to protect the wasteland Give me some of the best armor in the game for basically free so I can go teach these people a lesson.... Xbox btw
---
Feels like fallout to me. 
---
You weren't in cover is the simplest answer, sorry. Trees will break up the screech attack from hitting. Walking to the side while shooting will avoid the attack. You just need to avoid getting hit by the ball in the center of the translucent ball to avoid most damage. Some objects don't block it, so pay attention to what it does when it hits your cover. Does the center ball come through? Does the outer ball hit you? Is it their cropdust attack?
---
Take to the woods, the trees are endless cover in my experience.
---
Also, as level 25, it will get easier. Level 3 white knight perk in agility, plus my legendary no PA based build, and I barely take anything from sonic attacks. My armor takes barely any damage. I have less damage from scorched/beasts/ and 2 -50% fall damage, so my armor is still pretty crap. But it changes dramatically with the right perks and the right level of gear upgraded correctly and all that. At level 25 you're just 5 under when I defeated my first scorchbeast by using all my ammo, breaking all my armor, using most my stims, and having my partner there doing the same. I'm like 61 now and we hung around a fissure site last time we played chaining scorch beast after scorch beast with no time to repair or refill ammo. We did 3 in a row, then fought another at the ammunition factory when we went to refill ammo. I took aggro from most the aerial sonic barrages, dodging and using cover, and barely took any armor damage. I take a diluted stim and hide behind a tree when I'm at 45% health, then right back at it.
---
It gets easier.
---
I hope this eventually becomes a unique character. Summon by playing jaw harp, drunk on psycho, until you see its head poking around the corner.
---
Ah yes, sorry OP, forgot this ☝🏼
---
R3 is overkill. Just R1 keeps you no RADS in my experience
---
Or what they should do nerf the OP exploding weapons, they are just too powerful and they make the game not fun at all when you are a player without one and a random player just mows down all enemies with one. Vendors do need improvement to, tried for Emergency Protocol and never found one.
---
Well rdr2 is a phenomenal game so turn that frown upside down cowboy.

I think you should get the same number of stars in the drop that the enemy has with a twist. One star gets a one time health refresh, two star gets a two time health refresh, etc. Now that would make Queen the near impossible, but it means you invest more energy and bullets the higher the stars. You are justly rewarded for your efforts. 
---
I have a website I'm about to release for just this purpose! You'll be able to provide bug reports and suggestions, the community can curate and vote, and individuals can subscribe to alerts and notifications when an issue they are tracking is updated.
---
You will have to share your email address to log in but that's it. It's just to prevent spam. You can use a password or ask for a temporary link to log in. We won't ask for anything more.
---
And I'm trying really hard to get the moderators here and  the community management from Bethesda onboard with it.
---
I've been getting great mileage out of my explosive harpoon gun and faster firing Gatling gun.
---
It’s right next to Solomon’s pond. Look for a body of water.  He sits in it until you walk up and Agro him. 
---
Exactly, both me and my dad are encumbered, and I personally will probably stay that way until they buff vendors (a buttload) or increase stash size (still a buttload.)
---
I taught my mom how to kill trash mobs &lt; level 10. It was the best seeing her spam fireball. Only played for about 2 days though. Gotta hold on to those moments. She was about 37 at the time and I was 15.
---
Were you farming (if so where) and luckily got those as drops or were you just extremely lucky to get them out of the blue? 
---
Thanks for sharing 
---
The purpose of two is not to make players suffer, it’s to give them more to work towards!!!! I understand what you mean! 
---
And in regards to 3, the reason its multiples instead of flat numbers is for that reason, if you want to be a tank with 500 weight, you can carry a lot more shit than someone with no points in str... I don’t think this game was meant to be played like single player fallouts, and a weight limit is absolutely normal in games, I’d like to see it purely for server stability if nothing else 
---
Rdr2 is top tier trash 
---
questionable
---
I was thinking that but thought ammo consumption would be horrendous. Any advice? 
---
But all he needs to do if get a keycard....
---
I don’t see why I can’t just throw a roof on the ground or random walls that just fall over, who cares if my camp looks like a trash pile 
---
Correction - reporting players is not going to be an aspect of the website. Sorry. Nor will any of this be in-game, though we could easily open it up so Bethesda could add this to their game without taking them away from their programming and other duties.
---
Never duped before.
---
Heh, pretty much the opposite of me.  RDR2 has been getting dust for me.  
---
If you have it may as well fire it up.  It's got fewer bugs then release and is more stable on ps4 for me.  Seems like workarounds exist at this point for the bugs that pop up as well.  
---
I absolutely love this idea!!! You are my new favorite wastelander. Just subscribed to your channel. 🖤🖤🖤 
---
Less than 100lbs with Perks. Maybe 300lbs with.
---
I mean it's fertilized soil soooo...
---
iis the bayonet the only mod for the black powder rifle?
---
Being able to take a scorchbeast was a big moment for me. 
---
I felt the same way back in the 2000s when DLCs were first being released. Fallout 3 had so many DLCs n people were upset about getting “an incomplete game for $60”. More people paid for the DLCs than boycotted them so here we are 10-15yrs later with half finished games being released for $60. Everything people are complaining about in this game has it origin from a previous loved chapter of the fallout saga. 
---
Can anyone confirm that this is still a reliable way to get the schematics? I'm level 36 and have been checking the Watoga and Harper's Ferry vendors since level 25, with no luck. I have even spent time doing nothing but server hopping and re-checking the vendors.
---
So far, have only been able to find plans for the short NV scope for the handmade rifle.
---
I have seen conflicting info regarding what level you need to be in order to find the schematics. 15-44? 15-20?
---
I REALLY want the schematics but, also REALLY don't want to have to start up a new character.
---
Exactly! I am too, I have thousands of chems on fo4 I’ll never use but I keep anyways. This game is meant to be a survival game, I don’t think it plays well if you can carry so much stuff 
---
You've been trading duped weapons. Someone might have reported you.
---
Logging into the website might give more information, or you could submit a ticket.
---
Its also dropped nothing for me just a few mins ago. We killed it, and literally 2seconds later.. CTD. 
---
10/10 would do it again.
---
I could enjoy this game, but since i got no team for the queen its just getting harder to keep going especially with issues like this..
---
I know that spot, my camp kept getting despawned.  
---
You mean like jumping on top of a random ledge and then enemies just walk back and forth or run away from you?
---
Server hopped 5 hours last night trying for the Hunters. Vendor spawned about 5 times but no luck. 
---
What part of my inventory is crashing the game when I have barely anything? 
---
Welcome to the 'Shit Show' as you say. If you are abusing glitches. This is your own making.   
---
Gatling is really good ammo consumption. Was hitting 4k dmg with a bloody explosive one
---
They were sent over by the Brotherhood from the west coast to deal with the scorchbeast problem that Taggerty reported.
---
Not this complaint afain...
---
Cargobots are so stupid.
---
And I love it, it's so nice when it distracts a scorchbeast or all the robots in watoga and on top of not dying I also get a free cargo drop.
---
Fine by me, the rewards for defending are garbage. I can only use plans once, why do I need 27 plans for Bear Proof Trashcans?
---
It’s a fine line, and they are certainly out of time, I think we can all agree on that!
---
I didn't realize they had Undertale easter eggs in this game
---
It's possible they are the ones duping especially if they are asking for super low prices. You could just be the one neo. Destroying the simulation. 
---
If you are on PC and I stumble across one I’ll buy it and give to you at cost.  
---
Either way good luck and hopefully you get it today 
---
Never glitched once, bud. Just trying to play the game and normal player-to-player Selling and Buying.
---
Everyone “outside” BGS ahahahahaha love it
---
Ehh not just make some? 
---
It actually does. I died far more often using explosive weapons than grinding out against enemies using more balanced weapons. Melee is basically OP for pve. You can one shot anything but the giant bat dragons.
---
Ok, so say you went to a vendor and there was a TSE for sale for 200 caps so you buy it, you are now a “customer” the exposure is too big to just flat out punish anyone who has touched a duplicated item. That means most of us are gonna have repercussions from nothing we controlled 
---
Lead man it's a pain... I know how to get it but if I can just buy it that works too. 
---
Like the Messenger event? 
---
Just radius.
---
From my recollection it's happened quite a lot.  Best Buy used to be good about dropping price 5-10 USD to clear stock a week or so after release as well.
---
So I'm supposed to take the word of a Raider? Ok. That never ended badly in Appalachia before.
---
Could you imagine reloading six “The Dragon” weapons at once?   Might as well go make a sandwich or something.  
---
I don’t think simple “nerfing TSE” with out an armor / weapons rebalance is the solution either.  They are OP yes but for the most part this is a PVE game ... if the player chooses easy mode , how does it really effect anyone else? Just wondering?
---
Personal I think a lot of the tears over them is because “I’ve spent X hours” or “ I’m at X level” and haven’t gotten one yet.
---
The pvp is laughable.... if someone starts attacking my base and I don’t feel like vPing.... I can log out and relog.
---
Take a survival game like Ark. people form tribes and spend 10k hours building bases and breeding dinosaurs.... keep players on 24/h a day to keep guard so all of those assets aren’t lost in a PvP encounter..... this game has none of that... what do I loose, a bag of junk? I’m not a duper, but asides from potential server performance issues related to it, someone else’s style of game play, doesn’t effect me.
---
I personally think the people crying about the “TSE” were the same people 3 weeks ago crying about how FO76 is “unplayable bc there’s no NPCs”
---
I love the game and the community... just my 2 cents.
---
Time is a big difference. That guy probably grinded whitesprings to death and OP probably just finished the bos. 
---
Yea the gatling despite saying it has a 400 fire rate it definitely shoots very slow. It's great on ammo
---
I believe all the things they are saying is real lines, it’s just that noise makes them hard to tell.
---
&gt;Now that would make the Queen near impossible
---
They could always adjust the defensive or health values to accommodate this change without changing the duration of the fight. I totally agree with you, though.
---
Except all of the people I'm trading with are either, A, people I know, or B, low Levels I'm trying to unload junk onto.
---
I’ve of two minds about this. I want them to change how pvp and slap damage and pacifist works but I don’t know how extreme I want it. I kind of want them to turn it up to near max and give everyone on outer outfit that does nothing except makes it so you deal 0 damage to other players and they deal 0 damage to you. Make it so you can only put it on or take it off once per session or just at the beginning of the session. Then for anyone else not wearing that outerwear pvp is fair game. Scrap and aid items can be taken off of the bodies. Again not sure if I would want this but I do think things need to be changed. I’ve enjoyed the rare pvp occasions I’ve had in this game but I don’t seek them out and they are few and far between. Currently encountering another player is just boring and that’s the worse thing. 
---
Ill join the fight but dont really want to do the silo did 8 yesterday so kinda tired of doing it. NemoTouchedDaBut lvl 122
---
Lmao same 
---
ppl discarding are probably maxed on the vendor for the day, some of em just don't sell for much so we learn which ones to go sell off for the least amount of vendor venturing. 
---
Dross Toss is bugged for sure. This also happens any time I fast travel to Welsh station. 
---
PC/Xbox/PS?
---
Why does having a grind spot make someone an idiot? 
---
Darn shame, that game had huge promise.  Sadly management decided to double down on anthem instead of doing cleanup and dlc.
---
u have to farm zones more your speed..i know it can be a grind but thats part of the game
---
agree to disagree.
---
if we are going to compare to reality, quite literally you could not hoard large quantities of anything worthwhile, especially not in an anarchic setting where there is no law enforcement. you'd be a target by many, something that this game simply cannot provide.
---
also, a problem with comparing to reality is this: you wouldn't carry a thousand bricks to your home and store them "just because you might need them" because they are really heavy and you'd only be able to carry a few at a time. the issue is further compounded by the fact that there are probably more worthwhile ventures for you to undertake that ultimately could secure a larger amount of bricks (rather than manual labor).
---
to make your comparison work, we'd have to only be able to carry a few bricks (i.e. 10\~ carry weight). we'd also have to remove respawning items - like gyms for lead, or toy stores for screws - because in reality you'd have to go further and further to amass a large quantity.
---
you see where this is headed? comparing the game environment to your home in reality is inane.
---
&gt;You don't stop inflation by making everyone throw their money in the garbage. 
---
it's not to stop inflation. inflation is a market term, dependent on need and availability. what i am talking about is simply availability. if you always have everything, what's the point in looting anything? by making you prioritize your load-out, you are creating a hierarchy of worth for loot looted; this hierarchy is ever-changing, because your needs change, as do your goals. if you remove any carry weight, there is no hierarchy, and loot will just become loot, with no particular value.
---
for example, i just ran out of concrete. i bulked all of mine and sold it because i haven't needed it for so long, but lo and behold now i've finally found "brick walls" which, of course, requires concrete. so now, concrete has a much higher value, and it'll be a joy finding it. it creates a dynamic and sensation of actually "exploring" and "checking out" locations for loot, rather than just sweeping it clean like a vacuum cleaner. if i could have stored endless amounts of concrete (or anything), i'd never have run out of concrete, and it'd never ever be worth anything.
---
ultimately, the only things worth anything would then be legendaries, and that's pretty boring imo.
---
I got this joke with a perk pack.
---
What do you can a deer with no eyes and no legs?
---
Still no idea.
---
That took me a minute to get.
---
Me and my friend came up with a build using 6 of them in the beta. 
---
You basically have To be inside a building.    That will protect you some until it does the acid fly by.  Them get out of area quickly. 
---
Yes :)
---
Damn then I'm not sure. I've heard of crashes if you have the tesla rifle or power fist but I've only heard of it with stash related crashes. What system are you on? 
---
Hopefully someone can translate all of them eventually.
---
I turned off my fo76 and my ap is still draining. 
---
Yes, very neat :)
---
Built one of these today and fried myself at least twice playing with getting the timing and distance Right. It does a surprising amount of dmg. Lvl 92 
---
Ok thanks I'll do that
---
Water source. Quick walk to a POI with a handful of high level mob spawns and PA/fusion core. Centered so fast travel to Whitespring/Harpers/Watoga is easy on caps. 
---
also moving your camp and capitalizing on encumberment / stashing (i recently pulled ALL My junk and deposited everything else into stash to let me sell off and scrap a huge haul from a series of workshop events easily thanks to one camp move) is really awesome, using the mechanics that are in the game and spend some of our caps is soo satisfying
---
Gatling is the most well rounded. 50cal costs too much for ammo, gatling laser breaks too quick, lmg is a joke. explosive harpoon gun with flechettes can deal some serious dmg as well, similar a explosive shotgun.
---
Aside from the increase or decrease in durability provided by some weapon mods it seems like it has more to do with the rate of fire(and I mean the actual not the listed rate.. yes I'm looking at you Gatling Gun). I find that the Laser Gatling breaks crazy fast fast as well 50 cal is "ok" but can see go though 200% in a few fights and then my Gatling Gun seems to last a long time. All this will regular use of all three.
---
Wait, you’ve learned mods by creating items without the mod you want to learn and then creating it?
---
What IS all this?? My husband divorced me over Bioshock Infinite. Or maybe Skyrim. LoU? RDR? All of them? Damn but you gaming couples are lucky. I realize that it's mostly guys wishing their women would play, but men who don't are so intolerant of people who do. Bless you all.
---
Two shot 50 cal 25% faster fire (one could argue expo but it seems about the same and frees up expo perks)  if with 3rd star tray and get 15% reload.  If going true tank get  250 damage resistance while reloading  instead.   
---
So the gauss is affected by energy weapon based perks? 
---
XBox One. It's not my Internet, because I'm running 200mb/s. I'm not using either of those weapons. So unless there's something like Dupers in the Servers doing their thing and making it Brick (Like usual). Though it's only happening when I trade.
---
Seriously? That is one of the challenges?(at work atm) I have found some high up on cliffs miles from anything ....
---
XBox.
---
You should re-think grenades to allow Molotov Cocktails.  Also, I'm guessing you won't be using drugs or alcohol.  Where do you draw that line?  Radaway is a must obviously since you'll need to rid mutations.... of if you get a mutation you must make a holy pilgrimage to a decontamination arch...
---
It's probably people duping items, it somehow involves crashing the server, not sure how or why
---
the game is filled with the charm of detail, things to find and experience just for their own sake, the way video games used to be enjoyed... like a book filled with more types of symbolism than just words
---
I try not to use them around other people. Except the queen. But as a solo player I love mine.  For me they are a lot of fun.  
---
Dupers made them a househould standard.
---
MrEMar I will load back in now 
---
So scorched effects DO more damage on SB and SBQ? Thats my main question. Because I keep seeing some people saying yeah, and others saying no
---
Considering 76 reviews are bisised because 90% of the people did not want an online game 
---
Buying groups.
---
Ahh, righto. I didn't know they had mods, to be honest.
---
Todd Howard, you've done it again!
---
I keep seeing CaNaDa. Gets me every time. But I agree, something a bit more scientific would be nice. 
---
Yeah, Pain Train can fail to do damage frequently even though I'm physically connecting (and encountering resistance) with enemies. I'm not convinced Duping is solely responsible for entire servers crashing. 100+ robots outside Whitesprings is NOT good for server stability. Most of the time I'm there I have to carefully weave in between all the robots just to get to the damn entrance. Also, I've encountered server wide crashes twice now at the exact same time I tried looting an ash pile. Coincidence? Entirely possible. But Ash and Goo piles in this game are VERY buggy, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if I did in fact crash the server both of those times. Every other time resulted in either a loot box that loads forever, or no loot box at all. I'm avoiding energy weapons now.
---
Yeah exactly.. Have to take pictures in front of them. In different regions and top of the world

I scrapped a pair of X-01 Calibrated Shocks I had bought for a friend - this was while I was crafting throwing knives to burn off excess steel and make some room in my stash and on my person. Wasted 1K caps. Granted, I knew about the mod scrapping issue, but completely spaced it while I was doing this as I don't normally hang on to mods, if I get them, I use them. These were suppose to be a gift for a friend returning after the holidays.
---
So have I. It's ONLY today for some reason.
---
My ps4 doesn't take 5mins to load. You probably got pc problems.
---
The amusement park and fairground. There are plastic cups everywhere. A run through the park is something like 50 or 60 plastic. 
---
Try /r/fo76FilthyCasuals 
---
Full of people like us.
---
You create it but you learn them by breaking them down. So say you want to learn the mods to a .44. you make a bunch of .44s and as you break them back down there is a chance to learn the mod. Same with armor and power armor. Now mind you the odds are much less with guns but you can learn them.
---
Either way my op was about me wanting this game to be great and  that message has been lost....I love this company I trust Bethesda to make it right it was supposed to be a positive post ...and this sub makes it negative
---
That's a bit extreme. I think they deserve some changes, make the attacks more avoidable and less dazzling, maybe change their flight patterns a bit. But I don't think they're poorly designed.
---
I agree with your sentiment, but not sure I agree with your proposed execution. I would personally love it if there were pvp and pvp servers, where pve had the same mechanics we have now(maybe change pacifist to where you could take no damage from players, camp included), and pvp servers had full pvp with no map markers and an easy toggle for the current pacifist (so people could still team up at events like nuke zones with no worry of hurting others), and also restrict pvp respawns so it's not a battle of attrition. I'm not sure if it would work like I imagine, but I think it would allow a more intense experience with more drama than there currently is. 
---
Didn't work in Fallout 4 either unfortunately. Tested it a ton both there and in 76
---
Finding duped junk, ok, I can get with that as a possibility but at the least this is extremely rare.  
---
Finding a TSE in a container?  No, that doesn't just happen.  Players who dupe are doing this deliberately and intentionally.  Really the only way I can see this happening is some "anti-duper" type of player intentionally trying to track down dupers on laggy servers and stealthing into their camp to steal their gear.  
---
But to hear it from you stumbling into containers chock full of TSE's and baggies full of thousands of tons of junk is a common thing.  Niether of those things is a common thing.  
---
In any event I doubt Bethesda even has the capability of banning everyone who has duped or who has used a duped weapon knowingly or otherwise.  If they could, they likely already would have. 
---
I guess that the majority of players bought their TSE weapons from dupers.
---
these are really two different talking points; limitations of carry weight and carry weight as a design choice.
---
personally, i'd like to see a higher carry weight for stash, maybe around 1000, and i understand bethesda would like that too, citing instability as cause for not raising it (yet).
---
i think there definitely is a point in limiting carry weight as a design choice. i haven't played any of those games you mentioned, but take a game like How to Survive 2; the limitless stash basically means you never run out of anything, and you always have anything you need, so there's really no point in ever doing any "material runs" or "survival runs" (which imo, is a large component of survival games; specifically, the downtime part of the game).
---
If they made those changes then they would no longer be poorly designed
---
Yeah but fighting a dragon doesn't leave you effectively naked and defenseless with your armor and bows blown to bits and without any more arrows to shoot even if you did have a working bow. 
---
Yea, read way ahead if you scrap and have valuable mods make sure to read. Really annoyance is I just finished getting the parts and assembled my X-01 but just before it I thought "why do I still have a wooden wall base, oh yea you can replace all parts..."
---
Honestly 15min and I lost it all.
---
Good ending to the story though a friend who've encountered my exact scenario which whom also gave the first pair of shocks and jetpack gave me a whole new set for free, again!
---
So promised him if I ever find a set myself I will give it to him, don't intend to go back on my promise.
---
But it pisses you off knowing that the game make it so hard to get em you can lose em that easy.
---
They should simple make them non-scrap-part components cause honestly a mod is worth like 2 steel or proper metal (black titanium etc). But they havent and if they don't or make them easier to get I will lose faith in the devteam. 
---
Before exploding weapons, I remember melee one shotting everything. Low hp sneak builds also one shot anything with non explosive weapons.. So there is really no difference and it will allways happen..
---
The 4/5 star legendary effects are primed from the queen  and scorched killers from the responders
---
By buddy got a Lvl 15 TSE Shotgun at level 20 and Lvl 30 Assault Rifle level 32. Most are duped.
---
You guys sound awesome!
---
Swamp itch is a disease lasting 15 minutes that causes a -2 to agility. It is contracted by sleeping in a sleeping bag or on a mattress on the ground.
---
While they are annoying and poorly designed, at least you can get prime reciever plans from them :). 99% of the time you get shit though, lol
---
Dang, ah well. Keep lookin I suppose. Power fist till then lol
---
I just logged in to say this ;)
---
That version would be awesome too!
---
I feel like they should get buffs dependant on their star level, like increased health at star 1, or increased damage at star 3.
---
But it would just be great if we didn't have to grind relentlessly for our legendaries.
---
Same here, was saving it to give to a friend for present lol
---
If you can wait about 7-8 hours (at work) I have 1.5-2k 308 &amp; possibly 500x 5.56 (could be wrong). Would like .45 but can make a deal for caps.
---
Completely not necessary and kinda rude, bud.
---
Something got ya down?
---
Been looking for this damn fountain for two days now, still cannot find it 
---
Risk vs reward. It's a huge pain in the ass to farm the materials to repair your armor, if I'm going to risk spending the next hour or so looting just to repair I want to know they're going to have at least one decent drop. I have to find anything that was worth fighting them. My resources are more valuable to me than anything they'll drop. I'd much rather fight a group of anglers over a stupid SB. 
---
Bethesda deserves no brand loyalty at this point. 
---
We dont even know who is calling the shots, what % of the company is owned by Zenomax's parent company. Alot of smoke in mirrors around leadership and decision makers. 
---
From the wiki: "As of 2007, Weaver held a 33% stake in the company.[7] In 2007, it was valued at $1.2 billion, when it raised $300 million from Providence Equity Partners in exchange for a 25% stake.[24][25][26] In 2010, Providence invested another $150 million for an undisclosed stake.[27][28] In May 2016, it was valued at $2.5 billion"
---
Cool got you both added
---
This is why I don't mess with traps (I could probably do more damage throwing the raw scrap at the enemy and you have to repair them after they've been used) and keep at least 500 steel in my stash at all times.
---
I really don't hang on to mods because of their weight.  I ignore them unless I can use them immediately or leave a choice one for someone else while making a gift bag of plans, junk, legendaries and other stuff I don't need.  Lately I've been leaving stuff in the blue suitcase at the Watoga Station, and it's always nice to come back after a loop to see that people have taken things.
---
You got to kill the duping monster while he has hes baggy on the ground
---
Put the DENSE mod on your chest armor. Makes a world of difference.
---
That's what mine looked like too, because I found out it wasn't actually a real chassis anymore. The game at one point thought I had got out of it. The parts ended up in my inventory individually, and the chassis recalled like normal to my inventory. So I was stuck in a fake chassis. It was aggravating to say the least. Hours wasted trying to fix it. Still have no idea how I finally fixed it, as I was just doing the same thing over and over again because all my research from multiple sources said it would work. Apparently it worked the first time for everyone but me. &gt;\_&lt;
---
I've been farming a while and have never picked up an explosive gun. Are these especially rare or do they only come from certain events? 
---
To add to what the others have been saying, slow firing rate, high damage per shot which only gets better with legendary perks, but the ammo is fairly cheap to make and you can make a bunch of it.
---
It uses minigun ammo, but since it fires much slower and hits harder, you can stretch 500 rounds over many more corpses.
---
I’d most likely completely switch to a PA build if I could get a TSE gatling.
---
Pretty much agree with this. They're annoying as fuck, no real reward for taking one down, and consume too many resources. My saving grace is that when they do land, they WILL get a crippled wing and never fly again from a legendary shotgun. 
---
Especially since it would be fixed the next day, just like the nuke zones. 
---
I never made it past the "area" indicator around the building, does the  wendigo spawn there or am I supposed to do something to move it forward?
---
Yep the energy one is the Gatling plasma I have one
---
I'm not. I'm telling you about 2 things you have control over that is the ONLY difference between crashing none stop or not at all.
---
But i get it, blame the game. Patches ultimately won't fix your problems.
---
Even at launch i didn't crash daily. And since then I've crashed less and less
---
What level are you? With proper perks you should be able to kill lvl 50s without any trouble. 
---
Yeah, I like this idea. It would allow us to have unlimited stash space. Just put it in the shared stash, log into WeaponsMuleOne or JunkInMyTrunkMuleTwo, loot it all and log out.
---
i have i think 1k rounds of .556 in my stash if you want them you can give me however many caps you want
---
PSN: CGJ15
---
i'll be on in about 15 mins
---
Solved easier and truer to core design by the most common suggestion - a 30 or 60 min timer access to join the same world we recently left. Eventually I hope to see containers we can build or even a multi character base which might offer an item buffer space container as one of the reasons to invest in getting one.. its in my official feedback / idea response to the last Inside the Vault call for feedback.
---
I meant just the fist on the actually power armor arm. Not power fist. 
---
Yes, but they were not objects. It was over the Ohio River at the Mothman museum
---
Have you saw the one in the flat woods responder HQ? It's a skeleton sitting with a teddy bear that has a fadora, is smoking a cigar and has stacks of money in front it like a loan shark.
---
So scrapping a weapon and getting steele and a wad of chewed gum and needing screws steel and 4 leaf clover just to repair that same weapon makes perfect sense?
---
Err they actually have updated us every week if you pay attention.
---
But i assume you thought weekly patches when they never said that right?
---
Oh okay thanks I’ll look up to get it 
---
Amazing I have 1482 .45 that I'll save for you. So just think of how many caps you would want for the rest of the bullets 
---
Business is good when I am on the 6th hole. \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/QFrmBh0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QFrmBh0.jpg))  
---
I am currently scouting other locations as I get an odd bug that if I load into a world with a nuke already set off it destroys my camp. And well my camp is expensive to fix. 
---
Following to see what you find out. -Normie1
---
Just go through you gear I would think maybe you have a bugged item that's killing the trade I would guess? Have you maybe traded a weapon that could be a dup at all? Would not surprise me if you been trading with a lot of people it might happen. Seen people with things like attack effects in there inventory like the snalygastors spit. Just do a quick look for odd things like that.
---
Pretty much the same. 200% from bloodied multiplies base weapon dmg and explosive, adding up to the same as tse. Accuracy is where bloody really shines  
---
At low level (15-25) you can get the plans to craft it from Harper's Ferry vendor. 
---
Honestly, getting to level with the first surge of people and everyone not knowing anything at once was pretty special. I was salty about black friday as I bought 2 copies, one for me and a friend (motherfucker never plays, stop taking care of your 3 kids under 5 and play video games with your old college roommate dammit). Got over it after a bit though. Feel like I've gotten my copies moneys worth and my friends, even if he's still level 10...
---
Oh, I did not see that icon before. Time to make a trip to the atom store.
---
Master Heavy Gunners for life!!
---
I haven't actually seen any feedback like this actually implemented. Does "pass this along" actually mean "do absolutely nothing because we already have your money sucker" because that is what it sounds like.
---
Dude, trim that down and you'll crash less
---
Does that mean ammo will screw up when crafting it? That could easily exceed the number when I do craft it. Especially if super duper procs during that time frame. 
---
&gt; I had the idea of making events true level based
---
The thing is players are soft capped at level 50. If you see a level 63 it's because the monster is setup to be player level +13.
---
More levels just gives you more options but don't make you any more powerful. I don't think Bethesda ever considered how to raise the level soft cap, the SPECIAL stats can't scale any more without fundamentally breaking any idea of a "build".
---
Players are already one-shotting each other with 2SE weapons. Normal monsters, even level 96 Deathclaws are completely trivialized already. Adding power creep above and beyond this would just raise everyone else up to the same level of insta-gibbing all content.
---
This isn't desirable. Fix the exploits, nerf the heck out of 2SE and if at all possible take corrective action against those who actively abused exploits. Bring the game back in to a balanced state in its current form.
---
I am earnestly hoping that right now someone at Bethesda is working on the tool &amp; tracking necessary to identify and level repercussions against exploiters.
---
With scrapper it puts it closer to 9 I think.
---
The Gilded Grasshopper (if we are talking about the same one) is inside Appalchian Antiques in the Cranberry Bog
---
Two shot is better that bloodied even at low health.
---
Alright well that explains it... And there's no way to select from who shows up. 
---
Nor when building in my camp, but when trying to deploy power armor
---
Do you have to restart the bonuses if you miss? 
---
At what percent health do you get to 200% base damage. I’m usually at 50% health
---
Dupers.
---
I'm pushing 200 hours played and at least 75 are farming. I've recieved 2 explosive and 0 tse.
---
I fought one of these terrible creatures in launch week. I took a video and just assumed it would be a patched glitch. I was such a low level to see such a rare site!
---
Top floor of fort defiance.
---
Are you trying to trade for a certain item? Maybe something went wrong during installing and that one item is causing a crash. That could be my only guess why today is the issue. Don't think there was a patch or anything that would change since yesterday.
---
I get that idea, but people are still making odd floating buildings and I doubt any number of restrictions are going to counter that except for a complicated physics system with columns, beams, braces, weight, etc. 
---
Now, with some of these restrictions, I built a split gable roof with a clerestory type of wall ([kind of like this](https://www.ranbuild.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/skillion-9.jpg)), but cannot place a wall to block off the vertical clerestory section because it needs support or a wall all the way to the floor, partly defeating the purpose. 
---
I suppose what I'm getting at is the current building system leaves a lot to be desired. They've taken a few steps forward with the building UI, but further steps back with these restrictions. I've also noticed they've taken away the ability to stack multiple foundations on top of eachother in order to retain a 3d grid when building, or creating larger "walls" of concrete foundation. Just hoping for some improvements.
---
How are so many of you people so bad that they use all your ammo and break your gear?!
---
It’s like real life all over again
---
The problem too often is that the people on her kill her too quick... If you do that you get crap loot. You have to let her heal a few times.
---
Food, XP, remoteness, shock value.
---
Wow this is great, idk the value of bullets though so would you do like 350 caps? 
---
Do you have numbers? I’m not disagreeing with you, I’m just more of numbers/math guy
---
The two-shot Gatling I got was from Whitespring, but I don't really farm. I usually only do a quick run through if I don't see people around. The explosive Gatling was just a random area off a Legendary Radstag lol. I don't farm for weapons so it was all just luck.
---
let me guess, your definition of "raiding" is just being mean huh :p
---
Enough to hit nerd rage, and with nerd rage you'll be doing more then tse full health build. Lots of usefull perks/items to keep you alive at that low health
---
I just kill it. Free lead delivery!
---
nah I'm a melee build just keep some rounds around for friends and scorchedbeasts
---
I’d just think building a cute lil suburban home with all the amenities and matching furnishings would be put on the back burner until the zombies, minigun wielding mutants and sonic boom dragons were no longer a threat? 
---
Around level 47ish I felt like I could reasonably attempt to even take one on. I kinda wish they were more like the dragons in Skyrim where you could get a bead on them in the air. That they would be grounded after a certain amount of damage. I had one attacking my camp and if it wasn’t for constantly repairing my turrets it would’ve been a futile exercise even dealing with it. I like challenging enemies but the scorch beasts are just bad. 
---
When I make my CAMP’s I like to put as much effort into it as possible, and it’s no fun if I’m the only person who sees it. 
---
This time around I made a trading post, so I try and get as much foot traffic through it as possible, so it’s right up the road from the Overseer’s camp, directly on the road. Many new players can go through it. I’ve got water purifiers and a farm, so people can take what they need. 
---
I’ll also catch new players and ask them if they want me to craft and mod their weapons, giving them ammo like .38 and .44 rounds. 
---
Yeah, I have an explosive smg, but yeah, sooo much tse on the marketplace I thought it must be a common drop
---
I'd love to set up a shop at whitespring but damn does my camp not be able to place down due to people with their turret base grinding camps nearby 
---
Easier, because you've got to at least hit a radroach. With a TSE you only need to hit near a target, generally.
---
What energy weapon based perks?
---
The Science! Crafting perks are required to mod it; the ammo is under Energy in the crafting section, but I haven’t checked to see if 2mm EC has it’s weight reduced by Batteries Included; the Grounded mutation does reduce the damage you do with it (but that’s not a perk); I’m not sure if the Energy weapons, Heavy Weapons, or Small Guns Bobbleheads affects it’s damage, I haven’t checked (I’d assume the Energy weapon bobble head based on how Grounded affects it), but in terms of energy damage resistance, (I believe)it does ballistic damage, not energy.
---
Ive made the nuka cola, donut holes, mac n cheese and meatball sandwiches out of the book so far.
---
Its been a great experience. You could never get me to cook before these gaming cookbooks were out.. And now im making dinner every week for the family!
---
Everything has been so tasty too!
---
sure on now btw
---
Well you don't exactly spread good cheer as a raider now do you? ;)
---
Bethesda doesn't know the meaning of end game. They are used to programming a game that ends after the last quest is finished.
---
Log out and back in again.
---
I constantly craft random crap and build camps a lot. I like repairing as little as possible. I’ve never known how it is to have so much scrap I am looking for excuses to use it, if anything I have to put things on hold. I just like crafting a lot.
---
If you liked the super sledge and obviously have the balls to kill a scorchbeast why not try the mayor for a day quest in watoga? it gives you a kick ass weapon with a cool fight at the end, there’s a bit of lore in it too 
---
I have ultracite or prime plans for them. I've yet to make them though. 
---
Every single thing you ever buy will be cheaper down the road. Every single thing. 
---
You didn't get screwed. 
---
You don't deserve anything extra. 
---
Even without the perk they do more damage than any other combo.
---
Im planning on making those brahmin fries next week!
---
Yaaaaay! Nice :)
---
Bloodied is 5% damage increase based on HP missing. 5% per 5% missing maxing at 95%. Two shot gives a second shot based on the standard receiver for that gun. For guns without a receiver that improves Dame, it is a 100% increase, with weapons that have hardened receivers it's like 80% (eg: with my perks a handmade does 103, 2shot handmade does 186). The other factor is that the second shot of a 2 shot can miss.
---
Conclusion: In practice 2 shot is nearly always better.
---
Good points!
---
Molotov is better since it doesn't knock the already dead ghouls into the stratosphere.
---
I'm still over here wacking shit with a ski sword.
---
Thanks, I appreciate the update. I did get an email today stating the invoice has been accepted and to expect the bag to ship once manufactured, in 4-6 months.
---
Yup sure do
---
Now that’s the good shit, thanks
---
My issue isn't killing them; I kill them easily.
---
My issue is that they're not worth it. The fight isn't fun, challenging, or rewarding. It's just an annoying chore that really takes away from the good aspects of the game.
---
You rock thank you I'll add you 
---
Best bet is to a quiet server with not many people on it and don't advertise it...or go with a WS nuke first, the SQ
---
*points to my username*
---
The regular SBs stay at level 50. They become really easy to kill with proper perks. A general rule in Fallout games - if you find yourself in a situation where the enemy takes forever to kill, you engaged it too soon and should probably run instead of wasting ammo. 
---
If you slowly back pedal and spam melee slashes you can hit them. I've killed a few with out VATS with my Super Sledge doing that.
---
I have a group of gamer friends (about 8 total) and I was the only one that bought FO76. I pre-ordered and once the reviews came out they promised not to buy the game until a lot changes were implemented or if it drops under 30...
---
You're welcome
---
I've finally sold off all of my legendaries I don't use, all 800 something tactical marine helmets I crafted for a reason that has a very long story behind it, and junk I have too much of. The only thing left is selling off the hundreds of med-x, psycho, etc that I'll never get around to using, and finally start selling my 900 stimpaks once those are gone
---
I got in a fight with 3 at once. So much spam.
---
Ive compared the same bloodied explosive to tse weapon, screen dmg is pretty much the same
---
I've ONLY crashed today, and it's ONLY when trading.
---
I have under 10 Items, excluding maybe another 10 Aid Items.
---
Thanks for the info. I think I may already have the plans, just never messed with the weapon.
---
Noob question, whats tse?
---
Near whitesprings so it’s a convenient location.
---
Next to a vendor.  
---
Next to a common event that drops legendaries.
---
Next to a good location to farm mutations.
---
My crops for my vegetable starch farm.
---
Opposite corner of map to vault 76, so I can fast travel to it for free then fast travel to other locations cheaply (and vice Vera’s for vault 76).
---
Get a shotgun with enforcer perk-&gt;cripple head stops screech and crippling both wings does cause them to land but they need an open enough space to do so otherwise they will float around until they regenerate. Side note, crippling every limb of the SBQ makes her just sit there and do nothing. Side side note can cripple one deathclaw leg causing them to limp, both legs makes them just lay on the ground.
---
Get dense chest mod for normal armor, reduces their dps to nothing. Don't even have to use stimpaks anymore against them.
---
Last but not least, they drop prime receiver plans but rarely
---
Are they annoying? without a doubt but they are the only way outside of the SBQ for getting prime receivers. 
---
It's opening the trade menu that crashes it.
---
Happens to me occasionally. Just relog 
---
Explosive is still way overpowered on the double barrel, and instigating can fuck her up on the first shot. If you nuke the edge of the fissure so you can stand next to it without dying when the nuke hits, and you headshot the queen with it while she's coming out of the crater, you will do some insane damage. Especially if you're the only one there so she doesn't get ultra buffed up
---
Cool, if it turns out it's there i may pay another visit and see if I can get the right wire 
---
I personally thought they were always bugged because I kill them often and usually get no good items. Skin and bones are decent I guess..
---
XD this has been the best thing I’ve read lately 
---
All of my weapons are things I've picked off of enemies.
---
Joining your world right now
---
There's several gyms, like in the hotel at Flatwoods, and the one at the Charleston fire department where you can pick up weights, which give lots of lead.
---
Plus, many food cans give lead. Pencils too. 
---
Considering my weapon heals them about 85% of the time, ya.. I avoid them whenever possible.
---
I think radaway is probably a less egregious use of technology than a decontamination shower. No drugs or booze for sure. Also not going to eat prepackaged prewar food. 
---
This is a wonderful idea
---
There's plenty of places on the golf course, you don't need to put it right at the golf club. 
---
Yeah, and FO4 was already a downgrade from FO3. I played FO2 and 3 for hundred of hours. I just bought FO4, I am level 50 and that's gonna be the end of it. So, I didn't have much expections for 76, though I hoped I was wrong, but it's worse than I had expected.
---
I mean when you start your post with the words "Fucking. Shut. Up." as if consumers aren't allowed to voice their displeasure with a product they paid for and can't get their money back for, what kind of response to you expect to get? No, Fallout isn't in the same state as when it launched, but it's still not GOOD and it still doesn't WORK, in fact it just recently broke yet again.
---
Can it be fun? Yes, sure! but I've seen that a lot of the fun people have is in spite of the game instead of content handed out by the game. A majority of players have given up playing the game-game and have turned it into extreme home makeover and even that is barely functional, with nonsensical reasons for walls not being able to adjoin stairs, yet campfires can stack infinitely.
---
Fallout 76 is, in any reasonable estimation, a joke, and people aren't going to shutup about it just because you feel like it's an echo chamber and you want people to be nice. People continue to bitch about Fallout 76 because as George Santayana is credited as writing "Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
---
The instant people move on and stop thinking about the problems, about the mistakes, as soon as focus is lost, they repeat the failings. We want to believe in the good in people, we want to believe that others have our best interests at heart. This is why when a new game comes out from a publisher that repeatedly abuses its consumer base, we go "Maybe this time will be better." and we buy it anyway, because that once burning hot ember of offense, that feeling of betrayal, has faded and become a pale memory that we no longer really think about and we dare to hope that despite all history and logic, things will be different.
---
People don't shut up because there is an overarching climate of companies taking advantage of consumers and not caring about producing a quality product. It's not just about Fallout 76, it's about the state of gaming. Fallout 76 simply exemplifies this modern ethos that anything can be fixed later regardless of how poor it actually is, and that we as consumers should be happy to have it. It is a highly visible target, and the ethics surrounding the game, and the fact that everything surrounding it just keeps producing new things to be stunned by, means that these burning coals of Fallout 76 will remain in our memory much longer and hotter than most. Yes, dealing with a problem too big for anyone person to change IS exhausting, and if you want to bow out, that's your prerogative, but if other people want to keep fighting, keep showing that it's not okay and insisting for something better, they have every right to and perhaps a responsibility.
---
If you tag along (or are doing) the last BoS quest that takes you through Watoga to the bottom of the Bog, you can easily kill enough. The last time I helped someone try to do it (he disconnected right after I killed the last SB in the Cavern and the lovely checkpoint system took him back to Watoga, so he quit) I ended up killing 8 or 9. Can't say they dropped the correct parts though, because it doesn't seem worth it over the recipes that only call for one part so I didn't even look to see if I could make it.
---
I think I had a teammate sharing good with salt rank 3 at the time though.
---
No problem, I'll contact you when I am on later today. If you get good deals before then go for it - I won't be upset.
---
Depends on gun and HP at the time. With a hardened receiver gun at 15-19% health they will be about the same which is what my post says
---
Golf balls
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
Nope but I have a bloodied explosive combat shot gun and a tse combat shotgun. I use the tse. Plus If I'm not nearly dead the tse is way better. I have used the low health build, and it isn't needed with the tse. At 50% health the tse will put out more damage.
---
No I'm gonna hoard as much as I can especially the 556 so I'll probably still be on the market when you get on 
---
Anywhere around cranberry bog, but why not prime while you’re at it?
---
Mutated ferns (flash ferns) are what you’re looking for. Look under trees. 
---
Atoms are strictly for cosmetic improvement, not gameplay/QOL improvements. 
---
I just made it to level 50 the other day. The highest I’ve seen so far is 65. Though I don’t know how much difference that makes. They are a shitty enemy to fight. It’s like level 14 snallygaster. You think they are only level 14 no big deal but they are still brutal without terrain to help out. 
---
I've had to get rid of everything I don't use on a regular basis. All my survival role-playing ideas of keeping stocks of canned food and water had to be abandoned.
---
This would be fantastic! I drop cloth every day 
---
true
---
I agree. What's worse, I've been waiting to see some of these "great" suggestions to get implemented. Instead I just see more crap in their Atom Shop I can't buy because Bethesda can't program a proper tracker if their lives depended on it so I can't complete something like 20 challenges. FFS Bethesda.
---
I would love to get that feature for many reasons, but for transferring stuff it is still risky, for various possible reasons: someone may notice you and steal your stuff while switching chars / server full / server CRASH and REBOOT / random bugs with containers i.e. not showing loot.
---
Overseers camp because its the main spot to find and help those on their way. Also because Grahm comes past now and then.
---
I find it more interesting that we have to listen to tapes, I can listen to one and still move around and not restricted to one area, unlike when a npc was explaining something and having to wait, especially if the npc didn't give you a quest 
---
Sometimes tho I do forget to press play straight away and found a few tapes have gave me some side missions that have been in my inventory for a while lolx
---
Oh thanks Gilded Grasshopper was in Fallout 4 I just appreciate the homage to 4 
---
Right near north kanawha lookout, if you’re facing the stairs, turn south, jump over the pokey spikes, take a few steps and it’s there 
---
Try playing Guild Wars 2 with her instead, it's a bit more new player friendly for an MMO.
---
It can also be used to craft ultracite ammo for prime weapons.
---
Rose isn't.
---
Then I got nothing. :( been trading in the same area of map? Maybe that could be somehow an issue. Just have a quick look to make sure you  have no strange item that might of been out in there from an attack some times there is a bug there.  Sorry I can't be any more help. Just thinking what I would do if it was buggy like that for me. 
---
There are NPCs just like Sky....oh wait
---
I can trade for .50 cal balls 1:1
---
They banned several people for using Cheat Engine and Reshade. We had multiple posts here. 
---
That sounds overpowered
---
Not a bad idea at all man i would love this.
---
You’re welcome

---
If u don’t need them they will bring you some good caps 
---
I am sorry to burst you bubble but neither of those look like the assault rifle they have box or belt and this has Clío or drum,those are squad assault weapons and these were standard infantry equipment before the laser weapons were introduced, the assault rifle is long and tube shaped with a collapsible wooden stock whereas the m249 and mínimo are boxy and usually fixed stock it would Be more accurate to say that it is a Lewis gun with the mag on the Side instead of on top
---
I can provide the team with :
---
Glass steel, screws - ceiling fan
---
Cloth - couch, pillows, and newspaper
---
Leather - chair ? (Not sure if we get leather from chairs in f4)
---
So very many coffee cups - ceramic
---
Springs, gears, copper, glass, wood, - various tables, lamps, clock, 
---
As a plus I can toss in some tiny tatoes and carrots and build the team a guitar chair.
---
Thanks, appreciate the offer! Unfortunately I'm on PS4 since all my buddies play on it. Hopefully I can find it tonight. 
---
 you will never collect more options for playing,  Collecting and Hope is your only option 
---
Thats a good possibility, you going into the trade could be tipping it over the edge, good news is you are probably trashing their plans as well. I'll try a trade with you later if you want. 
---
Word of advice from someone with 300+ hours in, take your time. If you rush to end game, there isn’t much to do currently, so enjoy the early &amp; middle game where all the content is!
---
Good luck on your job interview 
---
Chewing gum and four leaf Clovers? No, it's plain and simple materials, most of which you get from other weapons, and a couple you can salvage from other things. It's really not as complicated as you make it seem, and the materials are bountiful. 
---
I'm really saying it's not worth throwing how easily that fits into the entire rest of the crafting system just to make it more complicated to repair weapons. Especially since there's harder weight limits now so you'd have to lug around really heavy spares just to fix your stuff. The mats system makes that massively easier.
---
Going through my stash stockpile of mods makes me wish for some way to tell if I can already just make the mod and not need the standalone mod anymore.
---
I can see cases where you still might want a mod even though you can make it, but indicating the status would make inventory management easier.
---
Shotguns is where it gets confusing to me. ive proven only one extra projectile gets fired yet again screen dmg is virtually the same between the two
---
No it’s by no means an assault rifle why it even exists in the first place is beyond me
---
That might have been me. When I logged in after the most recent update, I was carrying 20k nuka cola quantums that I could neither sell (I could barely move), store or drink (rads). I dropped most of them in front of other players. I kept 1k for myself.
---
Market76 
---
That's where the most traffic is though that's the point, how often do people go towards the fissure site area of the golf course. I only see people at the golf club or the resort. Nowhere else 
---
Some I've found for free, others I've bought. If I buy stuff then I can sell them more stuff. lol
---
They already made my Apparel section much more bloated now that my 60+ straight jackets aren't stackable.
---
yeah I always kill him after he gives me the prize, he's been constantly bugging me lately
---
&gt; For the X01, there are 5 tiers and I believe this is tiered by rarity.
---
This is actually true for all PA models, though the X-01's tiering is for complete mods while the other models use the tier lists for mod recipes (and follow the same groupings). The only location currently referencing Tier 5 mod recipes for T-series power armor is Vendor Bot Phoenix.
---
Headlamps aren't included in the tiering, but the list for X-01 headlamps is included in the full leveled list for the vendor--which is good, since it means that the headlamps aren't crowding out "real" mods on the table that it rolls to determine which X-01 mods to offer.
---
Is the Jet Pack really that rare?  I hopped at the Whitespring Bunker for a bit trying to get a full set of scout armor, and happened to get the Jet Pack mod after about an hour.
---
Meanwhile, I've been hopping Patrol Duty, Watoga, and Harpers Ferry for weeks and STILL don't have the handmade gun plans.
---
Lol you got the wrong guy I'm having very little problems... I'm loving. It 
---
TSE heavy energy weapons actually aren’t affected by legendary effects. They are exactly the same as a non legendary energy weapon.
---
I know but i was stating in fallout lore, it looks nothing like what tan  assault rifle in our era looks like and neither of the weapons you listed accurately fit the description of the aforementioned weapon 
---
I did a few workshops but the plans I got were mostly repeats so I stopped. I'll do it again for a bit.
---
i must've dropped some for weight in my stash i have 604 so you can have it for 100 caps
---
Fo76 all of my friends died in the bombs RP is just so realistic, eh?
---
I appreciate it, but I think I'm going to wait until the next Patch and see if they do anything about the Dupers giving servers Autism.
---
Works for me thank you
---
Camden park and the finding area of fort defiance both have plastic plates, cutlery and cups
---
I kinda got the impression it might gave been fake? Especially the reshade thing? There were a lot of fabrications flying around back then, and gaming media was publishing it all without even bothering to check it.
---
Well what I mean is that you can place it a bit down the hill as to not be right at the doors. People will still see your shop especially if you have structures to draw them in. If your on xbox I can show you what I mean. 
---
WoW LoOk At ME iM eLItE rIgHT GuYs?
---
Lucky. I finished the Order of Mysteries but didn't get anything very interesting.
---
 "Hey guys, thanks for commenting about this issue. I can confirm that this is going to be fixed in a future\* update. "
---
^(\*Future meaning anytime between now and when we decide we got enough money and have no need to keep this game running anymore.)
---
No, I appreciate it. I have so few items that I'm certain they're not the case, though I did check. Most are just normal stock weapons.
---
and re-logging it's all back... I wish they would fix this stuff
---
I pre-ordered for $50....
---
If you want to be first in line, you need to pay more. Every single video game drops in price when sales numbers drop off to capture more of the market at lower price points. That is standard practice in the industry and if you feel ripped off, you ripped yourself off.
---
Are you saying that you want to shave off your mustache, and put the hairs into different containers around your camp??
---
I completely agree!!!
---
Ah good, one more part of the game I need to avoid due to Bethesda's shit programming skills.
---
Happened a lot to me when I was hunting for the longcoat. Could have something to do with running too fast but I'm not sure. I noticed if you slowly walk up near it, it comes towards you. I just waited and never had any problems after.
---
yup, I encounter this bug all the time, while I'm sprinting I usually decide to open my map quickly to make sure I'm headed the right way only to flip back to my character and watch my AP drain as I stand still, it doesn't stop draining until I run again and then stop running. My character will even start panting like they are out of breath just by standing still, it's super annoying
---
Do you have plans for Neón signs or any ultra cite shogun or .50 ammo cuz ny primed weapons ran out and I cba to craft them 
---
Sounds pretty normal to me actually. They do that stuff all the time. Just wait next time. 
---
5mm, 38, and 44 ammo do not have a weight when using bandolier. IE you can carry an infinite amount.
---
I snapped a picture- I'll take a closer gander the next time it pops up as my loading screen :-D
---
I had assumed it was something more... sinister.
---
Actuall i think that would defeat the purpose of the 'survival' charactaristic of this game. To maintain a somehow immersion it is neccesary to micro-manage certain things. Even if they are sometimes a   
---
little annoying (and sometime even a real pita). Me personally would find it rather boring if the game manages more and more of thise things on its own.
---
&gt;You can one shot anything but the giant bat dragons.
---
You can one shot those too, radicool etc build 
---
Reading this has me reconsidering, but I picked mine for cheap fast travel on the eastern half of the map, near Harper's Ferry (but away from the river because it kept spawning me underwater). Vault 76 provides cheap travel on the western half.
---
I think I'll move a little southwest to be closer to Whitespring and Watoga, while still being in the same vicinity. I'll probably scope out resources too.
---
They do make weird floaty looking buildings but there's still always technically some kind of anchor on the ground. I'm not defending it I'm just saying that's probably part of what it's based on. Hopefully they'll make it a little less rigid. 
---
Always. I smelt my metal too. It's a real chore.
---
With the crafting stations not working I usually get it after I've moved my camp, but I did a test and found out that no benches worked, including ones fixed in the world.
---
You need some Nuka Cola t-51b in your life
---
And then they one shot you with a TSE. The end
---
Not stairs, but what about half width walls? Half width roofs? Why cant i use my atom shop floors on anything but full-size floors?
---
You also need destructible base items for taking workshops over. Some people like to box off the main ws station. 
---
Lol yeah, running around with Speed Demon so might have been too quick for him. He was barely around the corner from the nearby hut.
---
Preach brotha
---
I set mine up that way, but almost never have any business. It’s more for like a role play kind of feel. 
---
Somebody never fought a Cliff-racer.
---
This and it has been noted for awhile now we are just waiting still for Bethesda to correct it along with the exploits and the abuse from them.
---
Hopefully we will see something done this month or next month.
---
They are not even the most annoying flying enemy that beth has ever created. Probably second most for sure.
---
So my combat shotgun with legendary armor ignore and superior piercing mag... doesn't need the piercing mag? I am sorry I am slow. Am I helping my gun or gimping my gun?
---
Make it worth 100 caps haha
---
The level lock is specific to vendors. You can get them at any level from Patrol Duty, it's just a lot harder because as far as I know that quest can give you schematics for every craftable weapon in the game. I've seen people that have farmed that quest dozens of times now with no handmade plans, so you are very fortunate.
---
Yeah, you gotta cut down on the paranoia. The entire known universe did not conspire to sink FO76 out of spite. Bethesda did that all on their own with their shoddy work. 
---
Is it too late to get in on this action also?
---
well ive won it like 3 times apparent im getting 100k dolars 
---
Wait. I’m missing something I think. What rare responder vendor?
---
Cornholio!
---
To me, it comes down to cost per entertainment hour. If I play for 60 hours, one dollar per hour seems cheap. At 120 hours, 50 cents per hour is a total no brainer. And so on. 
---
&gt; I admire your envy
---
Such a good game tho!
---
Oh cool. Havent tested anything with radicool yet. Melee is the shit in this game. It's not memey like the TSEs but efficient and obviously OP.
---
I didn't get the bullets
---
Happens in the map/menu too. Just more poor programming on Bethesda's part. Nothing surprising in the least.
---
SOMEBODY, ANYBODY who is on Xbox please for the love of god donate some ammo to me .
---
Is that the FO version of "honey, can you carry my purse?"
---
I just collect of stuff out of habit and wanna sell it for cheap to players who might need it more then I do instead of selling it to vendors who in return sell things at expensive ass prices
---
Actually it was a Meme that was born from the E3 presentation for Fallout 4 while demoing the settlement building system, he said "It just works", He referenced back to that meme in the Fallout 76 release admitting the irony of that statement coupled with how buggy Fallout 4 (and all Bethesda games for that matter) were
---
Seems to be a pattern in Bethesda related MMOs.
---
http://i.imgur.com/FYcepGT.png
---
Yeah I guess I am, the vendor one makes sense tho because I found some on my 2nd character but didn’t know how good it was on my first considering I reached lvl 20 in the beta and overlooked most of the vendors
---
lol
---
I don't really understand what you are saying.
---
If you are looking for things only off of vendors, and not using every option the game offers, then you are making it harder on yourself to get those "certain" items. 
---
The letter set is 12500. I got it from claiming The workbench at Abandoned Bog Town. I found lots of recipes at The General's Steakhouse. 
---
Not completely. The other day I sold a guy a whole bunch of gears, screws and springs. 
---
Thank you so much 
---
Oh I didn't realize it was *that* far off
---
So, I got my first nuke last night as well OP. Did you follow the mainstream or nuke where you wanted? I'll admit I have in and nuked  whitespring.
---
Agreed. I have a big stockpile of low end plans, cosmetics, interesting but ultimately useless gear, stuff like that. But no one ever shops, so it just stays in the stash. You can list the stuff on market subs, but even then you’re not likely to get responses. 
---
lmaoooo good point...
---
New PvP mode
---
You can force them to land by crippling their wings...
---
Has anyone found the coal miner marker , I know we have 3 already but this is for future reference . I am trying to find it near the mount blair trainyard , I suspect . 
---
You're right, there is always at least one foundation. I ran into a workshop owned by another player once and they had placed a bunch of foundations with a stair and floating second floor piece on it for their turret towers. 
---
I guess all we can do it wait and provide feedback on the current system at this point.
---
I have to wonder how many unpaid interns are responsible for 76's code.
---
Nice list. Quick clarification:  Isn't this in the game already or do I not understand?
---
* Allow upgrades of legendary items if you have the plan for the base item - I have changed out every legendary ranged weapon I've got - hardened receivers, bigger capacity, etc.
---
If this is true that's awesome! If you're making videos about duping that's easy money with proof for B. You don't need to be a douche nozzle and promote game breaking bugs. 
---
All Rise is unique with the attachment on it unfortunately.
---
Also remember that both shots explode meaning even more area dmg
---
True true. I'll set up a shop nearby, but if no one comes or I get little to no business I'll just move my camp to a place with a big pond.
---
So why buy a game with always-on PvP. Or more specifically, why complain about a highly communicated core part of the game experience?
---
&gt;hes dressed as a confederate
---
Never understood why people are so excited to be the loser.
---
Again with the assumptions.  Banning no one and banning everyone?
---
In a perfect world they'd ban the obvious abusers, who have duped multiple items on multiple occasions and clearly are duping intentionally.
---
This not being a perfect world, who knows what Bethesda will do, if anything...
---
There’s going to be more to count. I’ve found gnomes on hillsides next to drain pipes with gold around them and a pick. Couple teddies dresses like soldiers paying homage to two graves. Found one holding a human arm plunging a toilet. The list just goes on. 
---
And who knows what kind of silly precious little scene with gnomes and bears were ruined by a super mutants random missile or grenade before you showed up. 
---
I look forward to those little scenes as much as I do the environmental story telling. 
---
that exploding meat thing you get on a quest works real well. anything stuck under a extractor or other things for the most part coming running towards it under the world and someone are able to get close enough to take damage from it .  If its mole rats, radrats, ghouls or dogs, you can put a fence down and they instantly warp back up and start chomping at it.  
---
“I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.”  Haha 
---
My favorite interaction with a prize bot was when I was stealthing up on some dupers to bandito/robin hood them and out of know where CONGRATULATIONS!
---
I was immediately one-shot through pacifist via TSE shotgun retribution.
---
Ah...I recently got an explosive Minigun on my heavy weapons alt, and Scorchbeasts are so hilariously easy now. I feel pretty much [like this now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHgZh4GV9G0)
---
Because when I have pacifist mode on, it means I don't want PVP on. That should also mean that no one else can damage me or my stuff.
---
I can't get mine into it either.  If you ever find the magic phrase that convinces him, fill me in.
---
World full :/
---
They should have replaced the perfectly preserved pie with a perfectly preserved pepperoni roll :D
---
I think you are missing at least one digit.
---
A big assumption in this thread is that bloodied is equal because damage is equal.
---
This assumes that whatever you’re shooting at isn’t shooting back at your gimped 4/5’s dead ass.
---
Practically speaking, a full health player using a TSE is going to have a much easier, low-stress time during the sh_tshow  that can be ScorchQueen battles.
---
its annoying because its range seems infinite, running away is no help
---
I'm going to keep my stache on my face thank you very much
---
I smell crickets
---
Really downvoted?  Lol what did I say?  
---
Yes she is.
---
It's not the first time I have seen the Elder Scrolls admin team doing stuff with FO76, someone in the sub got an email with Elder Scrolls all over it when communicating about FO76. I remember thinking it was odd at the time.
---
I agree with this, perhaps having workshops destructible but bases not? I'm fine with 'raiders', I want PvP servers so we can just be done with it.
---
I got a Prime receiver for the crossbow. I am truly blessed.....
---
*nods to bethesda*
---
That’s *very* country road of you.
---
I bought the tricentennial edition on launch, played through beta and have put 200 hours. Definitely got my money's worth, I did however ask for the free 500 atoms (guilty) when prices dropped. I love free shit, but I never complain about prices once I made a decision to buy, I just hope Bethesda put effort into this potential game as I love it.
---
As it stands with duping, and stability I've taken a break.  I'm hyped about what f76 will have in the future! 
---
Don't feel bummed out too much about it, we understand you but these posts have been here for a long time with many others. If you feel ripped off show them with your wallet, I'm just a general bum looking to artillery bombard someone's base (when it works)
---
Enjoy the show, so far so fun =)
---
I killed a this glowing deathclaw because it glitched and couldnt move
---
That’s why I was getting feedback to see if the juice is worth the squeeze like it is for melee
---
I still don't understand why the trouble for the canvas bag. I mean i love my helmet and i have it in my gaming room but its not like i bought it for the bag. The bag , map and our little bag of lads to place on the map, steelcase and our in game perks were all bonuses to me lol.
---
I just couldn't fathom all the trouble for a bag myself. 
---
I hope the next Fallout game comes with a Torso mold with arms. ;)
---
And Skyrim didnt have condition, 85% of weapons were not ammo based, and arrows are plentiful in the game. 
---
Skyrim's dragons are similar but Scorchbeasts are WAY more of a resource sink in terms of ammo and junk. 
---
Are these correlated to the real world markers?
---
Have you set off the nuke yet? Interested in scorchbeast queen
---
Technical you could find a legendary super sledge with the same legendary effects as all rise, much better options out there though
---
Dammit, Beth! Come on!
---
I’d love to have a nice chat about things, but you are being unnecessarily hostile for no real reason, we are all tuned in for the same thing, which is a resolution. You are just invalidating my experiences for no reason other than your experiences are different. That’s bullshit and I don’t want to talk anymore to a bullshitter 
---
I've seen them by the Mothman museum, was crazy to see so many just hang out
---
From just the Scorchbeast Queen. The normal scorchbeasts drop largely meaningless items. 
---
Two words; Chrome Minigun. 
---
What ya want? Realistically,
---
Lol you still visiting a subreddit for a game you don’t play?
---
I would like one foundation to make moving it easier, but not need to make a tower every time. 
---
I want pvp, too.  I, like most, just want it to be balanced, Haha. 
---
I mean there are people that go to Thailand to pay for things a person should definitely shit on them over and that's not worth raising an eyebrow.
---
This. I was on my phone. I'll check on the computer. 
---
It’s not bad no, but it is severely lacking in stuff to do.
---
i like this game :D 
---
Except no dragonrend :( 
---
Reeee Bethesda man bad.
---
Tesla is king of this its chain lighting attack is very powerful since most mobs have a 2 second lifespan.
---
&gt;You can't see anything when fighting them because they relentlessly spam their Sonic Boom as if they're button-mashing in a fighting game.
---
This is the only real problem with them. Even without an explosive prefix, a good .50 cal build will melt them before they can finish crawling out of a fissure, but once they're up in the air it's damn near impossible to see long enough to put more than a couple rounds on target at a time.
---
Actually everyone I found a way. Under conduit junction, there's one that looks like a giant bar. This can be placed inside a wall with the power connect sticking out one side and the conduit out there. Follow it up with a junction with a power connector on the other side and boom, power. Just thought I'd share
---
The bans for re-shade / other cosmetic mods appear to be attention seeking BS. 
---
It becomes a sticky note on the side of a white board. Then when one of the dev's walks by while double-fisting his Italian BMT from Subway, it can catch his eye and he'll think to himself "heck, I could code that in about 30 seconds and then it could sit for 40 days while we complie it into a patch." He then snatches it up, fixes the code, passes the notes over to get included in the patch notes, then gets back to work on how to dial scorchbeats attacks \*down\* to 11.
---
I can't stop laughing 
---
\+1 on this. I used to always farm the crazy cat house E of Morgantown (\~58 plastic per trip), but now I just kill the super mutants north of Whitesprings and in Harper's Ferry and use the scrapper perk to get 6-7 plastic per laser pistol.
---
Also, every time you do a Whitesprings run, pick up the plates, dog bowls, cat bowls, golf balls, pool table balls, etc.
---
That was never what pacifist mode was for. If you don’t want to PvP then play a game that doesn’t have PvP as a core mechanic.
---
Cool, I must go and try this out. Thanks.
---
That patch hasn't happened yet bud
---
Because I am moron.
---
Is this oven your...final solution...to noobs?
---
[](/tempestgaze)
---
I’ve seen this criticism of the game in reviews before I bought it and Dunkey really showed it a lot in his. I’ve only ran into to it 3 times so far. I personally think it’s hilarious when light come out of a mountain so gloriously. 
---
That I cannot do but appreciate the offer 
---
I'll figure this out. Thanks for the input.
---
Yeah but risks are necessary for reward in game settings. There are containers throughout the world, there is an element of challenge finding a deserted corner , using sneak. It is part of the current gameplay. My feedback is centered around keeping current gameplay wins and making improvements directly dictated by the current design
---
I noticed that like half the time i fast travel to my camp its not loaded. The water around it isn't loaded and some textures as well. After 10 seconds or so everything loads.
---
I wonder if the reason we don't have a fast travel mat for our camps is because you could end up falling through where your camp would be while it was loading. 
---
Yea, you've got to jump through a pretty large amount of hoops ( %20 Hp and getting all the perk cards etc not sure if Revenant is required or just suggested) 
---
I've seen Melees kill my entire team and than me in PVP because when a Melee VATS you don't have to deal with lag and you just flat out teleport, i don't know why they didn't at least make it a Perk like FO4, hell even shooting out their powercores does literally nothing to slow them down.  
---
You should have expected this when we all played the beta and none of the beta issues were addressed before it launched. 
---
The crashing is so bad I don’t even bother capturing workshops because I’ll disconnect before I even collect the resources I was hoping to collect but instead wasted resources on. 
---
This is also why most of us are level 100 and getting bored. Capturing workshops and spending time getting the resource stuff going and getting disconnected before collecting anything is getting old. The only thing we can do without being interrupted and losing progress is kill shit. 
---
I ran into six once. It started as one, then three, and while fighting them I ran into a crevice which spawned another.... there were six total by the time I decided to find a new server.
---
Herpes.
---
Omg so much yes Haha. At least have some with pie, some with roll

Game keys go for 17-27€ max these days. I try to look on the bright side and picked up an extra copy for my brother.
---
'Member when Nintendo let you play multiplayer for free with up to  people who didn't own the game? I 'Member.
---
Hahahaha you won't play a game because of screen burn in. That's great.
---
Not sure if this on the list because I didn’t want to scour the whole thing, but it would be nice if they brought back the ability to change armor type like in 4 i.e; change a light armor into a medium armor or vice versa. I could understand needing the plan to craft heavy sturdy and light to be able to do this or add in a new perk card but I really feel it would benefit the game greatly instead of leaving finding good gear to the specifications you want to chance.
---
Thank you!  It tells me I've completed the quest after I find a random wendigo and put on my clown suit while feeling dirty and shameful, then it's back again the next day.  Actually, maybe it's worth the shame for the daily chance at caps and xp.  That idea feels dangerously similar to prostitution......

---
Yeah.  Got the small set - those and light boxes are what I need to pretty much have all the (non-atom) camp mods.  Got 5k saved up, over halfway there :D
---
There is a house outside the watoga school not to far away that you can find tons of cat bowls which are good for 2 or 4 plastic per bowl. 
---
It's also boring as fuck. Spend more time watching the loading screen than playing. 
---
I didn't kill one until I was gifted my prototype armor, congratulations on earning that win. 
---
13gbp sounds right. This is essentially a fallout 4 online expansion. A broken one, with unfixed bugs carried over and cheaters crashing servers 
---
You prefer the hunting rifle to the lever action?
---
Not sure if this will help, but if you remove the slanted roof above where you would like to place the half wall (without support) and place instead the roof with the peak, it has 4 mounts to connect to walla. You place the roof, then the half wall, remove the roof, and replace with slanted. I believe this should assist with your desired effect without the need for "walls all the way to the floor". Please let me know if this helps.
---
Thing is, everyone would need to play with the same mods installed. At that point "modders" become "developers."
---
You can easily do this now with marsupial. Plus it would actually be more realistic wouldnt it? Most animals in real life cant climb a ladder either but people can. Also considering most of the major fights in this game take place in an open field that's kind of a moot point. Its not game breaking for someone to climb a ladder to escape a mob who cant climb
---
It's totally random. I think there's over a dozen prefixes for the same tier as explosive prefix. Then there's also a similar amount of prefixes in the same tier as two-shot prefix. So the odds of you getting a two-shot explosive (which for most guns is the Holy Grail) are pretty much one in a few hundred. Meaning if you get a few hundred legendary weapons, one might be a two-shot explosive.
---
I had pretty decent luck for explosives, got a few shotguns, a few heavies. But I haven't seen a two-shot explosive as a drop yet. And across all my alts I'm cumulatively over lvl 200 by now.
---
Happy to swap you my low level automatic and armour if you fancy a challenge again 😂
---
That's LITERALLY what it's for. It's called pacifist mode for a reason. When you have it on and you try and shoot somebody, it says "you have pacifist mode on. Therefore you did no damage."
---
It hasn't? I was sure I read that it was fixed in one of the patch notes.
---
I have max enforcer and it doesn’t seem to work very well.
---
Are there plans for every mod? Since mods get destroyed when another is attached, I'd much rather get the plans. I seem to only find plans for Motion Assisted Servos for most models, Hydraulic Bracers (don't care for them so I didn't pay attention how many different models I saw), and specifically for Ultracite Explosive Vents.
---
Just don't read the comments to it they are always depressing.
---
Sure, but this isn't that kind of hard boss. There's no particular skill involved in killing cancer bats - their autotargeting stream of huge projectiles prevent you from timed dodging, so you're just meant to be more of a bullet sponge than they are. Even in level 25 excavator, that's not very difficult; once you're in level 50 X01, it's boring as fuck. About the only "skill" involved is learning that there are certain areas they like to land and leading them there, or hanging out around fissure prime and melting them when they're vulnerable while crawling out of the cracks.
---
While they’re at it, they should reintroduce the ability to rename all armor and weapons too.
---
Yeah I only have the one lol
---
Here's a cheesecloth for them tears so you can extract the salt from them to add to your post. Wah wah, scorchbeasts, wah wah, they don't die in one hit, wah wah, they don't give anything good(besides great temp stat boost foods, thoopid). Wah wah, make scorchbeasts oneshottable and drop 10* 5shot nukaexplosive weapons. 
---
Yea I paid $1500 for a great display, not gonna risk ruining it for a mediocre game. Sorry. Other developers have the competence to have their HUD fade by default or include options to tune HUD elements or add fading. Oh and by the way, the last game they made, Fallout 4, had HUD fading and color options. We’re in the 4K age and the best displays on the market right now are OLED tv’s and other developers have adapted with the times.
---
What platform, I am sure people will take them from you, don't throw it out .. I am on XB1, I will take some if you throwing them out
---
People complaining never played Pubg.
---
In the nuka world DLC, the fake aliens are refered to in universe as Zetans. This is thee name of the actual aliens from mothership zeta. Paranoia intensifies. 
---
The issue of unstable servers and more space are two different ones entirely. Bethesda needs to recognize that defending a camp requires resources ie turrets and they also need to allocate more $$$ to more or better servers. A basic house with a bed, a banjo and some workbenches with power take up quite alot of budget.
---
Also considering they determine how much cash goes into the serverfor upgrades means they underestimated the load the client has on their servers and need to adjust.  
---
A few more words. 
---
I'll never have enough ammo to use it properly.
---
30 bucks is a trivial amount of money imo.  I'd have paid the full price knowing it would go down.
---
I've watched so many play those pathetic low HP builds, yeah they one shot everything but they get downed a lot, with a gun not so much. There is no trade off really with the explosive weapons, besides hitting yourself, which really is not enough. Also melee can only kill 1 enemy at a time, an explosive weapon can kill many in just one shot.
---
No not at all. If you reread my comment, I mention using the hunting rifle to level up because more mods are open up early on. Lever action is definitely preferable once you can mod it out. 
---
It is LITERALLY to stop you from starting a PvP engagement. It is LITERALLY not there to stop other people smacking you about.
---
It is, completely ruins the game for themselves and everyone else .. .should be removed
---
Okay cool thank you for the info! I appreciate it! Seeing how I already have a strength of 13 that explains why I don’t gain any additional carry weight. 
---
There is a lot of violet in the queen area, I usually get around 140-150 per trip
---
When I was farming pieces, I did a quick loop in Watoga.
---
1. Start in East Watoga at the BoS vendor.
---
2. Go directly West to the downed vertibird in the square. One chassis spawns here.
---
3. Continue West to Watoga Emergency Services. Head up the elevator. Two floors up from the elevator, you can choose to fight through a random pod of enemies. There is usually a 3-star legendary here. You can also just run around the enemies to get to the stairs to the roof. There is a chassis on the roof.
---
4. Directly North, you can see an intact vertibird on that roof. If you have speed demon or marsupial, you can drop down to the billboards and jump across. Otherwise, the convention center building West of the vertibird has exterior steps and a walkway to get to the vertibird. There is a chassis just in front of the vertibird.
---
These chassis seem to be pretty evenly split in percentage chance between Lvl 50 T-60 and T-51 pieces. Very rarely, you can find Lvl 45 T-45 pieces. You can just keep relogging and doing the loop until you have what you want. Obviously, this is easier after doing the Mayor for a Day quest.
---
Would love if they can add more subterranean dungeons and caves
---
It's still incredibly ammo-inefficient. I have a lower level (35?) .50 Cal, and it feels so much better. Minigun just eats ammo. At this point I'm looking for explosive Harpoon Gun, with flechette mod it's infinite ammo. 
---
No ultrcite ammo unfortunately or neon sign plans. I'm looking for them myself 
---
It needs to be though. That would make the game more enjoyable.
---
I think I'm probably ok sleeping in a bed. They operate the modern world
---
Prime, just look under all the trees, also those plants that spew things out give you violet. 
---
Maybe we should rename them flying garbage cans
---
In day to day life that sounds rather impolite. 
---
Wow. Thanks so much! I'll try this out today.
---
The protective/shielded underarmor as well as ultra ammo
---
Yea shotguns and teslas are a different beast when it comes to 2 shot. I don't have any numbers on either, but used to own a 2 shot tesla which I sold because the listed damage was barely more than a regular tesla. Maybe the AoE effect has an extra arc? No idea. Not experienced enough with these weapons
---
This is amazing!!!
---
Thank you!
---
I was speaking about the camp size having an effect on the server load.
---
You can make a fairly large building with the current camp budget. I stopped bothering with turrets and just deal with the small number of attackers myself.
---
I'm not defending their shitty servers, I just don't think this is a top priority for them at the moment. 
---
I know I modded my furious combat rifle (had to put a suppressor and new reciever on it) - he might mean the level its at I.E. upgrading a 20 level to 50
---
t h r o w b a c k
---
Why does it need to be? So that *you* can enjoy it? Well sorry bucko but that's not how it was designed, pitched, sold or intended to be. Why did you buy something that was clearly advertised when it obviously doesn't appeal to you? Would you buy a green car and then demand the dealership paint it red for you just because you prefer that colour?
---
Seems like this just happened to me. The turrets were all fine last night, and when I logged in today they were all broken. I hit "e" to repair, and it looked fixed, but then quickly switched back to broken, and no gears were used. I'm baffled. 
---
Yep. Sonic boom hits you through cover. Green shit hits you through WALLS AND ROOFS. 
---
There's no tactics, no grand strategy. I do not understand the process that got us here.
---
This is a top notch suggestion!! Could not upvote enough. Would spare alot of hassle to utilize something like this
---
My favorite with the gnomes so far is the hunting and riding of the flamingos.
---
bought excavator mods in watoga. Bought excavator motion assisted servo plans in grafton from responder bot, not the train vendor.
---
What ever the random mechanic is for x-01 mods it's screwy as I regularly see jetpack mods, five in the last three days. I bought three. In a month I've only seen 2x xo1 calibrated shocks and never any tesla.
---
To balance it out I almost only ever get armour off of legendaries. If its a weapon its usually a 1 star exterminator. Best drop explosive assassins dragon. Killed myself too many times with it though 😂
---
Yup. I am at a point where I can easily take them down on most of my chats, but if one attacks me and I can't dodge out of harm's way, I just server hop. Like, I can burn one down, in the air, in 10 seconds. But the damage my armor is going to take from their explosive attacks, and the amount of ammo that will take, weighed against what they drop, makes it not worth it. I'd rather sit through a loading screen.
---
These guys need to drop guaranteed legendaries. Multiple ones. Just to be worth the effort and aggravation. Should be an automatic 3-star legendary in The Mire. If I have to deal with shooting those fuckers down when I can't even see them through the tree canopies, they should pay better.
---
Prices for miniguns will skyrocket :0
---
Thanks for the reply! I'll give this a shot next time I log in. 
---
They're talking about the heavy mod, not the weapon qualities.
---
Most common places that give tons of steel are what most of the super mutants/mole miners hold. 
---
Ex-Assault rifle,super sludge hammer,mini-gun,shotgun.pipe rifle,automatic pipe rifle,hunting rifle
---
MAKE SURE TO ADD THE SCRAPPER PERK CARD as it allows you to get more materials from each weapon you break down.
---
Two most common places I go to farm just steel is the west tek research center and the event of the uranium fever
---
There's also another area but its in the far NORTHWEST of the most and there'll be tons of super mutants you can kill and loot from they're weapons in which  you can farm for steel
---
Then don't fight them 🤷‍♂️ no one's holding a gun to your head and saying fight scorchbeasts 
---
Thanks all! Helped get all that clear in my mind 👌🏼 
---
Calm before the storm, next hair style hill be a 2000 atom mullet lol
---
Still broken in the new year (Jan 8th).
---
Well... Rosalyn is, Rose was never alive
---
This is very good news i hope the some of the ones over 1,000 atoms drop down as well. Been eyeing a few items but just can't bring myself to pay so much lol.
---
Common issue for me is server disconnect right now. I cant go an hour or 2 without a disconnect.
---
I think it'd go over better if he told her he sold it to a vendor imo lol
---
For sure. Anything where the devs took time to make a little scene somewhere, and I’m telling you if you take pictures you’ll smile when you see the loading screens. 
---
&gt;Why does everything that is tough or hard have to be rewarding?
---
Because it's a game and I'm not here to be randomly annoyed? I can turn on the TV when I want that.
---
So rad x and radaway can be made with local flora. I would also concentrate on making recipies and healing items based on using locally medicinal plants. Radshield is also a great option. 
---
2 is pretty much what will happen if we are to assume this game is going to progress like every other MMO.  We're currently in patch X.0 so we're pretty much in the intro of the current phase/patch of content.  Soon we'll be getting patch X.1 then X.2 then X.3.  If we continue the assumptions of progression based on other MMOs like WoW, Tera, Rift, etc.. we can also assume that each .1, .2, .3, etc... patch will bring in a new tier of content which comes with a power spike in the form of higher item level equipment.
---
TLDR; treat this as an MMO like any other and we'll be getting new tiers of power/higher item levels with content patches down the line like WoW, Tera, Rift, etc...all assuming this is the path Bethesda wants to take with the game.
---
This is my guess at least.
---
now I need a chome painjob for PA to go with it
---
what about .50 cal? no love?
---
Current year argument... Classic.
---
An announcement for an announcement? How deliciously redundant!
---
In what way? Is it impolite that barely anyone says 'Give my compliments to the chef'? Is it more polite that people mumble 'Thanks' without even looking as they get off a bus?
---
Oh yea you reminded me of something I forgot to mention. They definitely need to change the way respawning after pvp works. You need to be forced to respawn at your camp or vault once killed in pvp. My main concern with pvp and no pvp servers is I feel like the pvp servers will devolve into “raider” servers. Where everyone just kills each other on sight which is just the opposite problem we have now. 
---
new games that receive negative reviews will tank due to people reading them and not willing to put 60 bucks in a game so controversial.
---
That attitude isn't how you get things fixed or improved. OP's is.
---
Dude, good luck on the interview!
---
It does appeal to me, I do enjoy it, I'm simply venting on something that got me heated. It doesn't make me hate the game.
---
Well, that's interesting.
---
